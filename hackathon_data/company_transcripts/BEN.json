My name is Brenda, and I will be your call operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin.","Greg Johnson","Well, good morning, and thank you for joining Ken Lewis, our CFO, and me to discuss the company's fourth quarter and fiscal year results.","Importantly, flows continue to trend in the right direction, as we've seen redemptions slow and sales begin to rebound over the course of the year, led by our international retail business. Fiscal year financial results remain strong, as we prudently managed expenses while also investing in what we hope will be new areas of growth.","And on the capital management front, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the year.","Now we welcome any questions you might have on our results.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Ken Worthington","In the prepared remarks, it was mentioned that the insurance redemptions were the lowest in the decade. Just first, is that comment about gross or net redemptions? And the insurance win, can you share with us sort of what product won for you or what asset class? Just a little more color there. And then lastly, do you think this is sort of an indication or other indications that the insurance channel has really turned the corner here?","Greg Johnson","Yes. I mean, I think, as we said before, there is a lot of movement within that channel and the lumpiness of those redemptions that you still have some coming. Some have been delayed, in particular, and some have been withdrawn. But it just happened to be, for that quarter, we didn't see any. I think, next quarter, there's still a chance of some lumpiness coming through. But hopefully, our goal is to try to capture some of that by introducing things like low-volatility equity products that are geared towards what they may be looking for. I think that's what we're trying to do in saving that. I think, today, we have approximately $40 billion of assets that you'd put in that category, of that traditional VA business. And I don't know what percent is still at risk, but probably half of that would be still put in that category. Again, that's a...","Ken Worthington","And the wind this quarter was, I guess, a little VA product or something like that?","Greg Johnson","Right. Yes.","Operator","Our next questions come from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier","Greg, just on the flow trends, an improvement we're seeing. You mentioned in the commentary, obviously, the international retail has been driving it, and then you've seen some pickup on the institutional, on the non-U. S. institutional side of the market. So both of those are good. In the U.S., when you look at the institutional part of the business, what's the biggest challenge? Is it performance? Is it value versus growth? Just -- what could maybe shift that momentum? And then on the retail side, I guess, you're seeing the same pressures that the whole industry is seeing from active-passive. But you guys have been working on some of the alternative product solutions. So how much traction are you starting to gain on some of the distribution platforms that can maybe partially offset some of the industry headwinds?","Greg Johnson","I think the U.S. institutional, if you look at historically for the organization, the majority of the assets and, really, the business was built around Templeton and global equities. You don't have that. I think it's more of an open playing field as we get outside of the U.S. So you just haven't had the base of assets, the consultant relations on the other side of the business. So for us, that -- with value and its longest underperformance stretch probably in history and a lot with that moving to indexing on the -- for that portion within international equities. That area of the business has been under obvious pressure. We've continued to build -- I think the opportunity is still in the fixed income area for us. That's where we're getting significant wins outside of the U.S., and we hope to build that in the U.S. And we've recently made some hires in the U.S. institutional side to build on that opportunity that we see is there. So I think it's really getting the message out, building the right teams in place to support other mandates rather than, I think, we were a very focused organization on the Templeton side and need to broaden that out to other areas in the U.S. And your second part of the question was on just retail. Is that right? Or...","Michael Carrier","Yes. It was just -- you've seen the strength on retail outside of the U.S. Same concept, meaning inside the U.S. You guys have been working on some of the newer type of product offerings, whether it's ETFs, alternatives, K2. Just how much traction are you starting to see on the platforms to maybe offset some of the traditional pressure that we're seeing in the industry?","Greg Johnson","Yes, I mean, they're certainly growing and having a positive effect. And as we said before, it just takes time. And the solutions side is one that we're continuing to build. And obviously, the multi-assets and doing more in that area will be important for us, not only in the U.S., but in Europe. But I think the K2 side is contributing. I mean, it's somewhat tough then a hedge fund to fund in a risk-on environment where the markets are running to get a lot of traction. But we're still seeing a lot of interest and positive flows. And I think if you get a little more volatility in the market, those kind of alternatives are going to look very attractive. And the ETFs, we know, takes time, and we're building that, putting the resources behind it, and we're pleased with the progress as far as getting on as many platforms as possible. And then it's really how its performance doing. If you're -- especially, if they're in a smart beta fund, you've got to validate that factor-based performance, and then we think we're on our way there as well.","Operator","Our next questions come from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.","Patrick Davitt","Last quarter, you mentioned an ongoing fee rationalization process at the fund board level getting started. Could you update us on any conclusions from that and, to the extent any changes were made, what they were?","Greg Johnson","It's still really I mean, I think, ongoing. It wasn't really at a fund board level. It was really just management looking and positioning. And I think we made some adjustments to some funds. As I said, I think, in the prior call, we didn't identify anything that we'd call out as far as significant assets to reduce fees. But there was some areas and things like limited duration and shorter-term funds that we thought were not as competitively priced, not big assets, so not -- wouldn't affect our revenue number much. But it's just really -- we're continuing to do that. It's looking at every class. We don't want to be in the fourth quartile. We think we're fairly well positioned. There's a couple of areas we're still looking at, but really nothing to call out at this stage as to say that we recognize the importance of being competitive. And fee rankings can be as important as total return in this kind of environment. So we need to be realistic about that.","KenLewis","I think the comments in the past on the border initiative was more related to products and just looking at our product offerings versus fees.","Patrick Davitt","Okay. That's helpful. And could you size the fixed index annuity win?","Greg Johnson","Size the fixed index annuity?","Patrick Davitt","The win that you called out in the...","Greg Johnson","Yes, we'll get back to you on that one because I don't have that in front of me.","Operator","The next questions come from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler","I assume there'll probably be some additional detail in the K, but I wanted to get an update for your current estimate of excess capital outside of the U.S., really that you'd repatriate back in the U.S. if we get a tax holiday here.","Ken Lewis","Sure, Craig. So outside the U.S., I think we're looking at around $6 billion or so of cash, maybe a little bit higher. And what we've identified is kind of -- and this will be refined in the K, you're correct. But what we identified -- my current estimate is around $2 billion of that is set aside for regulatory, perhaps, [seed]capital needs are just other business needs.","Craig Siegenthaler","So Ken, just to be clear, you said $6 billion is excess, but you need $2 billion for regulatory. So is it $4 billion net?","Ken Lewis","Correct. Outside the U.S.","Craig Siegenthaler","Outside the U.S. So $4 billion net outside the U.S. And let's just say tax reform is unsuccessful, I know you see you have some cash and some higher tax domicile regions like Luxembourg and Singapore, but then you also have some lower tax domicile regions like the Bahamas. Would you ever explore trying to repatriate some of that higher tax domicile cash back to the U.S. if the outlook for tax reform is pretty bad at some point?","Ken Lewis","Craig, could you just repeat the question? There was some noise in here.","Craig Siegenthaler","Sure. If there is no tax reform, and if you guys reach the conclusion that there will be no tax reform in the future, would you target some of your excess cash in the higher tax domicile regions like Luxembourg or Singapore in the event that you think there's going to be no tax reform? And [indiscernible] out in the future?","Ken Lewis","Right. I would say the answer to that is yes, and it's something that we are constantly evaluating. And so to the extent where -- those economics make sense, we've done it in the past, where we've repatriated earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, and we would do that in the future.","Greg Johnson","I'll just follow up on the other question, just to clarify, on the cash. I think, if you were to say what's liquid today that you could bring, probably $4 billion is the right answer. If you could say, how much will we probably bring back, it would be -- or free up would be about over $6 billion because a lot of that is in investments and things that we can liquidate and things like in our short-term income funds. So the number would be more like $6 billion of what we...","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Just curious for a quick update on both Franklin income and Global Bond. In general, performance has been a lot better. A subtopic on that is if you could give a little color of the $850 million in expected redemption for Global Bond from some key distributor, is that a consolidation thing? Just curious for any color you can help us with there.","Greg Johnson","Yes, I think that's just within a large kind of solutions provider where they're going a little more low risk-off as far as looking at the portfolio. I think the flows and trends continue to look very strong. And I would still argue, as I've said in the past, if you have any meaningful rise in rates, this fund will do very well with its flat to no duration risk. So I think it's one of the few out there that -- in the fixed income category that will do very well in a rising rate environment. The income fund, on the other hand, obviously, has duration risk. But really, if you look at the quarter or the outflows and some of the pressure in the last quarter despite some of the better short-term performance, it really relates to the 3-year number, which is still, as of end of the year, was under or just in the third quartile. As of the first few weeks of the year, it was back in the second quartile. And that's a very important number on the Morningstar metrics. So we think the next look, we hope that gets upgraded back to its 4-star level, getting rid of that one bad quarter when we had energy crisis really move the relative number up on the 3 years. So we're still -- that's a very important, obviously, metric for sales for that fund, and hopefully getting it back to 4 stars with the improved 3-year number should bode well moving forward.","Glenn Schorr","Any sort of -- how real-time is that? Let's say the tough quarter rolls off, the upgrade happens, how quickly does the system take hold of things like that?","Greg Johnson","It just depends. I mean, but it -- I think the other pressure you still have is just around the move from brokerage to fee-based and how that has, as I said in past calls, an effect on heightened redemptions that wouldn't be there normally, and it's hard to separate out. But I think, from a sales side, we are now -- we've just gotten approved on 2 major new platforms with the income fund, and I think that's going to help a lot as we move towards fee-based and these are in the fee-based platforms on 2 big distributors.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.","Bill Katz","Just Ken, you mentioned -- you gave some expense guidance to just look out to the new fiscal year. So a [pre-board] range of 3% to 5%. Just sort of wondering if you could frame that out a little bit around a couple of different aspects. First, what kind of revenue backdrop are you assuming? And then secondly, what kind of flexibility do you have on that expense growth if markets were to not meet whatever expectations built into your revenue picture?","Ken Lewis","Sure. Some but not all of that has some revenue estimates. And the way we look at it, we say increased flows, but it's such a guessing game, if you will, to project what flows are going to be in the future, as you know. But certainly, it's aspirational in the sense that the business units have said, \"Okay, if we invest XYZ, we think there's a reasonable chance that we can improve incremental revenue in the short term.\" And then some of the other expenses are more longer-term aspirations. And then regarding your question on flexibility, I think, it's not like we have agreed to do these things and implemented them on day 1. They're going to take time to phase in. We're going to evaluate the situation as we go forward. We cannot spend the additional money. We can pull back the additional money. But as it is today, this is our best guess. That range that I gave you is our best guess of where expenses might be year-over-year next year. But certainly, there's a lot of flexibility if markets take a downturn, and we want to go in a different direction.","Bill Katz","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Greg, just want to come back to the discussion of maybe Franklin's position in sort of U.S. When I look at your gross sales dynamics, those seem to be relatively soft. I think you explained some of that away with potentially some of the weather issues in the U.S. in the quarter, which was very helpful. But is there a more profound issue here for Franklin, just having been a strong beneficiary of the growth in mutual funds and brokerage assets, and that sort of migrates to more customized advisory fee-based type of outcomes? Do you need to do something more structural? Or you're simply just waiting for the performance to turn and then gearing that through the distribution channel?","Greg Johnson","I mean, I think we have been doing something structural, are in the middle of doing things that, I think, we all recognize sitting and waiting for the old brokerage model as going to be failed effort. So we are very much in part of what -- a big part of what Ken was talking about on the contingency and some of the spending is really geared towards, continuing to upgrade the distribution model to meet the gatekeeper and institutional quality and institutional quality across all of our groups. But really, the pressure in the U.S. are core strengths. And at the end of the day, most of our assets are value. And if you look at the Mutual Series, Templeton, you had a good start to the year, but a very tough finish to the year. The things have led the market 1\/3 of the S&P's returns. That just makes it very difficult for you real core value person to get any kind of play in this market. So I think that's a big effect. But it's also, I think, part of it is you have to adjust the product line and make sure that you have mandates and styles and sleeves that are cost-competitive that can fit into solutions. You have solutions that differentiate, whether it's target date funds or multi-asset funds, that we can build. And part of that is having now ETFs that we can use in the lower cost way as part of that solution and have open architecture solutions that we've done around the globe with other partners. Those are the, I think, things that we're continuing to try to adapt to, but we're certainly not sitting around waiting to get back to the old brokerage model because, I think, at the end of the day, we recognize that the fee-based side is going to continue to be the driver going forward.","Bill Katz","Okay. Just trying to tie into that, just how do you think about maybe turbocharging that shift? Many of your peers talk about the importance of scale diversification, customization, active-passive, et cetera. And you have some, but not all of those attributes. How do you think about repatriation opportunity? You mentioned $6 billion, which is certainly, I imagine, many of your peers potentially using that for maybe acquisitions or other type of growth versus capital return to investors?","Greg Johnson","Well, I think, as we've said before, I don't think the repatriation has impacted that part of our -- we've added a lot of small type funds that improve our -- or management companies that give us more flexibility around solutions like the risk premium 1, commodities firm, all kinds of different styles looking at ESG like many today, whether you buy or continue to build that. So that's very much part of what we have done and will continue to do and differentiating the solutions side by having. I think that's the real advantage of a large global scale player, that you can have a lot of those pieces together, to really build the solutions capability, including the risk side that we have a very robust risk group as well. That's where -- if you looked at our plan and priorities, that's really what it's all built around. It's pulling all of that together and having a world-class solutions group. That really would be the top goal. And if we see any weaknesses in that, that's certainly something we'll continue to go out and look at and purchase in the market. But we have always -- whether it's offshore, onshore, the balance sheet keeps us -- I think, has allowed us that option, and we'll continue to do that.","Ken Lewis","I think the tax reform or the tax changes that are being proposed a little different than it was last time during the repatriation where it's kind of a one and done deal. From what I understand of where the tax direction is going, it kind of levels the playing field, from our perspective, in terms of where the cash is. So in the future, it wouldn't matter and it shouldn't really impact our M&A decisions.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Bren Mc Hawken with UBS.","Bren Mc Hawken","I got a follow-up, slightly different direction from Craig's question earlier. We just had the House, I think, pass the budget. So move to step closer here to tax reform. If we get repatriation, and you're allowed to repatriate, can you update us on how you would weigh buybacks versus special dividends versus M&A?","Ken Lewis","Yes, I think we weigh that question all the time. I guess, and I've been asked this question before, and I can point to, I guess, more than 10 years ago when we did this in the past. And that's kind of the only guide that we have because it's going to be a separate discussion at the board level. And we would have to weigh what the M&A landscape is at that time. Is there something really interesting that is going on at that time? Share buybacks are always interesting to us. So I don't know that it actually changes our direction from what we've done in the past.","Greg Johnson","And I would say, obviously, we just had a board meeting this week, and that was a topic of discussion with the board. And we recognized that once -- if repatriation does go through, that the investors are going expect that answer help how much do you really need of free cash on the balance sheet. And that's really what we're looking at today. It's coming up with a plan to go back to the board and say, \"All right, if we bring free up $6 billion more, how much do we need on the balance sheet? How much do we need for buybacks? How much do we need for M&A? And whether or not that means a special dividend?\" All of that would be certainly on the table for discussion. So I'd say we're putting that together right now, and too early to indicate before the board ultimately is going to make that call.","Bren Mc Hawken","Sure, sure. And then one follow-up on the institutional, U.S. institutional business. It seemed from your commentary that, that business remains difficult, yet I think you also said that insurance are the lowest redemptions in a decade. So does that mean that there were certain other parts of the domestic institutional business that deteriorated? And if so, what were those parts?","Greg Johnson","Yes. I mean, I said before, the continued pressure has been international value as a dominant part of our institutional business in the U.S. And that's been under pressure. Value has lagged to growth. And if you don't have technology exposure in the portfolio, it's been pretty tough to retain assets in that deep value approach. We have seen redemptions. You've also seen pressure, as we all know, for anybody that looks at the foundation endowment or any institutional plan that you see more and more go towards indexing and passive. And that's been ongoing pressure as well. You just haven't seen the new kind of opportunities in the U.S. of monies moving into active international in the value space. And that's our dominant portion of assets. So that's really why that segment has been under the most pressure in the U.S.","Operator","And our next questions coming from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Greg, if you can comment a little bit, and I appreciate the color on the distribution in the U.S. But a little bit on the tempo of what your sales force is saying about what advisors are thinking on DOL. Looks like things got a little bit better after the, certainty, late last year and earlier this year. But we did see active flows for industry starting to -- active outflows from the industry starting to pick up again. Do you anticipate that will be a little bit bigger of a headwind in the coming 1 or 2 quarters than it has been? And also, if you can size what you think the impact from the hurricanes were on your sales in the third quarter.","Greg Johnson","First of all, I mean, the hurricane impact, I think it had an impact because we saw a, clearly, in Florida and Texas, that they were off like over 30% in that month, in September. So it did have an impact. I think the -- our view on DOL is that -- or our hope is that the SEC comes out with a standard that addresses this without destroying the brokerage business. I think that's where it's going today, is that you'll have a way that without a best interest contract without a process other than going to court to settle disputes. I think those are private right of action, get rid of that. And you have something that, I think, will serve the industry well. I think there's just -- there's no reason why brokerage shouldn't continue to exist. It's appropriate for certain people, and I think it's inappropriate to move certain people. So I think the regulator understands that. So will that slow down the move towards fee-based? Maybe, a little bit. But at the end of the day, I still think that, that's where you need to think about -- you got a make sure your firm's properly positioned in that space. And as far as active and redemptions and how much of it relates, it's just very hard. I think what we do know is that as you transition from a brokerage to a fee-based account, it's -- you may have 1 out of 3 of your products on that lineup instead of all of them, and that's a general statement. But one that it makes it difficult to capture the assets that you had. So anybody with multiple products, with one relationship, is going to be under pressure as those assets transition. But I do think the pressure of the transition could be alleviated somewhat if we have a standard that allows those 2 to coexist.","Brian Bedell","And do you think the advisers are kind of waiting for that to happen? In other words, are they really kind of not doing much until they get more clarity on that? Or do you think they are heading one way or the other?","Greg Johnson","Well, I think some are, and some aren't. There's pressure to move. I think the management, many have embraced the rule and fiduciary standard and are putting pressure to do that. But clearly, some are not comfortable moving to that, and we'll wait. But it's hard for me to answer that exactly in any way, it's definitive.","Brian Bedell","Yes, understood. And then, Ken, just on the spending for next year. I appreciate the color on that. You mentioned a bunch of initiatives. One of them in the prepared remarks were initiatives to enhance investment performance. Maybe if you could just elaborate on that a little bit. And then is -- are you still potentially -- or would you potentially look at outsourcing the back-office custody and funds accounting? I know you guys always review that. This would be typically the time when you would do that. Is that something that's on the table for this coming fiscal year?","Ken Lewis","Sure. I'll answer those questions. On the investment performance, it's really where can we distinguish our investment performance, find new ideas. So it's really investing, I guess, one category would be investing in fintech, but also just investing in systems that give our portfolio managers the edge and get -- finding unique information to distinguish their investment performance. So it's kind of the broad category there. Nothing more specific than that. And in terms of the fund accounting, I would say that we have looked at that. And in the current frame of mind, it's not to do that outsourcing anytime in the near future. And in fact, invest in systems there as well to take advantage -- to be more scalable and be able to be more flexible and customize some of the unique product demands that are coming down the pipe.","Greg Johnson","And I would just add things like, I mean, we are investing in data. We've been doing that. We think that, again, for a global-scale player, is going to be important part of active management going forward for building better factory-based ETFs. And that's an important initiative that does require additional resources as we continue to build that out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Dan Fannon","I guess, could you talk a bit about the fee rates and kind of based on the mix of business, that you're seeing today, and kind of trajectory we can think about that going into next year on that kind of ins and outs of non-U. S. versus U.S?","Ken Lewis","Well, I mean, that does play into a factor, the fee rate itself not, necessarily operating income, but the mix between international and U.S. I mean, from where we stand today, we don't really see a significant change in the fee rate. It's hard to predict mix 12 years out. But from where we stand today, we're not seeing any significant change in the effective fee rate for next year. It's like downtick.","Greg Johnson","And I think, as I've said before, I mean, one, it's hard for everybody to be the in bottom 2 quartile. That's challenging. And if somebody believes passive outperforms active, you can cut your fees in half and only lose your margin. You're not going to get any incremental. So I think that's the key is we have to switch that around, rising rate environment and volatility tends to mean that the active will do better. And I think that's probably where I would argue where we're heading.","Dan Fannon","Got it. And Greg, you mentioned in the comments earlier that about some of the placements of some of the funds on key distribution list and platforms. Can you talk a bit about that? Was there more this quarter? I think the reference in the previous quarter or the earlier was for the year. So just curious as to where the momentum might be if we're already seeing that potentially in the fourth quarter numbers or is that more for next year?","Greg Johnson","Yes, I think it's more for next year. I think the crazy thing about how this transition works with brokerage and fee-based and sometimes, you have to almost get funds reapproved on the platform, funds that have significant assets already in the system and have to go through all the validation of why that's beyond the new platform. And we've been able to do that with 2 of our largest distributors where they haven't been on that in the past. So I hope that means improved flows but it would be in the coming year, not -- and probably not right away.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein, Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","A couple of topics I was hoping to delve into. I guess, first on the global international equity part of the business. Obviously, flows there remain kind of challenge for you guys. This has been an area of strength for the industry broadly in many of your peers the reported so far. Is it just the performance issue? Or is there something in the distribution landscape broadly that you need to address, I guess, more aggressively to start winning more of a fair share of flows on the global international equity side?","Greg Johnson","No, I think it's just the style with the deep value style of Templeton and not having really -- any real technology exposure in this kind of market. You're going to be challenged to match up against anybody who does. And I think that's been the bigger issue for our traditional global equity group.","Alex Blostein","Got you. And then the second question, just around your ETF efforts. Obviously, the competition in the smart beta space is heating up, scale becoming more critical. We've obviously seen Invesco make a couple of acquisitions recently. And pricing becomes more and more a factor. So just taking all of that together, can you just spend a minute on LibertyQ strategy? And does it make sense to add to it inorganically just to kind of create more scale and critical mass in that business?","Greg Johnson","Yes, I think it does. I think it's just -- you have to -- if the -- and we continue to look at every opportunity that's out there. But that would certainly jump-start the effort. And we have filed for passive ETFs, which we believe will give us quick scale in that marketplace and improve all visibility for the rest of Liberty. And that's very much part of our strategy is to be cost-competitive within the passive sector where existing assets are there. So I think that's as important to become one of the top players in terms of size. That's certainly a goal. And one that, back to Ken's point on resources and incremental cost in specialists around the globe supporting that effort. But it -- we still are firm believers on the smart beta concept, and we just rolled out the first multifactor-based emerging markets fund in Europe. And it's been a very aggressive schedule for us between Canada, Europe and the U.S. in getting these funds out and we'll continue to be so as we get ready to roll out the 20 passive ones.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.","Patrick Davitt","You mentioned some onetimers in the expense line. I imagine this is in the 10-Q, but I haven't had a chance to look. Could you be more specific on how big those were and what they were?","Ken Lewis","I think, there's quite a number of them. So I think maybe the best thing to point out is when we look ahead, like, to next quarter, I mean, I think we mentioned this in the notes that normally, there is seasonality where some of the lines like the tech line and the G&A line are a little bit higher in the fourth quarter and then a little bit lower in the first quarter of the following year. In G&A, we have advertising that's typically a seasonal spend that goes down. So if I look at G&A, what's a reasonable run rate, given market levels because some of the expense line and [indiscernible] in there are driven by market values. But given the current market levels, I would say that the run rate's more towards where it was in the last 2 quarters prior to the -- I'm sorry, in the June quarter and the March quarter versus the September quarter.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","ChrisHarris","Can you guys give us an update on K2? What are the trends you're seeing there? And how much AUM is that part of your business?","Greg Johnson","Yes, I think I mentioned earlier on the call that it continues to be positive flows and interest. I think it -- hedge strategy in a risk-on environment, it's hard to keep up with what everything else is doing. And we feel like it's an important part to balance the portfolio, and many people are using it for that. And today, probably, over -- I think, in the retail funds, over $2 billion, $2.2 billion and in total assets, $15 billion or $10 billion. Is it $10 billion? Yes, that's right. Right around $10 billion for total assets there.","Operator","Okay. We've reached the end of our question and answer session. Are there any closing comments you'd like to make?","Greg Johnson","Well, I'll make one, just I think I'm looking at my notes and just want to make sure that I mentioned. We talked -- there was a lot of questions around global equity and value and not having the growth side, and I'd be remiss not to mention that we do have actually a very strong global growth group. And when somebody is talking about distribution opportunities in the institutional side of the U.S., I'd certainly put that one there because this team's done an excellent job, a New York-based global growth group, in building very strong long-term records. And it's a matter for us to get that awareness out there. And also, even within Templeton, the emerging markets, which does have some technology exposure, has done very well over the last 1- and 3-year period. So I think that's another very positive story, along with our Asian Growth fund that under the Templeton even in this market, has had excellent performance in the short run. So with that advertisement, I will close off and say thank you, everybody, for participating and we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

Mr. Johnson, you may begin.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, hello, and thank you for joining Ken and me this morning to discuss our second quarter results. I know it's been a busy week for most of you, so hopefully, the commentary we provided earlier this morning easily address most of your questions.","This quarter we saw a number of encouraging signs with retail flow trends improving in some regions and funds returning to net inflows. While we clearly have more progress to make, investment performance is strengthening, which is a positive sign for future flow trends. Importantly, the financial condition of our firm remains strong and we continue to position ourselves to meet the evolving needs of our clients.","I'd now like to open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I guess in the commentary, Greg, you're generally positive institutionally in talking about sales in the U.S. hitting levels we haven't seen since 2015. And I guess just where \u2013 I want to talk about that more broadly in terms of kind of where you still see the headwinds, whether that's on the international front? And I guess, specifically, what products institutionally in the U.S. are you seeing the most demand?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I think, first of all, I mean it was really retail sales where we saw the big improvement in \u2013 certainly in gross and even on the international side, probably had net inflows, if you take out some of the lumpier institutional redemptions. I think just overall, from just looking at the more normalized levels that we're seeing strong improvements in both gross and net on the back of strong performance. And I think just sometimes the institutional redemptions and certainly the headwinds we've talked about, whether it's the variable annuity side, which we had a smaller quarter in terms of net redemptions of about $1 billion. But we had some other lumpy net \u2013 or institutional account redemptions on the global equity side, and that's really where \u2013 I think if you look at the flows where we had four, five large redemptions, none of them \u2013 I think, one a Middle Eastern client that not a performance-related redemption, just really a cash flow need kind of situation. And then, you had redemptions related to a platform moving to sub-advisory that had a couple large funds as well. And then, just a couple of $0.5 billion type global equity redemption.","So, if we look at the big changes over the quarter, Global Bonds, certainly from a retail side, much improved, and really in Europe is where we're seeing the dramatic improvement in redemptions and flows there, and that's an encouraging sign and one that we know, if we continue to get momentum in that, that can turn into significant inflows, and that's what hopefully we expect in the short run. But, overall, I think improvement in just about every area, except the global equities, and most of that was just due to the institutional side.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just, Ken, a follow-up on your commentary around expenses. Appreciate the comp and the kind of the tech guidance. I guess just generally, those are moving, one's coming down, one's going up. I guess, did you think about total expenses for the year? Can you update us on your thoughts on an aggregate level?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I think on an aggregate, if you compare our forecast for this fiscal year to last year, I think we're looking at about a 3% decrease overall in operating expenses, and that would be compensation, tech, op, G&A. It would exclude the sales distribution expense line.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Katz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much and certainly appreciate the streamlined process, it really is helpful on a day like today. Just maybe starting with capital deployment. I see that the repurchase did slow a little bit in the quarter, just sort of curious what drove that? Was that just timing, pricing? And then maybe stepping back a little bit, Greg, you had mentioned that you're a little bit behind the curve on Solutions, a little bit within the institutional channel, at least that was I think in your prepared commentary. Can you maybe dovetail together, whether that'd be a de novo solution or maybe possibly through acquisition?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Let me start with the capital question. This is Ken. So, there were a couple of things, price was a factor during the quarter. Also I think, maybe and probably one of the bigger drivers was buyable volume was down, and it was down 25% to 30% this quarter versus last. So, that had an impact as well.","And then, you wanted...","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I'll just add. On Solutions, it's really \u2013 I think, the integration of our multi-asset solutions into the rest of our equity teams and the reorganization that we just did reflects that and also reflects the importance of Solutions versus Alternatives, where we're breaking them out with two separate business heads. We'll continue to add where we think we can add value. AlphaParity, the recent acquisition last quarter, a small one, but it gives us more tools to customize within our Solutions group. But having someone who's run the Franklin Income Fund and our Hybrid group now heading up the Solutions group, I think really makes it a much more robust platform that's really integrated into the rest of the group. So, that's really what we're \u2013 I think the immediate changes that we're talking about.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And just one follow-up for me, and thanks for taking both questions today. You mentioned that global retail did a bit better this quarter. (07:24) in the U.S., that continues to struggle, at least from some of the Sim fund (07:26) data that we take a look at. I guess the big picture question I have is, you have much better performance, however, you're also seeing a pretty sizeable A, B and C share class, which seems to be out of phase just generally speaking at the industry level. How do you reconcile that? Do you think performance wins at the end of the day or is it more the structure has to change to leverage the performance?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, I think performance wins in the end. There's no question about that. And as we've said before, I mean it's \u2013 when you have a good quarter, a good year, it may slow redemptions a bit, but it takes a while to build back under the shelf space. And we've seen \u2013 I think the number of four and five star funds for us has quadrupled here in the last quarter. So, those are the things that really drive sales and shelf space.","I think, all of us, on the \u2013 whether anybody \u2013 and that's most of the industry that has more brokerage assets, it, as we all know, creates challenges in the transition to more of the advisory model. And you have to look at your lineup and that's what we've been doing and kind of pruning funds and changing some things to adapt to that advisory model. But at the end of the day, if you have performance and you have reasonable fees, you'll get distribution in that model as well. But I think you're right to say that it's a little bit slower, the turnaround, than you'd seen just if it was all traditional brokerage.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. Greg, maybe just another one on, I guess, sales inflow. So, you mentioned the momentum on the retail side in the quarter. When I look at the institutional and the VA, that part of the business, it sounds like you had one client that decided to stick with Franklin. And then, you guys are focused more on the Solutions kind of aspect. So, just wanted to get a sense on like how quickly \u2013 or how much work have you guys been doing, whether it's on the Solutions side, trying to figure out kind of the institutional variable annuity? I think last quarter you mentioned some new products on the variable annuity side to maybe offset some of the redemption pressures that you're seeing?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I think when we look at the VA part of our business, and the assets today are about $44 billion, we'd put somewhere around $11 billion into the inactive side of the portion that \u2013 I'd put that at the higher risk for moving to passive, insurance companies that have gotten out of the VA business and are transitioning those. It was public that with one of those insurance companies that they are holding off on their plans to transition. That was one of the ones that we had indicated to you was probable in terms of redemption, redemption either last quarter or this quarter or over the next few quarters. And that was about $4.5 billion of the $11 billion in assets.","The others we continue to work with, and some of them we have transitioned, as you said, with our Solutions, trying to come up with \u2013 whether it's low volatility products, we have built those. I mean, this isn't something that's new to us, but we continue to work on the active piece of the business and we see a lot of opportunity still. And hopefully, that's a number that instead of looking at a dwindling base, can be a growing base for us. So, it's not \u2013 and I think that's an important distinction. You just had a portion of that VA business that, because of the volatility and what happened with prepaid commissions, a lot of insurance companies got into a difficult situation, are looking for a solution to work through that. And that's really something we've been engaged and have accounts that exist today in those lower volatility funds. And so, hopefully, that's an area that can continue to grow.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, we spent a lot of time over the past year on DOL. Just wanted to shift to MiFID II, and just wanted to get your perspective. I know there's still a lot of kind of puts and takes until implementation and how things are going to kind of settle out. But I just wanted to get your view on how Franklin kind of looks at the regulations, particularly for the European side of the business?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. It's something that we continue to be very engaged on and \u2013 obviously, our Luxembourg-based CCAB is sold in, I think, more countries than any other one. So, we are very active on the lobbying front. And I think, the obvious main concern is around how we handle the unbundling on the research and brokerage side. And we're spending a lot of time doing that and we've been asking that question, well, what does it mean, what kind of dollar number are we looking at. And I think it's probably too early to say, because it depends just how clients react to this disclosure.","For us, it's not just on the face of it, it's only two funds that really get affected directly by the MiFID legislation. And so, it wouldn't be a significant dollar hit to us. But again, when you have that transparency and the questioning, we don't know how far it extends and I wouldn't want to try to extrapolate, because we don't know that would mean. I think you're right in saying, there's still quite a bit of uncertainty on it.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Morningstar downgraded the parent company rating for your funds at the end of March, citing investment lineup and firm leadership. I guess, are there any indications that institutional consultants share these concerns? And are there parts of the Morningstar comments that you think may have even some remote merit, and are you making any changes to address the Morningstar comments?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","I think it's a subjective analysis that probably based on flows with something that they led them to do that. I don't \u2013 there's not much you can do. It's not \u2013 we haven't gotten certainly any feedback from clients that it's a concern in any area. I mean, they have the relationships. They do their due diligence. They know us, they know our funds probably better than that analyst. So, I don't really \u2013 I think a couple of the comments they had were probably relevant that we are looking at. But it's not something that we got any feedback from the distribution side that this was an issue. It's not something that's really that focused on.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And it seems like there has been some movements in leadership and you've done some things around some \u2013 the acquisition of AlphaParity and some other reorgs. Maybe what sort of changes seem \u2013 there seem to be changes being made behind the scenes. Is anything \u2013 maybe you can talk about what's happening behind the scenes in terms of leadership changes?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, we just had the reorg that we announced, and there was some major changes just on, again, aligning people with where the priorities are for the firm and having a new role within Solutions, new role within Alternatives, new role within equities as a whole. The president consolidating many of the functions or reporting lines of the existing co-presidents model. So I mean, I think, that's a big change. And the other big change is, I've taken on the performance analytics; basically, your risk group reports directly to me, separate from the investment teams. And I think that that just speaks to the heightened awareness and importance of risk management for the firm. Having that kind of check built-in and I get that information directly, I think that's a fairly significant change as well.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just quick on the international gross sales. Really a solid improvement, I think which you highlighted in your prepared remarks pointing to flagship products driving the sales momentum. Was there anything specific as far as the products go? And was there any other components that contributed there that are worthy to note beyond just a general improved optimism or a reaction around the performance track record that's turned around?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's really Global Bond is the driver there, a major turnaround, and kind of the proven case that we've been talking about that if rates rise, this is the fund that can position your portfolio very nicely for that, and I think that, that proved itself in this last cycle. You look at the return numbers and first quartile for every time period, I mean, that certainly helps when you're having a fund that was in that redemptions.","There are other areas that had inflows and certainly our Emerging Markets Fund had major inflows and continues to do very well. Our Floating Rate Fund, specifically in Korea, crossed $1 billion very quickly. So, those are new areas of distribution for us. And if we look across the globe, many markets that had been in redemptions have turned to positive. When you look at Hong Kong, Korea, India, Taiwan, Germany, all back in positive. So, I think that that's a very strong and good trend for us going forward.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Terrific. And then, is there any color, it was \u2013 while the gross sales picked up nicely, which is very encouraging. Obviously, stronger in international, but also picked up in the U.S. What is it that can get those redemptions to slow? Are there any particular trends that you're noticing that would give you encouragement that we might not be far away from that beginning to slow down? Is there any additional color you can give on the redemption side? Thanks.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think they are slowing and if you look at the numbers and \u2013 of course, we'd like to see them slow faster, but again, I think it's just a matter of performance sinking in and people recognizing this strong performance across the lineup right now. As we said earlier on the call, I mean, the transition from brokerage to advisory creates a little bit more of the lag effect and \u2013 or just more of a headwind in some of those redemptions in those A Class shares. But I think when we look at the trend right now, and of course, knock on wood, we don't like to lead anything, but certainly better right now what we're seeing and seeing some positive overall days for the firm, which we haven't seen in a while. So, hopefully that continues.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Terrific. Last question for me. Do you guys have any plans as far as maybe an offering in the \u2013 amongst these clean share sleeves that we've heard about, and what's your view on this type of a product and structure?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yes. I mean, I think like everyone, it's something we are looking at and trying to figure out how we would buffer that and how it would affect our distribution channel. So, it is very much something that's certainly on the plate today. And we don't have any plans to announce any offering right now, but it is something that we think is very viable and something that I would put in the probable category at some stage.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","But probably too early to be discussing with distribution partners or anything like that, is that fair?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Right. I think we work together with the distribution partners to figure out what they need and the uncertainty of the rule is still pending. I think it's early to decide what those share classes are going to look, whether you need the T, whether you need a clean share class. All of that, I think, is still very much up in the air based on what happens with the fiduciary rule.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Fair enough. Thanks for the color.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, everybody. A question for you guys around the management fee rates. So, some of your products tend to be, and especially some of the larger ones on the higher end of things, and as I think about the growth in the advisory channel and your guys kind of market share within that part of the market, do you find your fees competitive enough to gain a larger share of the pie there, especially relative to some of the larger peers? And I guess ultimately, would you consider some of the fee reductions to accelerate growth in that channel?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think that's just part, again, of what I've said earlier that with this transition to advisory, we're looking at the entire lineup. And to me, you obviously have to be competitive on the fee side. I think we are. I think the areas where \u2013 I'm not sure what you're referring to where we're higher, because in most cases, we are lower than the average. And I think you have to look at the specific category and who you're competing with. But that's certainly something that if we feel like it's not competitive in the channel, that's something that a short-term hit we would take, if we had to. I don't \u2013 those are discussions we're having, we're looking at all of that, but more of the funds are on the lower end of fees. So, I think it'll continue to be well positioned.","And I think the battle on fees, it's easy to sit there and think, well, I can just reduce and suddenly I'm competitive. But the reality is, when you're competing against passive, you better beat passive or make your value proposition clear, reducing your fees by 20 basis points doesn't change, if that advisor is moving a key amount of their assets to passive, reducing your fees only hurts your margin. And if you beat passive over the long run a 20-basis-point difference doesn't really matter. So, I think that that's the bigger question, is whether you believe active will beat passive, because trying to compete with passive on a fee basis is not the right answer.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. That all make sense. And then secondly, I was hoping you could touch on the institutional channel, understanding a couple of lumpy apples for you guys this quarter, good news on the VA stuff sticking around. But just bigger picture, any comments around the pipeline and the composition of the institutional pipeline for you guys?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I would say that the area that we've been talking about and continue to see more interest based on the last market cycle with rates coming up is just the institutions interested in local asset management currencies \u2013 currency funds with Global Bonds, we're seeing a lot of interest there and those can be larger accounts. We're seeing pretty good interest as well in the emerging market side. We're growing in the UK side as well, with some of the fixed income funds there on excellent performance. So, those would be some of the areas that \u2013 and global ag, we've had a couple of big wins and had a big win last quarter that will fund close to $1 billion this quarter.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much. Greg, if you could just comment a little bit about what you're seeing on the Department of Labor trends in terms of what your sales force is seeing with the advisors and your work with distribution partners. To what extent are advisors moving or you think they'll be moving product, shifting around more before June 9? Or is it more of a play of gee, let's see what happens? And then, just maybe your AUM that has 12b-1 fees, I know some distributors switching out of 12b-1?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think it's still like the future of the rule very much up in the air with how distribution's reacting. I think that it doesn't matter if you have a rule or not. The trend towards the advisory platforms is there and happening. And it's just a question of how quickly it accelerates and that's something that many of the major broker dealers favor. So, to sit back and say, well, I'm not going to react to that because of the uncertainty of the rule, I think it really doesn't matter. That trend is in place.","I think, as we said earlier, around what it means in terms of share classes and the future, I mean, there are things that need to change with that rule. And I start with what are we trying to solve. And hopefully, it's something that the SEC \u2013 it gets pushed back to the SEC at some point to provide a workable rule that affects all distribution. I think if we feel like we need a rule, then that's the right place to have a rule. And this rule was highly political from the start, and things like private right of action I think need to be taken out of the rule, and having a more reasonable and workable best interest contract, I think, are the two things that we think need to change, if we indeed believe we have to have a rule.","So, the future of how asset classes look, how brokerage accounts look, I think is still very much in the air in terms of what we have to price and that will all be probably worked out in the year ahead. But it's also somewhat challenging to get a common voice from the industry on what we need. So that's \u2013 I think that's one of the issues as well that people have different views and different needs on what that rule should indeed look like.","The question around 12b-1, I mean, we have already share classes that exist without a 12b-1. So, that's \u2013 and some would obviously in advisory models use those. So, that's already there today. Isn't actually called (26:37) advisory class.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Are you seeing active substitution into the non-12b-1 shares within your account play (26:44)?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think the more \u2013 more of the advisory platforms, that's something they would use. So, yes. I mean, as that continues I think you'd see that.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And then just on expenses, Ken, the 3% drop in expenses, a couple of questions around that. I guess what are your assumptions on performance fees is I think you said you still expect comp to be down 3% to 4% and it was a little elevated, I assume performance fees helped that this quarter. So, just maybe comment around your view of performance fees for the back half of the fiscal year in conjunction with the op expenses and just the base of that op expenses, is that the $2.042 billion base? I just want to make sure I have the right number there.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Let's start with performance fees. Well, I think, the performance fees this quarter and a little bit last quarter were for similar products a year ago. So, that was like the first time we had performance fees on those. I would not expect those particular performance fees to recur in the second half. But we do have performance fees typically in the second half of the year. What they'll be I'm not sure, but I would just go back and look at what we've had in previous third and fourth quarters and \u2013 because performance is picking up.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And in the expense base, just the 3% drop, the fiscal year, just want to make sure I'm doing it off of the right base of expense. Ex-sales distribution, of course...","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Yeah. Yes. Two point, sorry, last year was about $2 billion, right?","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. I just want to make sure I have all the one-timers that are there. So, is it $2.04 billion or is there...","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. If memory serves, that's correct. Yeah. And you could also \u2013 for kind of the more granular questions and answers here you could also feel free to call our IR department, Brian, should be able to help you out with that.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thank you. Two clarifications. First, one on the whole large insurer not replacing dozens of actively managed funds. Just specific, is it related to the lawsuit and what I'm getting at is, is should we think of this as a temporary stay and these funds could be at risk at some point or there was a decision of this is where we're going to be and we can consider the 4.6 base?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I don't have the answer. I mean I think the reaction is, they're going to stay put for now and assess it, may take a different tack. I mean I'd still think you always put it at the at risk. It's just we don't know today and their decision is to hold off for now on moving that to passive.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then your other point, on the key distributor transitioning from advisory to a sub-advisory program. Is that just them sub-advising out? Has that part (30:14) was most curious because some of the assets were in funds that performance has gotten a lot better. I'm just curious on what's behind the move?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. They don't \u2013 I think they would say that it's not related to performance. It's really just the concentration of assets that they've had in those funds and they built their own sub-advisory platform and moved a lot of assets from a lot of top performing funds into those other funds. So, it was never an issue of performance. It was just a build the fund family and had a fair concentration in a lot of different funds. And this was one way to handle that.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","Got you. So, it's not actually something that we should look for as a trend hopefully.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","No, it better \u2013 no, I don't think so. I think for now I hope it's \u2013 I hope that's it.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","I'm with you. Last one, always tough to get too much out of you on this. But just curious going on $10 billion of cash and equivalents, is there any different sense of urgency on, I'll leave it really open in saying do something with that or are we like we're so close to tax reform now, and now we wait.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","No. I think the \u2013 it's still \u2013 I think the way we would look at tax reform is if we find something before repatriation that we can save 15% on buying offshore, that's still going to be very attractive. So, I think it \u2013 you could argue that it certainly makes it more interesting with the cash in the meantime before you repatriate to look at things offshore, and we continue to do that. I mean it \u2013 like I've said in past ones, every moment we're looking at something.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","All right. Thanks for all that, Greg.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. I missed the response on this one, but how much 12b-1 fee AUM do you have remaining? And do you include load (32:22) in this bucket too?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. We'd have to get that for you. I don't have that here, but it would still be the majority of the assets.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. And then, can you provide some commentary behind if Global Bond and Franklin Income were removed from recommended list and platforms generally last year after their underperformance and if you've seen them getting added back this year and any kind of tangible data points would be helpful too.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","I think that's part of the \u2013 the challenge is that, that when you have a strong rebound and somebody made that decision to take them off, that they're going to be a little hesitant to put it right back on. So, you need a little bit of time. But, again, I look at the sales trends and certainly income fund now as a fund, and last quarter it was actually in positive sales despite Hybrid being somewhat negative. But that's a huge turnaround from where it was. And Global Bond had its lowest redemptions in over 10 quarters. So, behavior is changing despite whether or not you're on a recommended list and that performance does trickle down to the advisor level regardless of whether you are on a focus list or not.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks, Greg.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Just to clarify something you said earlier. I think you said you've had some positive days which hasn't happened in a long time, is that in April or was that already happening in the first quarter?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","It's in April. And, again, we don't like to \u2013 think I'm just mentioning it because I think it certainly feels better for everyone, the company to see that trend and whether or not that continues, I think is always what the market does in the near term. But, that's clearly a positive sign for us, a green shoot.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Sure. And then there's a $1 billion mandate you know of coming in, in global ag?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. It's the $900 million, $900 million.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Yeah. Okay.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Exaggerated slightly.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","All right. And last one's on the repurchase. I think you said something about buyable volume, but your volume was actually up in the first quarter. So, could you give us some more color around the lower repurchase rate?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Right. So, you have to \u2013 when I say buyable volume, I am talking about something called 10b-18 volume, which is the \u2013 our metric and what we can buy.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. Thank you.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","And, again, if you wanted to know more about that, feel free to call IR after the call.","Operator","Thank you.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","That's a little technical issue there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks. Just a follow-up question on potential M&A opportunities. When you guys think about what's out there, and what your needs are internally at Franklin, do you guys feel like you need to do things mainly in line with your core competency, so active management? Or would you be willing to step out from that say, either in passive management or something maybe even adjacent to asset management? Just trying to get an understanding if there's sort of a governing philosophy to how you're thinking about deals here.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I think, it's always \u2013 the philosophy is trying to figure out what the needs are of clients and how we can strengthen our offerings. And, obviously, the big change now and that everybody is talking about is, how you look at data and whether it's kind of the big data analytics, artificial intelligence. There's a lot of new companies, a lot of new interesting things happening there. So, that's certainly an area that we are spending time on, understanding and figuring out how \u2013 whether it's a direct investment, a JV, or building your own, how we can use information today to help our active teams, or build a separate one that could be completely different from our traditional.","So, I think, as any large asset manager, that's certainly an area today with the super computing capabilities and the amount of data real-time, documenting behavior real-time, it's something that every asset manager I think needs to be at least aware and looking at. So, that would be an area.","We don't have, if a large passive manager came up, and I just don't think that's going to happen anytime soon, but it would certainly be something we would look at as well. I don't think we have any hard rules on, philosophically that we have to be this or that. I think, it's hey, if our clients \u2013 we know passive's here to stay. We know that it works very well with active. It works very well with alternatives and other capabilities that we have. And the more we can package all that together through our solutions is something \u2013 that's really our long-term vision is trying to build out all of those capabilities. So I don't think that the philosophy of saying you're an active manager precludes you from doing anything and there's all forms of active using passive through solutions and that's really where we think that the market is going.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great, thanks. And thanks for your patience, taking all the questions. We've talked a lot about different fund share classes and advisory business, but we haven't really talked too much about the SMA business, which is clearly in a lot of your U.S. distribution outlets a sizeable and growing business. So, and maybe some of your strategies like Global Bond and Franklin Income don't translate as well. But can you talk a little bit about your presence in the SMA business, and do you feel that you have the right product suite there? Is that a place you're putting more emphasis on incremental growth? Just trying to get a better feel for your positioning there.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","I mean, it's a business that we have been servicing and building and going after, so nothing's new there. It's still a relatively smaller proportion of our business. And I think with advisory, with the move towards advisory becomes less significant in many ways. I think the challenge is how \u2013 the compression of pricing within those models and how that reconciles with your other funds is always somewhat of a challenge in how you enter that business when you're competing with firms that may not have other retail funds, pricing differently than what they're doing in the SMA world. So it's an area that's going to be still significant and important. But I don't think there's anything new that I'm aware of in that channel that changes our thinking.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","And, I mean, just within your franchise, I mean is that a $20 billion asset business, $30 billion, $10 billion? I'm just trying to get a sense of how meaningful it is a contributor to kind of your sales and flows.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. We'll get back to you on that one because I don't have the exact number.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","It's pretty small though.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","It's pretty small.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And...","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","(40:07) maybe less.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. $10 billion maybe.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Maybe less.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And maybe just as a follow-up. I'm just curious for your perspective, I mean one of your peers or competitors has filed for kind of, I won't call it a new pricing scheme, fulcrum fees has been around. But, clearly, have taken a view that something has to change with mutual fund pricing dynamics. So, just kind of interested in your \u2013 just in general your thoughts around some of those initiatives you've seen a competitor take and if you think there's much merit to it or just kind of your perspective?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I mean I think the more options you have on pricing, the better. I think if you believe that actives can outperform, the client probably will end up paying more for performance fee. But, certainly, something that we have been open to more on the institutional side where we've done some pricing with performance fees with lower expense rate or lower management fees on them. That's something we've been doing. We're looking at it in the retail space as well. And, I think, that clearly with such focus and pressure on fees today, paying out of your alpha probably makes more and more sense. So, that is something that we are open to and looking at. And if clients prefer that, then that's something that we have to adapt our model to. So, I think we are open and we think we will see more of that.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","All right. Great. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just as industry assets continue moving into the fee-based advisory channel, just curious how you think about your vehicle delivery today for active management, certainly you have lot of legacy A, B, C mutual fund share classes out there. Can you just talk about how you're evolving your vehicle delivery, so the mutual fund vehicle itself is not a barrier for investors to buy active management, how you're thinking about going beyond the mutual fund vehicle?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, again, I mean, we look at \u2013 our core competency is the management of those assets, so the vehicle is dictated more by the channels and how technology evolves and how we can weather it, an ETF with \u2013 using an active bucket in that. I mean, those are things like everyone in the industry again we're looking at. And if that is a vehicle that's lower cost and something the clients want, then we're certainly open to doing that. And it's just a matter of working with our clients, our advisors and understanding what they need in their channel and moving towards that. So, I don't \u2013 again, we don't have any preference whether it's an SMA vehicle or an ETF or a 40 Act mutual fund. It's whatever the clients prefer and meets their needs.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And just on the SMA, do you feel like you have enough of the capabilities yourself today or is that something you feel like you need to built out more to be a little bit larger within that sort of vehicle delivery?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, I think we've certainly \u2013 and there's a lot of overlap on \u2013 we've built out our internal consulting group within our sales and marketing teams and a lot of that overlaps with what happens on the SMA side too, and really creating a more institutional process and service model. That's been the big focus for us over the last five years, so that suits the SMA account as well. But as I said before, it's just not a large part of the business today, but one that we certainly are servicing.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to clarify something. We did do just a quick run on Morningstar and we got a little over $300 billion of mutual fund AUM with 12b-1 fees. I just want to see if that was in the ballpark for capturing all of that properly?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","That sounds right.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just on the fee rate picked up this quarter on ex-performance fees, so just was wondering, obviously, there's a mix shift between the asset classes but even within some of the asset classes we've seen some improvement in fees. I wonder \u2013 just wondering if there's \u2013 if that's all due to mix or were there any sort of one-time-ish elements that (44:53).","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","It was predominantly due to mix.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just of mix.

Joining me, as always, is our CFO, Ken Lewis. The first quarter had many challenges, but overall there were a number of positives, including investment performance, improving flow trends in many asset classes, operating margin and capital management that we highlighted in our commentary that was made available this morning. Hopefully everyone had a chance to listen to that, as well as take a look at our 10-Q that was also filed this morning. Now I'd like to open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Carrier from Deutsche Bank.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Your first question, just on the equity side of the business, it looks like the flows in the quarter are probably better than you expected. Yes, I know last quarter you guys had some either redemptions on the institutional side, I think it was maybe $2.7 billion that you pointed out. This quarter you've mentioned, on the prerecorded call, some wins. Just wondering how significant those were because it seems like on the retail side, depending on how big those were, you saw some improvement there. So just trying to figure out what's driving that. And then any -- do you have any product granular, that you could give? I think you mentioned income products, but just any color there.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I think there was no real significant moves on the institutional side except there was one large account, about $840 million in global equities that was a new mandate during the quarter, and then there were a lot of wins in the $200 million to $300 million range. But really nothing more, I would say, normal as far as wins and losses during the quarter. But nothing really to call out as far as retail trends. I just think there's a lot of noise, quarter-to-quarter, on the institutional side.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the global bond side, you guys provided some color on the prerecorded call, just any more color when we look at the U.S. products and the flows versus the non-U.S. And, yes, I think even if we look in the past 2 years, there was a lot coming in the non-U.S. channel, and you guys have mentioned over time where it's not as sticky, and so when you have some volatility in the market, you can see some more outflows there. And then, I think, we've asked the question before in the past on capacity on those products. I just wanted to get your thoughts on -- sometimes there is -- you can have the same strategy, you have different funds. So when you think about some of the concentrations that the fund can take in, say, like emerging markets, have you guys ever considered, or would it make sense, to have a product where you can focus more on some of the smaller markets and then have a product that, just given the size of the fixed income markets, could continue to grow and you probably wouldn't have any capacity issues?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I think all of that -- we've considered all of that. I'll start with just the flows. And I think as we've called out on prior calls, I think the level of flows coming in to the CCAB and the cross-border funds, we felt that, that was not a sustainable level. And this was the first kind of setback. And also, I think, the other factor is that you do have more control by gatekeepers. And with the increased volatility, they have -- they can slow down a larger portion of your flows versus the U.S., which is more one-on-one out with advisors. And also, I think in the U.S. generally, a smaller portion of an overall portfolio, and in the offshore sales, a lot of newer investors to this category. So what we're seeing and what is consistent with our thinking is that the U.S. was less vulnerable to the downturn and didn't have as much in terms of outflows and is quicker to rebound based on the performance. And I think it is important, it's early for January, but much of the underperformance that we experienced over the last year, we've had a strong rebound in the month of January. So I think that'll help when people see where the fund is priced today. And then on emerging markets bond and capacity, those are all good points. I mean, we came out with emerging markets balanced fund this quarter, which would have more exposure in the smaller markets along with the emerging markets. So capacity is not a constraint right now with sovereign debt and how this fund's been run historically. So we don't think it's an issue with the global bond fund. And I'd also point to the total return fund which continues to grow in terms of flows, which includes corporate's as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Lee from KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","First, I had a question on margins and maybe it's a little conceptual, but if I look back over the years, you guys have done a really good job of kind of improving the operating efficiency of the business, whether it's through transitioning expenses to lower-cost locations and other things. And how do you think about going forward, do you feel like there's much -- any more or much more opportunity to kind of drive, make kind of the big drives in efficiency that you've kind of get -- were able to gather over the last, really, decade, I guess? Whereas at this point, it's more about top -- if you're going to grow margins, it's really pretty much a top line driven story that's not as much -- beyond just trying to be tight on cost, not a lot of other big move you can make on the infrastructure side?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes, Robert, those are good questions. I think there is capacity in the low cost jurisdictions. We have this campus in Hyderabad, there's capacity there to add more people. We're constantly looking for ways to increase our efficiencies using that. But having said that, it's a hard fight to make a -- to really move the needle on the margins. When you do that, it's more of a long-term effort. So obviously, the big swings in the margin comes from the revenue. But I do think there is room for us to become even more efficient.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and maybe as a follow-up for, Greg, you kind of a touched on this in your comments before -- just now, on the control the gatekeepers exert and to what extent do you think there is a risk you kind of become a little bit of a victim of your own success? And what I mean by that is your so well penetrated in distribution in the U.S. and whether it's through the global bond products or maybe mutual shares or others, that you get to a point where certain distributors are just like, \"Look, performance is good. We like you, but we kind of have enough exposure.\" At this point, maybe -- do you feel like you're -- that, that's something you bump into at different places or do you think there's still plenty of runway so to speak?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes. I don't think that's a problem. I think the way the world looks at it or advisors look at asset management is they look for a category and a strong performer that they have a good relationship with. And for us, it's under multiple names with, really, distinct groups. So I don't think you have that kind of concentration risk where they feel like, \"Oh, we're -- this is our #1 outside firm, and we need to cut back on that.\" It's just not an issue. I think people like the global bond. They're going to look at capacity on an individual basis with individual funds. They're not really going to roll it up and see how much they have with the overall firm. So I've never really experienced that as being any kind of a barrier.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Kelley from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just curious. Based on what you're seeing in January so far in your conversations with clients, just curious to get your thoughts on the retail side and institutional side, how willing are your clients to re-risk and what do you think are going to be the biggest growth drivers in your products this year?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, one, I mean you've had a pretty significant rebound in the market, but still headwinds with active managers on the equity side that we've seen, I think. So risk, we haven't seen people coming back into the traditional long-only equity mandates, but we have, I think where you see the movement is on the dividend income side, the hybrid income fund. It's clearly still a flight to quality. We saw a movement in our U.S. government fund, muni sales, those are doing very well. But where -- the area I expect to see continued growth is around rising dividends, equity income and the Franklin Income Fund. I think those are the funds that have equity exposure, have a yield better than a money fund yields certainly, and we think offers better risk\/reward. And that's really what we're talking about in distribution.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then, I was hoping you could just shed a little bit more light on the response in the U.S., particularly on the discussions you're having with the advisors on the Templeton Global Bond Fund. So just curious, is there more of a skew to the investors who have been with you for a longer period of time, say, 2009, understand it a lot of better? Do you think the ones who -- the people to put money to work with that fund in 2010 and 2011 really understand the long-term strategy as well?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes. That certainly helps. I mean, we are looking at it and trying to understand are there redemptions coming. And certainly, they're a little bit higher with the newer money that haven't really seen the ups and downs over time. And we have had periods of underperformance in the past with this fund, and because this fund is not really run to a benchmark or an index. And to get the kind of returns we've had over time, you do take risk. And you're going to have periods like we had with this unusual flight to quality that can move the needle pretty quickly. But I think what we've seen here in January and we saw it in past years is that the markets will normalize quickly and you can get much of that back. So the longer somebody is in a fund and experiences the ups and downs, the better we are. And I think that's the silver lining to Europe where you have a lot of new investors that came in, and the ones that now stick with the fund understand that it can go up and down that kind of level and it's really not a money fund equivalent. So I think that's the good news, if there is any.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cynthia Mayer from Bank of America.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You mentioned on your commentary you expect expenses to turn a little bit higher this quarter, and specifically, you mentioned comp and merit increases. I was looking back and it looked like last year, I think it was -- forecasted something like $10 million to $20 million in merit increases. And I'm wondering if you're expecting that sort of same range? And also, since you pulled back on variable comp in this quarter, would that then bounce back?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Right. I think you're right on, on both points. If you do look back to the first quarter of last year versus the second quarter of last year, you could see a -- in percentage terms, you could see an increase, I think, it was about 7% at our 8%. And we have grown the employee base a little bit, so I do think it's reasonable to expect something a little bit higher than that in the next couple of quarters. And of course, on the variable side, if things pick up, you could expect some pressure there as well. The other thing I'd mention also if -- depending on your assumptions for sales is, don't forget about the sales distribution and marketing expense line as well, which typically grows a little bit faster than its revenue counterpart.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then also you didn't mention G&A. Is that pretty much a level rate?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","I think that there's a lot of things that go into that line item. Certainly, one of the bigger ones is advertising, and for us seasonally, the first quarter of our fiscal year is pretty low on the advertising front. So in the normal circumstances, I would expect that to go up, but we have been pretty cautious about expense management in this first quarter. I've asked everybody to try to keep underneath even their budgeted levels and they're doing a fantastic job at that. So with that as background, I'm not sure that we would see the normal pickup in advertising in the next quarter. But certainly, there'll be some pressure in the advertising lines that might drive that expense category up.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Katz from Citi Group.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Greg, you mentioned on the call, your activities picked up a little bit in January. And so the question is, is that both gross and net sales? And if so, where specifically are you seeing the leverage?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well I think anytime you see the market rebound like it has and certainly global bonds settling down, that's going to help the kind of pressure that we were under. As I mentioned before, I mean, the leverage is -- the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter where we saw a pickup in hybrid sales and funds, like the U.S. Government Fund, had very significant net inflows. And I think that, that trend, along with municipal, should continue. So that's where I would expect to see the biggest move. And then obviously, the global bond side, the net outflow pressure should be a lot less.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Helpful. And second question is, I think I asked [indiscernible] I apologize. But a number of platforms are out there for sale, you're sitting on a ton of cash, great free cash flow. What's your appetite for deals in this environment? And if so, what kind of products or geographies might be of interest?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes, it's -- we do get this question quite often. And the answer is there is really -- we don't kind of limit the universe. And small deals, certainly we've done small deals in targeted areas to bolster our local asset management capabilities. On balance, I'd say that probably appeals to more than a megadeal, but we certainly wouldn't rule out a big acquisition if we thought that there is substantial synergies to be had by doing that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Craig Siegenthaler, Credit Suisse. First question just on the other revenue item. I'm just wondering, or if you could help us think about this in terms of run rate, because the reclassification impacted it, lifted a little higher. Is $27 million a good run rate to think about for next quarter? Or is there anything we should be backing out?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes. Because we have limited historical data, it's a little tough to say. But certainly, I feel comfortable saying it's going to be higher than it has been in the last 4 quarters whether it'd be as high as it is now, I can't really say at this point.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, just another question. There's a few data points I was wondering if you could help us in terms of thinking about flows this quarter, but I'm sure you've probably seen some of the data. So I'm wondering if you have any commentary in terms of how sales have trended as of the first month or the first quarter or overall sales or maybe Templeton Global Bond Fund flows specifically or even aggregate flows, like any data in that type of category that let us think about kind of flows quarter-over-quarter?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes. I can't really add much to what I mentioned earlier. I mean, the markets are stronger things have stabilized and we expect a much better quarter. But it's a little bit early and I wouldn't want to lead anybody to some numbers one month in.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Then, Ken, just one question on the Auto business. I believe you said no impact. But when we think about the forward run rate of earnings after you sell the business, is that also -- is that basically also very little impact?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes. It's going to have very little impact because essentially we have a been running that book down. It's becoming a less significant part of the business over -- since 2008. So I wouldn't say no impact, but it wouldn't be significant.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Casteleyn from Susquehanna.","Jonathan E. Casteleyn - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","You mentioned active equity mandates still not recovering despite the uptick in the market. So I'm just wondering, in your view, what's the catalyst for the improvements in equity mutual funds on the active side?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I mean, I think that's a good question, it probably just comes to the type of risks that people are taking. And just looking at the overall portfolio, I think most of the active side you're kind of seeing through the target date funds that are flowing through 401(k). But individuals, and I've said this in past calls, probably had an overweighting to U.S. equities and continue to bring that number down, and that's put a lot of pressure on active. It's not certainly the movement towards passive, which is a small percentage, but not the conclusions that people have when they see the big flows in the passive and inactive. I think it's a more rebalancing of their own and that includes alternatives, commodities, other type of strategies in their overall portfolio. So I think it's going -- it's still -- its headwind for the industry, but we're going to continue to pound that message into our -- on the distribution side because, again, we think, risk\/reward, it's a better place to be than fixed income at this point.","Jonathan E. Casteleyn - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And any sort of ballpark timing? I mean, you've seen many cycles before, so just wondering, do you think this is an '12 item or it's more longer data than that until you see the...","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I hope so, but it's taken longer than I thought it would. So, again, I think the you can see some real movement on the equity income side, and I know there is a lot of advisors now that are looking at that and even looking at -- as a substitute for some short-term cash, that it may be a better place to park money than even holding it in a money fund they have or certainly in -- on bond funds.","Jonathan E. Casteleyn - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then quickly to the Templeton equity side, one, your numbers still quite weak. I'm just wondering can you -- do you have any color on the underlying exposures there, just so we can understand how they're trending during the course of '12 here on a go-forward basis?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes. I think the 1-year number is about average because the growth fund is 55% out, foreign funds 51 percentile, so they have had exposure to financials in the Eurozone, and that's been a little bit of a lag, but maybe a little bit of a help more recently. So it -- that could move on, really, on a daily basis into the top 2 quartiles.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Follow up on the auto lending business. Wanted to hear a little bit more about the, maybe, benefits of unwinding that business. Does that change kind of the bank holding company status? Does it free capital? Are there other ancillary benefits outside the P&L that are worth highlighting?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","No, not really. It was treated as a standalone business. It was certainly part of the banking segment, but it was treated as a standalone business. And the decision to wind it down was just a cost benefit for that business. It doesn't really impact the bank holding company status.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Is there a reason to keep that holding company status if you don't have the auto lending business?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Well, it's really the reason we're a bank holding company is for the high net worth business -- custody business and lending in that area.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then on investment income, can you give us some just better details on the results this quarter? What was realized versus unrealized? And then, in what part of the investment portfolio did you see the majority of the gains if it actually came from one part or the other?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","I'll try to give you a little help with that. So thinking about in the presentation that sharpest of the different components, I mean, I think there is probably 2 ways you could look at this, if you're trying to model it. There is kind of a back-of-the-envelope way, which says, \"Okay, look at the investments in cash that the company has legal ownership to\", and in our slide we show that, that generated $55.6 million. And then you could say, \"Look at the things that we don't have ownership to\", and in our slide, net of the noncontrolling interest, it's really almost nothing. So the majority of the net-net, bottom-line impact was for things that we owned and then we've kind of broken it out in the different categories. The trading investments category, it was the bit that's unrealized. The available-for-sale, most of that would be realized. So that's kind of the back-of-the-envelope way.","Then, another way you could look at it is looking at the underlying securities and we've put a disclosure, I think, it's on Page 42 of the Q, that lists about $1 billion of trading securities by investment objectives and those are the ones they get to mark-to-market. In addition to that, we note there is about $800 million of noncurrent investments that get driven by the market, and we show what categories those are in, and that drives the equity method investment bar on Slide 17. In addition to that, we have $1 billion of VIEs and most of the variable interest entities are collateralized loan obligation. So what you're seeing in the P&L there is the changes in the net asset liability position of those products. I hope that's helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Spahr from CLSA.","Chris Spahr - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Actually all my questions have been answered.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Kim from Sandler O'Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First, now that flows into the Global Bond Fund have slowed a bit, do you have a sense of how much the redemptions you're maybe recapturing into other products, similar to what you were able to do when you had some muni fund redemption pressures earlier last year?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, I don't have those numbers in front of me. I did see fairly significant exchange activity into our government fund, which would -- I think would be a normal place for that to go. But I don't know how much we're capturing off hand.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then, maybe a question for Ken. Just given the recent step-up in dividends and share repurchases, has your thinking changed at all as it relates to the payout ratio? I think previously you've talked about maybe a 60% payout range, but maybe are you a bit more willing to stay above that level just given the strength of the balance sheet?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","I think we're probably going to consistently stay with that target for now. And keep in mind that all of those create shareholder returns in terms of dividends and share buybacks come from the U.S. cash, so it's not the entire balance sheet. So I think we're going to continue with the targets that we've set in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Katz from Citi Group.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just 2 of them, I may have the numbers wrong from memory, but I think in your prepared remarks this morning, you mentioned that the yield launch program, you're saying, mailed out like 20,000 fulfillment kits, if you will. How does the -- how long has that been going on? And how does that beginning compared to what you do with maybe, Vision 2020 (sic) [2020 Vision] or even fixed income back several years ago as well?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes. I think it's a complement to the 2020, and really the equity story and just specializing in a category that today with yields at historic lows, certainly 10-year historic lows, that we feel it's a compelling story to focus. So the literature was just mailed out, I think, just over this last quarter, it's a new campaign that just kicked off and will be ongoing throughout the year. Bill, did that answer your question?","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Close enough [indiscernible]. The other question is just in terms -- coming back to Ken's commentary about other income. I just want to make sure I understand the step up though, is there an equal offset in the noncontrolling lines? There's really no net economic impact regardless of the new revenue line?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","So to the end -- okay, so back to Slide 17, I think we've even color-coded it, kind of the areas above the purple, which is $7 million, most of that is offset by noncontrolling interest. Not the entire category just the things that we consolidate.","Operator","You're next question comes from Robert Lee from KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just curious, in the prepared remarks, Greg, I think you mentioned that, and you've talked about this in past calls, launching some multi-asset class products and some alternative products. And just a couple, really, 1 or 2 questions at this, number one, is there anything within that mix, I know it's early days, but that when you look at and given your distribution capabilities that you think, kind of you're particularly excited about, that you think could be, I'm not going to say another global bond product, but something you think can be a good driver of flows over the next couple of years? And then on the alternative front, are those mainly kind of retail-type products? Or have you actually started kind of launching more alternative strategies for institutional investors?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think the multi-asset fund is just natural for us to have that with all the capabilities that we have. And as I've said before, I think it's important that you have that commodity exposure. And then the other one that we just launched this quarter, the real return, real asset fund. And in this environment, I don't expect it to move but it's very important to have that fund in there if rates do start to back up at some point to capture exchanges and have a fund that's designed to beat inflation over time. So that's a big risk to the company. And so having that in the lineup but then can be invisible will be important for us. But I think in the near term, the multi-asset fund is the one that we think has the shorter term opportunity. And then what was the other question?","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","It was just on the alternatives, all types of...","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Alternatives. Yes, I think, probably more on the institutional side, but you could argue that some of these funds are a little bit more alternative because they do have the commodities in them and futures in them and a different type of exposure than our traditional loan-only, and as well as currency forwards and things like that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just one follow-up question on the global bond. I'm curious, when you -- it wasn't a big pickup in redemption, it's a small pickup in redemption. So it's really a gross sales follow up. And so, you had like, literally, 3x or 4x the falloff in gross sales than you did in the U.S. products. So I'm curious if you -- how you might attribute it? What kind of feedback you got from the sellers, if you will, of -- is it a performance or was it a performance issue? Was it people freaked out on Europe issue? And what is it about that customer base that is that much more active in quarter-to-quarter than the rest of your clientele?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think it's all of the above. I mean it is -- in Europe, there are little bit -- it's a heightened concern, I think, over what was going on at the time. There were rumors around the fund at that time. I mean, I could contribute. And I think some gatekeepers may have been worried that they had too much concentration in there in certain cases. So all of that adds up to a slowdown. How quickly it can come back? I think that's the question that we're all -- we're hopeful that the January rebound will accelerate that. But clearly, it's moving in the right direction in the U.S. It's going to be a little slower with the cross-border sales.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies & Company.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Following up on that a bit. Just -- you guys have highlighted regionally areas of strength for sales. I think Italy, you mentioned that at least a few quarters ago. Maybe if you could talk about areas of strength and also the regions where there was potentially a pickup in redemptions or where you saw the most weakness?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, I don't really have any trends to call out other than obviously, Italy, which majority of that was global bonds. So you wouldn't have -- you'd obviously see a big drop from where it was as far as flows. I think it is important to point to the other big driver in cross-border, which is the Asian growth fund, which had a tough quarter last quarter but had good relative performance. And as we would expect in that fund, it's a much quicker rebound in sales and that's consistent with those markets coming back. So we have seen a pickup there. And so, any of the markets that were selling more equities, more Asian growth, more U.S. opportunities, they have rebounded a lot faster than the ones that were concentrated more on the global bond. And really Italy, is probably the only one market that had the significant concentration on the Global Bond Fund.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Okay, well, thank you, everyone, for participating on the call. And we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

My name is Omar and I'll be your call operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin.","Greg Johnson","Hello and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I\u2019m joined today by Ken Lewis, our CFO. While some clear challenges persist during the quarter, investment performance within our growth strategies was very strong and net flows into our US equity and hybrid products improved. US equity sales reached the highest level in three years, driven by demand for a number of growth funds within the category. Additionally, we continue to make progress with several strategic initiatives to offer lower cost options to investors, notably in the DCIO space. Importantly, operating results remained strong with over 503 million of operating income generated on 1.6 billion of revenue in the quarter. We continue to prioritize capital return with elevated share repurchase activity in the quarter and a $0.23 per share regular quarterly dividend.","We\u2019d now like to open the line to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler, Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler","On page 4 of the prepared remarks, I see you adjusted fee structures in your A share, so I\u2019m just wondering how large is this A share from an AUM based standpoint and also what\u2019s the estimated economic impact in terms of EPS or revenues or earnings?","Ken Lewis","Yeah. I mean, I don't think we have a number. I think it -- I would say, it would be nominal any impact. It's really just adjusting the payout schedule to be more competitive on the breakpoint schedules and we think the real impact would be in the lower duration kind of products where we've seen a lot of over million dollar sales, being competitive on the brokerage side of those still selling A share assets. So, I just don't think it is a number that would adjust anything at this stage. Hopefully it will if we get strong sales.","Greg Johnson","Right. We think, it will increase sales, and if it does increase sales, then you would see the sales distribution revenue and expense line increase, which is a good thing.","Craig Siegenthaler","And then just as my follow-up, I don't know if you guys did this intentionally, but it looks like you pulled the tax and commentary around the pipeline in the prepared remarks. I'm just wondering how did the institutional one up and not yet funded pipeline trend from next quarter?","Ken Lewis","Well, I think that the -- was the question how the pipeline related back to last quarter?","Craig Siegenthaler","Yes. So how did the institutional pipeline of one yet not yet funded mandates trend the current right now versus three months ago?","Ken Lewis","Yeah. I think, for example, the big win for our local asset management in the UK, I don't think, we noted that last quarter. So that was an upside surprise, but I would say for, the pipeline came in pretty much, for the rest of the pipeline, it came in pretty much as we expected.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Katz, Citi.","Bill Katz","So first question is just on expenses. Appreciate that you \u2013 sorry, some background noise. So just appreciate the guidance, as it relates to the fourth quarter on the G&A side. So I guess first part of the question is, where is the spend? It sounds like there is a little lumpiness to it? And then now that you\u2019re so close to the end of the year, how are you thinking about the growth next year, relative to the growth rate you articulated for this year?","Ken Lewis","Right. There were a few one-time charges in the G&A, but there's also -- there was a bit of kind of expense trends going on in there as well. So that's why we gave the guidance. Some of it relates to sub-advisory expense, so you're seeing an offset to that in revenue as well. But I think that's probably the biggest driver there and so that's why we're giving that guidance for the fourth quarter. I mean, it's early in the budget process for us looking forward to next year, but our target is to try to keep the expenses under 3% growth rate next year, year-over-year, \u201919 versus \u201918.","Bill Katz","And then just stepping back, you mentioned the priorities is cap returned, where are you in terms of the buyback versus sort of the stepped up repurchase you announced more recently. And just as you think sort of going forward from here, is buyback still the priority use for that within sort of the overall capital plan?","Ken Lewis","Yeah. I would broaden the answer and say that, returning capital to shareholders continues to be a priority. And part of that is share repurchases. I would point out, this quarter, there are, we like to be opportunistic with our share repurchases this quarter. There was a couple of factors that kind of elevated the share repurchases compared to the previous quarter, one of them was, there was a pretty big spike up in volume during the quarter. And also we repurchased shares to cover any -- some share issuances that we had related to M&A. So a little elevated this quarter, but it continues to be a priority.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington, JP Morgan.","Ken Worthington","And to follow-up on the capital return conversation, you\u2019re clearly returning a bunch to investors, but at the same time, the business is under tremendous pressure and you've got a tremendous amount of cash, gives you the opportunity to kind of redirect the business or buy your way into better growth. And you've done acquisitions, but nothing that I would consider transformational. So, how serious are conversations in the board room about leveraging the cash for more than just buybacks and dividends? And if the opportunity arose to do something truly transformational for what has been a struggling business?","Greg Johnson","I mean I think you're dead on and I think I was going to add that to the last two bills, to Ken\u2019s response to Bill's question that when you look at capital, M&A is still the priority for the use of that capital on the balance sheet and I think the challenges that you mention and we all know with, whether it's fee pressure passive or just the move to advisory from brokerage will continue to put pressure on organic growth rates. So we are, as we said in past calls, very active in looking and that still would be the number one priority to invest the capital into growth channels and not make the priority just buybacks and dividends.","And I think obviously, in those board discussions, our ongoing, looking at all aspects and all channels of growth and are much more interested in that discussion than the level of buybacks.","Ken Worthington","And evidenced by what you guys have been doing, you guys have done a number of smaller deals, but they've been smaller deals and not sort of big transformational deals. If the right opportunity arose, is transformational something that would be under serious consideration or really is the better approach, do you think to kind of nudge the battleship and maybe transform the business longer term, using smaller transactions? Like I guess, it's been so long since -- like Franklin has done big, big transformational deals in the past, but it's been a long, long, long time since you guys have taken that approach?","Greg Johnson","Well, and also very different organizations from when a Franklin bought a Templeton to where we are today, as far as the breadth of what we offer in as many places, so I think, the answer is that we continue and doing bolt-on, developing products whether it's alternatives and we're building out businesses like private equity. We want to continue to scale up the high net worth business, we've said that in the past.","I mean I define transformational, but I think they are harder to do and of course, we are open to that, but I think combining with the company of this size, is very challenging to maintain who we are as an organization, but I think those discussions again are ones that we are open to but more probably you'll see continued investment in those other categories that can't be duplicated by passive strategies as a priority and then just again scaling up the businesses that we're in, we\u2019ll continue to do that. But I think as far as a transformational, whether it's two huge organizations combining, I think that that's more difficult, but we could certainly still do something in between that that would absolutely change the organization in a significant way. So those are all things we're looking at.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Maybe first one, just on the fee rate. It seems like there was a little bit of -- a little bit more pressure this quarter. Just wanted to get some sense, were there any other changes that were made in the quarter on pricing or was it more, whether it's product vehicle shift, that was just playing into that?","Ken Lewis","I think one of the factors was just simply that there were some one-offs last quarter and that weren\u2019t -- that didn't happen this quarter, but we're not really seeing any major shifts and fee reductions in any of the major retail products. I think some of the institutional accounts are coming in, there's some free pressure on that we're seeing for new accounts, but nothing significant.","Greg Johnson","And I would just add to the mix and if you look at the emerging markets that they were down 8% for the quarter, that probably counts as two or three times per dollar of assets. So that kind of move can have an impact on that line as well.","Michael Carrier","And then just on the investments on the M&A front. I think you guys have said in the past that you look at a lot of opportunities, but it's also from a timing of the cycle, like pricing or valuations are a bit tougher. Just wanted to get your sense, when you guys go through that math and the calculation, how much do you focus on sort of the price being paid versus maybe the longer-term consequence of not pursuing those with the outflows continuing, the cash flow deteriorating. Just wanted to get your perspective on, how much is the current, maybe the K rate factor into potentially doing something.","Greg Johnson","Well, I think, every target, if you will, every potential acquisition is bespoke. So, I don't think it's -- we look at it and say, oh, we can improve aggregate net flows, but we look at the opportunity set that potential M&A target presents and of course that would include where we think it will be improved flows in a certain sector and all that. Or a product or -- improve our investment capabilities, et cetera. So, I think, I don't know if that answers your question, but basically, it's a case-by-case analysis.","Ken Lewis","And I would just say that first and foremost, we think our stock is probably still the best buy out there. So we'll continue to do that and I think the, we don't think the pressure that we've -- that we\u2019re undergoing, I think, in a rising rate environment, different kind of market, the value growth cycle, the 30-year spread of where we are of value versus growth, the strength of the dollar, all these things can mitigate some of the pressures that we're seeing on the current flows. So I think that that's, we don't think that's forever. So let's start there that we have to change the business.","But I think -- and to your question on how we look at acquisitions and pricing, obviously, a smaller one, you can pay a higher multiple to get exposure to an area that you can grow quickly. I think, it gets more difficult when you're looking at larger deals at very high multiples and then the market becomes such a factor in how that works out in the next few years. So we're willing to pay up for talent in people and we recognize that it's expensive, but also at times, when things are expensive, that's when you have opportunities to purchase quality organization. So I think we're certainly open, if we think that it's a business that can scale to pay above market multiples.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Fannon, Jefferies.","Dan Fannon","I guess a little bit more on kind of the areas you're spending in and kind of opportunities for growth, headcount, if I just look at, some of the numbers went up 3.5% sequentially. I assume part of that's the deal, but I guess could you talk about, as you look in to next year with whatever 3% growth and we know is happening in the fourth quarter pick up like where those dollars are going, what areas you're investing in the most in terms of, I assume, for kind of future growth.","Greg Johnson","Well, I think the key areas that are new channels for us and new products would be, first, would be the ETFs and that has been, build organically and grow and if we find the right acquisition to bolt on that, that\u2019s something we would certainly do, but the significant headcount in the ETF business as well as separate distribution there has increased the headcount line overall. Solutions is another area that we've talked about, having tactical asset allocation, having multi asset products and having better retirement target date, glide path, funds is a priority for us and we've added quite a bit of talent there.","The institutional side has been a priority to grow that part of the business and we've added headcount in the institutional side and just the changing distribution landscape in the US, switching from your brokerage selling product to more of the consultative planning side. We\u2019ve really revamped and reconfigured our entire what was our retail distribution and have a New York Stock Exchange channelization focusing on the traditional wire houses with more of a planning approach. That has required all additional resources. So I think there's been a lot of areas where we\u2019ve spent and invested incremental dollars hopefully. We can find savings in other areas, but that's really probably three or four areas where we\u2019ve added headcount at more of the higher cost type of headcount.","Ken Lewis","This is Ken. I would add across the enterprise, we've also been -- we forecasted years ago we've been increasing our investment in technology and you're seeing that come through the numbers.","Dan Fannon","And then just a follow-up from the prepared comments about the 28 recommended list placements across the broker dealer channels this year or in fiscal \u201918. I guess, can you give us some context like, what is that, where was it a year ago, or kind of what's the bogey of it you're trying to get to, I guess, it's hard to get a sense of what that means on a standalone basis.","Greg Johnson","I don't really have that -- those numbers to give you that context. I think it was really -- we tried to set specific goals and targets and that was one of our targets is to get that product placement. I think the importance, it really speaks to again some of the investment that we've made in that side, bringing in more consultants and building better relationships in the home office. And, we all know that, getting the product place doesn't necessarily mean you suddenly get flows coming in your funds, but what it means is you'll have that pipeline when the market does turn and when people are looking for, whether it's value or other styles that could be out of favor right now. We want to be on that platform and it also helps you retain assets, when assets are moving from brokerage to the fee base, you need to be on that plan or on that platform, but I don't really have a number to give you what, in terms of how many platforms or it's just -- it was a goal that we set a metric that we set out there for that team and for them, they hit it three quarters of the way through the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell, Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Maybe, Greg, if you could talk a little bit about the broad strategy in global equities in the Templeton franchise with the acquisition of Edinburgh Partners. Does this change how you're thinking about either managing the Templeton Global Equity franchise or delivering the product?","Greg Johnson","No. It really doesn't. I think it -- it allows us a little bit more flexibility with pricing where Edinburgh has done a good job, building sub advisory relationships that Templeton wouldn't be able to price to with the existing assets in 40 Act funds, so that gives us a new channel to distribute the value side. I think having the resource of Sandy Nairn, who is a highly respected person in the industry, one that we know well, we think can only be helpful on just the overall Templeton side, but there's no plans to do any combination and we think the benefit of accessing a growing distribution channel in the sub-advisory side that we can leverage our distribution to do that. And I don't think there's any other plans, other than having the standalone entities with the benefit of Sandy there with helping with Templeton side.","Brian Bedell","Right. So more of a bolt-on and leveraging that extra capabilities, rather than any kind of transformational move?","Greg Johnson","Exactly.","Brian Bedell","And then just, Ken, one on expenses. Just wanted to make sure I had this correct. I think the top of the expense growth guidance for this fiscal year, if I'm correct is about 7.5% and that was for me, an expense base of 2.0 billion, am I correct on that?","Ken Lewis","You are. You are.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris, Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Can you guys talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing in Asia? That's been the one region for you guys that\u2019s been growing the fastest, at least on an AUM basis. So maybe you can elaborate on what you're seeing? And then also related to that, is China loosening up the restrictions an opportunity for Franklin down the road?","Greg Johnson","I mean, first of all, I think the -- if you look at our distribution around the world, Asia continues to be the areas that are still having net inflows in a tough environment for our traditional strengths. So I think that markets like Taiwan and India continue to grow and are generating positive sales. I think the China question on, they have announced the intention to allow the minority owner in your JV to become majority owner.","We don't have exact clarity on when that will happen, but we are having discussions with our partners and that's always been our intent to do that. And then I think once you have control of that, that I think enables you to put further resources in on building out distribution there. So, I think everything probably is on a little bit of a holding pattern right now with some of the trade issues on giving clarity around that. I don't expect to see that, but from everything we've heard, we expect that to be within 12 months that we'd be able to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Lee, KBW.","Robert Lee","Maybe following up a little bit on capital management and deals, I mean some of your competitors have made investments and acquired various types of digital, have a digital strategy for distribution and otherwise and you've talked in the past a little bit about some strategic investments, small, but strategic investments you've made in different companies. Can you maybe update us on how you're thinking of, do you see a place for a digital strategy at Franklin, I mean, is that a possible path you could go down for future M&A?","Greg Johnson","Yeah, I don't know if we need, I think it's absolutely a path that we are continuing to develop a strategy on, we're doing direct in some of the markets around the world and are doing it in a very efficient way in a market like India where it's probably a quarter of our business there direct. So we've been building that out. I think the robo piece is fairly simple. I don't think we need M&A to do that on top of it. The digital tool, capabilities and customizing service levels, those are all things we've got people working on actively. As we said before, we have an investment in some different robos around the world, different companies like advisor that do financial tools that are high net worth fiduciary trust is looking at leveraging there.","So we are experimenting with it on various channels and developing, at this stage, we still have a lot of accounts that are direct, some that came through mutual series and it would be just a better way to service those accounts where we could have 30 billion or so of no advisor record accounts and think that a robo -- some type of service there makes sense. So I think like most firms, we think first and foremost, that technology is going to help distribution, help partner with the advisor, provide better tools for them to more efficiently serve more clients, so that's the first goal, but then we're thinking longer term about how we can also service those direct accounts as well and whether it's in the US or other markets, we\u2019ll be thoughtful about how we roll that out.","Ken Lewis","And I would just add that that is an area that we've been increasing expenses and investing in, so that\u2019s been part of the expense growth.","Robert Lee","Great. And then maybe as my follow-up, can you update us on your ETF initiative? I mean, where does it stand now and now that you've been at it for a while, I mean, do you feel like it's meeting your expectations, particularly the low cost kind of country specific strategy that you start with, so just kind of progress update.","Greg Johnson","Yeah. I think it's moving along, it's probably in the range of 2.5 billion I think roughly today. And we are still early in rolling out many of these strategies in terms of distribution. Our goal has been to get on platforms. We continue to make progress there and every -- seems like every month or quarter, we're being approved on new platforms, some just take -- may take three years to get on, but others we can get on a little bit faster. So, I think the progress has been good to date and one that we just recognize, will take a little bit of time and actually sales support to grow, but we are seeing decent growth at this stage. And in June, we kind of had a targeted campaign to grow awareness at the RA channel institutional. So, and also we\u2019re marketing ETFs through print ads and digital, and compressed advertisement, et cetera and we launched three active ETFs last quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein, Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Question for you regarding non US retail distribution broadly and I guess specifically focusing on UK market. I know it's been an area where you haven't had a lot of presence in the past. I don't know if a number of changes this materially, but given some of the more structural changes unfolding in the UK retail market, is this still a priority for you guys to try to expand there or not as much?","Greg Johnson","I would say it's a priority and one again that -- one that we have identified to market that I think in the past, we felt that our core strengths around global equities, there were plenty of global equities in that market. So it's one that we really didn't put a lot of resources in, but I think now, what I think what changes, we look at the size of the market and the potential still for us. So it is a market that we made a strong hire to run that effort there and we're putting more resources into that market. So I think despite some of the changes that one could argue make the retail sales a little bit more difficult, it\u2019s just too big of a market for us to ignore. So we are building that and we've been very successful with our local manager there and have very strong performance in UK equities. And just in the last quarter, as we mentioned, we got an institutional win, over $1 billion, which again I think validates the strength of that local team.","Alex Blostein","And just a follow-up question around expenses. So I heard your comments in the near term and kind of as you started to think about \u201919, but I guess in an event of a downturn, can you help us think through what you would be able to scale back on, granted you're obviously trying to pivot the business toward some of our faster growing areas. So where would be the flexibility in the expense base and what are some things you would need to pull back from, if we see more of a prolonged period of tougher markets?","Ken Lewis","Yeah. I will address that two ways. One, you can kind of -- we've had these downturns in the past and you can kind of see how reacted. I think there's that level of flexibility, if we needed to do it, we wouldn't -- we don't want to do it, but if we had to do it, we have that level of flexibility. But part of the process that we're talking about and part of -- incorporated into my trying to keep the expense growth minimal, next year is to look at investments that we've made in the past that maybe aren't panning out and call operations that we don't see the benefit in performing a certain service and all that. So we're looking at all of the areas to see where can we create savings that we can reinvest because we do want the actual incremental growth into new things to be above the 3% guidance that I gave you, but we also want to fund that through some savings from outdated processes and services.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys, Morgan Stanley.","Michael Cyprys","Just wanted to follow up on M&A. As you think about the opportunities out there, what sort of a hold back or hesitation, as if the largest side acquisitions at this point, have you gotten close on anything and if so what\u2019s happened? And as you think about any sort of hesitation, is it price of you on the cycle in terms of where we are, does that kind of factor into consideration and is there a view to maybe be a bit more patient on M&A, wait for a return in the cycle and then kind of get a better price, how do you sort of balance the near term versus medium term of a better purchase price?","Greg Johnson","Well, I think, first of all, we did close two deals last quarter, so it's not like we're not doing anything, although obviously not of the scale. You're talking about, I think, we have been as active as we can be in looking at multiple deals and you only have so much capacity if we\u2019re working -- even if it's a number of partners, that's going to take resources and tie up for a bit to close that. So I don't think it's -- price is always a consideration of course. I mean, that's going to be one. It could just be what we think is not the right fit, not the right culture.","We're concerned about where we are in cycle in the business, all factors, all of the above, but not anyone stands out. As I said in earlier answer that again, if it's an area that we think we need to be in and we've got an opportunity to bring in a quality organization, we're going to pay up for that. So I don't -- we don't have any set number that says, gee, it can't be -- has to be accretive in year one or it can be, those are factors that we're going to think long term and try to just bring the best in and would hopefully isn't overpaying too much.","Ken Lewis","As Greg mentioned, price is always a factor, but that's the benefit of having a strong balance sheet that if we see an opportunity that we think makes strategic sense, we could just get it.","Michael Cyprys","And just as a quick follow up, I think I may have heard you, your suggestions were building on a private equity business, if you could just talk a little bit more about that and some of the alternative capabilities that you're building out organically, how that's progressing, what we can see next there?","Greg Johnson","Yeah. I think the -- for us, we've been in private equity in other areas with Templeton and for a while, it's really the US side that we've developed and part of it is, the growth, the private markets, having analysts that build strong relationships here in Silicon Valley and just seeing a lot of opportunities on the private side. That's one that we just said it made sense then to start a business. I think the -- and the fund is not a big first fund, but at 50 million, it has significant outside investors that recognize our access and strength on the analyst side here in the Valley that that made sense we're doing and we're also looking at AI and big data and have some partners there that we're bringing in to do that.","And I think just, we're trying to take advantage of our location and the strength of our technology team here in San Mateo. It's very hard to go out, as you know, to go buy a private equity firm. I think that's -- we see that that's extremely difficult, again, if the right situation came up, we would entertain that, but I think building it organically, taking time there and just building strong records is what we want to do. The other alternative side, the K2, we didn't talk about that, but had an extremely strong quarter.","Whenever you see the kind of disruption in the market like we did earlier in the quarter, we tend to see a strong interest in the alternative category and they've had very strong results on a relative basis and on a flow basis and had a major win last quarter as well. So that's another business within the alternatives that continues to grow. And then other categories that we're looking at on the M&A side, we'd like to build the larger real estate group within that. So that's certainly something that we've been looking at deals and recognize that that's going to be an important category.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell, Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Just wanted to come back to a couple of comment that was made. On the balance sheet, in terms of M&A, it sounds like it will be, you would be looking for doing any deals, strictly in cash. So maybe just given us an update on what you view as excess cash on the balance sheet. And then you mentioned also building the ETF franchise potentially through acquisitions, so would you consider a large transformative ETF acquisition, relative to your current footprint there?","Ken Lewis","So let\u2019s see. We had net cash, net of debt, it\u2019s about 7 billion and we think that, as we disclosed, we need about 3.5 billion for regulatory requirements, internal uses, so that leaves about 3.5 billion.","The other question was, would we purchase a large transformative ETF?","Greg Johnson","We would consider it. There's not many of them out there, but we certainly would be open to the idea.","Brian Bedell","And then also you mentioned in the deck, strategy sort of in the collective trust area and that is obviously growing area. Can you size sort of your AUM in the collective trust or at least, to what extent, you are either transitioning mutual fund assets and to collective trust structures or actually just getting new sales with collective trust in DTIO?","Greg Johnson","I think right now, we have 6 billion in the collective trust and I think as you know, the flexibility of what we can do pricing, it's like an R6 class. So it's a lower cost alternative and the pressure on fees within the retirement channel, we just find this to be a very strong vehicle, well suited to do that and also the flexibility of combining and building within your solutions group, using trusts, it's more flexible than a 40 forty Act fund.","So we have seen strong interest there, on specially the DCIO channel and have built strategic partnership with another firm that allows us to kind of plug and play those funds into an existing -- already existing platform. So I think, our retirement group felt like there was 10 billion in the pipeline. I'm not sure what the probability of that. But 10 billion, that right now that they've identified and working on within the DCIO channel, but obviously, I think the market itself is like 2 trillion or something like that.","Brian Bedell","And then just in the formation of that 6 billion, is that mostly new money to Franklin Templeton or was a good portion of it switches from your own unusual fund?","Greg Johnson","No. Most of its money that's been there for a while that we use that vehicle for the institutional side with Templeton. So, those funds have existed, but where we're seeing the incremental growth now is really the, what our group is excited about is just the opportunity within the DCIO channel to have a more competitive pricing structure and we seem to be getting a lot of interest there.","Brian Bedell","So just maybe if you can characterize the environment in July, I mean, obviously, we've seen the other companies talk about net outflows, a lot of them have come from lumpy sources. But maybe with the uncertainty in the markets on trade and everything, if you could give us a flavor for what your sales teams are hearing from financial advisors in terms of retail appetite for funds and maybe any kind of July flow, early July flow outlook if it\u2019s possible?","Greg Johnson","Yeah. I don't have much color to offer there. I don't think we're seeing any significant shift at this stage, but probably consistent with some of the other remarks that have been made.","Operator","Our next question comes from [indiscernible], Evercore ISI.","Unidentified Analyst","Just going back to the 28 recommended list placements, is that a gross number and on the flip side, can you talk about like funds, what are you seeing as far as funds maybe getting consolidated off list for you guys and the industry in general?","Greg Johnson","Yeah. I think it's probably a gross number as far as new placements and I'm not sure how you would net, if you have a new advisory platform that it's really getting on those. I think the -- I'm not sure we even keep a statistic, if you went off, it's really once you're on it and most of these are new lists that, and you could argue, if you go from the old open architecture to a new list or you off that list or on, how you'd calculate that because everybody who has had access before, it moved, it's really when they set up their new advisory platform and you're absolutely right, it's a funnel, it's a narrowing of what's available and that's why it's so important and meaningful to get on that, because if you're on it, the opportunity to get greater share is there, because you're not competing with thousands of funds, but we all know the downside, if you're not on it, the brokerage assets are more vulnerable to redemptions as they move to advisory.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Katz, Citi.","Bill Katz","So a three part question. How much -- where do you stand right now in terms of remaining A, B and C share exposure in the US? And then as you've repriced now into the A class share, where are you like within sort of your peers in terms of that pricing? And then if you are to be successful and sort of realign yourselves, so that you are better flowing versus the brokerage to advisory shift, what\u2019s the economic impact on the business as you look ahead?","Greg Johnson","So, when we look at the, first of all, the pricing was to make sure that the pricing was competitive with our competitors and if we just -- it's effective, it'll be effective the next fiscal year, it will go into effect. And in terms of the economic impact, it's hard to quantify. Certainly, there's a cost, but it's only a cost if it results in increased sales. So that's a good thing to have. So we\u2019ll have increased assets under management and you'll see the sales distribution and expense line go up as a result.","Ken Lewis","And some of it was just being consistent as part, adopted even their brokerage model or adopted it to more of a, trying to get a consistent pricing model. For example, we have a new class that would just make -- we were an outlier with the lower 12B1 at 15 on some of our funds and we've had to move them to 25 because that's the standard pricing for that asset class within certain advisors that had to have that. So repricing there doesn't really have that and that won't have an impact financially other than hopefully generating new sales. It's really just some of the tweaks within the payout structures and more flexibility around the million dollar pricing that -- and hopefully that leads to larger tickets and better sales, but we don't have an exact impact number, because as I said earlier on a call, I just don't think it's going to be material for a while there. And I just don't think it's a material change in any way.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Now, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Johnson for closing remarks.","Greg Johnson","Well, thank you again for everybody attending today's call and we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"10323":["Franklin Resources, Inc.

Mr. Johnson, you may begin.","Greg Johnson","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining today to discuss this quarter's results. Ken Lewis, our CFO is here with me, as usual, to discuss our financials, and we also have Rich Byrne, President of Benefit Street Partners, available to address any questions on the alternative credit markets as we're set to close on the acquisition this Friday.","Market volatility clearly impacted our financial results this quarter. In fact, the net effect of the mark-to-market, which is predominantly unrealized losses and other income, was more than $83 million this quarter. Fortunately, this environment has been more conducive to the success of value-oriented investment strategies, including many of ours.","We are pleased to see our relative performance continue to improve with net sales improving notably in several of our flagship strategies this month. Lastly, we remained active with our capital management program and returned approximately $460 million to shareholders through repurchases and dividends in the quarter.","I would now like to welcome any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. ","Patrick Davitt","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Looks like in the prepared remarks you're guiding to expenses being down in 2020. Could you walk us through the puts and takes of that, versus investment need and how you can get comfort that the expenses can come down after being up in 2019?","Ken Lewis","Sure, Patrick. This is Ken. So we've been working in the last couple with all the business units to identify areas where we can leverage efficiencies and kind of fund all of those investments you referenced. So the result of that exercise is that, we do think through cost cutting initiatives that we will implement this year that, we'll be able to get the run rate expenses to be at or below the 2018 levels and still make those investments -- the strategic investments that you referenced. ","Patrick Davitt","Okay, great. Thanks. And in that vein, I guess, is there a chance that some of that could bleed into 2019 so that the lower end of the 2% to 3% guide could come down again?","Ken Lewis","Yes, I think that's true and I think we are trending on a lower end of that guide. Right now I think I would say to you that as we go through the cost-cutting initiatives that probably be execution cost that will be non-recurring and will be able to give you better handle on that as we go through the process next quarter.","Patrick Davitt","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Daniel Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Fannon","Hi. Just a follow-up on that. I guess I thought last quarter the comments for this -- for fiscal 2019 was closer to flat and your comments about -- you guided opposite, it could be towards flat. So, just want to clarify, is your fiscal 2019 guidance a plus 2% to 3%, a change from what you had before?","Ken Lewis","No, going by memory of the comments last quarter. For sure, the guidance remains the same at 2% to 3%, we gave that guidance. But I think when we talked about this quarter, because of the seasonality, I think, that's where we made reference to flat.","Daniel Fannon","Okay.","Ken Lewis","Sure, the guidance was up 2% to 3% and that's hasn't changed. And we're tracking to the lower end of that right now.","Daniel Fannon","Got it. And then just on -- you kind of referenced increase gross sales in the quarter. We're seeing it, I guess, more in some of the U. S. products, can you talk about that momentum and kind of maybe a little more specifically where you're seeing it at some of the products and maybe some of the channels that there is actually -- you're seeing some of the traction actually pick up?","Greg Johnson","Yes, I mean, I think the big driver tends to be in flows is the global bond. And if you look at the performance in just recently the one and three-year moved to the top quartile and also the fourth quarter, which as we know was a very tough quarter for every segment where MSCI was down 13 and S&P down 15. We had a positive absolute return for global bond.","So, I think that gives a little bit of near-term momentum that we saw kind of -- I think as there's more uncertainty as I said before as people get a little more nervous, that tends to be a better selling product and we are certainly seeing that. And I would say that one has had the biggest turnaround in flows and we're seeing that through this current month as well.","The other would be the income fund, which is something we put our press on and that's really U.S. retail product, but we saw a pickup in sales there. We're just getting that message out. We had a big anniversary kind of sales push on that fund. But those would be the two primary drivers and we saw a pickup in the muni gross numbers as well over the quarter in the U.S.","Daniel Fannon","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks. Good morning. Just first on excess capital. What is the level of working capital, regulatory capital, and feed within the $7.8 billion just so we can back in sort of true excess here?","Ken Lewis","That's approximately $3 billion.","Craig Siegenthaler","$3 billion, so then it would be $4.8 billion net?","Ken Lewis","Well, $3 billion to $4 billion, so $3 billion, $3 billion to $4 billion net.","Craig Siegenthaler","Okay. And just as my follow-up, what is the potential for another special dividend here, and I actually think you may have another board meeting coming up in February. So what are your thoughts around that just given all that excess capital?","Greg Johnson","I think as we've said before to this question that, that decision is the board decision. It's hard to handicap what they think. We feel that -- we feel and we continue to see this, we feel that having a strong balance sheet is strategic and having the dry powder for potential acquisition is always a consideration. All of that will be weighed at the February board meeting.","Ken Lewis","And I just think it -- you know, I mean, this is an industry that's undergoing quite a bit of change and excess is not a word we use in the balance sheet, it's a word that the market tends to use. But we think that capital can -- if you choose appropriately, can be very strategic and add a lot of shareholder value as things change and opportunities arise and what could be a pretty volatile period for the industry.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Thanks, guys. Maybe first one for you, you mentioned in the some of the commentary just some of the traction that you're seeing over a multiple years of initiatives on the fee-based side of the business in U.S. retail. Maybe just can you give us an update on what traction you are seeing in terms of the platforms, number of products?","And then maybe an update just how much of your business is on the fee-based side relative to say maybe the brokerage and how that has shifted over the past few years as these initiatives have been in place?","Greg Johnson","Yeah, I mean, I think as we said before, I think, an area of significant investment for us in the last few years has been really transitioning the U.S. retail distribution to be better equipped to service of fee-based environment not only require adding a lot of different skill sets into the group, but also pricing and changing and adding classes of shares and changing products as well.","And also, we created a specialized New York Stock Exchange change, dedicated, and I think those kind of changes take a little bit of time, but we are seeing results, and even the New York Stock Exchange channels, we were up 26% in sales quarter over -- the prior quarter. So I think that -- and those changes can be destructive, but I think, they\u2019re somewhat several now.","I think another area that we think is going to be important, we talked about solutions. We put a big investment in solutions, and I think, today we have what we consider one of the best in the industry, which is as far as product development and where we think incremental growth can occur within our multi-asset group in solutions, we now have 11 model funds, which use underlying FTE funds, but also because they can incorporate some lower cost indexing and passive into that it gives us a much more competitive outcome-oriented solution type product, and we have 11 of those that are just rolling out right now, and we\u2019re seeing a lot of interest there.","I think the -- I don't have the exact number between the brake, but I think, as far as we look at the world; probably 70% is going into fee-based versus brokerage today. So that's where we need to be. And what we measure is the effect of or how important it is to get products on the shelf on the platforms. And we have very specific metrics trying to do just that. And we've seen a very strong pickup and that goes to ETFs as well, where I'd say one of the big changes in the last year's, because we have been out there, long enough now with some of those ETF firms having those types of consultants in place and product managers that have been able to get approval into the New York Stock Exchange firms and that will help that as well. So, I think, it is a big transition. It's going to continue to happen with some funds that may not fit the fee-based world. Others that we have to continue to modify pricing on and maybe adjust, but I think we have better momentum or good momentum there now and hopefully that's going to continue.","Michael Carrier","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Ken, just a quick follow-up on capital return. You guys have been active kind of across the different ways that you're going to return capital. Just on the buybacks, given that the pace has been elevated, any update just how we should be thinking about the rest of 2019 just in terms of the pace?","Ken Lewis","Yes, it's pretty much the same policy that we've had and practice that we've had going forward. So obviously, we think stocks are good buy at this price, so we'll be active in the market. But having said that, we're going to be both systematic and opportunistic to take advantage of things like volume dips and then holdback, if we see any kind of opportunities in the M&A world there are any other need for capital. So kind of more the same. I don't know that I would think we would -- the volumes would be elevated from this level, but just we're just going to continue to be opportunistic.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bill Katz with Citi.","Bill Katz","Okay. Thanks very much. Ken, staying with the margin discussion for a moment. Could you sort of maybe drill down in terms of where you think you can get some of those incremental savings versus talk to some of the incremental areas of spent?","Ken Lewis","I think across the board, I think, every function is looking at their operations and trying to identify areas where we could reduce costs. It just simply looking at kind of what we do and how we do it. The worlds changed. So there's probably a lot of outdated procedures that we don't need to it, do the same way anymore. And obviously, we have been building over the years in low-cost jurisdictions, so leveraging that and that crosses every function. So, it's really an enterprise wide effort. It's hard to say one particular area versus another. But I think the key levers are the low-cost jurisdictions and then leveraging technology. And then we've kind of been very forward with what strategic investment are. So we would continue things like solutions and other strategic investments and fund them with these savings.","Bill Katz","Okay, and just as a follow-up. Greg, you mentioned, it's a rapidly changing backdrop and from that I'm sort of implying that maybe a little bit more interest in M&A. Could you talk a little bit about from here, what areas seem to make the more strategic appeal to your mind?","Greg Johnson","Well, I think, again, as we've said before, I think, it is a changing landscape for distribution and how we look at the world. And I think if that means there's opportunities to tie up with distribution in some cases or own portions of distribution, I think, that would be different than our traditional way of thinking about it purely independent asset manager. And I think you're seeing some of that happen in places around the globe that would be one that we think could be strategic for us.","I've said, the high-yield business, the ETF business all businesses that we want. I meant \u2013 I said high-yield, the Fiduciary Trust would be one that, we would want to grow and scale up having that direct relationship with the investor. I think it would be important as well. So those just be a couple of the distribution and building high net worth would be certainly two priorities for capital. ","Bill Katz","Understood. And just a quick follow-up, since you have him online, I was wondering, if you can get update from the team of Benefits, just in terms of what they are seeing in terms of credit backdrop and allocations given some of the \u2013 somewhat through the fourth quarter?","Rich Byrne","Sure.","Greg Johnson","Rich, are you there?","Rich Byrne","Yeah. Thanks. Greg. I'd be happy to take that. Fourth quarter, as you know, with the drawdown in the S&P. We saw outflows out of loan funds and bond funds. Some of that trends \u2013 that translated into the liquid markets on pricing less so in our private debt business is usually a delayed effect there. Maybe for the purpose of your question, note that almost all of our capital is locked up capital. So if your question relates to any redemption's or things like that, that's not really a factor for us. For us, it's just a function of where is the most opportunistic investment opportunity. I know, the market has retraced a lot of the declines in \u2013 from the fourth quarter into the first quarter. But we're finally starting to see \u2013 some of that lag has finally taken hold.","Pricing and documents starting to reflect the more reasonable risk reward equation and just a word about sort of our philosophy. We've generally been fairly defensive in how we position most of our portfolios, particularly around the private debt product. Mostly everything, we've been doing is top of the capital structure, most of that's first lien, low loan to values. And a fair amount of dry powder. So we're looking forward to a more reasonable environment, where we can invest. Fundamentals have been still relatively strong. I know there is been some headwinds, we'll see what volatility brings us going forward, but for us, this is a buying opportunity.","Bill Katz","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee","Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe sticking with Benefit Street, a little bit, I guess, a couple of questions there. Number one, maybe could you give us a sense of where you are and maybe your fundraising cycles, I mean obviously, mostly lots of capital that you just kind of come out of the cycle with a lot of dry powder? Are you kind of have on the drawing board post-closing there's a fair number of new strategies or existing strategies your raising for? And then maybe, can I think when you announced the deal last quarter, you kind of suggested that beyond kind of the GAAP impacts, there could be some other things that kind of start impacting the P& L, either going forward whether it's a contingent payouts or whatnot, give any update how should we be thinking about those non-GAAP factors going forward or maybe some non-GAAP?","Ken Lewis","Let me start with that, and then hand it over to Benefit Street guys. Right, so in the guidance, we talked about for this year, we have eight months left. The deal closed February 1st, that for modeling purposes, we're looking at investment management fees increasing about 3.5% and then commensurate increase in expenses, not on percentage base, but in absolute dollar basis. So we still think that in this fiscal year, the acquisition would be neutral in terms of EPS accretion and then accretive after that. ","Robert Lee","Okay. I mean there going to be any \u2013 so we want to think of kind of the cash impact, so we assume that\u2019s going to be somewhat higher, maybe there\u2019s some tax benefits or obviously intangible amortization things like that or?","Ken Lewis","Well, those expense numbers include everything. And in terms of cost, we disclosed the purchase price, so that's it. So it's pretty upfront payment that we disclosed and then the expense number I gave you, and that's okay. ","Robert Lee","Okay. Right. And maybe the follow up on some of those questions. I'm sorry, go ahead. ","Ken Lewis","Do you want the Benefit Street folks to answer you? ","Robert Lee","Yes, that'd great.","Ken Lewis","Okay. ","RichByrne","Sure. Well, let me see if I can hit the key parts that you're getting at or follow-up, if you like. We were -- most of the money as I mentioned or as you mentioned is locked up capital in drawdown funds that is our flagship funds in private debt. That's our Fund 4. We have a senior-only fund in private debt. We have a special situation fund.","We're actively investing those funds. When we get to a certain threshold of drawn capital we usually then start to market our successor funds, which we intend to have successor funds in each of those. So we have been generally on pace, on all of that.","And remember we also have leverage against the funds that we could use for additional buying power, if the market opportunity gets better. So we remain on pace and that sort of the nature of how we approach it. Did that answer your question? ","Robert Lee","Well, I was just curious I mean to say, since not familiar with your firm, you say on pace. So you kind of halfway through in investing these and to have kind of average investment period of 3 years, just trying to get a sense of when you could be hitting that next fundraising cycle? ","Rich Byrne","Yes. As a general rule, we raise our successor fund when we are 75% invested in the current fund. And all 3 of the funds that I referenced, and I didn't even mention you our separate accounts and other capital that we manage, that's also locked up.","But we're more than 50% drawn on all the funds that I mentioned. And they all have different drawdown periods and cycle. So it's a little more detail, but we are more than halfway. We are more than half drawn and when you get to 75% you should assume we'd be launching some successor funds. ","Robert Lee","Okay. Great. Fair enough. And maybe if I can, just four quick question, when you think about your own budgeting and modeling going forward and given a lot of the investments you've made in, whether it's CIPs or ETFs or just new products.","And obviously, you have made some and have talked about some kind of fee adjustments, how are you modeling changes in your kind of overall fee rate? I mean, do you kind of assume that it's going to go down 1 or 2 basis points a year or half? I mean, how do you kind of handle that internally? ","Ken Lewis","Yes. We've -- so we do the bottoms up, build of all that and then we look at the mix of assets going forward. And with the volatility this quarter, we saw a slight degradation effective fee rate. And so if you look forward for the 2019, we think that the fee rate won't change that much, it might be slightly lower than last year, but we're not getting a lot of external fee pressure on that.","So we're not budgeting some material decreases in the effective fee rate going forward. Now, of course, Benefit Street will change that for the better. But if I could give you the math for that, but without Benefit Street, we don't see significant change in effective fee rate a slight degradation in 2019 versus 2018.","Robert Lee","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks very much. Greg, maybe can you talk a little bit about the investment adviser reception to the improved performance in across a lot of different products, especially in the one-year and three-year periods? And whether that's actually impacting sales here in January and also whether that's slowing redemptions? Obviously, December was heightened redemption through the industry.","And then also on the institutional mandate side, any large one or lost mandates in the pipeline? And then do you see delayed fundings given the environment in the institutional space?","Greg Johnson","I think December, January is always a little bit tricky to get to draw too many conclusions because of the tax selling in December and then the strength that -- the historical strength in January. After that, with some retirement fundings, other money going back in the market after tax selling, I think like most in the industry, we sometimes maybe get overly encouraged by January because it looks so good compared to December.","And I think that's true again for us, and I think part of that hopefully is certainly sustainable with better performance over time and I was just looking at the chart, for us, our top 25 funds a year ago, 6% wherein above average. And this year, 78% are above other peer average.","So that's a significant shift in performance that I think, we know that. We have to get that message out and then have it flow through the three-year and five-year numbers, but I think, we are encouraged by what's happening in the market.","We said sometimes, being a predominantly as far as our mix having value side that it takes a little bit of a disruption in the market to get people thinking back, again, about value And I think the decoupling from the things is another important shift that's happened over last few months. That should help these.","So we are seeing, as I said before, I mean, I think, the Global Bond has a very strong story in this kind of marketplace. And as people become more concerned about equity valuations and things and looking for alternatives, it's just a nice fit. So we're seeing and that one tends to move a little bit faster, and say, your traditional retail value funds, which may take a little bit more time.","But clearly, I think the relative numbers give our sales force something to certainly talk about, and hopefully, we'll see that bode as I\u2019ve said, beginning January looks a lot better than December.","Brian Bedell","Right. And on the institutional side?","Greg Johnson","Yes, institutional, I haven't heard anything as far as -- I think we -- that may have been the case where you saw delays, but I haven't really heard that. And if you think of -- if you think the retracement in the market that we've had to-date, it would probably eliminate anybody from a timing standpoint. But I haven't -- that's just something I'm not aware of having a little delay there.","Q \u2013 Brian Bedell","Thank you. And then just on the capital management, Ken, I think you said, just -- I just wanted to clarify, was it $3 billion to $4 billion of what you view as net excess capital or cash? And then maybe, Greg, just to expand on your M&A comments about you talked about distribution. I guess, if you can get a little deeper in that I think you mentioned the high net worth, but is there anything else where you said you wanted to own distribution? And, I guess, how that fits in with this general trend towards open architecture that's been going on for decades?","A \u2013 Ken Lewis","Yes. So in our prepared remarks, for your question on the excess, let Greg get the moment, its $3.3 billion of liquid assets reserve to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements and capital investments in our products.","Q \u2013 Brian Bedell","Right. And so the excess capital then is you said use that word?","A \u2013 Ken Lewis","No, that's what we need. So the difference is available is opportunistic and available to us.","Q \u2013 Brian Bedell","Got it, got it, got it. Okay. ","A \u2013 Greg Johnson","Just to expand, I mean, I think it -- the world, if you look at -- and this is not a statement really for the U.S. When I look -- when I mentioned distribution, it's probably more outside of the U.S. and markets that have guided architecture-type platforms and may have ownership of four or five investment managers for those platforms, and it could be new technology platforms for fee-based advisers and countries where we may not have a significant share could be a good way to enter that market.","So those are the kind. I think it's just a change in how we would say we\u2019re -- strictly think of ourselves as an impending pure asset manager and open architecture world. We do see more guided architecture in certain markets and the strength of banks in certain markets and bank may for regulatory reasons, spinning out there distribution and things like that, that I would say we are open to looking at that.","Where in the past, we have may have said hey, we're a pure independent asset manager. That's not something we want to do and fiduciary trust is a very successful high network manager that we think could be bigger and more meaningful to our bottom line. It's something that we want to grow and something that we\u2019ve talked about. We disbelieve in the value of advice and that would be another area that would be on that list.","A \u2013 Ken Lewis","But just like alternatives, real estate, all of the things are on that list too.","Q \u2013 Brian Bedell","Great, okay, that\u2019s clear. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Q \u2013 Alex Blostein","Hey guys, just a couple of clarifications at this point. So when I look at our expense guidance again for fiscal 2019, does that include any sort of kind of severance restructuring charges that are going to be associated with the cost savings plan? And any help that kind of help us break out the actual dollar amount of kind of a run rate expenses that you expect to take out and kind of restructuring cost that will be associated with that?","A \u2013 Ken Lewis","Yes, so the guidance does not include any severance or execution cost related to cost reductions, simply because we don't know about that is right now. So that's when we talk to you next quarter, we will be able to give you a better idea for that even by line item for the rest of the year. But that's going to be.","We do expect all of that to be incurred in this fiscal year and not bleed in to 2020. And so, it will probably start out slowly next quarter, gradually build with the bulk of it, probably being in the fourth quarter. And then, in terms of the number, I think, of savings we're looking to get it, like we said, at or below 2018 levels without regard to Benefit Street. ","Alex Blostein","Got it, okay. And then just a clarification, again, another one on cash and kind of the requirements that you guys have between working capital, regulatory, et cetera. Do you include the upcoming payment to Benefit Street, which I think was $683 million within that or that would be on top? So I know you guys don't like talking about the excess cash, but would that be effectively a reduction to that number?","Ken Lewis","No, that's in there. ","Alex Blostein","That's in there. Got it. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next questions are from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. ","Brennan Hawken","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple left here at this point. Can you -- I know you spoke to the core trends that you expect in fee rate, but could you please quantify performance fees this quarter just so we can try to calibrate at least where we're starting off from our core fee rate basis?","And then post ESP deal, it seems as though performance fees are going to be substantially larger. Is that going to lead you to actually break that out as a line item, so that we can have greater clarity and maybe avoid some of the noise that might flow into the numbers?","Ken Lewis","Sure. So you're quarter-over-quarter delta for performance fees is about $4 million. And so last quarter, they were about $4 million higher than this quarter. And I think if I remember, last quarter they're about $6 million, this quarter they're about $2 million. And then going forward, yes, you're right. We do expect performance fees to be higher.","We haven't made a decision on how we will present that, but for sure, we will call it out. We will call it out in the prepared remarks. In terms of the geography, the income statement, we haven't decided what to do there. Kind of waiting to see what the magnitude is, but for sure we'll call all of that out.","Brennan Hawken","Okay.","Greg Johnson","That\u2019s good point, some thing we're going to look at, just like we're going to look at the other income line and look at the mark-to-market effect of the investments we hold, and because that can be a little bit noisy quarter-to-quarter, too.","Brennan Hawken","Sure, that's fair. Thanks. And then, just curious about -- on the accretion expectations. I know you said you don't think that there's going to be much change, and also fully appreciating that the comments about the BSP funds not really being marked as we see with some of these other alternatives. Certainly, attention being drawn to leverage lending and other similar types of lending activities, which even though explicit leverage on, it is just part of what BSP does, a lot of the other lending activities are very, very similar in structure, et cetera.","So for example, the Fed SNC review, leverage lending was like three-quarters of non-accrual lending, and almost 90% of substandard commitments. And there's been a lot of significant risk flagged in these loans. I know you see the recent volatility as an opportunity. But is there still an assumption of credit losses remaining at zero in your accretion, when you think about if that turns out to be too optimistic and credit losses go up in these products, how much does that impact fundraising and how much could that impact outlook for accretion from this deal? Thanks.","Ken Lewis","Well, we are assuming -- I mean, let the Benefit Street guys talk about the risks in the portfolios, but we are assuming very low -- consistent with historic results, very low default rates in our accretion analysis.","Greg Johnson","And I would say, I mean, those are all fair concerns and comments and once we had well before the fourth quarter. And as we look at this business and we\u2019re late in the economic cycle and credit spreads were narrow.","And I think -- we think -- again, we would say this is an asset class that's here to stay. I think that having the dry capital puts you on the right side of the trade, when other vehicles are forced to sell and have to continue to markdown. Those are the kind of things we got comfortable with.","I think from fundraising, it's very hard to give you any kind of sense of what that means. I mean, yes, it's going to be harder in an environment where spreads are rising and there's defaults out there and credit issues, that's clear. But I think that our commitment is to the asset class long-term.","And the fact that Benefit Street has come into that with sites wide open as far as being one of the first lien side and more senior-secured. And we know the arguments on that, that there's less junior and recovery rates going to be lower. But that's all \u2013 that\u2019s I think we feel like we are in the right place in a growing market and I'll let Rich take it from there. ","Rich Byrne","Thanks, Greg. I think you and Ken hit most of the key points. I guess, I would just add a few things. One, I think as the question unfolded, you talked a little bit about marks. Just to be clear, we mark all of -- and I assume, we're mostly talking about private debt here. We mark our private debt assets quarterly. Those are real marks, this is not -- there maybe a lag affect sometimes, but on a quarterly basis, we feel very comfortable that the book is marked appropriately by third-party evaluation firms.","Greg mentioned, we're generally at the top of the capital structure. The correction in the markets and the drawdown in the S&P and outflows was really a technical correction, it really -- we haven't seen any material energy.","There were some issues, of course with oil prices. But we haven't seen a material change in or termination in credit quality across the book. There\u2019s always going to be defaults. We have been very fortunate to be running at very low default rate historically.","Of course, we are going to always model something greater than 0 in our books. But nothing that's happened in the fourth quarter has led us to materially change our assumptions around defaults or recovery rates. And we think all of our books are marked appropriately. ","Brennan Hawken","Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next questions are from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. ","Chris Harris","Okay. Thanks. The earlier commentary about M&A and possibly investing in distribution, how do you guys think about the conflicts that might arise as a result of a deal like that? ","Greg Johnson","Well, I think that's why I said that, I don't envision this in the U.S. certainly where you'd have a conflict. But I think, the world has changed considerably where it doesn't -- in the old days, the thought of having anything direct to our consumer, you could never do if your business was sold through advisors. And today in the fee-based world where you're competing with Vanguard and conditional direct marketers, it's really just you've go to make sure, you got best of class funds with very strong track record and that's going to get you your distribution.","So I don't think the conflict is big, although I would say I don't envision us doing anything in the states that would own distribution. I think it's more, we look at markets that have become more closed and guided and you look at the Canada that has a very -- has closed market as far as distribution goes, or more closed than most and Europe, which is trending that way too.","We are seeing countries like Italy and others where distribution has co-owners that could be fun sponsors. So those are just the things we\u2019re looking at. And I think it's just a change in how we would view our traditional mission and mandate of being independent, one that in certain markets it may makes sense to tie up in places like Latin America where banks dominate the markets\u2026","Ken Lewis","And India.","Greg Johnson","India, there\u2019s just a lot I think of places around the world, outside the U.S. where it may make sense long-term to do that. I think that's just a different thinking as far as how we would approach M&A in the past.","Chris Harris","Okay, that makes perfect sense. And then just one follow-up question I had was on your investment performance. Obviously, good thing to see things trending in the right direction there. I know it might be difficult to generalize, but when you look at across your asset classes, the numbers in tax free fixed income and U.S. fixed income probably a little bit still below where guys would like to see them. What is driving that at this point? Is that kind of like a duration thing perhaps?","Ken Lewis","Yeah. I think it -- so few things. I think we tend -- that's the one area where we don't worry as much about your total return ranking. I mean, we want to be in the middle because we run those funds. We want to make sure we\u2019re providing some of the highest tax fee income out there, and have a stable net asset value. It's kind of how we think about it. And that's important in how we sell those.","I think as far as the makeup over the last few years and why we've underperformed would be we were on the higher end of credit quality and the lower credit in munis tended to do a bit better. Although, we saw that reverse in the fourth quarter where many of our funds had very strong performance with stronger credit compared to others and duration, we don't really switch. And we were on the lower end of duration because of predefined bonds.","And again, how we think about running this as more for stability and high income and trying to make duration bets, and have a dividend that goes up and down from those duration bets. We think that's what people really want. So I don't -- we don't worry as much below or above average in that categories, we do certainly in equities. We want to make sure that the funds are stable in all types of markets and provide that high occurring income.","Chris Harris","Great. Thank you.","Ken Lewis","Thanks.","Operator","And next questions are from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.","Michael Cyprys","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to circle back, Greg, to your comment earlier on fees and pricing. You mentioned modifying pricing on some products. Can you just talk about your approach to that in terms of modifying pricing, your expectations there? Where have you modified? How that's played now to the expectations? And is this more about grow sales or looking to stem redemptions, how are you approaching that -- thinking about? Thank you.","Greg Johnson","Yes, I mean I think it's just recognizing that being on a high-end of a fee if you're fourth quartile and fees and have top performance, you're not going to get shelf space in a -- in the new fee-based world.","So, I think you have to look at how are we positioned against the universe and we have to be at least competitive on the fee side. So, we've made a series of modifications in a lot of different products. I mean they are not dramatic shifts, but we've lowered fees on our international equity funds, we have lowered fees on limited duration fixed income funds. We've changed payouts to be more competitive on -- for those that are still using the brokerage side, reallowance and things. I just think all of that affects your margin, but that's reality of where we need to be.","And then I mentioned that we -- I think -- we're excited about these 11 new models that -- the outcome-oriented growth income that combine a lot of our traditional funds with some lower fee mixes and then gets you to a more competitive overall fee. And that -- we think that is very attractive in this market as well.","So, I think it's just the recognition that it's not just a world where certainly the buyer or the consultant or the gatekeeper is looking just at your total return. They're looking at where you're positioned in fees. So, we have to -- and I think the good news is that we are always on the lower end of that equation. So, don't feel like we have a huge amount of changes ahead, but we continue to -- I sit there and I sit with our group and will look at every fund on a regular basis and go down and see where it's positioned. And we obviously do that with the Boards as well.","But it just reflects the nature of the forces that all of us are dealing with in industry, but as Ken said, I think at the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t really have a material effect on our overall effective fee rate and what's going to affect that next year if emerging markets or international equities or equities are up, that's going to have a much greater effect on our effective fee rate than any tinkering by individual funds.","Michael Cyprys","Got it, okay. And just as a follow-up question maybe more broadly on credit cycle and liquidity, some concerns around there around buildup and leverage by corporates with a larger portion going to daily liquidity funds, high yield bond funds, loan funds, et cetera. Can you just talk about what actions you're taking to mitigate any such risks in your daily redeemable funds?","Greg Johnson","Yes, I mean, I think it is a concern and certain -- obviously, many academic papers, many journalists have covered this that liquidity in certain markets -- senior-secured debt market and floating rate and things like that, you do need to be careful about. So, I think, like most, we look at liquidity and make sure that we feel comfortable and we stress test these things and don't want to be in a position where you're force-selling into a market that doesn't have a lot of buyers.","But, again, that's not an area where we have a lot of assets. So, -- and why we think benefit Street structure that is more like a private equity structure can be I think a very effective way to benefit from that dislocation in liquidity with funds on -- that are daily liquid funds.","So I just don't think it's a category for us that there's a lot of assets where we would say that's a concern, I mean, we have some funds in those areas, but not \u2013 they are just not significant as far as size.","Michael Cyprys","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just one more on M&A, maybe a longer-term view, I know, Ken, you mentioned you do want to preserve dry powder for potential future opportunities, especially if the markets get tough. So if \u2013 we are late cycle and if we do move into a bear market and recession period for a prolonged period over the next even two to three years, I mean, Greg, how do you think about large scale M&A where there would be a lot of product rationalization involved and the lost of cost-cutting. And it typically those deals are hard to execute well, and that's my manager's kind of shy away from them. But if we do have even a much tougher environment both from a market level perspective and industry-wide organic growth perspective, do you see those deals starting to form and would you be interested in engaging in something like that?","Greg Johnson","Well, I think we never say never, and if we think it can add shareholder value by efficiencies and synergies and costs that's certainly something we're going to look at. But I think you hit it on the head. The execution it is very challenging. It's very disruptive and very time-consuming for management to do that. And it's also a question of the brand and how much you can throw on distribution and get those synergies. So I think it's more of the smaller media managers that will be bought versus the bigger managers that are going to combine that's where the difficulties lie and if you're not on it, smaller group that relies on a narrow distribution platform and that goes to fee-based and all of sudden you're not on that platform. Those are the ones that you will probably see moving with larger firms and you're able to benefit by getting different styles and management teams in there. I think the larger ones are very difficult, they look good on paper, but the execution side is just challenging as you said.","Brian Bedell","And then maybe just going back to your alternatives comment with BSP, I guess, thinking about that, down the road as well as is there a shift into your alternatives assets in a more meaningful way, something desirable for you or rather just continue to be opportunistic around the edge of it?","Greg Johnson","No, I think it is. We stated it's a priority for us to grow that business. And I think the strength and depth of the BSP senior team and access that we think really accelerates that by having somebody like Tom Gahan his senior team involved and looking at the landscape of alternatives, along with our K2 Group that \u2013 I believe will be very helpful in is looking at other opportunities in that area and none of these are vulnerable to the passive shifts in pricing wars that we're seeing on the traditional model.","Brian Bedell","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Greg Johnson","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We reach the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any closing comments.","Greg Johnson","Well, thank you, everyone, for participating on the call, and we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation."],"10311":["Franklin Resources Inc.

My name is Kevin, and I will be your call operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin.","Gregory Johnson","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me as usual is Ken Lewis, our CFO. And you may be able to tell by my voice that I\u2019m recovering from that flu, so I have asked Jed Plafker, who heads up our distribution, if there\u2019s any questions around flows. And we also have Gwen Shaneyfelt, who is our Senior Vice President of Global Accounting and Tax to get into any specific questions around the tax reform.","Today, we reported first quarter results that included a $1.1 billion charge related to the recently passed tax reform. Hopefully, you had a chance to review the commentary we provided earlier today, which outlines the details of the charge and our expectation for taxes going forward.","We\u2019re excited by the options created by corporate tax reform and are currently discussing how we can best serve all stakeholders. These options include committing resources to further develop our financial technologies and investment data science expertise; obviously M&A activity; investing to optimize our global distribution efforts; and introducing and seeding new products and services. We also plan to make investments that directly benefit employees and the communities where they do business.","Another exciting recent announcement is, we reached an agreement to acquire Edinburgh Partners Limited, an established global value manager.","Now, I would like to open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Now we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Carrier","All right. Thanks, guys. Greg, you mentioned some of the priorities from the tax benefits and what you\u2019re thinking about? Just wanted to maybe shed a little bit more color on that, when we think about the $9 billion-plus cash and investments, how are you guys thinking going forward on what you need to retain on the balance sheet, whether it\u2019s for operational purposes, regulatory purposes? And then how much is excess? And then of that excess, some of the things that you mentioned whether it\u2019s investments, capital return, what\u2019s the timing on that in terms of making some of those decisions of what to do with the excess?","Gregory Johnson","Well, I think, the timing is really a function of what the Board decides to do. I mean, I think, ultimately, we are putting together various options. And I think, at the end of the day, we will always err on the conservative side of capital management, because we feel it can be very strategic in the long-term to have that flexibility on whatever comes up in any kind of market condition. And we also find that, there\u2019s a value from our \u2013 from investors that are in our funds and separate accounts that the rating on the company. It\u2019s important to have that strength of the balance sheet.","So, that will be built into whatever cushion that we look at. And we\u2019re really in the process of doing that today to kind of figure out looking at all the levers what makes the most sense. We\u2019ve gone out to institutional holders and try to get as much feedback as possible in this process and we encourage any feedback directly to our team as well. But it\u2019s really too early and we\u2019re careful about setting any expectation around that. But I think, there will be some, obviously, more information forthcoming certainly after our next Board meeting.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks. And then sort of a follow-up on maybe organic growth side. You mentioned in the commentary some adds to platforms during the quarter. Just wanted to maybe get a little bit more color on that. And then on the flip side, just given the short-term performance that\u2019s under some pressure, how are clients reacting to that? And I know some of the products relative to some of the benchmarks or the categories that you\u2019re in, there are some nuances there. But just a little color in terms of the platform adds, how that might be a benefit versus the performance being a headwind?","Gregory Johnson","Yes. I mean, I think the point was that, one of the things that we\u2019ve done is continue to build out the consultant part of the distribution effort on the retail side. And that\u2019s so important in communicating what our fund is doing and its risk attribution performance, all those things. And you really \u2013 as we\u2019ve said before, I mean, it\u2019s like a funnel with fee-based. You\u2019ll have \u2013 you had a world, where everything was on the brokerage platform to take. Today, where there maybe 30% of those funds on a given platform.","So every \u2013 anytime you have funds that get added specifically to platforms now that that could be a style, it\u2019s out of favor. It doesn\u2019t mean, you\u2019re going to get an immediate flow into a value-based global fund. But it means, one, you\u2019ll do a better job of retaining assets; and two, when the market turns, you have an ability to capture new organic growth where you wouldn\u2019t in the past. I\u2019ll ask Jed, if he has anything specific he wants to add.","Jed Plafker","Yes, I think, that\u2019s right. I mean, on the fee-based side, we\u2019re seeing now about 75% of the sales go to fee-based, which is almost double what it was seven or eight years ago. And so whereas we\u2019ve been on platforms in the cushion base, we\u2019re adding our funds and strategies to the fee-based side. We build up the team to meet with those research and gatekeepers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Fannon","Thanks. Good morning. I guess, one of the \u2013 I want to talk about M&A, because one of the options for the corporate tax reform was not M&A. And so just thinking about the \u2013 I know, you\u2019ve announced the transaction here recently. But now with more proceeds and more cash available like, how you\u2019re thinking about it on a longer-term basis?","Gregory Johnson","Well, I think, we\u2019ve always been \u2013 we always think about it. I think, the difference probably today is that that everything is fairly equal as we look at the world. You \u2013 in the past, if it was captive offshore cash and before any tax reform, you may have had a bias to try to do something outside the U.S. I think, today, the U.S., it\u2019s all fungible cash around the world.","So we would look openly to opportunities as much here in the U.S. as abroad. I think that that whether \u2013 so as I guess, the net-net would be, you have a opportunity to do a larger acquisition in the U.S. than you did in the past, that would be the only real change, I think, as far as how we look at the M&A landscape.","Daniel Fannon","But it\u2019s safe to say it\u2019s not one of your priorities as you think about the next 12 months or kind of on a more near-term basis?","Gregory Johnson","Yes, I think, it\u2019s a priority as far as having the financial wherewithal and balance strength to do that at any given time. So that\u2019s part of how we\u2019re going to look at capital going forward. But it doesn\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t feel any urgency to do a deal, because of tax reform.","Daniel Fannon","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Kenneth Worthington","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I apologize if I missed the obvious question here or the obvious answer. How much do you anticipate repatriating at this point, given where your cash balances are and the nuances of the law?","And then is it possible given that you\u2019ve been waiting for repatriation for probably, at least, a decade and have been thinking a lot about it. And even with Trump being elected, I think, you guys were anticipating repatriation being one of its changes. So can you give us maybe an estimate or at least a direction in terms of what you think will make it into a dividend versus what makes it back into a buyback versus what makes it into just investments in the business. How are you \u2013 how do you gauge the level of each of those with the money that you bring back? Thanks.","Kenneth Lewis","That is \u2013 those are exactly the questions that Greg was referring to earlier that we\u2019re discussing with the Board. I think to the first question, we talked about what we viewed is excess cash before in the neighborhood of $5 billion to $6 billion. What we do about is, the first priority is to invest in the long-term success of the company. What that means, it could mean a M&A, but also we\u2019re always \u2013 we\u2019re going to continue our history of being shareholder friendly.","So the tax law is the month old, discussions are ongoing. We\u2019re going to be as transparent with the investors as possible. But it\u2019s probably going to take us a couple of months to work through all those questions.","Kenneth Worthington","Okay. So no even feel for what might make it into dividend versus buyback? Is one a more obvious answer than the other would it be equal? Does one come more quickly?","Gregory Johnson","No, I think, that that\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s a decision first of all that the Board makes and so which haven\u2019t had the opportunity to have those conversations with the Board.","Kenneth Lewis","And I just think it\u2019s \u2013 to speculate on what that \u2013 or what that would look like at this stage, I think, we don\u2019t want to create any expectation out there before we really vetted it and had Board approval. So, I think, you\u2019re right. All of those are the obvious levers and we will come back, but we certainly don\u2019t want anything out there right now that states the plan as to do X one. We have to get that plan approved by our Board.","Kenneth Worthington","Okay. And I guess, just you had discussed investing back into the business and you gave some, I think, some higher-level themes that you were considering with some of the repatriation windfall. Any chance you could flush those out a little bit more here?","Gregory Johnson","I think, the first priority as always is to improve and deliver good performance of the fund. So we have made some investments in improving our capabilities in the investing area in solutions. We invested \u2013 we\u2019ve been investing in technology. We\u2019re investing in also distribution, the changing distribution landscape and getting smart investing in technology in that and new products.","So it\u2019s \u2013 and marketing, so it\u2019s kind of \u2013 the list we\u2019ve gone through in the past all the strategic initiatives that we\u2019ve gone through, there\u2019s no change to that. But I mean, you want to add anything on the distribution side that we\u2019re investing in\u2026","Jed Plafker","Yes. Sure, sure. We\u2019re adding a fair amount of resources in a few different areas, one, on the institutional side in the U.S. Greg mentioned, consultant relations on the client service team, as well as sales. We\u2019re building out the strategic relationship team, which is on the group responsible for getting funds on platforms.","We\u2019re adding people to our sales team. We\u2019re rolling out more of a channel-centric model for some of the broker-dealers, and so we\u2019re adding people in that area. So I think that there\u2019s a fair number of resources on the distribution side.","Kenneth Lewis","And also in alternatives and solutions.","Gregory Johnson","And I would say, just on the capital side one thing that we\u2019ve been expanding on too is just using our balance sheet to invest directly in companies and forming funds in areas like industrial tech and we have another one that\u2019s an AI and FinTech specialized area, too. And part of this is just strategic for us to stand in the forefront of those developments and part of it is to also build out within alternatives a capability within private equity and venture in that area. So that would be the use of capital.","Kenneth Worthington","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Brennan Hawken","Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. A quick one following up on Ken\u2019s question, is debt pay down one potential use of the funds that you guys are considering as well beyond the previous priorities that you mentioned?","Kenneth Lewis","Yes, absolutely, as of the tax charges payable over the next two years, so those definitely come into the equation.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, terrific. And then is there \u2013 just thinking about maybe potentially framing possible investments, could you give us an idea about how much expense uplift was driven by those types of investments that you guys have made recently just so we can maybe keep that into context and consider possible alternatives?","Gregory Johnson","Sure. I think, when we talk \u2013 when we spoke last, we had just finished our budget. And our estimate at that time was that, those kind of \u2013 the laundry list that I gave you was going to probably increase expenses year-over-year by about 5% to 6%, and I think we\u2019re still on track with that guidance.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, perfect. And then just making one more here, you had mentioned tied to your expense outlook for the year that Edin \u2013 that would be beyond Edinburgh. How should we think about what Edinburgh will add from revenue and expense perspectives?","Gregory Johnson","I think, we\u2019ll be in a better position to give you kind of specific line items maybe the next time that we get together. But generally, it\u2019s \u2013 from a cash flow perspective, it\u2019s accretive, from a GAAP perspective, it might be slightly dilutive, but not materially so\u2026","Brennan Hawken","Thanks for all the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bill Katz from Citigroup. Your line is now live.","William Katz","Okay. Thank you. Greg, I feel you\u2019re flu pain, may be that will be the reason for my question here. But I\u2019m still a little foggy on your priorities for this capital management. I\u2019ve heard you wrote certain things in your prerecorded commentary with a supplement and both you and Ken sort of ticked off a couple different things.","Could you just, again, prioritize where you sort of think the waterfall for these priorities are? And I guess, within that, when is the Board meeting? Because I think the market is a little surprised that we don\u2019t have news today. And so I\u2019m just trying to understand like, what is going to change in the next x days as we think about that priority list?","Gregory Johnson","Bill, well, if you\u2019re foggy, we\u2019ve done a good job in communicating the plan at this stage because, again, I just think you don\u2019t really want to get in front of something that\u2019s important like this. And you have \u2013 as you know, you have all the levers in place. You\u2019ve got your buyback policy. You\u2019ve got your dividend policy. You\u2019ve got special dividend policies. You\u2019ve got \u2013 determined what is the appropriate level, and that\u2019s a big discussion that has to take place that we\u2019re all comfortable with. And we continue to seek input from as many stakeholders as possible. There\u2019s a lot of different views on what we should do.","So I think, rather, there\u2019s no rush here to say to the market that we\u2019re going to do x tomorrow. I think you do want to be thoughtful and come back with something that we think makes sense and represents the best interest of all stakeholders. So I think, unfortunately, we don\u2019t really want to communicate any priority of all of those things until we\u2019ve had a real chance to vet that appropriately.","William Katz","And then just a clarification. Of the cap \u2013 of the cash that sits on the balance sheet now, the $9 billion, in your recent K, I think, about $3 billion of that is sort of earmarked for operational purposes, et cetera. Is that still the right number? Ken may have said it, I apologize if I missed that number. I\u2019m just trying to think about that incremental number relative to maybe the $6.5 billion that you had mentioned last quarter as sort of net available with this tax reform?","Kenneth Lewis","Yes. But \u2013 that could be a little bit on the high side, but that is in the ballpark. If you factor in also longer-term debt repayments and the tax charge that I mentioned, it\u2019s probably a little lower than that.","William Katz","Okay, all right. And then just a follow-up question, a little more tactical, maybe to get off the capital management discussion, you recently launched the ETF business a bit of a passive approach to it. Can you give us a sense of where the AUM stand and what some of the net sales have been so far and how you sort of think about where the incremental levers are to grow that part of the business?","Gregory Johnson","Well, I think the overall assets are around $1.2 billion. I mean, we just introduced them. I think our feeling is that if you\u2019re going to be a significant player in the ETF business, passive is obviously going to be very important, and we view this as kind of the last available space to do that by having lower costs, country-specific and regional global funds available.","So it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s only been out really a very short period. You didn\u2019t see a lot of movement at year-end because of the tax consequences of doing that. And so to date, very \u2013 as expected, some flows, but nothing significant, and we\u2019re just really in the process of going out and getting that message out there that\u2019s available.","And I think the point in those categories is that, there\u2019s already significant funds with much higher expense ratios. So we think that part of that should take care of itself. And while it\u2019s not going to have a large impact on the revenue side of it, I think, it\u2019s important on just the flow and building the brand within the ETF space.","William Katz","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Gregory Johnson","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Blostein","Hey, guys, good morning.","Gregory Johnson","Good morning, Alex.","Alexander Blostein","A couple of quick clarifications, I guess. So Ken, back to the expense discussion, when you talk about the previous guidance, I think, it was 3% to 5% growth, sounds like you guys will be 5% to 6% growth in expenses ex-distribution. But when you think about some of the incremental initiatives for growth that you\u2019ve highlighted, whether it\u2019s tech or investment in data, et cetera, is that inclusive in this, call it, 5% to 6% growth or that could be on top of that once you guys make all the decisions about capital and what \u2013 how you\u2019re going to spend the money?","Gregory Johnson","That is inclusive of all of the items that we talked about that are known and we decided to do. So I think, we\u2019re still pretty comfortable of that 5% to 6% expense growth, excluding underwriting distribution is inclusive of all the initiatives that we mentioned. And if we come up with future initiatives with costs, we\u2019ll be transparent with that as well.","Alexander Blostein","Got it. And that could be on the back of the discussions with use of capital from the tax reform?","Gregory Johnson","Correct.","Alexander Blostein","Yep, okay. And then in the press release you guys \u2013 when you went through the number of different things that you could use the excess cash for, you highlighted optimizing global distribution efforts, and I wasn\u2019t 100% clear what you guys meant by that. So maybe flesh that out a little bit. And just any sort of implications when \u2013 if you think about that on how you are selling the product, any incremental focus on one region versus the other, that will be helpful?","Jed Plafker","Sure. In addition to the resources we\u2019d talked about on the U.S. side, we\u2019re also increasing our spend on advertising, both on the traditional side as well as on the ETFs, as Greg mentioned. So that that\u2019s certainly an increase.","Alexander Blostein","So it\u2019s not really like moving people around geographically, this is literally just investing into distribution?","Jed Plafker","Right. I think, there\u2019s some additional resources included in our kind of expanding the international distribution function as well, just the increased headcount.","Alexander Blostein","Got it. Great. All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks, guys. Good morning.","Gregory Johnson","Good morning.","Craig Siegenthaler","The $1.1 billion tax charge, when you changed the territorial system, just want to \u2013 how was it calculated, because it\u2019s a huge number?","Kenneth Lewis","Okay. This might take up the rest of the call. It is calculated based on our accumulated earnings that haven\u2019t been repatriated that we disclosed in the K. But this is going to be a good opportunity for us to let Gwen have a chance at the mike.","Gwen Shaneyfelt","Right. So, Ken, you\u2019re exactly right. So basically, we look at what earnings we have yet to repatriate and we do the calculation. Really, you have to add back kind of the deemed \u2013 the taxes that you\u2019ve deemed paid in the foreign jurisdiction to come up with a number and multiply it times the rate. Take credit for those taxes and that\u2019s what comes out to that $1.1 billion number.","Also, obviously included in there is some \u2013 there\u2019s a 1.12, which talks about the potential for state taxes on those. So we have included certain states that don\u2019t follow federal automatically. We may have to pay some state tax on those dollars, we bring back as well.","Craig Siegenthaler","Got it. Okay. And then just on a second subject. I saw that China and also India had good sales momentum in the quarter. What\u2019s driving that? And maybe also, what products are seeing better demand there, too?","Jed Plafker","Yes, that\u2019s \u2013 so that\u2019s accurate. So in India, it\u2019s \u2013 all of our local \u2013 locally managed funds, both equity and fixed. We\u2019ve had strong performance on both sides and we\u2019ve had good sales there. In China, it\u2019s really Greater China. So for us, that includes Taiwan and we\u2019ve seen a huge surge in some of the global macro funds. In particular, emerging market bond has been a big fund of interest in Taiwan.","And maybe just to mention in China, we recently upgraded our license in Shanghai. And the rules are changing in China on the ownership that you can have as a joint venture partner, which hasn\u2019t been released yet just the actual rules. But we expect that that\u2019s going to be a big market for us going forward.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Glenn Schorr","Hello, there. Thanks. Just a quick question on the retail fixed income side. In periods of rising rates in the past, I think, the retail investment had been a little bit more emotional. We just had a 19% lift in the equity market in the U.S. and not much at all, if not a little negative in fixed income. Just curious if you\u2019ve seen any reaction yet through January and as people get statements and what you\u2019re thinking on that front going forward?","Gregory Johnson","Well, I don\u2019t think the uptick at this stage has been dramatic enough to change. I think, you are certainly getting more headlines on the risk. I think, the \u2013 probably the drop in the munis could be for other reasons. High yield doesn\u2019t appear to be as long as the economy is strong there, they\u2019re less sensitive to duration. So we don\u2019t really have huge exposure to duration risk. If you look at even the global bond fund, which is \u2013 or the global macro, the largest category, that has a flat to negative duration in that fund.","So, we hope in a rising rate environment, that could be a very strong story within fixed income. The other \u2013 I think, just from a behavioral standpoint, the difference of fixed income and equity markets is when the equity markets drop and fear comes in, it\u2019s hard to get people back in.","Fixed income, remember, somebody was on the sidelines because of where rates are and they back up suddenly look at the equity market and say, gee, now it\u2019s a good time. They backed up 100 basis points, 200 basis points.","So you attract new buyers. You attract certainly people locking in liabilities as rates go up as well. So there\u2019s always a demand despite a rising rate environment even within the retail side, I find. I think, we found that historically.","Glenn Schorr","I very much appreciate that. Thank you. Just one follow-up. So I\u2019m just curious, we \u2013 I think we\u2019ve \u2013 on this call, we\u2019ve revisit this several quarters ago. But I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re managing through the shifting landscape in broker-dealer land as we move from commission to fee-based. Historically, you\u2019ve had a good chunk of your assets on the commission side. I just don\u2019t know how you physically manage what you can do to influence that behavior in the channel?","Gregory Johnson","Well, I mean, I\u2019ll start. I think the \u2013 and then maybe have maybe Jed jump in. But it does require a very different approach to how you sell. And I think, we have to \u2013 a very small portion out going into the traditional front-end sales charge brokerage account. And a gatekeeper is controlling what\u2019s available. And also what\u2019s available sometimes is put into a plan already for advisers to sell, I mean, as they recommend various buckets and pockets and move back and forth.","So, the good news is, if you get shelf space, you\u2019ve got bigger opportunity. The bad news is a third or 40% of your funds may get on that shelf from before. So I think the net-net effect is, one, you\u2019ll see more mergers and consolidation of funds that may not be well positioned in a fee-based plan; and two, you\u2019ve had to add resources at an institutional level to have the right kind of people and consultants representing your funds to those platforms.","So those have been the big changes as well as really retraining your sales force to not talk about a story and a fund, but talk about how a fund fits into a plan. I think, that\u2019s a very different tact and one that we\u2019ve spent the last, probably five years working on. Jed, add anything?","Jed Plafker","Yes. No, that\u2019s right. I mean, you have to adapt obviously, especially in your service model. So on the fee-based side, performance is obviously going to be a big issue, but past that, it\u2019s helping advisers construct their portfolios for their clients. And so we\u2019re doing a lot of work on portfolio construction and portfolio construction tools and working with advisers to look at our strategies and products and how they fit into meet the client\u2019s goals. So as Greg mentioned, there\u2019s a lot of retraining and training going on upscaling of \u2013 and repositioning people, but still a good opportunity, I think.","Gregory Johnson","And I think, the other is just making sure your \u2013 one thing is performance and other is fees, and the fee pressure from the \u2013 on the fee-based side is greater than ever as one of the attributes of any funds going to get on that platform. So we continue to look at any funds that may not be competitive on a fee basis and we\u2019ll recommend reducing those, I think, that\u2019s an outcome as well.","Glenn Schorr","All right. Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank Your. Our next question is coming from Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is now live.","Robert Lee","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Perhaps my first question, I mean, maybe a little bit of a technical question around taxes. But I think, your guidance for 2018 for your new tax rate, I guess, I think, it was 24% to 25%, I believe. Since technically speaking, your fiscal 2018 includes one quarter of \u2013 at a higher rate, am I understanding this correctly? So that 24% to 25% kind of a blended rate \u2013 a little bit of a blended rate that the kind of core rate going forward is actually a little lower?","Gwen Shaneyfelt","Yes, that\u2019s right. It is a blended rate that on a pure statutory basis 24.5% applies to our year that\u2019s how it works for fiscal year tax payers. Next year, the rate that will apply on a statutory basis will be 21%. So obviously, we would expect for FY 2019, the rates go down.","Robert Lee","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe moving away from taxes a little bit, I\u2019m just curious with Edinburgh partners that its Founder and CEO is also going to become the Head of the Global Equity Group at Templeton. But presumably, their investment process is pretty similar to what Templeton does currently. How are you thinking about the integration of the two? And is there kind of any thought or concern that gee, this leads to some, let\u2019s call it, asset breakage, if you will, in Templeton or elsewhere just as you kind of change up leadership there?","Gregory Johnson","Yes. I mean, I think, first, if you look at their distribution channels and where their shareholders are, there really is not any overlap. So we see it as adding distribution certainly UK side, as well as they\u2019ve had very strong sub-advisory business here in the States without a big retail presence at all.","So I think, they are complimentary as far as international value. They do have distinct styles that both are value-oriented, but both are distinct and some similarities obviously. But one that we view it as adding more value options at time when they\u2019re out of favor. And as value investors, we think it\u2019s a good time to add to our portfolio of value.","And I think, the other is just somebody that we respect a lot to bring back under the Franklin Templeton roof, Sandy Nairn, who is highly respected in the industry, a real thought leader can just \u2013 can increase the profile overall of value and global equities for us and be good just another eyes and ears on what we\u2019re doing on both sides.","So for today, there are going to be two independent brands and they\u2019re really sold through different channels. And we\u2019ll kind of figure out where there\u2019s any synergies or any new channels we could add. But for today, we don\u2019t, for example, compete in the sub-advisory channel, and some of that\u2019s due to fee issues with 40 Act funds in the States, where we can do that here with somebody who doesn\u2019t have that potential conflicts.","So I think, there\u2019s clearly immediate benefits from a distribution side of having more value equity records that are sold in different channels.","Robert Lee","Great. And if I could maybe just one follow-up, going back to really maybe follow-up to Glenn\u2019s question earlier. You think about kind of the intermediary channels, I mean, clearly, the SMA side of the business and their fee-based products in one place there\u2019s been some reasonably good demand at some of your peers and that\u2019s a product set that, I don\u2019t know I think you guys have always \u2013 my perception has always been as big and maybe some of your strategies don\u2019t lend themselves to the SMAs directly global bond or equity income. But can you update us on kind of your initiatives or how you\u2019re thinking about building more capabilities in that that product line to maybe kind of try to tap into some of those opportunities?","Jed Plafker","Yes. No, that\u2019s \u2013 it is an area that we are actually looking at right now and looking to add some strategies in that area and some relationships. So it probably is an area that over the past few years has been growing and we haven\u2019t been necessarily growing with it and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at actively.","Gregory Johnson","And I think, the other is just, it was always \u2013 I think, the portfolio management tools and technology are a lot better to compete in that wherein in the past it was cumbersome for the PMs and then pricing differentials, too, were a little tricky. So, I think, you\u2019re right. That\u2019s an area that is \u2013 will continue to grow. And the potential for tax efficiency within the SMA customized portfolios, I think, is another one that we are clearly looking at today that we can do in those type of accounts.","Robert Lee","Great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Gregory Johnson","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Harris","Yes. Hey, guys. If we get a uniform fiduciary standard out of the SEC, do you think that could represent another risk for industry flows and your flows in particular?","Gregory Johnson","No, I don\u2019t. I mean, I think, the \u2013 a standard that that\u2019s the appropriate place to have a standard for the industry. And I think, it will be a more workable standard and probably one that that brokerage can coexist with fee-based. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get any worse by having a common standard.","But I think, the point that many of the major distributors have already gone down the path of adopting a fiduciary standard, we\u2019re with some of our distributors putting out share classes that do just that for them specifically. So I think, it to sit there and think, it\u2019s going to go back to the old way, it is not a fee-based, is the future in many cases and will be the dominant area.","But I think, with the new rule, brokerage can survive and it doesn\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m hopeful that it doesn\u2019t mean it has to be all at one price and you can have some reasonable differentials, that that I think is an outcome that we certainly favor.","Christopher Harris","Okay. And then the question on global bonds shortly after the election here in the U.S., we had interest rates spike up and the performance of global bond was really good. We\u2019re seeing another move up in rates here in the U.S., but that it hasn\u2019t really necessarily led into stronger performance for global bond. So just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on that why the key difference is there?","Gregory Johnson","Yes, I think, this time it\u2019s just the euro, they\u2019ve been negative on the euro and that\u2019s been so strong and relatively strong around the dollar and that\u2019s been weak. So that\u2019s probably offset the duration relative attribution you got from rates going up and then Mexico with the NAFTA noise again kind of it\u2019s been bouncing around in that short-term period. So it\u2019s not like the funds losing any money or anything. It\u2019s just those that the move of the euro, I think, is the real dominant factor, as well as Mexico in that short period.","Christopher Harris","Gotcha. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Davitt","Hi, good morning. A lot of conflicting views on the broader M&A opportunity. On the one hand, getting through tax reform could unleash a wave of new deals. But on the other, with equity markets at all-time highs, the pricing for buyers and sellers still feeling very far apart. Could you give your thoughts on that conflict, and which side you think is winning out?","Gregory Johnson","Yes, I mean, you\u2019re right. I think, but the other side of that coin is that, when the markets are high, you tend to have more sellers, too. So you have more availability than you\u2019d have when markets are low. And the time you think now is the time to go strike, people aren\u2019t exactly selling unless they have a reason to.","So I think, you will have activity and probably more activity. But like you said, there\u2019s going to be a certain caution when p multiples are at their historic highs across almost every type of equity out there. So I think, you have to be a little careful on how big of one you \u2013 how big of a bet you make in this kind of market.","Patrick Davitt","Okay. And then on the China question, given your historical strength on the retail side, I\u2019m curious about your thoughts on getting involved in the qualified foreign institutional investor program, which I was a little surprised not seeing your name there, but wondering if that\u2019s in the works as well?","Jed Plafker","When you say not see our name there, I\u2019m not exactly sure what you mean. We participate in pretty much all the programs that are available in China in one way or another. So \u2013 and that\u2019s something that we see will continue. Recently, the government has loosened some of the quotas and things that they\u2019re allowing. And so we are and we plan to increase that as we can.","Patrick Davitt","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.","Gregory Johnson","Thank you, everybody, for participating on the call, and we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today."],"10324":["Franklin Resources, Inc. (NYSE:BEN) Q4 2018 Earnings Call October 25, 2018 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Unverified Participant","Gregory E.

Statements made in this conference call regarding Franklin Resources, Inc., which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.","These and other risks, uncertainties, and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the risk factors and MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings.","Operator","Good morning. My name is Donna and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, good morning and thank you for joining today's call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year results. This year marked a period of significant investment for the company as we reevaluated several facets of our business, continued to invest in ongoing strategic initiatives, and expanded our capabilities.","These investments contributed to lower operating income this year, but we firmly believe we now have the appropriate organizational structures in place to meet evolving client needs. We also returned more than $3.5 billion to investors through dividends and buybacks, in addition to that used for strategic acquisitions to enhance and expand our investment capabilities.","Our heavy mix of value-style funds weighed on flows, but we are optimistic about our flagship products' performance moving forward, as we've seen very strong performance in our key global macro and global equity funds into the quarter-end and into October.","With me today is our CFO, Ken Lewis, and we also have some special guests here to discuss this morning's exciting acquisition announcement. I'd like to extend a warm welcome to Benefit Street Partners' Chief Executive Officer, Tom Gahan; and President, Rich Byrne. Tom is dialing in from BSP's offices in New York, where he's been meeting with his team, and Rich is here with us in person in San Mateo.","Tom has been with BSP since the beginning and previously served as Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche Bank Securities, and Head of Corporate and Investment Banking in the Americas. Rich also previously served at Deutsche Bank Securities in the capacity of Chief Executive Officer for a number of years. We're excited to welcome these talented people to our firm and we hope you find their participation on today's call helpful.","I'd like to now hand it over to Tom for some opening remarks.","Thomas James Gahan - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.","Thanks, Greg. Rich and I are happy to join the call this morning to discuss the partnership we're building with Franklin Templeton. We both believe that Franklin will be the perfect long-term partner. I can tell you that on behalf of the entire BSP team, we're super excited to join this world-class global organization and combine our alternative credit products and investment capabilities with Franklin's tremendous investment platform.","We believe this combination will serve to augment our investment capabilities, while accelerating our growth prospects. All five of our core strategies have significant and secular growth opportunities. We believe that the Franklin umbrella will improve our information flows, also expanding our origination capabilities. In particular, we look forward to working with Franklin's global distribution platform to offer new products with extremely attractive risk-adjusted returns to their clients.","In short, this is a win-win for our team, the combined platform, and most importantly, our investors. In addition, Franklin's long history of successfully acquiring platforms, while maintaining the strengths and independence of the investment processes, give us confidence that this will be a mutually beneficial endeavor. Our investment team and process will be unchanged and the team has strong, mutually aligned incentives to continue delivering best-in-class returns to our investor base. Our conservative investment style will mesh well with Franklin's focus on long-term value creation for investors.","In conclusion, we feel fortunate to be navigating the markets and future opportunities with Greg, Jenny, and the entire Franklin team as our partner. Thank you.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks, Tom. So with that, we'd like to open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. Our first question is coming from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Hi. How are you? So I like Benefit Street and I like the space. Never mind there's big concerns about too much growth in private credit. I think there's a big ramp if you do it right. So, a little more question on what \u2013 I get what Benefit Street brings to Franklin. Could we talk a little bit more about what Franklin brings to Benefit Street? Does it expand distribution and which parts of it?","And this might be a stretch, but I know I've given you heat over the years of how you have this great retail fixed income platform, but never really grew a big institutional platform. Could Benefit Street be a launching pad towards a bigger institutional public fixed income as well?","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","I'll take that. This is Greg. And I think the immediate opportunity for us looking at our worldwide distribution network, the relationships we have with sovereign wealth funds around the globe, I would say that Benefit Street has been very successful growing with a relatively small distribution group and relied some on third-party distribution, where we think this asset class in this environment with floating rate, first lien, more defensive characteristics is very attractive to institutions that are concerned about rates, but need fixed income exposure.","So, we clearly see this as a growth opportunity, where immediately we can plug and play this with our institutional network and then explore the retail channel, whether it's a high net worth channel or looking at the type of interval funds or closed end funds that could be attractive in the retail space. So, we think there is immediate demand and opportunity for our distribution channels. And I'll turn it to Rich if he has any additional comments.","Richard Jan Byrne - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.","Sure, Greg. I think the way we think of it at Benefit Street is Franklin brings a lot of things. Tom mentioned some of them in his remarks, but it's pedigree, global reach, distribution, balance sheet, and information flow. So if you think about it, we have a number of alternative strategies. We think they generate some really attractive risk-adjusted returns, to the extent we can aid in our sourcing or information flow through the analyst at Franklin and all the other things that it brings, that's great for our ability to deliver returns to our investors.","But as far as delivering our products to a broader set of investors, our footprint on institutions, we've raised $26 billion over the 10 years that we've been around. But our footprint just isn't big enough and this deal comes at just the right time for us. And I would add, as you said, on the retail side, the only products that we have that really touch the retail market at all are two permanent capital vehicles. We have a publicly filing, but not listed BDC and mortgage REIT. And to the extent we can tap into the massive retail distribution here at Franklin, those are big growth areas as well.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","And maybe, Tom, you could expand on. I think the institutional opportunity for us, we think this is the final piece is having the full platform of credit available and we're seeing more demand in the institutional space, where you have mandates, where you can be tactical in moving between different categories.","Thomas James Gahan - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.","Yeah. No, I think that's right. I mean, we're definitely seeing increased demand for the products that we manage and we're seeing increased demand for effectively commingled structures that take combinations of what we do. Markets are always constantly changing and opportunities are constantly changing, and having that type of flexibility is becoming more and more important to our investor base.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Okay. And one final thing, anything you could tell us about performance on \u2013 it's going to sound ridiculous, but how you know these guys are good and what record are you looking at that you can show us over time?","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, I think we, obviously, did a lot of due diligence and looked at the records. And also, more importantly, we looked at the structures and downside protection, and I think that our first reaction like anybody is, hey, we're late in the credit cycle, and that was our first reaction and even my initial discussions. And the more we got to know the business that we think this is really in a great position to benefit from any dislocation. And we haven't talked about, but it's not just private debt, it's distressed, it's long\/short credit, it's high yield, it's other sectors that we think can do very well.","And I think the important part of their business model is that the funds are more like private equity type funds, where you have \u2013 you call on capital, there's dry powder there, you get market dislocations, you can have fresh powder put into the market. That's very different than the daily valuation, which has to sell as redemptions come in.","So I think we looked at the defensive nature of how the assets are positioned and captive, and that was very attractive. And also the lower leverage on the products versus the industry averages and the fact that this is one of the groups that has been doing it for a while since the global financial crisis and you have a lot of new entrants kind of coming in now and they've done it, done very well through the entire cycle with less leverage than others.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","All right. Thanks for all of that. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Robert Lee of KBW. Please go ahead.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions, and maybe like drill into the Benefit Street a little bit more. If I'm reading it correctly, financially, you're only buying the management fee stream and not buying the incentive fee stream. And any color you have kind of around \u2013 I'm assuming they're going to work as a kind of stand-alone entity, even though you own 100%. Kind of any color you may have around kind of their current profitability and margins?","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I'll take the first part and then maybe turn it to Ken on detail. I think the carry is the same carry percentages that existed before. So a percentage of the carry goes to the team, a percentage goes to Franklin, and none of that's changed. And I think that \u2013 and the majority of the carry goes to the team, 60%, and 40% to Franklin. So, yes, performance fees are still very important in the equation of the value and accretion for this deal. And I'll have Ken talk about the numbers.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Greg. So when we looked at this deal \u2013 and I know in the commentary we talked about that being neutral next year. I think the first thing to point out is when we're talking about accretion, we're talking about GAAP accretion. And so, while it's neutral, next year under GAAP basis we do see it accreting over time in the 5% to 10% range going forward, and that's on a GAAP basis. If you were to back out noncash items, it would be a lot more accretive, which I know some of our peers do.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Is it possible to get some sense to that? I mean, in terms of as we model it and kind of think about that cash generation. Means...","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","...is it tax benefits or what we'll see next quarter.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah, we don't think this will close, first of all, until like the second quarter. And then in FY 2019 we're saying it's neutral, but it should start to be accretive in the second year.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","And is all the $26 billion of assets fee generating? And kind of any color on what is the size of the kind of uncalled capital that's not earning fees yet as kind of the dry powder?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, we can have \u2013 yeah, we disclosed run rate revenues, so that's one thing I'll point you to. And I think maybe Rich will talk about the dry powder.","Richard Jan Byrne - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.","Yeah. The capital that we have under management, $26 billion, is we have \u2013 as we mentioned, most of that \u2013 actually over 85% is long life capital, meaning that it's either in a drawdown structure or in our permanent capital vehicles, et cetera. We lever our funds \u2013 our two most recent funds, our flagship private debt fund, our distressed fund. We have actually some other funds as well. I have not finished drawing down all their capital yet, so we still have a fair amount of powder and \u2013 in that runway.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","That's $2 billion in dry, $2 billion to $3 billion.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. And then if I could \u2013 I appreciate your patience \u2013 maybe back to the core business. Ken, end of the year, kind of looking ahead, what are your latest thoughts about kind of what we should be thinking for expense growth next year? I mean, previously you wanted to hold it down to, I believe, less than 3% or \u2013 that's still a good number? Where does that stand?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","That's right, Rob. So, we finished our budget process in August\/September, and that process was consistent with the guidance that I provided last quarter that we were budgeting expenses to go up 2% to 3%. But no sooner than was the ink dry on that that we started to look towards ways to get that expense growth down. And then, with the recent market activity, we're accelerating that. So, we do think that \u2013 while the budgets, we're projecting to grow 2% to 3%, we do think that there are opportunities to reduce expenses more. And so, even get it down to half that perhaps or even more than that.","But just a word of caution there, some of these things \u2013 these levers that we have, and we do think there are several of them, they're a little bit \u2013 take a little longer to pull, and they take a little longer for the benefits to be seen through the P&L. Having said all that, because of the cyclical nature of the expenses, we do think next quarter we should have flat expenses.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. Maybe first one just another question on the Benefit Street Partners. Just when I think about the $26 billion in maybe like the management fees, is that mostly on commitments or NAV? And then any margin color. And maybe for the team, like Tom, just wanted to get your sense, it seems like there's more \u2013 there's, obviously, structural growth, but there's a lot of like competition coming into that market. So, just how are you guys looking at deploying capital, given where we are in this cycle and how the structure is of some of these products kind of protect downside?","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Maybe I'll have Rich address that. And, Tom, you can jump in at the end if you have anything to add.","Richard Jan Byrne - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.","Sure. Thanks, Greg. We have a number of products. The one that people seem to ask about the most is around private debt. There undoubtedly has been more competition there, spreads have tightened, there's been some new players, but a couple of remarks. One is, everything we've read, it's probably the most unallocated asset class within alternatives, certainly relative to PE or real estate, et cetera. So, every projection we've seen shows that market considerably growing, almost doubling over the next five years. And despite tighter spreads and somewhat weaker documents, we still think for the most part across the continuum that we run \u2013 remember, we're sort of a credit ecosystem always looking around relative value. It really is the best risk-adjusted returns for the most part that we see across the credit spectrum.","And the only other thing I would add, and maybe if Tom wants to chime in here, is size matters. So, there may be more competitors in the market. Some stats we looked at recently is less than 20% of all the new funds formed are over $1 billion. Size really matters. Size matters because of the size of the teams. I mean, this is a very labor intensive business, private debt. You just have research analyst doing a lot of work for you. You have liquid markets to sell to. Oftentimes, we're the only lender. So, size matters as far as size of teams, monitoring, and all that, but it also manages commitment.","So across our platform, almost half of our AUM, about $12 billion, is in private debt, means that we can commit up to, and in some cases even above, $300 million per deal. Remember, the average size of deal we're doing on a middle market loan is a $30 million, $40 million, $50 million company. $50 million EBITDA companies don't need $25 million. They need commitments of multiple hundred millions. And believe it or not, there really aren't that many providers out there, the banks aren't in that business for the most part, that can do that.","And so, I think what you'll see over time is consolidation. And for us, hopefully, under the Franklin umbrella, just make us that much better at doing our job, and that's just private debt. Of course, we have a lot of other strategies which benefit from the same bank disintermediation, and a lot of the same fundamental factors that does private debt.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Tom, do you want to add anything? Are you...","Thomas James Gahan - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.","Yeah, I can add just quickly. I think one on more of a sort of technical question I think you began with, on our private equity style funds, fees are charged undrawn as opposed committed capital. We think that actually places us in sort of a much better position with our investors. That's how they work. But I think just echoing Rich's comments that scale matters, and we have 50 people that are originating, we can write checks of multiple hundreds of millions of dollars.","When we're talking to financial sponsors, owners of companies, management teams, and we can say, look, we can underwrite your entire cap structure, we can underwrite acquisitions, et cetera. That direct transfer mechanism is becoming more and more important. And we think that the combination with Franklin is going to sort of further elevate us and continue to separate us from the smaller players who just can't do that.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up maybe for Ken. Just on capital, so you guys were active on the buyback. You did this transaction. Going forward just wanted to get a sense. I know you guys have a ton of cash and you generate a lot, but just from a priority standpoint, does this change anything in terms of the pace of buybacks that you guys have been kind of run rating?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Sure. And I think we did see the buybacks slowdown this quarter. I think that's \u2013 the trend, all things being equal, would have continued. Of course, that could be offset with the market right now. And so, as you know, we're pretty opportunistic. But we think that this acquisition and our buyback practices are consistent with our historical practices. If you look back what we've done with the year, after tax reform we've had almost 200% payout of earnings this year. And this is consistent, this acquisition.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","So, I would just say the answer from our perspective is this acquisition doesn't affect our capital management program and I wouldn't relate it. There's a little slowdown quarter-to-quarter. It wasn't because of this deal...","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Correct, right.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","...on cash. There's plenty of cash for buybacks.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bill Katz of Citi. Please go ahead.","William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question and congratulations on the transaction to both parties. Just sort of on that, I just wonder if you could just maybe peel back one more level here on the economics of it. It sounds like there's some money upfront, some money down the road. Just trying to tie back to your GAAP neutral, and then some improvement on the other side of that. Maybe talk a little bit about how much is paid upfront and what some of the milestones might be in terms of earn-outs and when that might be, what kind of margin are we talking about, and then can you quantify the intangible amortization.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Sure. I think the margin in this business are extremely attractive. And over the next few years, that will be largely offset by retention programs. Just a little bit about the deal itself, we have the $683 million initial considerations. As we mentioned earlier, the key employees will still accrue the majority of performance fees, and they will also participate in retention programs. We stagger the vesting over the next six years, with the more senior individuals having the longer vesting periods. And the partners will invest, as we mentioned, 20% of the after-tax proceeds.","So if you consider the commitment to invest in the future funds and the deferred programs, approximately half of the total consideration is backend loaded and we think that's aligned \u2013 and including the carry. And so we think that all the interests are aligned there.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","And I would just add. I think, for us, that was a key point in the structure of this deal that based on the ownership structure allowed us to put much more of the consideration to employees and vesting over time. And I think like any deal you do, where it's one thing buying the company, it's another thing to be sure the key people are going to stick around. I think in this case, we would say that there's a higher probability of people staying, because the incentives are better for them than the prior structure, and nothing's been altered. It's just been more attractive with vesting over four to six years.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","And senior management will enter into a non-compete and non-solicit agreements too over a six-year period.","William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then my follow-up \u2013 thank you for that. My follow-up question this sort of stands on the core business as well. So when I look at the gross sales dynamics, they continue to weaken both quarter-to-quarter and year-on-year. However, could you give maybe a little bit more color around any kind of intra-quarter trends that you may have seen in terms of, given the performance has improved as the quarter sort of unfold a little bit? And then any sort of color, what you're sort of seeing just given the turmoil that's continued into October?","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I would start by, for us, we've always felt that with a large base of value assets, you need some market setback and sell-off and volatility to get the value back in favor, and rising rates certainly, as we've said before, historically in that kind of market value tends to outperform growth. So, if you look at September\/October, it's probably the strongest overall performance we have had relative to our peer groups in the industry.","And even to me, the immediate where I think we could turn flows fairly quickly, it's still our top selling funds would be around the global macro, global bond, where in this kind of environment where you have the uncertainty, you have rising rates, and in the last probably five weeks we picked up close to 600 basis points against our competitive universe here, and have a positive return the last 12 months.","So I think that's the one to me that from a flow standpoint that I think could turn fairly quickly. I think the others, we have better relative numbers with Templeton, with Mutual, as you'd expect, in this kind of market, but I still think it would take a little bit more time to see that translate to sales. I think the immediate opportunity is still what has been our big driver. And if you look at the last time we had the global financial crisis and coming out of it in the last decade in equities, that's where the global bonds did so well. So, I think that that story will be attractive.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","And that said, we did see a slight pickup in U.S. retail sales even last quarter.","William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Good morning, Greg, Ken. How did Benefit Street's private credit funds perform in 2008 and 2009 in terms of realized losses?","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","I'll let Rich take it.","Richard Jan Byrne - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.","Easy question to answer. We're exactly 10 years old, so we really started at the \u2013 I think it was a couple of weeks, right around the Lehman demise. So at Benefit Street, we don't have the crisis in our sphere.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","And I think maybe it's important just to point out, and maybe Tom or Rich, I think our first reaction was the same kind of question, well, CLOs were a disaster during the global financial crisis, but again when you really look at and understand the difference, these are not mortgage-related CLOs. They're not CDOs. And actually this asset class performed \u2013 it was one of the top performing fixed income classes during the global financial crisis.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","So, Tom, you want to add anything on that?","Thomas James Gahan - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.","Sure. Yeah. I mean, so from inception we've had virtually zero losses. Obviously, it's been a pretty favorable credit environment, but there are plenty of losses out there amongst our competitors. With respect to sort of what's going on in the broadly syndicated loan marketplace, CLOs, et cetera. If you look back to the actual returns of CLOs through the GFC, the returns are amazingly strong. Since then, the structures, CLO 2.0, have gotten stronger. We are very conservative in the way that we underwrite credit. And we believe that the CLO structures are going to be able to weather any foreseeable downturn in the marketplace and still be able to protect investors in those structures.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Richard Jan Byrne - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.","I'll also add...","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Just a quick follow-up here.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Wait. We just had one \u2013 Rich has one quick comment.","Richard Jan Byrne - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.","Yeah. Maybe embedded in the question is where we are in the cycle now. Clearly, the market's exhibiting a lot of late cycle behavior. If you look at our portfolios across our platform, you'll see a very different construct. Right now, in our private debt strategies, we're, give or take, 90% senior secured top of the capital structure. Loan-to-values are across our platform around 50%. In fact, in our most current fund, our flagship, we're investing now \u2013 excuse me, it's under 50%. So, we've got a lot of dry powder. We think the portfolio is very defensive.","As Tom mentioned, we've had a de minimis amount of losses since inception. And the point I made earlier about the \u2013 that most of our capital is long life capital gives us the ability to make disciplined investment decisions during market downturns and not be subject to flows. So, this is a fixed income business. Credits generally have limited upside and lots of downside. We're managing for that downturn and, frankly, are looking forward to it.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks, guys, very comprehensive. Just one quick follow-up. What is the appetite for another special dividend around year end, just given that tax repatriation is no longer a hurdle?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah, I think that's just one of the quivers and the arrows that we have to look at. And it's a board decision, as is the regular dividend. And I don't think, as Greg pointed out, nothing's really changed in our capital management policies or practices.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","So, yeah, it would be under consideration and we'd get feedback on it as we usually do.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. So maybe first, what kind of balance sheet or liquidity risk does Franklin take here with this acquisition? Maybe to what extent does Franklin buy a balance sheet with Benefit Street with CLO tranches or other balance sheet investments in the Benefit Street funds? And then what sort of liquidity provisions do the products have here? And how confident is Franklin that it won't have to step up to provide customer liquidity, should trading in the underlying investments dry up when customers look to redeem?","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","You sound like one of our board members. I think these are exactly the right questions to ask when looking at these types of investments, and we've done extensive due diligence around any potential liability or balance sheet issues. And really, again, the key here is the structure, where it's private equity-like fixed. You have terms of seven years with the private debt funds. There is no liquidity issue. They're in there for seven years, so you don't have a meet a daily redemption type of step-up that you could have in a 1940 Act Fund or any other vehicles that have daily liquidity. These are very much, whether it's the REIT or BDC permanent capital.","And so, we really looked at that carefully. We looked at the liabilities, If there were any that related to these instruments in the GFC. And really felt strongly that that hasn't been an issue certainly even with the CLO side going through the GFC, where the management companies have had any liability or any kind of issuance. And also the structure around \u2013 whether it's a partnership with funds \u2013 again, we don't have the balance sheet issues of having to put it on our balance sheet.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And there's no investments in the Benefit Street funds at all (00:34:05)?","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yes, there will be, but \u2013 yes, but for us, that's something we modeled out and looked at. It's a small percentage for the type of funds that we would normally do, and I think our view was that it wouldn't exceed. If we hit all of our growth targets and assets grew and doubled in size, our maximum at any one time would be somewhere around $230 million, $240 million of capital. And we think that's a pretty good use of the $240 million if that's where, better than sitting in 2% treasuries.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you. And then, can you give us a little background on the seller here? So, I guess, my assumption in Provident (sic) [Providence] is a seller here along with management. Maybe, what's the history and why are they selling, if the outlook for the business is so good, as you've represented, why do they see now as the right time to be transferring a lot of the economics from them as the owners to you, as the new owner?","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Tom, do you want to take that one?","Thomas James Gahan - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.","Sure. Yeah, listen, Providence has been a great partner and they're with us from day one. Our business has become larger and more complicated. We have capital needs and distribution needs that really couldn't be fulfilled by our existing partner. I mean, they're a sector-based private equity fund, really successful at what they do. And we determine jointly that it was probably the best time to start thinking about bringing in a partner for us for the long-term that could really help us on sort of that pedigree, that global recognition, access to distribution, capital to seed, new products, new teams, et cetera. And this was just a natural time to sort of do that, given our growth and sort of how much our business is so different from what they do.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Maybe to tie in a lot of the comments on Benefit Street and after a couple of questions on it. Financially, Ken, I think you mentioned you thought over the long-term this could be 5% to 10% accretive. I guess, just if that's GAAP or non-GAAP?","And then you guys have sort of given us some good detail here on the structure in terms of the $683 million, that amount being half of the total consideration. But I think you also mentioned, carry as a component of that. So, just trying to get a sense of what \u2013 if carry is a significant part of that versus actual cash laid out by Franklin. I think you also mentioned the assets doubling over time in a four to six-year timeframe. So just wanted to, first of all, try to get a sense of that on the financial side if that tie into the 5% to 10% accretion.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Seems there's a lot there. Let's see where to begin on that. So, first of all, it was kind of a long-term endeavor here. What I was saying was that the team will \u2013 they're participating in majority of the carry, and that is \u2013 will align their interests, the different components, as I mentioned, over six years. And that is why we're saying it's neutral in the beginning, but over time \u2013 could you repeat some of the questions...","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, yeah, no worries.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","...or just repeat the questions?","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, no worries. You're answering part of it. So as we go to the four- to six-year timeframe that you sort of talked about, and you also mentioned sort of a goal of assets doubling in time, it sounds like some of the incentive is going to be the retained carry by the teams, and then some of the contingent consideration will be cash laid out like a typical earn-out structure. And is that coming into that 5% to 10% accretion? And, I guess, that 5% to 10%, do you see that as sort of \u2013 not in 2020, but more like four to five years out?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","I think, yeah, my time horizon was about four or five years, and it included all of that in my numbers and it was GAAP, as I mentioned. So, if you backed out the noncash components, the accretion would be a lot higher than that.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And then, sorry, did you give the amortization...","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Sorry. No, we said that's \u2013 we'll give more details on those on the next quarter call in around.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Yeah, that makes sense. And then on the growth side...","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. So next quarter when it closes, we'll give some more guidance on individual line items.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, that's great. And then, I guess, more broadly, just the cross-sell that this can \u2013 I guess, your sort of idea of to what extent you can sell this into your institutional channels, particularly on the insurance side, which clearly has increasing need for liquid credit. And I think you also mentioned retail product structures as well, although, obviously, I would think they would have to be more liquid. But do you have plans on launching it with retail products?","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I think those are absolutely all attractive prospects and we have a team that calls on the general account insurance business. This would be a natural quick fit. It's not that complicated of a story for, I think, a generalist institutional team to go out and at least talk about and see if \u2013 like, whether it's sovereign wealth fund where you have relationships around the globe. This is a natural category.","And even \u2013 my interest \u2013 it was interesting on why, I felt like this category was one we had to look at. I was just sitting on two endowment boards and the consultant came in and said, we're going to educate the board on private credit. I said, hmm, this is interesting. This is a category, and again, because it just fits so neatly into this rising rate and having more quality around it and the attractive yields you get by eliminating the bank, I think it is very attractive that way.","And the retail side, whether it's the high net worth side with fiduciary is an easy first introduction. But we've already seen interest from our traditional retail channel around whether you have an interval structure or a closed-end structure. I mean, those are all things we will explore right away, and we think that we can do that fairly quickly.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's great color. Thanks. Just one on expenses, the base that you're growing from, Ken, for the 2% to 3% growth for next year, is that expense base $2.16 billion? Do I have that right? (00:42:06) excluding the sales and distribution expense.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah, I'm giving you the number excluding the sales and distribution and marketing line.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's $2.16 billion for fiscal 2018, unless there's other one timers in there?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","I'm not \u2013 I think that's about right, but I think you should just verify that with Investor Relations later.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, will do. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Thanks, guys. Could you maybe just step back and give us an idea of the process for the BSP discussions, evolution, who went to who, was this investment banking driven? And should we take this to indicate that there's a healthy pipeline of similar deals out there as you've kind of gone through these processes?","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Clarify that, how did we \u2013 oh, the BSP. I thought you said the BDC. Okay.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","No, no. BSP, sorry. How did the process play out? Yeah.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. This was not an auction or a book or somebody going out and saying, we want to sell to the highest bidder. This was a \u2013 came from relationship of one of our board members with Tom and introduced us and just thought this would be a very interesting fit, because he's heard in our meetings how we want to continue to build our alternatives business. And he personally knew Tom and his team and knew Rich and David, and just felt like this was the right cultural fit. These guys have a long history of working together. Our people knew many of their senior people going back to Merrill Lynch days in high yield and things.","So, I think that got us off to a good start in the discussions and our first reaction, like many, where we were late in the credit cycle know and the more we understood the business and the opportunities to benefit from any downturn with distressed and long\/short and just the conservative nature of how they're running their business, we got very comfortable and very excited about it and that's really how. And we did a lot of due diligence, because it's a new area for us and for all the questions that were raised on this call around capital, any future liabilities, all those things we wanted to be very careful about. So, I think that's really how it came, but it was not a bidding process at all.","And I think the point is, we've said before, we're open to any deal that looks like it has quality people, a quality record, and it's an area that can grow. And I think that's \u2013 we looked at this business and just feel like there can be some bumps like all credit areas have, but the middle market corporate business is one that \u2013 it's hard for the banks to get back into and it's a big market and we think very attractive in this environment.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just a quick one, I may have missed this earlier, but did you give the weighted average tenure of AUM? I imagine it's in the kind of five to seven-year range.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","It is, but that's really the private debt side. I think there is permanent as well. So maybe, Rich...","Richard Jan Byrne - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.","Yeah. Each of our strategies is different. For private debt, our funds are long lock-up funds, generally seven years. On the BDC and the mortgage REIT, those are permanent capital vehicles. They're publicly filed, they're not traded at the moment, but we plan on listing those and think of those as any permanent capital vehicle.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Thank you.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one; I don't think you touched on this, but when you spoke to your assumptions \u2013 this is on the BSP transaction. When you spoke to your assumptions about year two accretion, could you let us know what credit trends are embedded within those assumptions?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. The assumptions are that there would be future fund launches that are consistent with past fund launches and growing slightly. So, maybe like 1% or 2% or 3% growth in those fund launches, and that was the major assumption driving revenue.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And I'll...","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","We looked at downside scenarios, but we didn't really for \u2013 to say, what does the credit world look like next year, and I think the assumptions for those numbers are more where we are today, more or less.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Right.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, got it. Thank you. And then, given the fact that there's leverage used in these funds, can you give us an idea about what kind of loss tolerance there is before the earnings stream to Franklin would be impaired from some of these?","And then given your response to Ken's question, I assume that means that Franklin is not going to be providing the leverage to these existing funds. But you made a reference to maybe launching a few products that might be a bit more aligned with the core business. And in those scenarios, would that be a situation where Franklin might be the provider of that leverage or are you guys staying away from that altogether?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","We don't envision providing leverage to the products.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I'd say that we have no plans in providing the leverage. And I'll have maybe Rich address the leverage.","Richard Jan Byrne - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.","Yeah. Our funds are relatively light leverage certainly as compared to many of the peers in our spaces, different funds little different. On a private debt side and our BDC, we've run leverage of well under 1 times; will vary throughout the cycle, but anywhere from 0.5 to 0.8. More recently, in our earlier vintages, it was actually substantially even lower than that. Our bilateral providers in private debt and in some of our other products are the banks you'd expect them to be, Wells, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, et cetera. In our commercial real estate business, we take advantage of warehouses and CLO financing as they take out to our warehouses. And again, those are bank lenders that we take advantage of across our platform. We enjoy a lot of relationships across the street. Hopefully, that will even get better with our \u2013 post acquisition. But, no, we don't envision doing anything on a lending basis with Franklin.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. I guess, Ken, given your accretion assumptions, are you thinking about going to a non-GAAP reporting on a go-forward basis? And then also if you could just give us some context of what performance fees have looked like over the previous couple of years for this business?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, regarding the non-GAAP disclosures, that will be part of our analysis when we get closer to closing on it. We analyze that every year, frankly, and it just hasn't been material enough to make a compelling argument. This may change that, but we'll have to wait and see on that. In terms of performance fees, historically, it wasn't a significant part of our valuation or projections going forward. We don't include a significant part of performance fees when we were talking about the accretion calculation. So, I think that's probably the essence of your question there.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Performance fees, you need to put in context, this is not a private equity-type structure and they're more probable and less as far as upside. And maybe, Tom, you could touch on that just a little bit on where that expectation is around the performance fee.","Thomas James Gahan - Benefit Street Partners L.L.C.","Yeah. Sure, Greg. Well, obviously, it's a function of the marketplace and the opportunities. I'd say that our \u2013 when you think about performance fees for private debt vehicles, the debt product is very different than, say, the private equity product, whereby private equity you can earn multiples of your investment, while debt you're lending money and the goal is to get your money back plus a reasonable return. And so, we think about debt multiples or fund multiples or multiples of money being anywhere from about 1.4 to a 1.7, potential outliers out at 2 times if you're in a more sort of interesting credit environment than we're in today. And in terms of historicals, we generated sort of market-leading returns in our debt vehicles and we hope to be able to continue to do that.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. And then, just as a follow-up, in the core business, Ken, just thinking about the fee rate decline this quarter, I assume mostly because of mix. But, I guess, as you think about next year and kind of the outlook for the next 12 months, how should we think about the fee rate?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I think one of the factors was that the daily average assets under management, which a lot of the funds are calculated on, was lower than the straight monthly due to the volatility. And I think that was kind of a factor going that reduced it. Going forward, we're not seeing a significant \u2013 we're not projecting a significant decrease in effective fee rate over 2018.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. So the first one, I guess, on the deal, as you look out and you guys articulated this earlier some of the potential revenue synergies with Franklin's distribution, as you kind of compare and contrast to some of the other deals you guys have made, whether it's K2 or some of the others, what's sort of different about this one from a distribution perspective? And, I guess, what worked well versus what didn't work well in your prior experience that you could try to do something differently with this one?","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, I think this is a fairly simple story compared to \u2013 like, K2 is a little bit more complicated and liquid alts of fund of funds and do a retail channel. And we've been very successful in fundraising that area, but there's been, I'd say, some headwinds institutionally that we knew about on the standard fund of funds business, so, we've been kind of evolving that. But when I look at the amount we've raised in Europe and the U.S. in the K2 side and continue to be one of our areas of positive inflows and growth, I mean, I think that's done okay.","I think this is just an easier story as far as getting out there and telling exactly what this team does in an asset class that may be relatively new, but one that people can understand pretty quickly what benefits it has and getting an adjustable rate with X return above where the market is. And I think institutions, the benefit of the lockup is important too, the liquidity factor of getting that extra yield by having it held over a seven-year period or so. I think that's something institutions understand and can easily do.","I think it's a little longer in the retail channel, but I just think this is more mainstream, I would say, than a more complex fund of funds type product of a K2. But again, I think as far as we look at the billions we've raised in retail with K2 and continued to do that, especially in this kind of market, where the other factor were the fund of funds in a lower vol product in a straight up rising market, it doesn't look that attractive. It starts to look attractive again in the kind of market we're seeing right now. And that was the same in Europe. We saw a real pickup in interest when we had some volatility a few quarters ago and now we're seeing more interest again.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","And our team also sees an opportunity to expand on the RIA relationship base through the BDC and the REIT products. So it was another \u2013 they were excited about that.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got you. That's a helpful angle. So second question, Ken, for you just around expenses, so I just want to make sure I understand the message. So 2% to 3% probably a little lower, so it sounds like you guys are aiming to do closer to maybe 1% to 2%. Tell me if that's not right here, but that's what it sounded like.","I guess, taking a step back, if we are in a little bit more of a choppier market backdrop, let's just say zero beta, could expenses go down or do you guys think you still have a fair bit of investing you guys need to do to sort of drop expenses this kind of 1% to 2% range?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","I think there's opportunities for expenses to go down, with the caveat that there's not a lot of what you might reference as low-hanging fruit. So, the opportunities are there, but it's longer to identify and longer to execute. But we do think there are opportunities to reduce expenses, and just sort of some examples. And looking at the strategic investments that we made not just in the last year, but the last five years, and just assessing them are they successful, should we be doing something different, there's the easy stuff like tamping down G&A expense. We have a large component of comp is variable. And then just looking at our investment management distribution capabilities that maybe aren't operating at scale, can we be more efficient, increasing automation, increasing our global sourcing in low-cost jurisdiction. That's just to name a few, but there are clearly opportunities that we think can reduce expenses.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just hoping you talk a little bit about the private equity JV in Asia, if you could talk about your new partner out there, how you're thinking about building out the business, what sort of goals\/objectives do you have, how are you thinking about the opportunity set there, and why start with fund of funds, which has fees on fees?","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, I think it's somebody who we admire who has built a very strong business with Asia Alts and we've a local, Melissa Ma, who we've gotten to know and respect and somebody who has a very strong following. And I think if she wanted to partner with us to build a broader based PE fund of funds, she brought the kind of people in that have that expertise and relationships and has the ability to go out and fundraise without a lot of help from us to get started. I think that was all attractive. And willing to put her own capital into it along with management, and doing really a JV that way.","And I think it helps us get to know different segments of the institutional marketplace, where they've historically been strong and introduced relationships, as well as helping us with our nascent private equity effort in how we build out that business, having that expertise of somebody who's really dealt with all of the best ones over time in certain regions. So I think those were a lot of the reasons along with it's another alternative capability. And I think it's just having the opportunity with the management team that we knew and not a real drag on our existing distribution system, where we think it can be up and profitable pretty quickly.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And just as a follow-up question, if you could just talk a little bit about your solutions business. I know that's been a strategic priority of yours. If you could just update us on how that's progressing, where we stand in terms of AUM, what's new in terms of hiring, new products, goals you have for that business looking out the next couple of years. Thanks.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I think we're extremely excited about it and we've made some great hires and two high profiled people that along with Ed and have built a lot of new products within there. And I think, more importantly, immediately we've seen the benefits with some of our \u2013 the variable annuity changes, where they may be looking for a lower-vol equity-type product, we now can save some assets and move them into as some of these ones wind down and that's what they're looking for. And we've been able to do that in certain cases.","It also allows us \u2013 we've combined many of our different groups with risk premia and quantitative into systemic kind of quant. We've been able to build our factor-based ETFs, which are doing extremely well on a relative basis. And our U.S. multifactor one is up to 400-plus million dollars, and that's really a benefit of having that capability within the solutions group. So it really has pulled a lot of pieces together.","And I think the other part is just the ability to offer various types of sleeves that could be attractive in many of the different models that are out there. And as the market evolves from a product-driven place to more of a outcome-oriented solutions basis having specific solutions that can fit, whether it's a technology platform, those are just getting more and more important as these technology platforms get in between the end investor and the advisor. And we've got to figure out ways to get on that shelf space and solutions really helps there.","So, I think we look at it as we're fully staffed now, we've built the products, and we're going out to market with them. And I think the immediate benefit is really some of the ETF help, but also just having different customized options available for some of the insurance relationships that we've seen a direct benefit.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Sean Peche of Ranmore. Please go ahead.","Sean Philip Peche - Ranmore Fund Management Ltd.","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Mr. Johnson, during the last call, you said Franklin was quite possibly the best buy out there, and I happen to agree with you. And with the share price some 10% lower, can I ask why the board hasn't been accelerating the rate of buybacks, as price has fallen and\/or indeed even considering taking on debt to repurchase this potential portion of the company at the current value, which looks to be around five times normalized earnings, excluding cash and investments, especially given the change in value growth cycle, which looks to be under way?","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. No, all good I think points, and there are volume considerations and you can't just go out and buy. And I know that your next question will be, why don't you do a tender or something with that. I think those are all things we talk about and consider, and I guess I was wrong last quarter if the stock's down 10%. But we...","Sean Philip Peche - Ranmore Fund Management Ltd.","No, just early.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","But we are looking at all of that and I think the management \u2013 we and our board feel strongly that a one of the strongest balance sheets is going to be a weapon for us for creating value over the long term and having options in \u2013 as we enter a more uncertain period with a strong balance sheet is where we want to be. And capital is something that I think we \u2013 again, as I've said, I think the high rating is attractive to institutional investors, and not having debt on the balance sheet as an investment company we think is very important. And I'll let Ken if he wants to add anything.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Just add I think \u2013 I'm sure you're aware that the board did increase the share repurchase last February, so...","Sean Philip Peche - Ranmore Fund Management Ltd.","Yes. Look, I must commend you in how patient you've been, because many of your peers, who've been less patient, don't have the ability to take advantage of the low prices that are currently out there in the asset management space. But one doesn't want you to miss the opportunity. And perhaps as evidence of the growth value cycle having turned, I'd point out that Franklin Resources has substantially outperformed Amazon this month. But is the market right to be fearful of a substantial acquisition or should we expect more smaller bolt-on type acquisitions of the type announced today?","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, as I've said before, I think large acquisitions are very difficult. There's a lot of risk in them, and just the brand and who you are as a firm. But I think, again, if the right situation came up, where you think you can take out a lot of costs and create value, we're going to certainly look at that and be open to that. But I think as we've stated before, I think today we're over $40 billion in alternatives. We'd like to be bigger in that. So, yes, if we think things \u2013 if there's attractive other businesses to fit into that category, that's one we want to continue to grow.","And part of the attractiveness of BSP is having the kind of people that are plugged into the Street and relationships and see different things come up that could be interesting for us. And I think that that \u2013 Rich and Tom are builders and entered a lot of different areas just starting at private credit, and that's the kind of talent, again, that I think when you have in the organization, you're going to get a lot of new looks at some new businesses and we're going to continue to do that.","Sean Philip Peche - Ranmore Fund Management Ltd.","Perhaps just one last question. Has Franklin been approached by I know a number of large banks and financial services companies, Goldmans and the likes, are looking at increasing their exposure in investment management? Has Franklin been approached in that regard?","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, we wouldn't say \u2013 I mean, I think there's always conversations, I think but we don't really talk about whether we've been approached or not formally or informally.","Sean Philip Peche - Ranmore Fund Management Ltd.","All right. Thank you.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Robert Lee of KBW. Please proceed with your follow-up.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks for taking my follow-up and, I guess, I just had a question here. I guess, at the beginning of the call, Greg, you mentioned that you kind of felt you had kind of a lot of the structures built that you need at this point, and I know you talked about the solutions business. But can you maybe dive a little deeper into that, where you're referring primarily to kind of building out the CIT capability or are there some other businesses that we should be thinking about that now you feel you're in a better position to go out and accelerate marketing?","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, I think it just allows you to leverage \u2013 when I look at our business and say, you've got all these lines and you've got all this expertise in so many different places, and having a group now that really interacts and has the kind of people at a level of experience that the rest of the CIOs respect and work with, it helps us in a lot of areas. It helps us just in how we communicate our views on where the markets are and tactical allocation views, where clients want to hear that. And part of our \u2013 I think the difficulty we've had in delivering that as a firm has been that we were somewhat siloed and are, and think that's important with investment teams to have independence.","But we also have to have the ability to leverage and be tactical across these different groups to add alpha over time, I think that's what they're doing. And I think the customization that's out there, whether it's commingled trust like you mentioned, whether it's separately managed accounts, these are all businesses now that we have more flexibility in addressing customized demands from clients and interest and whether it's retirement income sleeve or an inflation protected fixed income piece. We can do all that much more efficiently now and having that I think. And even just the disparate pieces we had with quantitative and risk premia groups and AlphaParity now all under one group, it's much better organized and, I think, simpler for the clients to kind of understand.","So we just think that's going to be more and more important as we move from this product-driven brokerage world to more of a solutions outcome and technology-driven world, where they're going to be looking for specific tools to build the portfolio, and that's really what solutions allows you to do.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your follow-up.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Real quick, just can I always ask you this, the cash balances of $6.8 billion, looks like that is net of everything, but what portion of that do you view as excess excluding the working capital needs, which I think are still significant in overseas?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","We like to call it opportunistic capital.","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Or an ammo.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Ammo, yes, even better.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","And our current estimate is that that number is between $3 billion and $4 billion.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, another one I usually ask you, but since you mentioned the cost save (01:09:35) ability to potentially reduce costs, the outsourcing of some of the fund administration, you \u2013 obviously, we saw the Oppenheimer\/Invesco deal and a large part of that $475 million of cost saves they're getting is from outsourcing what has been internally done in Oppenheimer. Any consideration on your end for doing that, or is that part of what you're thinking about for the potential to reduce costs, or is that still a decision that's sort of in the distant future?","Gregory E. Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","No, it would absolutely be something that we would look at, as part of that exercise. So, that's a part of the laundry list that I went over. Having said that, I think it's important to keep in mind for us the low cost base that we have, because of our presence in low-cost jurisdictions. So, we're an outsource provider. It needs to be global and it needs to be at a pretty cheap price for it to be compelling for us, because we have our low expense base and cost base.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, got it.

These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filing. This commentary was prerecorded.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Hello, and welcome to the second quarter earnings commentary. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; along with Ken Lewis, our CFO.","The March quarter got off to a strong start for us as increased sales activity and the market tailwind led to increased assets under management. Net new flows turned positive again this quarter, driven by the increase in sales, with long-term flows positive across all investment objectives for the first time in nearly 3 years. Most importantly, long-term relative investment performance remained strong across the firm. Net income also rebounded, and quarterly earnings per share of $2.32 reached a record high. ","Relative investment performance for the U.S. fund range is highlighted on Slide 6. Of course, this is specific to a subset of our overall business, and we encourage you to take a look at the broader performance summary in our 10-Q, which was also filed this morning. ","Overall, U.S. relative performance rankings were little changed from December as improving fixed income performance was offset by weaker equity performance. The biggest detractor from equity performance rankings was the Franklin Income Fund, which represents 53% of Franklin equity assets. The fund underperformed its Lipper peer group average by about 80 basis points for the 1-year period, or 66 percentile, due to its traditional overweighting in utility and energy sectors that underperformed the broad market in the quarter. Importantly, long-term performance remains outstanding.","Fixed-income performance improved across-the-board, although the strong year-to-date rebound in Templeton Global Bond's performance has not yet fully turned the one-year number.","Assets under management increased 8% for the quarter to $726 billion. Monthly AUM increased 5%. ","Turning to Slide 9. The mix of AUM by investment objective and sales region was little changed since December. Strong equity markets and fund performance added $51 billion to assets under management this quarter. Long-term sales increased 27% to $48.5 billion while total redemptions fell 19%, although redemptions were really little changed if you exclude last quarter's large advisory account closure. ","As illustrated on Slides 11 and 12, flow trends improved in the U.S. and internationally and across investment objectives. U.S. long-term sales increased 19% due to an overall improvement in sales across a number of strategies, particularly U.S. equity, hybrid and fixed income. ","International long-term sales increased 37% from last quarter, due primarily to improved sales of our cross-border CCAB range where market demand for regional emerging market strategies and global fixed income continued. ","We continue to promote equity investing in the U.S. and internationally through a number of ongoing campaigns, and we are pleased to see that long-term sales in U.S. equity grew 32% for the quarter. The top-selling U.S.-registered fund in this category was Franklin Rising Dividends Fund. This fund has been included in a number of our equity campaigns. Internationally, our U.S. heritage makes us a natural candidate to invest in U.S. equity. ","The top-selling U.S. equity fund in our cross-border range was the CCAB U.S. Opportunities Fund. ","In the cross-border market, demand for regional emerging market strategies continues. CCAB Templeton Asian Growth Fund was the top-selling equity fund for the quarter, generating $1.2 billion in net new flows. Interest in this fund is diversified by distributor with the Americas and Europe regions generating the majority of net new flows. We've also seen a return to positive net new flows for the European sales region this quarter, led by strong flows in Italy and Germany.","On the institutional side, we continue to see flows into global and U.S. equity strategies, particularly from international clients. We've also been successful securing locally managed mandates from institutional clients investing in Latin America and India. Global fixed-income strategies also continued to attract institutional flows. ","In the hybrid category, U.S.-based Franklin Income Fund's long-term sales grew 36% for the quarter, resulting in $1.2 billion in net new flows for one of our most popular funds. Advisors with clients seeking higher yields in the current market environment have looked to the Franklin Income Fund, a fund with a history of generating income for over 60 years. ","In the interest of yield, we also have seen increasing sales in our high-yield U.S. fixed-income funds in both the U.S. and cross-border markets. Interest in our tax-free, fixed-income funds continued its upward trend with long-term sales up 36% for the quarter. Tax-free, fixed-income, long-term sales for the quarter are the highest we've seen since the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009.","Long-term sales in the global fixed-income category increased 28% following last quarter's sharp decline. The U.S.-based and CCAB-based Templeton Global Bond funds remained our top-selling funds this quarter. Redemptions declined in the U.S.-based fund, returning the fund to positive new flows for the quarter. Redemptions increased slightly in a CCAB fund due to a number of distributor platforms reducing their model allocations, holding the fund in net redemptions for the second quarter. ","On a positive note, long-term sales of the CCAB Templeton Global Total Return Fund grew over 60%, making this fund the third top-selling fund for the quarter. We continue to provide portfolio manager perspective for these global fixed-income funds to keep financial advisors and distributors up-to-date. ","A global bond retention campaign initiated at the end of last quarter internationally remains under way, and advisors have ordered more than 16,000 copies of a straight talk on global bonds flyer in the U.S. ","And now I'll turn it over to Ken for operating results.","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Thanks, Greg. The strong rebound in assets under management and cost management efforts translated into improved earnings this quarter. Operating income was $617 million, a small decrease from last quarter, but net income increased 5% to $503 million. ","Earnings per share of $2.32 was a quarterly record and rose 3% higher year-over-year despite flat year-over-year net income due to the net decrease in shares outstanding.","Investment management fees increased 5% from the prior quarter, consistent with the increase in average assets under management, a fairly stable effective fee rate, but this was partially offset by one less day in the quarter. ","Sales and distribution fees increased 12%. The asset-based component, which makes up about 2\/3 of this line, increased about 4%, and that's consistent with the increase in average assets under management and the number of days in the period. The sales-based component increased about 30% due to the strong increase in commissionable sales in the quarter, particularly in the United States.","Other net revenue was $10 million. The decrease from the prior quarter was mostly due to nonrecurring items of about $14 million, primarily related to the wind-down of our auto finance business and an accrual adjustment in our private equity business. ","As a reminder, we began consolidating certain private equity sponsored investment products this fiscal year, and as a result, we expect this line item to be higher than it was in 2011.","Operating expenses increased 11%, which was more than the increase in revenue for the quarter. 3\/4 of the increase in expense was due to sales, distribution and marketing expense that increased by $85 million. Almost half of the increase was related to higher sales and consistent with the increase in the sales component of sales and distribution fee revenue. ","The asset-based component increased $43.5 million. The asset-based expense growth typically outpaces revenue growth during the March quarter due to the relationship between revenue and expense as revenue is primarily earned based on the number of days in the quarter while expenses accrue on a monthly basis. Also included in this expense was $9 million of nonrecurring items.","Compensation and benefits increased to $323 million, reflecting the annual merit increases and higher payroll taxes, as expected. But most of the increase from last quarter was due to higher variable compensation, including commissions to employees due to increased sales. ","The information systems, technology and occupancy expense lines were in the range we expected. General, administrative and other expense increased $3.3 million, and while there are a number of moving parts in this line, the biggest driver of the increase was $6.2 million of expense related to the consolidation of sponsored products versus only $4.6 million last quarter.","Other income, net of noncontrolling interest, was $77.7 million this quarter, reflecting the strong market backdrop of the quarter. Two factors drove the increase from last quarter. First, equity method investments increased $16.6 million, but that was partially offset by other components such as lower dividend and interest income and available-for-sale investment gains. ","The second factor was higher gains in our seed portfolio reflected in trading investments, consolidated sponsored investment products. In the case of these seed investments on a net basis, we generally retain more of the gains and losses compared with noncurrent investments of consolidated sponsored investment products and variable interest entities as we generally have higher ownership in the former. ","Turning to Slide 19. The effective tax rate for the year-to-date period was 29.1%, a small increase from last quarter, resulting in a 29.3% effective tax rate for the quarter. ","The operating margin for the quarter was 34.3%. Cash and investments totaled $9.3 billion at March 31. However, that figure includes $1.5 billion of consolidated investments related to sponsored investment products and variable interest entities. ","Debt outstanding, net of liabilities related to those items, remained essentially unchanged at $1 billion. ","We repurchased another 1.1 million shares this quarter, decreasing shares outstanding 3% year-over-year. ","And that concludes our commentary on second quarter results. As always, if you have any questions or would like clarifications on our comments, please contact Investor Relations or Corporate Communications before the live call today. Their contact information is located in the presentation and the press release.

These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings.","This commentary was prerecorded.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Hello, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter Earnings Commentary. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO. Today, I'm joined by Ken Lewis, our CFO; and Vijay Advani, Executive Vice President of Global Advisory Services.","I am pleased to report a solid quarter of operating results to cap off a record year for the company in terms of revenue, operating income and net income. Assets under management ended the fiscal year near an all-time high, an increase of 13%, due to the strong investment performance of our funds both absolute and relative, and net new flows of $24 billion, a marked improvement from 2012. Although, there continues to be a number of headwinds facing asset managers, I'm encouraged by the improved flows to equity and hybrid strategies, which collectively had their strongest quarter of flows in 3 years, with net new flows of $5.6 billion. The improvement was due to steadily increasing sales, which were up 33% from the prior year, and net exchanges from fixed-income funds that helped to offset fixed-income outflows.","Importantly, Templeton Global equity performance continues to improve, with approximately 90% of assets ranked in the top 2 quartiles versus its peer group for the 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, and returned to positive flows for the first time in a while.","Turning to Slide 6. Overall relative investment performance of our U.S. retail fund range was little changed over the past 3 months despite the increased volatility we experienced. Franklin equity relative performance rankings improved this quarter, especially over the 1-year period. Long-term performance remained strong, notably among our larger dividend and income-paying products. The Franklin Income Fund continues to have great performance across all time periods, which benefits us at a time when investors are re-risking by transitioning into income-paying stock funds and hybrid products.","Templeton equity relative performance remains outstanding, especially global equity funds that have been overweight European equities, which outperform U.S. equities again this quarter.","Mutual Series equity performance generally improved but remains challenged versus its peer group over the short term. The long-term performance is strong. Mutual Series deep value approach, including the tendency to hold above-average cash, tends to underperform during periods of strong market appreciation and outperform during market declines. Risk-adjusted returns, though, continue to outperform the peer group and are a better measure of performance for these funds.","Taxable fixed-income relative investment performance remained strong, with the majority of assets in the top quartile across all time periods, including the Templeton Global Bond and Global Total Return Funds.","From a macro perspective, emerging markets experienced continued volatility for most of the quarter due to currency pressure caused by the U.S. Federal Reserve tapering expectations. When this did not materialize in September, markets rebounded strongly.","Tax-free fixed-income short-term relative investment performance continues to lag due primarily to the impact of rising rates given the longer duration of these funds. However, long-term relative performance in this category is exceptional, with 99% of the assets in the top 2 quartiles for the 10-year period.","Recently, our municipal bond funds have suffered selling pressure driven by the rising rate environment. Negative press on the muni bond market has been driven by narrowly focused headlines around Detroit and Puerto Rico, and this further contribute to the selling. Consequently, we view the current selloff as a reflection of weak demands stemming from fears of high interest rates and negative headlines, as opposed to a fundamental change in the underlying credit outlook for the asset class as a whole. Importantly, these funds are not without their appeal in this environment. We believe their tax-exempt nature may also be seen as more valuable to investors at a time when income taxes have increased.","Assets under management ended the period at almost $845 billion, a 4% increase from last quarter and 13% from the prior year. Average assets under management were $828 billion, a 14% increase from a year ago but 1% lower than the prior quarter.","The mix of assets under management by investment objective shifted toward equities in the quarter but remains well diversified, with a near 50-50 split between equities and fixed-income. It's also worth reiterating the point that our fixed-income business does not fit the stereotype of a rate-sensitive U.S.-based portfolio due to its weighting in nontraditional, global and international strategies, which are defensively positioned with respect to interest rates.","Assets under management by sales region were unchanged since last quarter.","Long-term net new flows turned negative this quarter due in part to a 47% decrease in sales in the global fixed-income strategies and an increase in redemptions from tax refunds, though total long-term redemptions actually decreased as investors paused in the face of heightened uncertainty. $400 million of long-term outflows were exchanged into cash management funds, which helped to limit total net new outflows to $2.7 billion. Market appreciation of $33 billion was the primary driver of the net increase of assets under management this quarter.","Now I'll turn it over to Vijay to give additional color on the flows.","Vijay Chandur Advani","Thanks, Greg. My comments refer to the data illustrated in Slides 11 to 14.","As Greg mentioned, similar to the industry, investor concerns over rising interest rates and fields of municipal defaults was the primary contributing factor to the outflows we experienced this quarter. That said, long-term sales of $215.6 billion for the fiscal year was just shy of the all-time high reported in 2011, and net new flows of $24.3 billion were one of our best years ever and a strong rebound for the modest net outflows reported last year. This quarter's flows, while at negative $2.7 billion, do illustrate the benefits of the diversification of our business.","In the U.S., municipal bond markets have been experiencing a negative feedback loop as fears of rising interest rates and consequent selling pressures caused yields to move higher, followed by a further selling pressure in the retail-dominated market. Regular headlines on Detroit's bankruptcy and Puerto Rico's debt obligation only added to the problem, leading to net new outflows of $5.4 billion from tax-free fixed-income funds.","Global fixed-income came under pressure during the quarter as sales slowed by almost half and redemptions moderated only later in the quarter. Our large flagship U.S.-registered and cross-border global fixed-income funds experienced volatility in performance last quarter, and again in August, which caused investors to pause. The decline in sales was most notably in the cross-border SICAV global bond and Global Total Return Funds. Their clients tend to be more reactive. This is reflected in international long-term sales that fell from their all-time high. The volatility in performance was driven primarily by fluctuations in currency valuations and not by expectations of rising interest rates.","In the current market environment, we leveraged a marketing campaign to talk to investors about strategies for investing in a rising rate environment.","U.S. fixed-income net new flows were up again this quarter as sales and redemptions both decreased, reflecting investor preference for shorter-duration and floating-rate funds. Floating-rate and high-yield offerings attracted solid inflows, which more than offset outflows from our longer-duration investment-grade strategies.","On a positive note, we saw increased sales activity in U.S. and global equity categories, with both generating positive net new flows for the quarter. We continued to discuss our popular Time to Take Stock campaign, promoting investor diversification into equities, which was adopted across our international businesses, with 21 countries leveraging the content and 15 countries publishing campaign-specific content on their local websites.","U.S. equity sales continued to trend upwards, increasing by more than 60% since the fourth quarter of 2012. In line with market improvements, redemptions declined and net new flows turned positive at $1.2 billion.","The Franklin Rising Dividends fund continues to be a strong seller, leading the category this quarter, with sales growing 10% from the previous quarter. The fund hit an all-time high in sales in the month of July. The Rising Dividends fund had $13 billion in assets under management as of September 30, 2013, compared with only $2 billion as recently as 2009.","Global equity also saw a return to positive net new flows of $1.2 billion after being in outflows last quarter. Our top-selling fund was our cross-border SICAV Franklin European Growth Fund, which had a very strong increase in sales and net new flows in excess of $1 billion, the second best flow gainer this quarter. Several European-centric funds such as the U.S. and cross-border versions of the mutual European fund and the Templeton Foreign Fund, which is heavily overweight Europe currently, were amongst the top-selling funds in the category.","We continue to promote the strength of our European equity product offering and are producing a new and more robust Franklin European equity story promoting the Pan-European local asset management team and the funds they manage. The mutual global discovery fund, one of our flagship funds in the global equity category, had a third straight quarter with solid long-term sales and inflows. In addition, this quarter, we saw net new flows in institutional accounts of $600 million.","Amid concerns over market volatility in emerging markets, the cross-border SICAV Templeton Asian Growth Fund and the cross-border SICAV Templeton China Fund experienced net outflows of $1.1 billion and $400 million, respectively.","Lastly, in the hybrid category, the Franklin Income Fund remains our top-selling fund. The fund recently celebrated its 65th anniversary, and we launched a campaign to highlight the benefits of the fund in providing a steady stream of income to investors throughout its history. We're also beginning a new retirement income campaign which will promote the fund as a core holding in generating income for investors and retirement. The cross-border SICAV version has also been gaining traction internationally and was the second best seller in the category this quarter.","We think of our business as a well-knit tapestry. Each region, asset class or fund may perform at a different pace or a different point in time, providing long-term depth and stability to our business model. This year, Europe continues to be a key driver of our sales.","Now I will hand it over to Ken to discuss operating results.","Kenneth Allan Lewis","All right, thank you, Vijay.","As Greg mentioned in his opening remarks, fiscal 2013 was a record year for revenue, operating income and net income. Total revenue of nearly $8 billion was a 12% increase from last year, driven by the strong growth of average assets under management of 15%. Operating income of $2.9 billion increased 16% and outpaced the growth of assets under management as we continue to focus on profitably growing the business over the long term. For the quarter, operating income was down 5% due mostly to seasonal expense increases.","Fiscal year net income increased 11% from the prior year, topping $2 billion for the first time. Earnings per share growth of 13% outpaced the increase of net income due to net share repurchases that have been about 2% accretive to earnings annually over the past 5 years.","For the quarter, net income was $509 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.80.","Now looking at revenue on Slide 17. Investment management fees were down 2% for the quarter, and there are a few moving parts to consider here. First, we had performance fees of $6.2 million and a small benefit from the additional day in the quarter. And this was offset by the decrease in average assets under management, as well as an adjustment for the classification of customer rebates of investment management, and sales and distribution fees that did not impact operating income or earnings. The total adjustment reduced the asset base component of sales and distribution expense by $47.4 million, with offsetting reductions to investment management fees of $31.2 million and sales and distribution fees of $16.2 million. About 3 quarters of each of these adjustments should be considered nonrecurring, as they reflect catch-ups for the full year.","Now sales and distribution fee revenue were $605 million this quarter, down 9% from the previous quarter. The asset-based revenue was essentially flat, excluding the impact of the accounting adjustments, with asset declines offset by a mix shift to equity and the impact of an additional day in the quarter. Most of the overall decline came from the sales-based revenue component due to lower U.S. and international commissionable sales. Shareholder servicing fees were down 3% due to a lower asset base and a decrease in the number of open accounts. Additionally, the number of closed accounts decreased due to the annual purge of approximately 1.2 million U.S.-based accounts in July.","Other net revenue was $19 million, and this was lower than prior periods due to decreases in dividend and interest income in certain consolidated sponsored investment products this quarter.","Now moving on to expenses on Slide 18. Operating expenses were down 5% overall for the quarter, but a couple of subcategories increased more than anticipated. The decrease in sales, distribution and marketing expense to $718 million was due mostly to the reclassification of investment management fee rebates to investment management and distribution fee revenue that I mentioned earlier. Again, no impact to operating income, but a decline in both the average assets under management and sales for the quarter also contributed to the decrease.","Compensation and benefits expense was little changed this quarter at $349 million. Information systems and technology expense was $58 million. This line tends to be seasonal, as we've discussed in the past, and this quarter was no exception. About half of the increase was driven by seasonal and one-off items.","In terms of the quarterly seasonal pattern, 2013 unfolded similar to 2012, with the aggregate annual spend up approximately 4.5%. We're expecting the historical seasonal spending pattern by quarter to continue in 2014 and also for general spending levels in this line to increase by 7% to 8%.","Occupancy expense was $35 million, up 3% over the prior quarter, reflecting higher energy use and rent expense, which reflects our global expansion in 2013. We expect this line item to also increase slightly in 2014 in the range of 3% to 5% for the full year.","General, administrative and other expense also tends to be seasonally higher in the fourth quarter but can also be difficult to predict because of the variety of expenses that are included here, including those that are market driven. This quarter's increase was mainly due to increased advertising and marketing expenses, as well as various legal and professional fees. And lastly, an additional $2.8 million increase in accounting adjustments relating to the amortization of intangibles also contributed to the increase. Now about $2 million of that is not expected to recur. Looking forward and assuming neutral markets, we would expect this line item to decrease slightly in 2014, as there were some unusual and nonrecurring items in 2013.","Other income, net of controlling interest, generated a net loss of $11.4 million this quarter compared with a loss of $3.3 million in the prior quarter. Slide 19 does a good job of illustrating the components, but this quarter, investment gains and losses were largely offsetting and we're essentially left with interest expense.","We incurred some fairly significant foreign exchange losses this quarter driven by the continued volatility in the currency markets. As a reminder, foreign exchange revaluations are part of the other category and were the primary contributor to the decrease in this category. It's worth mentioning that, on an annual basis, foreign exchange typically has an immaterial impact on our P&L, and that was true in 2013 as well.","Other net also included a nonrecurring charge of $4.5 million related to prepayment penalties on early retirement of Federal Home Loan Bank advances as we continue to wind-down our banking business. During the quarter, we also sold the related real estate mortgage loan portfolio to a third party and expect to close the sale of our brokered CDs this coming quarter.","Turning to Slide 20. The tax rate for the quarter was 29.4%, which brings the full year rate to 28.3%, which is in line with last quarter's guidance and essentially unchanged from 2012's rate. At this time, we anticipate the fiscal 2014 rate to be around 29%.","Now turning to Slide 21. We saw a 16% increase in operating income over the prior year, which was a record high of $2.9 billion. As our asset base has grown and as we build scale within key strategies and products, our revenue growth has outpaced corresponding expense growth, and that has contributed to our margin expansion over time. While it may appear as though the year-over-year effective investment management fee rate declined, the year-over-year operating income, in basis points of assets under management, actually increased by 0.5 basis points.","Moving on to capital management. The payout ratio was 64% for the fiscal year. During the quarter, we significantly increased the pace of share repurchases, buying additional 5.5 million post-split shares, which was more than we repurchased the prior 3 quarters combined, as we took advantage of a pullback in the stock and forward earnings multiple. The dividend payout remained consistent, but the Board of Directors did round up the last dividend to $0.10 per share, which represented a 3% increase from the prior quarter.","Net cash and investments increased $200 million this quarter to $7.3 billion. We understand investor questions about this growing number but continue to focus on returning available U.S. cash flow and believe that it is in the best interest of stockholders to maintain our current policy with respect to investing most foreign-sourced earnings given the substantial tax penalty that will result from investing that cash in the United States under current U.S. corporate tax structure.","So that concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for taking the time to listen.

My name is John, and I'll be your conference operator today. Please note that the financial results to be discussed in this conference call are preliminary.","Statements made in this conference call regarding Franklin Resources Inc., which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.","These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including -- in the risk factors and MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. [Operator Instructions]","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, thank you. Hello, and welcome to the call this morning. I'm joined by Ken Lewis, our CFO. The first quarter was a strong start to this year as we again reached new highs [ph] for revenue, operating income and earnings per share. Overall investment performance remained strong, and we are pleased with the traction in equity and hybrid flows, which were the strongest since '07.","I'd now like to open it up for your questions.","Operator","Our first question comes from Luke Montgomery from Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I guess I'm also a little surprised there's no special dividend in December. So maybe just a comment on what went into that decision, whether it reflects U.S. cash balance constraints. And I realize the board is not scheduled to meet again until March. So maybe you don't have total clarity, but I'm wondering if not doing it in December means the likelihood of a special is pretty much off the table in 2014? And then also you said in the prerecorded remarks, there's no change in your approach to capital management, but just wondering what you might be thinking in terms of the mix of dividends and buybacks going forward?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Okay, sure. This is Ken. I'll take that. Regarding the special, I think when we looked back in the past specials a few years ago, a lot of it was driven by coming -- new tax regulations and wanting to take advantage of that. That was clearly not on the table this year. I don't think that it indicates any change at all in our capital management approach. We continue to systematically reduce our share count over time. We've continued to grow the dividend at a rapid pace. It's increased every year since our first dividend in 1981. We'll continue that. I wouldn't say anything is off the table. I think that the board will consider, will look at all -- the whole mix of our capital management, the share repurchases, the dividend growth, and at that time, they'll see if they want to do a special dividend or not. I wouldn't rule it out, but I certainly don't think that it's going to be part of our -- a recurring thing because that's why they're specials.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Helpful. And then just to ticky-tack one [ph] on the tax rate, it was a bit higher this quarter. You called that a mix shift in earnings and then some impact from noncontrolling interests. Maybe just a little color on -- is that more revenue moving to the U.S. and perhaps what you expect for the tax rate going forward, and whether the drivers you said will continue or be -- maybe even less favorable?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes, I think it's real hard -- challenging for us in the beginning of the year to get an estimate of where the earning mix will be in the quarter. But based on the first quarter, we did project that the earnings mix will be higher, it probably accounted for about 0.5 point. There were kind of ins and outs as well, but there was also a little bit of an increase in a couple of states that put pressure on the rate, maybe about 1\/4 of 1%, 20-25 basis points. So that's why we are projecting 29.8% in that range, a little bit higher than it has been in the past year. And I think that the question about the U.S. earnings is true. I think we will have some -- we're expecting to have some higher mix in the U.S. and also that should bring some more cash into the U.S. as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You talked about the regulatory changes that allowed you to start marketing products managed outside of China to Chinese insurance companies, and just to be clear, I believe you're referring to business that's managed outside of your joint venture with Sealand, right?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","That's correct. It's just an opening up of the insurance companies that we actually have had good relationships with for years. We have a joint venture with China Life, and we've been very active in anticipating this opening up where the insurance companies can now use outside managers for their own assets. We think that, that could have a real nice impact for institutional flows out of there.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And does that have to go through a QDII structure? Or can you just go directly?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","No. It can go directly.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just a follow-up on the operating margin. How high are the incremental margins on some of your largest funds that have very large scale, like Templeton Global Bond, Franklin Income Asia Growth?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I think the large funds do add to the scalability of the company. I think when you look at margins, one of the things, if you compare it maybe this quarter to the same quarter last year, which should rule out any variations due to seasonality, one of the things that was unique this quarter was a lot of the increase was due to market. And so you're not going to have that pressure you might have on the sales and distribution line that you'd have if the mix was more balanced between sales and market appreciation. So I think that, if you were to compare this year versus last, it's probably the biggest driver of the margin expansion.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. But on the incremental margins for this product, is it materially higher? I imagine it is, versus kind of the 38% range you're at now.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","It's tough to say. It depends on the fund itself. But certainly -- and it depends on where it's sold, where the vehicle is registered. But clearly, it's better for us to sell the big -- to have revenue come from the bigger funds because the smaller funds and the local asset funds, they're kind of just growing and trying to reach that scale.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Katz from Citi.","Steve Fullerton","This is Steve Fullerton filling in for Bill. First question, I just want -- if you guys can review the decision of the bundling of services in Canada. What drove the decision, and what might be the impact to margins or flows?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes, so that was -- just looking at the market, we probably -- a lot of the big banks had gone to that standardized management -- administration fee. The thinking there is that it provides more predictability in terms of the TER rate. You're always going to have a set expense ratio, and advisors typically like that. They don't like to be surprised. The old method was the funds would pay expenses as they came up, and so you might have -- there'd be a little lumpiness in their TER rate from period to period. So it's just an easier way to predict the TER rates for the funds and compare them across the landscape in Canada. It's unique to Canada. We don't see that in any other jurisdiction. It's just driven by market.","Steve Fullerton","Okay, great. And then are you seeing a big pickup in retail alternatives [ph] ? Where's the opportunities? Are there any early successes to start the year here?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes, I'll take a start at this, Ken. We launched the K2 Retail Fund in November. There's been a lot of interest in it. These things take a while to get on platforms, but it is now on 41 platforms. I think the fund is about $300 million. Performance has been great in that fund. And that's -- so that's why it's getting a lot of interest. In terms of seeing significant flows, I think across the whole industry, we're not really seeing that yet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier from Bank of America.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. You hit on this on the prerecorded call to some extent, I just wanted to get your sense. There's been a lot of volatility on the EM side this month and if we think about 2013, those markets have underperformed. You guys have still held up relatively well. I just want to get your sense in terms of what you've been doing kind of on the client side to explain whether it's on the Templeton side or the Global Fixed Income, how you guys are managing through some of this volatility? And then if you look past -- in the past, in terms of experiences where we've had this type of environment where you do have a pickup in volatility, how do the clients typically react in your products? And are there areas that they'll kind of hide in temporarily before they kind of move back into these riskier areas?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","I think, first of all, you got to remember that most people that own emerging markets own them with a relatively small percentage of their portfolio. They understand that you have more volatility. And a lot of people, a lot of investors also look for points when you have -- because when you have sell-offs in these markets, they tend to be a bit more dramatic and create nice price points to get in or to add more. So I don't think you have a big education issue out there. I think we're out there talking about the growth. I mean the growth is slower, but it's still double that of developing markets. We think it will be an excellent market for stock-picking. Because the old way, you kind of looked at emerging markets, and when you had the capital going out, all of the currencies were under pressure. They relied on outside capital. Today, you don't have that. You can really differentiate between the countries. So that's the story we are talking about now is that when you have these blanket selloffs and everybody's saying, \"Let's invest in the Developing Markets.\" The entire market gets hit. And that's kind of what we're seeing today. And you can really distinguish -- and that's the same with that Global Bond Fund as well, that all of these currencies will get hit. But some of them are much healthier than even the developing markets. And I think that's been the big change over the last decade or 2, and that's the story that we are talking about. For us, it's still emerging markets are 5% of the overall assets. And I think the other point I would make, obviously, Global Bond would include that much higher number. But Templeton, the Templeton equity side, which had continued to have excellent performance through this selloff, is underweighted in that area right now and probably that's something they're looking at. But they've been well positioned for this. I don't think it necessarily means that you're going to see a big pickup in redemptions due to the more -- due to the volatility. And it really hasn't been that great yet. It could be much greater.","Steve Fullerton","Okay. That's helpful color. And then, Ken, maybe -- I think you noted this quarter performance fees ticked up a bit. Given some of the product launches and what you have in the AUM now versus historically, should we be seeing a higher level of these performance fees? And just remind us of any seasonality that you typically experience.","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes, sure. I think particularly with the acquisition of K2, we'll be mentioning performance fees more than we have in the past. The biggest quarter for them, and I guess historically for us too, is December. And I mentioned, they were [ph] about $22 million. The next biggest, for K2 anyway, is June. And we also have a couple of other products that we would have performance fees in June, and then maybe a little bit in the quarter that ends March. So in order of magnitude, last quarter probably the -- we'd expect the biggest performance fees, then June and then March.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Kim from Sandler O'Neill.","James Howley","This is actually James Howley filling in for Michael this morning. I appreciate some of the color you guys gave around some of the retail mix shift on the prerecorded. But I wanted to sort of focus on the Institutional business. Are you sort of seeing any meaningful shifts in allocation trends in the RFP that you've seen come across? And can you sort of update us on the level of the pipeline relative to past quarters? And then maybe any color on the underlying mix there?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes, I mean I'll start with, I think, the Institutional business, as you can see from the numbers, had a very strong quarter with over $3 billion in net inflows. And I think as far as the pipeline, I mean I haven't heard or seen any real change in around the RFPs. I think for us, it continues to be the strength around Global Equities and continuing to leverage on the improvements in our performance on the Templeton side, and then really, the bond side as well. I mean you're still seeing surges there despite the headwinds of rising rates in the bond market. So we haven't really seen -- I think we get a lot of other RFPs just in specific areas that people want exposure to, but the real drivers for us continue to be global equities and global bonds.","James Howley","Great. And then sort of just turning to product development. Obviously, interesting with the Asian income fund that you called out. It's going to be [indiscernible] side of Hong Kong. Is there any way to size that opportunity at this point?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Well, I just think we feel like that market will continue to develop, both in liquidity and offerings. And also as investors get more sophisticated, that fixed-income is a nice way to lower risk in a portfolio. And how quickly it evolves? I think it's already -- we've seen decent flows into that and decent demand, but we really don't try to guess how quickly or what the market is going to look like in a few years. Just I think it -- like many markets as they mature, there'll be a greater demand for fixed-income from retail.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","In recent quarters, you've gone to great lengths to highlight the risks other than interest rates that you manage inside your large fixed-income funds. You've had your senior leaders on the call and talked about credit risk and currency risk and perhaps other risks other than interest rates, yet the outflows were substantial in fixed income. Does this surprise you and disappoint you? Or should we think of this as to be expected, notwithstanding the efforts you have made to highlight the noninterest rate-related risks?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, I mean, I think that's -- it's always a challenge, and I think it's also a challenge when you don't really have the visibility of the underlying portfolio. And you take the case for us, where Europe has been the big driver of a lot of the global bond net flows, and that's been the area where we've seen the heaviest outflows. And I think our feeling is that the weighting of the underlying investor was probably higher to that category and less to equities, and the strength of certainly European equities for Europeans. A lot of people, and we've seen it in the exchange activity as well, had the confidence to get back into equities, and they may have had high-weighting to areas like global bond, which may have been somewhat of a holding area for them, and move back into equities on the strength of Europe over the last year. We've certainly seen that in the exchange activity. The point is, when you look at a portfolio, right or wrong, an unconstrained bond fund, a Global Bond Fund is still going to be put in the fixed income category. And somebody looks at that and says, \"Well, we have a weighting of x%, maybe we got to take it down a little bit,\" then they take down everything a little bit. I think that's what's happened. And in Europe especially, where it's more gatekeeper-consultant type-driven for portfolio allocations. I think it's just what we've -- again, what we've seen talking to the big banks is that they've just lowered their exposure to fixed income and that kind of takes everything down with it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on sort of MiFID and the impacts it may have on RDR. I guess, first of all, just basically with RDR being like fully in effect this Jan 1. Have you seen, in places where RDR is in effect and where you have sales, does it matter? Has it been having an effect on either the composition or the sales that you have in those RDR regions?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I think it's probably a little early for us, and the hard part is because of the volatility in the marketplace, especially in our 2 strong areas in Europe, which would be Asian Growth and Global bond. It's hard to draw really any conclusions on what the effect of RDR and the new share classes are having on that. I mean talking to our distributors, I think they feel that it shouldn't have a big impact. But I think it certainly is a big change and could have some impact. But I think it's just, again, too early in a month with the kind of volatility that we've seen, especially for our 2 strongest areas, to draw any conclusions right now.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then assuming, we don't know if it matters or not, MiFID II seems to be incompatible with RDR. Any views on just RDR get overwritten by MiFID. It seems like MiFID enhances disclosure but no ban on third-party inducements. Just any opinion on what happens on the regulatory front given the kind of conflicting regulations?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, I don't really have a strong opinion, one way. I think those are things that should be worked out. I don't think you're going to have 2 conflicting major rules out there. And a lot of work is still to be done on that. So I'm hopeful that we'll come out with one view.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Lee from KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","A quick question, maybe going back to capital management. In the past, you guys have been pretty opportunistic of putting some term debt on the balance sheet and kind of using the proceeds to -- for the most part to buy back stock or fund the special dividend over time. And if I look at today, most of your existing term debt, I know you have some coming due in '15, but it's termed out, business has continued to grow, maybe generating a bit more earnings in the U.S, or expected to going forward. What's your willingness or appetite to maybe kind of contained incrementally -- add some incremental term debt and maybe take advantage of still cheap funding and use that to add to the share repurchase over the near term?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","It certainly -- it's certainly a tool that we could use, and I don't think that there's any particular resistance to doing that. On the other hand, there's no plans to do it either. And we've done it in the past. So I think there's -- in our opportunistic approach to share repurchases, on one hand when we see tremendous opportunity, that's certainly something that we would consider to do. Because we could withstand -- it wouldn't put the rating in jeopardy and -- I think the interest rates are still low, as you mentioned. So we would consider it.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And maybe, if we think of the U.S., non-U.S. split in terms of cash generation. Again, you kind of suggested that it's increasing somewhat in the U.S. relative to outside of the U.S. How should we -- if you're looking ahead at this year, looking at cash that's available to fund repurchases or dividends. Are we starting to get to the point where 60% is coming from the U.S.? Or is this still in the 50-50 range? So how should we think of that?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes, I think it could be -- I would expect it to be a little bit -- the U.S. cash earnings rate to be a little bit higher than it was last year. And I think part of that is due to some changes in the tax rate. We saw the tax rate go up a little bit. And I think we'll see a little bit more cash in the U.S. But I don't think it will get to the 60% number that you were talking about.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And one last question, maybe, Greg, for you. I'm just kind of curious about muni flows. You did touch upon it in the prepared remarks. How confident do you feel that -- I mean it's been a big source of outflows last year, but is that you're really turning the corner, not just maybe some seasonality, but maybe you're setting up for a possible sustained improvement. Maybe even turning it to inflows. Is that something you feel pretty confident about?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I don't know I feel confident at this stage. I think the -- it's still just the headline -- headwinds that the market faces. And to me, people and investors need to differentiate what's happening in the muni market. Overall, the municipal bond market is much healthier than it was a few years ago. Yet the markets and spreads and everything are much wider because of the specific risk -- risks with certain bonds. But the states are much healthier. The surpluses, in many states, have been created. The budgets look a lot better. I think that message is one we're doing our best to get out in the marketplace. And then at some point, you have higher taxes this year. So all of those with the relative -- the after-tax yields just make them look attractive. How quickly investors come back? We saw a major drop in the redemption rate quarter-over-quarter. We saw an improvement in net flow rate, but we didn't see -- we saw a continued drop in sales. I guess that's good news for some, at least, hanging in there. But we need to attract new money in. And I think, I've said this before in fixed-income, when things stabilize and the markets and people look at how attractive these yields are on an after-yield basis, I think you will get investors moving back faster. But it's hard to say. I'm just like you, I'm hopeful it happens this year. But I think there is some headwind just on the perception of rates and getting through tapering and what that means.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Freeman from Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just back on EM, I think one of your earlier responses you mentioned is your education efforts. I'm just wondering, versus a couple of years ago when we saw some volatility in EM, would you say the investor\/advisor base understands the product somewhat or a lot better than at that time?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think they do. And then most of our assets are through an advisor that's sitting down with that client. And I think, again, if you look at the historic volatility, it hasn't been a major drop. It's been a, from a relative performance, it's a huge differential. But it hasn't been a big loss of money for most investors at this stage. So I think that's helpful in keeping assets as well. But I just think we've got to go back to the long-term fundamentals of growth versus developing markets, and again, how you can differentiate areas around the globe where there is opportunity. So to me, long-term investor needs exposure to market that are growing twice as fast. And I think they do have the understanding that these are more volatile, and you will get, hopefully, they're a smaller percentage of the investor's portfolio.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And I may have missed any comments about this, but I'm just wondering how you're thinking about positioning the domestic equity product this year. Are there any particular marketing pushes? You've had a couple in the last 2 years.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, I mean, I think we're pleased with the progress of the positioning and our equity net flows were $3.6 billion this quarter, which is very strong for the firm. We have been consistent with our message on equities. Really, that's been the core of our marketing campaign over the last 4, 5 years. And the work that we've done to get these positioned in 401(k) platforms, I think, is paying off. So there's not a whole lot of change in our story. We've also been positioning the portfolios for rising rates, and that's been part of our marketing campaign, where we've talked about how to position portfolios in a rising rate environment, and give them alternatives. And we've seen the strength in many different areas, Global Total Return Fund, a lot of new hybrid funds, that because of those marketing efforts, I think there's an awareness of other types of fixed-income alternatives.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Quick question on capital management here, or I guess I should say another question. I'd appreciate if you guys could help me understand, it seems like your payout ratio is below what you've indicated in the past as a target. And from the Q, it looks like cash continues to build in the U.S., now it's like $2.4 billion. So I guess, can you help me understand why not step up the buybacks here? Why not -- I mean, Ben, your stock with trailed peers [ph]? So maybe help me understand the decision behind that?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","I think when you look at what's been going on in the market in the last 2 quarters, and I think last quarter, the S&P was up around over 10%. We're typically, because we are opportunistic so our share activity will typically be lower in rising markets like that. That doesn't change at all. Our philosophy, I think that in markets that we're experienced [ph] in the last couple of weeks, we would look for opportunities to buy more stock. So that's -- if you just look at our historical experience, I think you'll see that. And so we are committed to reducing the share count through repurchase activity and growing the dividend. And I think there's no change to that. Now in terms of the payout ratio, I think what we saw was the rolling -- the graph that we do is a rolling 12 months -- the special dividend rolled off there, so that's why you're seeing that drop down. But that's certainly something that management and the board will look at going forward. And depending on what happens with share repurchases and stuff, we'll take some action and we'll consider that [ph] to do something different.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then on mutual series, and especially given the fact that it certainly looks like outlook for returns in the U.S. versus the rest of the world looks good and we're starting to see some increased flow activity in equities. What can you guys do to turn around the performance of Mutual Series? And maybe help us understand what's driven the underperformance versus the peer group? And how you can kind of get that turned around in order to capitalize on this better environment for equities here?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I think, first of all, Mutual Series is kind of hard to put into a clean category for comparison because, historically, the big U.S. equity funds do have exposure to Europe. And as we've said on previous calls, while Europe has been a very good market, the only one it hasn't outperformed has been the U.S. So when you compare that -- those funds, the S&P 500, that exposure will continue to have a drag. They also tend to have a little bit higher cash, and that's been used very effectively in building long-term returns over the past. And Mutual Series lags in rising markets. I think for January, you'll probably see a different story if the markets continue to be under pressure. Mutual Series and those returns will start to rise to the top. And I think it is a different investor. We spent a lot of time talking about the long-term returns and lower-than-market risk that Mutual Series offers, and I think if you get an investor that doesn't like as much volatility, that's the type of investor that will go to Mutual Series. So it's really just the combination of the types of markets that we've had. If Europe continues to perform well, that will bode well for how Mutual Series funds do. And if the U.S. markets continue to sell off, that will help relative performance as well. So I think when we look at attribution there and stock-picking, they continue to do a very good job of that, that's the message that we want to get out there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marc Irizarry from Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Greg, just a question. You gave some nice color on muni flows and growth versus -- growth sales versus redemptions. Any color from the channel in terms of where that money is going? Are you keeping it in -- within the Franklin family?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think we've certainly seen a much higher level of exchanges, some of that into the intermediate funds. But I think it's hard again when we sell through advisors, and some of that -- they may be moving it to shorter-term cash and other types of unconstrained bond funds. Certainly, that's where we've seen more exchange activity -- or hybrid funds that have exposure to equities, as well as some yield. I think those are the areas that continue to be strong. And I think that's an interesting trend really, even in a rising rate environment, that you saw the strength of hybrid funds. And usually, the higher income funds would still be under pressure like any fixed income in that environment, yet I think that's where a lot of the rotation is occurring. It's not just taking a fixed-income investor and just moving into equities, or into 0 money market balances. It's moving into hybrid assets, it will still give them some of that equity uplift but have a decent current yield on them as well. So I think that's a notable short-term trend is the strength of hybrid on the exchange activity.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Okay.

Thank you, Mr. Johnson. You may now begin.","Greg Johnson","Well, good morning and thank you for joining Ken Lewis and me today to discuss first quarter earnings. Although we faced a number of headwinds impacting investment performance and flows, we\u2019ve been through periods like this before. And it\u2019s one of the reasons we value diversification and a strong balance sheet.","As we work through these challenges, and maintain our focus on expense management, we will continue to invest in a number of long-term growth opportunities, including strategic beta ETF, liquid alternatives and related solutions while delivering our value-added services to a growing customer base around the world.","And now, Ken and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Michael Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","All right, thanks guys. Greg, maybe first one for you, just on the flows in the quarter and the outlook, you hit a few things on the pre-recorded call. But it sounds like the institutional business continues to gain some traction. So just wanted to get an update on maybe the pipeline and what you\u2019re seeing on that front. And particularly given maybe some of the pressures in the market in where institutions are looking to put some money?","And then on the retail side, it seems like the pressure on Franklin income and Global Bond, it has been out there, it seems like there is more outreach to the client base, and just any kind of reaction to that?","Greg Johnson","Normal searches with Global Ag and global equities. I think of note, and what has happened over the last say three to six months, some of the pressure on global currencies, affecting various countries and then looking for those countries to diversify, I think we\u2019re seeing more opportunities in the Global Bond space in Asia right now, as those currencies have been hit and with further risk of some going down to diversify away from their local currency.","I think anytime you have periods where you face challenges and headwinds in performance, certainly a risk-off environment that any income funds that have heavy - high-yield exposure are going to be under pressure. And we just want to make sure we communicate the value and really the appropriate kind of understanding of risk in those funds.","And when you get the kind of spreads that you have today, from treasury, as you do have room for even some defaults and those and still continue to do very well against treasury. We think the markets have been under stress certainly in these areas as expected, Franklin Income Fund affects any high-yield funds like our high-income fund. And we just want to make sure that we continue to get as much information out there and hand-holding to help advisors deal with their clients right now.","Michael Carrier","All right, thanks. When you hit on the institutional question, I don\u2019t know, my phone wasn\u2019t working I didn\u2019t hear the start of that. So, I didn\u2019t know if you mentioned anything on the pipeline?","Greg Johnson","Well, I think, I would say the pipeline, the opportunities in the pipeline would be more global bond opportunities like the win that we had in Asia over the quarter, we\u2019re just seeing more interest whether it\u2019s Sovereign Wealth Funds or government entities in diversifying from their own currencies that are under pressure right now.","Michael Carrier","Okay, got it, and then Ken, just a quick one for you. Given the pace of the buybacks, just wanted to see if you can give us an update on maybe the U.S. versus the non-U.S. cash balance. And just given the level of cash flow you\u2019re generating what\u2019s the outlook on buybacks?","Ken Lewis","Sure. So, the buyback activity is in relative to history, it\u2019s been pretty elevated last two quarters. And I could essentially say that U.S. cash has remained unchanged. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s remained unchanged year-over-year as well. So, we\u2019ve been having plenty of U.S. cash generation to cover our needs.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks, good morning. I just want to follow-up on the Weddell news yesterday because you guys also have a high composition of A-class mutual funds. So, I\u2019m just wondering, do you have any load waved A-s that currently sit in fee-based accounts?","Greg Johnson","Yes, we do. And that\u2019s been a growing portion of our sales as more advisors have gone to the wrap advisory fee accounts.","Craig Siegenthaler","Do you see need in the future of those transitioning from a low-wave A to I-class or is your rev-share less?","Greg Johnson","I don\u2019t, I mean I think part of the reaction I don\u2019t want to speak for Weddell. But for us, remains to be seen on the fiduciary rule which we have I think - we\u2019re expecting something out in 90 days on that. But we don\u2019t think it would affect our existing A-shares in any way. And if, there are different rules around use of those in advisory programs, we already the no 12b-1 class available. So it would be easy.","It\u2019s really, I mean, for us, it\u2019s up to the broker dealers and advisors to interpret those rules to best fit their business models, but I think we would have all the share classes and we do that right now.","Craig Siegenthaler","And then, I don\u2019t know if you have this number handy, but if I look at your U.S. mutual fund business, do you have the mix that sits in fee based accounts and the mix that sits in commission based accounts?","Greg Johnson","I don\u2019t right now. I think the, I just looked at the number, on the top of my head, it said right now we have about 40% of sales going into the no 12b-1 share class. And that\u2019s grown from 30% in the prior year. I would still say that our A-share count is higher with the 12b-1 just due to our distribution model and our strong partnership with Edward Jones that still favors that class.","Ken Lewis","And can I just add that it does also vary by fund on that mix.","Craig Siegenthaler","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.","Greg Johnson","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Bill Katz of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Bill Katz","Okay, thanks, I appreciate guys taking the questions, good morning. Ken, I\u2019ll start with you, you\u2019ve given a little bit of expense updated expense guidance in the pre-recorded call, I appreciate that.","Could you talk a little bit about I guess some disclosure was given through the 10-Q. Some of the disclosure, where the severance is occurring and if the markets, and what are your underlying assumptions for markets with this guidance and I guess the markets would have continued to still work themselves lower. What kind of incremental flexibility would you have to try and protect margins?","Ken Lewis","Well, I think, regarding where the expenses been incurred, I think geographically maybe the majority of the expense is U.S. based. Across business lines, it hasn\u2019t, we haven\u2019t really impacted the investment management sector of our business. It\u2019s been spread out pretty much across the board other than investment management.","So, the assumptions regarding, we talked about a target of 3% to 4%, and that was few months ago. What this market volatility has led us to conclude is that we should just be looking at all of our business and seeing where we can increase efficiencies, leverage efficiencies and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing and that\u2019s going to be a theme for probably the next nine months. And that\u2019s just based on the volatility we\u2019re not assuming that market is going to go up or down. But it\u2019s obvious to let that volatile so we need to be looking at our expenses closely.","Bill Katz","So, is there, if the markets were, just to clarify, if the markets were to sort of continue to work their way lower away from volatility, so down returning for the short-term, could you, is there more levers to pull to sort of protect the margin?","Ken Lewis","Well, we think there are more levers to pull but as I said, it\u2019s just - we\u2019re looking at the entire business almost without regard to the markets. So it\u2019s just an opportunity for us to make sure that initiatives that we started years ago, we still believe in investing things that we believe in now, and just try to kind of reengineer all of our processes.","Bill Katz","Got you. And just to follow-up to Craig\u2019s question, your thoughts here. Your very big picture, you\u2019re doing a nice job in some of these ancillary businesses, K2 continues to grow, you\u2019re sort of investing in I guess smart data portfolios.","But when you step back and look at your portfolio, you do have a lot of relatively sizeable flagship retail funds with some choppy sort of short intermediate term performance. What measures are you taking to try and protect those assets particularly in the retail channel? And then, sort of corollary, any thoughts of maybe ramping up the marketing spend, or was that just sort of wasted dollars as given the backdrop with the only way down?","Greg Johnson","I think it\u2019s a good question, and one that was really performance driven like anything in this business. And we\u2019re on our 10th year now of growth outperforming value. And you kind of look for a glimmer of light out there hope. And certainly in January, it\u2019s been very choppy market value did outperform growth for the first time.","So I mean that would be the kind of the key driver to get more attention to some of these flagship funds that have been lagging. And we looked at some of the big laggers that have been in January, made some ground, back with rising dividends, mutual shares and mutual quests had a very strong January. So I think if that trend continues, that would be important.","I think the other part, as Ken said is really looking at our entire business and validating everything we\u2019re doing. And I think part of the changing distribution landscape advisors, looking at our industry and what they need differently, I think if you have redundancy with certain funds or it\u2019s just not clear, what that fund offers in various categories that advisors need, we may need to tune some of the line-up or merge some of the line-up. And that\u2019s something that we really are looking at now. And that can drive some cost savings ultimately longer-term as well.","Bill Katz","All right, thank you guys.","Greg Johnson","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Michael Kim, Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Michael Kim","Hi, guys, good morning. So, first, Greg, on the pre-recorded call, you highlighted some initiatives to better position the institutional business by building out some infrastructure optimizing the product line-up. You also alluded to pricing. So I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us a bit more color in terms of how you might be thinking about either the level or structural fees in that channel and just kind of the potential impact from an economic standpoint as you move through that process.","Greg Johnson","I think that\u2019s always a challenge on the pricing side especially when you have funds in the marketplace and sensitivity to making sure we have consistent pricing across. I think the comment was just more on some of the development that we\u2019ve been doing also with the Smart beta ETF as I said before, I mean, I think that allows us to get some lower cost vehicles out there that have market beta at a much lower cost. And that\u2019s going to be attractive to certain institutions as well as within our solutions and outcome group.","But I think the, I don\u2019t think there is anything really to call out on the pricing side that we look at, I think we continue to study the markets and try to be competitive. And then we all know the pressure on lower fees continues. And we\u2019re trying to meet that or develop new capabilities that don\u2019t conflict with some of the retail styles that we can build-out capabilities.","Michael Kim","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then also on last quarter\u2019s call, I think you mentioned about a third of the $17 billion in sort of the sub-advisory variable annuity channel was at risk. So, just following sort of the $5 billion redemption last quarter, does that suggest that sort of related AUM at risk from here is the minimums or immaterial at this point?","Greg Johnson","I think there is still probably another $5 billion at risk right now with one of them, but, and from there, I think we have today low 40s, $42 billion in those sub-advised assets, that\u2019s 6% of our base. And I think of risk, I\u2019d put another $5 billion for the changes that are taking place in that market.","Hopefully the other side of that is we are because of build-out we have with our solutions group and some of the development, and we just got our first mandate of managed volatility fund, so that is an area that hopefully we can more than make up the loss of the $5 billion coming up.","Michael Kim","Got it, okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Worthington","Hi, just first simply on the new marketing materials that you gave out on Global Bond and the Income Fund. When was that rolled out and then you said in the prepared remarks that there was good engagement and interest by clients. What does that really mean? Are you actually seeing any indication that redemptions are slowing or sales are increasing? Thank you.","Greg Johnson","I think we rolled it out right around the end of the year, around January 1. So, early to quantify any behavioral changes there. I think what we\u2019re trying to do is get the tools in the advisors\u2019 hands so they can quickly sit down with their clients and walk them through logic on why you would stay put in a period where there is a lot of headlines around high-yield and stress and liquidity and make sure that they have a broad understanding of what is going on with those funds.","I think the other point I would make just around, because I think that\u2019s the question I would look at is when would, you see your flagship flows returning. And I think when I look at the income fund, its long history and it is a well-diversified portfolio.","But it\u2019s always one that doesn\u2019t fit neatly in any category. It will always have high-yield exposure and it will always be the, what the highest yielding in its category. So, it would be naturally a little bit more risky than its peer group. So you will expect to have periods where it lags performance.","I think the other side of fixed income I\u2019ve said before, when the market settle and high-yield settles, and you\u2019ll have very attractive spreads to what certainly treasuries are today. And you\u2019ll have a 6 plus yield on a fund that\u2019s done very well long-term. I think it\u2019s very easy to get momentum back in flows, little bit easier than an equity fund that just the attractiveness of that coupon and the history. And that\u2019s where I would expect to see a turn.","So, I think it\u2019s really just when the market settle, when the high-yield bond market settles in, I would expect to see that fund start to get lower redemptions and hopefully better sales.","Ken Worthington","Great, thank you. And then on the, I guess from now $5.5 billion mandate which I believe all that funded this quarter. There was the initial amount then there was like a stub piece that was added. What is the potential here for more money being mandated from this investor? It would seem like there is a lot of money out there, change in strategy, I guess my erroneous view is that that was kind of a one-time thing. But does this have the potential to be the gift that keeps on giving here for couple of years?","Greg Johnson","Yes, and I think not only that, that relationship but other institutional mandates in that market as well. And it\u2019s a high-profile relationship there that gives us better visibility in that market. So, hopefully we can extend that into a few more relationships. But it\u2019s one that we hope we\u2019ll grow.","Ken Worthington","Okay, awesome. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ken Hill of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Ken Hill","Hi, good morning guys.","Greg Johnson","Good morning.","Ken Lewis","Hello.","Ken Hill","In the pre-recorded comments you mentioned a new head of global ETFs and then the registration of the strategic beta ETFs. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how you\u2019re looking to package those with some of your active products and what you\u2019re hearing from clients, maybe the demand for it ahead of a launch like that?","Greg Johnson","Well, I think the need whether we use someone else\u2019s ETF or our own between, in our own line-up we know we have the need for lower cost beta in outcome oriented or solutions type products. So that\u2019s something that we feel we have an immediate place for those ETFs.","And then, I think it will take more time and marketing to develop more presence and probably a broader line-up. But it\u2019s just our first step into the ones that we think, internally, we don\u2019t have to go out and use somebody else\u2019s ETF, we can use these and that there is some demand from the retail channel as well. I wouldn\u2019t try to quantify that right now but enough immediately to make it meaningful to us.","Ken Hill","Okay. And then last quarter you guys spoke about potential acquisitions. Just wondering how the thought process there might have evolved, given how you look at repurchases and capital returns with the stock price and then also the value of other companies you might be looking to purchase there to fill in perceived gaps maybe. Does that look better or worse than it did last quarter and how are you thinking about that for the course of the year?","Greg Johnson","I wouldn\u2019t, I think it is unchanged, kind of the strategy, how we look at M&A, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed. I don\u2019t think the level of repurchases changes that. As we always say, and we say we\u2019re opportunistic, one of the facts is the share price and the market. But the other factor is what are the uses of cash, if we were identify a target then we would probably scout back on the repurchases to balance it out. But, we continue to look for opportunities in M&A and that hasn\u2019t changed.","Ken Lewis","And I would say from my perspective, it\u2019s more probable just based on what\u2019s happened in the marketplace. Unfortunately we\u2019ve been sitting with a lot of cash and that puts you in a unique position.","And I think with the sell-off and a lot of asset managers and the sell-off in currencies around the globe, the potential for doing something I think is a lot more attractive today, just looking at currency moves around the globe than it was before. So, we are actively out there and are hopeful that something will come that enhances the line-up and adds value long-term.","Ken Hill","Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dan Fannon","Thanks; good morning. Ken, I guess a couple of specific modeling items. The G&A you mentioned on the pre-recorded call, there was a one-time item that boosted it. If you could give us a sense of what the starting point is normalized going forward?","Ken Lewis","Yes, I think we would expect that line to be more like it was in 2015 on a quarterly basis than what it was this quarter. Maybe that implies I don\u2019t know the exact number of the item but probably in the neighborhood of $10 million.","Dan Fannon","Okay. And then just to follow-up on the last comment on M&A. Can you talk about some of the things you find interesting, whether it be from a product perspective, geography or is it just scale? Like how do we think about what you view as realistic in terms of adding to your existing suite of products?","Greg Johnson","I think it\u2019s really all the above, I mean, it could be a large scale that you get efficiencies from distribution and servicing, it could be parts expanding the high net-worth business, it could be the solutions\u2019 outcome, it could be real-estate, I mean, it\u2019s a lot of areas that we\u2019re looking at. But I think the probability of the rate situation offshore, even with Asia type funds that are very much at a favor right now I think would look attractive for us long-term.","Dan Fannon","Great. Thank you.","Greg Johnson","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Yes, hi, good morning. Just a follow-up on the comments you made about the, I think you said 40% of the sales are in I-class and the rest carry some kind of distribution. With those that carry distribution, do you happen to have visibility into what portion is in retirement accounts at this point?","Greg Johnson","No, I don\u2019t have that number. And obviously that\u2019s the relevant one as far as the potential with the fiduciary rule.","Brennan Hawken","Okay.","Greg Johnson","We can certainly get that for you.","Brennan Hawken","That would be great. Any additional, I know in the last quarter\u2019s call you were asked on DOL and at that point it didn\u2019t seem like you wanted to make many comments, given it is not final. But now that we have the rule in OMB, right? So, we\u2019re a couple months, at most, away from final and it\u2019s expected to be largely unchanged. Do you have any sense of the extent to which this might impact your AUM, rather, through the broker-sold channel?","Greg Johnson","No, I think it\u2019s still too early. And I don\u2019t think it has an immediate impact, I think what it does is, it has an impact on your future sales in those markets. And I think you\u2019re absolutely right in every indication, despite record comments and concerns raised, it\u2019s something that looks like it\u2019s going to move pretty quickly and try to be enacted before next January.","And whether that results in lawsuits, I think that\u2019s still very much out there as a possibility to take this up. But we are going to work with our partners and try to work through what will be a very complex transition to deal with this new rule. But again, I couldn\u2019t quantify what that means other than it\u2019s not a positive.","Brennan Hawken","Sure. Yes. No doubt it is going to be difficult. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell","Thanks. Good morning, folks, just a little bit more on the strategic beta initiative. I mean, first, how substantial or how, what kind of breadth of product do you want to ultimately develop in this area?","And then if you can talk a little bit about the distribution game plan for the products and also is this partly in response to potential DOL with these products, they obviously become more attractive in a DOL or in a kind of fiduciary rules?","Greg Johnson","No, I mean, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in response to the DOL world, I think it\u2019s just in response to where we see growth and needs in our line-up. Again, as I said before just getting a cheaper beta that doesn\u2019t conflict with your other funds will be important for us. I think the question on how big this market and whether or not at some point there is a vehicle that makes it more efficient than you typical 40-act and transfer agent type driven product, I think those are all questions that are still very much out there.","So, we just felt like the business is too large for an asset management company to ignore and whether it\u2019s again through acquisitions or organic growth, that\u2019s going to affect our plan on how we roll this out. We think it has to be a separate effort but also part of - you get the leverage from your existing wholesaler group as well.","And how big, I think again, I think we\u2019re starting kind of small but we will continue to roll-out or acquire new ones as we see fit, it\u2019s just kind of getting that space and building a team there and growing it.","Brian Bedell","Is there any desire to develop actively-managed nontransparent ETFs, you have obviously a number of applications in the SEC for that to de-leverage your own investment management products?","Greg Johnson","I think that\u2019s a possibility that we are looking at. So, I think that like everyone we\u2019re studying that and it is certainly a possibility to do that if you get the right regulatory relief on that and if it makes sense in that specific vehicle. It\u2019s something we certainly would consider because there are efficiencies you can gain.","Brian Bedell","And then just lastly on the, question for you, Ken, on the costs, obviously if you - regarding the flexibility, if we are in a longer term difficult market environment, does it cause you to look at the out-sourcing of fund accounting, administration and back office as one of those potential longer term cost saves versus maybe looking at more deeply at the investment management segment of the business?","Ken Lewis","Yes, so, and I think I\u2019ve mentioned, we talked about this subject before. That topic regardless of market conditions has come up over the years. And we\u2019ve done a lot of analysis on it. But so, I wouldn\u2019t say, I think that market volatility as I mentioned causes to just look at our entire business, all the business processes, all the business lines and rationalize everything. And I would include outsourcing of any type.","Brian Bedell","You would include that?","Ken Lewis","I would include that, yes. We would look at that again.","Brian Bedell","Okay. And yes, that\u2019s a little bit of a change from you guys, I think, have been more steadfast on keeping that in-house in the past. Is that sort of, little bit of a change in view or was it always something you\u2019re considering?","Greg Johnson","Well, I think it\u2019s not a change of view to look at it the conclusion may or may not be different this time. There are very valid reasons for us to do some of these things in-house, some of - our business is very, customized and very difficult to outsource everything. So, I don\u2019t know that philosophically we\u2019ve changed what we think is important to our customers and our business but we will look at it.","Ken Lewis","And I would just add, I mean, again, in any environment this is something that we would look at. And because of our structure and capabilities in lower cost regions like India, we\u2019re very, cost competitive to the market in those services. If we were not, then that\u2019s something that we have to consider. So those groups know that that\u2019s something they need to validate, they need to press cost down and they\u2019ve done that effectively. So it really hasn\u2019t given us a reason to go out and outsource it.","Brian Bedell","Right, understood. Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Robert Lee of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please go ahead.","Robert Lee","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Two questions, going back to the M&A question, I\u2019m just curious. A couple of your peers have done some acquisitions and I guess I\u2019ll call it the FinTex space, so whether you want to call it Robo Advisors or something else, and I was just curious, your thoughts about maybe not those specifically, but kind of your thoughts of opportunities to enhance or strategically position your business with acquisitions that maybe we wouldn\u2019t normally think about for you guys.","Greg Johnson","Well, I think certainly the industry is exploring that space. And looking at lower cost alternatives, it can reach broader groups through digital marketing and the capabilities that exist trying to get to the millennial in a different way than the traditional broker-dealer advisor model.","So, for us, that\u2019s another one that with the FinTex space and looking at Robo Advisors is something we certainly are studying whether or not we need to go acquire one or to build that capability, I think that\u2019s a question that we\u2019re looking at today. And I think the opportunity for the industry as distribution landscape changes, as we go to more advisory driven models as in traditional barriers between a broker-dealer funds sold group versus a direct group, continue to erode and disappear at a pretty quick pace.","I think the opportunity is what does that mean, for investment management firms. And I think that\u2019s why a lot of groups are looking at. And for us, I mentioned, the partnership that we\u2019re doing with a large global bank and using our solutions capabilities targeting the emerging affluent market through digital marketing to existing customers in the bank.","And that\u2019s very similar to what a Robo Advisor can do. And these are funds that are multi-asset and have a lot of different, they have other managers than Franklin Templeton in them and we can do that. So, that\u2019s somewhat of what a Robo Advisor can deliver. And to me, there is not a lot of magic there to what a Robo Advisor can do versus a solutions group can do or anybody modeling out.","And I think the direct space, the Vanguards and the traditional people in that space or swab have a pretty good head-start of dealing with them in a marketplace as far as Robo Advisors.","Robert Lee","Okay, great. And then, maybe just one follow-up, just trying to, the macro business which I guess is housed within the Global Bond business. I mean, that\u2019s a place you got that big mandate, hopefully more, you kind of talked about as a place of success. I\u2019m just kind of curious, could you kind of size maybe how big that book of business is? And kind of give us a feel for, in addition to this $5 billion-plus mandate, kind of the growth trajectory of that?","Greg Johnson","Well, no, I mean, it would be very difficult. I think it\u2019s still well it\u2019s called a global macro mandate from that group. It\u2019s really more aligned with your traditional global bond. It has a separate account. And I think the opportunity we still feel is a significant one. And I think there has just been some recent pressures around global currencies and a short-term lag in performance but we still feel that\u2019s kind of a pure alternative category to rates rising or equity markets dropping that it really does provide a nice cushion to a portfolio.","So, we think it\u2019s still, it has a very large potential in a market. And I think like last time, when did it do well, it did well when the equity market sold off and other markets were under pressure. And it had good relative standout numbers. And I think when you have that you\u2019ll see large flows there.","And I think as I said before, I think the feedback we\u2019re getting from the institutional side in Asia if that opportunity is real today, in getting other separate accounts in that space. But I don\u2019t know if I could quantify that.","Robert Lee","Great. Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Eric Berg of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Eric Berg","Thanks much.","Greg Johnson","Good morning.","Eric Berg","A number of your competitors in the alternative area have described the rapid widening of credit spreads in the energy area and in the high-yield area in general. And in the bond market in general, you have created just tremendous investment opportunities in the area of what they call stressed and distressed investing, rescue lending, these sorts of opportunities to invest in fixed income that is involving troubled companies. It\u2019s, again, stressed or distressed.","Understanding that your primary business is traditional investing, to what extent do you have the capability, product capability and human resources to spend in this opportunity if, in fact, you think it if, in fact, you agree that it exists?","Greg Johnson","Well, I think that\u2019s a perfect question to lead to our introduction of our, the fund that we just rolled out in the last year, as our K2 long-short credit fund. And really again to meet that need in an alternative category and we feel it really does offer a way to lower risk in a portfolio and really seize these opportunities that come because of stress in the marketplace, because of liquidity constraints and forced selling by some long-only holders that you want to have the ability to capture that.","On the other side, and that was a category of one of many categories but the one that we felt made the most sense to introduce now and we\u2019re just in the process of rolling that out to complement our $2 billion plus in the global macro space with K2.","Eric Berg","Very good; thank you.","Greg Johnson","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Gregory Warren of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Gregory Warren","Yes, thanks, good morning guys, for taking my question. I know we touched on share repurchase a little bit here, but I\u2019m just wondering what sort of capacity do you feel you have to make share repurchases this year? I mean, from a cash perspective, there are limitations, given how much cash is held overseas. And you spent $400 million in the first quarter and, arguably, the stock is cheaper right now. Do you anticipate being able to spend as much in the current quarter? And what sort of quarterly run rates are we thinking about going forward?","Ken Lewis","Yes, I would just say the quarterly run rate is dependent on several factors many of which we\u2019ve talked about today, M&A, share markets etcetera. We continue to think the stock is at good value, we purchase shares in January, you could see that from our filing. And we don\u2019t, we have many options in terms of capacity. So I don\u2019t see that as a near-term issue at all. I think future share repurchases are just dependent on many of the factors that we talked about previously.","Gregory Warren","Okay. That\u2019s good to hear. Thanks for taking the question.","Greg Johnson","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Michael Cyprys","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up just for a moment, just on the expense side equation here. The pre-recorded call you mentioned that you\u2019re expecting expenses to be about 3% to 4% below 2015 levels, but it sounded like you wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect all those to come through hit the bottom-line because of the execution relation cost on that. So, I guess just want to make sure I heard that right and not those expense cost to be fully offset in \u201816 and how should we think about the run rate there into 2017 and the expenses coming through them?","Greg Johnson","Yes, your question was a little garbled so I\u2019m going to try to answer it, but if I didn\u2019t hear it right, please correct me. So, right, so we are thinking if you compare \u201816 to \u201815, we were targeting 3% to 4%, we\u2019re thinking it\u2019s 4%. That\u2019s inclusive of some of the expenses it\u2019s going to take, some of the restructuring expenses that I mentioned in the pre-recorded remarks.","Our attention now is focusing on 2017. So, we\u2019ll do some modeling in 2017 and as I said, we continue to look at all the business lines and then once we come up, if we have additional guidance we\u2019ll provide them in future quarters. But it\u2019s an ongoing process.","Michael Cyprys","Sort of 3% to 4% would fall down to the bottom-line that\u2019s not offset because I think that\u2019s inclusive of the?","Greg Johnson","That\u2019s correct, that\u2019s inclusive.","Michael Cyprys","Okay, great. And I guess just could you elaborate a little bit more on what sort of actions you\u2019ve taken so far because expenses did come down in the quarter and sort of what you\u2019re thinking about next? You did mention earlier some thoughts around out-sourcing. But how high-up and realistic is that on your priority list?","Greg Johnson","Sure. So we\u2019ve had some staff reductions that\u2019s part of it, we had voluntary retirement plan that we talked about in our filing. So those were the examples to date and then looking forward I did mention, there was a question about out-sourcing but there are several things that we\u2019re looking at, we\u2019re looking at offices, we\u2019re looking at business lines. Of course the variable competition is a lever that we can use and did use this quarter to a degree and so, all of those things are on the table.","Michael Cyprys","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing comments.","Greg Johnson","Well, again thank you everyone for participating on the call. And we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"10322":["Franklin Resources, Inc. (NYSE:BEN) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call April 26, 2019 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Gregory Johnson - Chairman & CEO","Jennifer Johnson - President & COO","Kenneth Lewis - EVP & CFO","Conference Call Participants","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Benjamin Herbert - Citigroup","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","William Cuddy - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research","Robert Lee - KBW","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group","James Steele - Jefferies","Unidentified Company Representative","Good morning, and welcome to Franklin Resources Earnings Conference Call for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2019. ","Statements made in this conference call regarding Franklin Resources Inc., which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

My name is Jessie and I'll be your call operator today. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin.","Gregory Johnson","Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Joining me for his final earnings call as CFO is Ken Lewis. We also have Jenny Johnson, our President and Chief Operating Officer, with us today. Importantly, strong investment performance translated to better flows from many of our flagship funds. Retail sales and redemptions improved significantly, particularly for global fixed income that once again attracted inflows as did Franklin income. ","Earnings per share improved to $0.72, a 33% increase from last quarter. Higher investment income more than offset the initial impact of the cost structure optimization initiatives intended to increase operational efficiencies and streamline the organization. ","We'd now like to open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","I'm curious to see what you think what's behind the lowest redemptions since 2011. Obviously the market got better and we're coming off a crap fourth quarter. Your performance is better. There is a lot of interesting things in there. But to be lowest level since 2011, I'm curious on how much environmental versus Franklin-specific. And are you doing anything to, obviously, bring that on in the retail channel?","Gregory Johnson","Well, I think partly sometimes coming off a volatile quarter, it does slow down redemption activity. We've seen that in the past. But, I think, nothing else other than better performance comes to mind. And certainly, the pickup and focus on some of the flagship funds where we've had larger redemptions and then had better performance, I'm sure has helped as well.","Jennifer Johnson","And I'll just add that I think some of the investments we've made on adding talent to the distribution channels, we've seen upticks in our New York Stock Exchange channel and had some additional placements with gatekeepers and things and most recently, hires in the private wealth and the SMA channels. So I think that that's probably also helping.","Glenn Schorr","And have we seen a slowing in the list consolidations that went on around the retail channel?","Jennifer Johnson","You're still seeing some of that. I mean, obviously, is -- firms are rationalizing it, but we're also, in some cases, winning in those channels.","Glenn Schorr","Got you. okay. And just one other follow-up, if I could on -- just curious on I know we're not there yet on Benefit Street, but what's going on behind-the-scenes to start driving growth so can hit the ground running? What's the overall plan once you're closed and out the door?","Gregory Johnson","Well, I think the plan is to, first, get Benefit Street -- I mean, get our distribution comfortable with the investment process and team and then really go tackle. And that's really what they've done, I'd say, in the early months, and now we're going out with roadshows around the globe to introduce Benefit Street to our -- many of our global clients. We're also looking at expanding the retail part of the equation and developing some products there. But it's still early stage, but the focus has really been on making sure that our entire team is up to speed on Benefit Street and then attacking the clients in an optimal way.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.","Benjamin Herbert","And it's Ben Herbert on for Bill. I just wanted to follow-up on the expense commentary '20 versus '18. Are you still expecting the potential to be able to bend it a little bit lower than '18? Or is that maybe pushed out a bit further?","Gregory Johnson","Thanks, Bill. Our guidance, we're pretty confident that we can get the run rate expenses to be at the 2018 levels. That's as a result of all the cost-savings initiatives that we're doing right now.","Benjamin Herbert","And so we're not expecting to may be come in a little bit lower in '20 or just a touch?","Gregory Johnson","In '20, yes. In '20 -- I'm sorry, in 2020, we expect 2020 expenses to be at the 2018 level.","Benjamin Herbert","Great. But any opportunity to come in a bit lower?","Gregory Johnson","Hopefully. Yes. Working on it.","Benjamin Herbert","And then maybe just one unrelated follow-up would be any change in capital management priorities with the CFO change?","Gregory Johnson","No. I think we all worked with the Board on the strategy around optimizing the capital management and certainly, you'll have a new input to that, but nothing at this stage to really speak about.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Maybe, Greg, can you talk a little bit about your views on the approval of the active nontransparent ETF, whether it's something that you would look to license for your -- some of your active strategies? Maybe how that would potentially fit with your liberty shares effort right now that, I think, has been -- supposed to pass the smart beta and active? And then also whether you'd be interested in accelerating the ETF effort with any acquisitions, say, in the smart beta space?","Gregory Johnson","Well, I will turn that over to Jenny, who is a Liberty Share Board Member.","Jennifer Johnson","We obviously pay isn't close attention to the various blind trusts that are coming through the SEC. And with the most recent approval the Presidian, it's limited in that it's really U.S.-listed equities. So -- and you're talking about ones that can be replaced. So it's tended to be mid- and large-cap. So in that space, if we have an active product that we think that makes sense, we would certainly consider it. We have active fixed income that are performing very well, and they don't need that kind of blind trust. ","And so it just depends. We're open and looking at all of them. And right now, we're seeing some good growth that we're about to just to hit $4 billion in ETFs with -- this quarter, we had one -- our FLQL, which is our liberty shares of U.S. equity ETF that is now $1.1 billion. And one of the key things with ETF is just scale, attracts more institutional players and our smart beta performed very well through this volatile market.","Gregory Johnson","And I would just that, I think, as we've always said in M&A, if we see something accelerates our ETF and potentially complements the offerings and things, we're certainly still looking at that as well.","Brian Bedell","Okay. Great. And then maybe just on that M&A theme. Obviously, the Invesco-Oppenheimer deal is about to close and fairly sizable one. If that is -- ends up being successful in terms of -- sort of rekindling organic growth and obviously getting the cost saves. Do you think that would potential spur more industry consolidation for these types of properties? And would that lead you to think potentially it might make sense for you to even consolidate more on a sort of on a sort of a scale basis? And maybe just any updated thoughts on, I think, you had mentioned the distribution agreements potentially in Europe in some past calls. Any updated thoughts on that?","Gregory Johnson","Yes, I mean, I think we just pointed that it's not -- it's a challenge to combine entities of that size. But certainly, there is a huge opportunity for cost savings and synergies there. And I don't think we have that strong opinion one way or another other than if we have the right fit and right culture and right complement, we would certainly take that on. I just pointed to how disruptive it can be and difficult. But certainly, there is opportunity if executed well on that. That's something that every firm, I think, has to be open to when looking at margins and other ways to reduce expenses in a challenged revenue environment. ","The other -- I don't think there is much new to report, and Jenny can add maybe, but on looking at distribution plays and M&A., I think that's certainly something that, as we have said on past calls, that we're more open to doing in certain markets and it will continue to look, but there is nothing new really new to say there.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","First on some of the efficiency initiatives. Can you just provide -- I need a little detail on where you're pursuing those? You mentioned outsourcing, but any other areas? And then in terms of redirecting those savings, you guys have talked about either the multi-asset solutions, distribution, but just specifically, over the next two years, as you're getting those efficiencies, what are some of those priorities?","Gregory Johnson","Okay. I'll start with the cost savings. It is a enterprise-wide effort. So essentially, all the business units participated in it. So it's difficult. And I will point out that the outsourcing announcement is just in the early stages. So there's going to be more to come on that in 20 -- in the year 2020. But the cost-savings initiatives that we're referring to in the text and on this call relate to just the -- all the -- every department in the company looking at their operations and finding ways to become more efficient. Maybe it's a leverage or low cost jurisdictions and maybe just to eliminate processes that we're not doing it. So it's enterprise-wide. And you want? What we're going to invest the money on?","Jennifer Johnson","Sure. Yes. No, obviously, multi-asset solutions and distribution are two big areas. And in that, in distribution, it's both in people. So we've added key talent in important areas as well as technology, technologies that support the distribution channels whether we're partnering or developing some capabilities on our own. And then, of course, data science. Data science that supports our distribution so that we could be smarter at providing the right products through the distribution channels and, of course, on the investment management side. ","We believe that active managers need to be -- need to have the ability to leverage AI and machine learning and data science to gain insights. And that's really nascent, but it's important. We think it's very important over the long run. And so developing capabilities around that is critical.","Michael Carrier","Okay. And then just to sort of follow up on the flows. You guys had some good pockets of improvement. Greg, you mentioned the global bond and in international retail. So on the institutional side, it seems that continues to be a bit of a headwind. I think you mentioned during the quarter some items that impacted you, but just maybe little color there and then just on the outlook what you're seeing in that channel.","Gregory Johnson","Yes, I think -- I think, you're correct in saying that there's -- that's where we had some headwinds continuing. And I think the majority of our assets historically have been on the Templeton side and institutional and another -- as the markets have rebounded, they value trailed growth by about 400 basis points over the quarter, so that hasn't helped the relative numbers there. ","And as we enter our 10th, 11th year of this cycle, it's just -- you still have pressure on redemptions and certainly not new sales to support that. So that's where we saw some global equity accounts go as well as some variable annuity, that's been a continued headwind. ","We probably have another $1 billion next quarter coming and that'd be a business that some of it's going passive, a lot of it's just they've gotten out of the business and are looking whether it's low vol or other type of fund managers or indexing. We've seen a lot of that. And that represented a large number of the redemptions as well for the past quarter. ","So those are the two that continue, I think, to put pressure on the net numbers. And overall, retail would have been just about breakeven or positive if it wasn't for the institutional side where we see some of the larger redemptions. The good news is they're in lower cost fund -- separate accounts or funds.","Operator","Our next question is a from the line of Ken Worthington of JP Morgan.","William Cuddy","This is Will Cuddy filling in for Ken. First, Ken, thank you for perspective -- your perspective over the years. Turning to questions. Franklin has been investing in it's RIA and adviser distribution. Could you please update us on your progress on those investments? And within retail, how much of the retail flows are coming from RIAs and advisory? Are we beginning to see your investments in those channels pay off?","Jennifer Johnson","We are beginning to see it pay off. We actually had a good uptick this quarter, but it is still a much smaller part of our U.S. retail distribution and one that we're very focused on growing. And there's a lot of different ways to be able to attack that market. We have a multi-asset solutions has launched for models that we think will be appealing to that market. We also have come up with sleeves that can be incorporated into more of open-architecture models. We look at strategic investments in tools that RIAs use because they tend to be more independent in some of the technology that they use. ","And so whether we do strategic investments or whether we support those applications through our own models and content. So all of those things are focused for us on the RIA channel. Obviously, the ETFs. We're getting some good traction on the ETF space in the RIA channel. They tend to like ETFs but we definitely see it as a very important strategic focus going forward.","William Cuddy","Great. Turning to tax prefixed income. There has been a commentary on impacted of tax reform on the MENA market. Have you seen changes in broker sales? Either in the tax reform broadly. And more recently, we're coming off of tax season. Have you seen a change in behavior as a result of tax season and some of the speculation about lower refunds this year for the tax rate and fixed income bonds?","Gregory Johnson","Yes. I just would say in general, I mean, it was a stronger quarter for tax-free flows and for us, a positive inflow, which it hasn't been in a while. So that was good. I think the -- everybody becomes more aware of taxes and especially in those states that no longer have the state deduction, the tax -- the double tax rate is very attractive and our Cal tax-free has done pretty well in performance on top of that. So I think it's an area that clearly had improved gross sales and flows and hopefully, that will continue as people have to pay up more their estimated taxes and things to make up the difference of not having that the state deduction.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.","Patrick Davitt","On the expense guidance, I just want to make sure I'm thinking about it right. So you kept the guide -- the 2020 guide basically flat with 2018, excluding Benefit Street. So is the 15% to 16% 2019 comp guidance excluding Benefit Street as well? And through that lens, that was -- pardon me? Yes?","Gregory Johnson","I'm sorry. I didn't hear the sentence. I cut you off there.","Patrick Davitt","Go ahead.","Gregory Johnson","It includes Benefit Street. This year includes Benefit Street, but...","Patrick Davitt","Right. I guess it still would suggest the vast majority -- sorry? Okay. There's -- Do the -- It just the vast majority of that guidance basically severance. Could you kind of separate out how much it would be up without kind of onetime or severance-type item?","Gregory Johnson","You're right, it is severance. I think we can give you perhaps a range for what we think the execution cost for all this cost savings are. We think it's about 2% increase. 2% of the increase is related to the execution costs, other cost initiatives.","Patrick Davitt","Including severance?","Gregory Johnson","Yes.","Patrick Davitt","Okay. cool. On Benefit Street again. Was -- were they -- did they add to the $60 million performance fee at all? And do you have any updates on your views of timing of potential accretion from the deal?","Gregory Johnson","I do. Performance fees were minimal in total and inclusive of Benefit Street this quarter. And I think we are still pretty confident in our projections that this year it was -- as we said, it's going to be neutral. Next year slightly accretive and then as a result, the revenue growth accretive after that.","Patrick Davitt","Great. And any update on the potential noncash expense that's in numbers from that deal?","Gregory Johnson","Yes. The cash -- you could see the cash went down this quarter, though it's pretty much related to Benefit Street and a couple of other things. But...","Patrick Davitt","No. I meant like noncash...","Gregory Johnson","We just closed the purchase price and other cash price of that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee","And Ken, best of luck in your next chapter.","Kenneth Lewis","Thanks.","Robert Lee","Could you maybe just go back to Patrick's -- your answer to Patrick's question on the 2% increase. Did you mean 2% increase in total expense, excluding sales spend?","Kenneth Lewis","Yes. I'll simplify that even more. Our estimate is like between $50 million -- for the remainder of this fiscal year between $50 million and $60 million of execution costs.","Robert Lee","Great. And then obviously that includes severance and whatnot?","Gregory Johnson","That's right. Exactly. That's right.","Robert Lee","Right. okay. Perfect. Maybe shifting gears. I'm just kind of curious are you've seeing the rebound in demand for global fixed and, in particular, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. I'm just kind of curious outside the U.S. that where you're seeing some of the best traction. I know in years past, it was Italy, for example, is a big market for you. Are using it -- is it relatively concentrated in a couple of places? Are you seeing spread out? Just trying to good to get some color on that.","Gregory Johnson","Yes. I just -- I actually just returned from Asia yesterday and spent nine days traveling around. And we're actually seeing most of the growth in -- or rebound in sales coming from Asia. And if you look at Hong Kong, Singapore, in particular, Europe secondarily. But as we said before, a lot of these type of retail sales are driven from the home office and the platform and putting it back on. And we're really seeing a renewed interest in the global bond fund. ","And I think part of that is just the fear of retail investors right now having gone through December. And even with the rebound, there's just a lot of caution out there. And this fund had a positive return in December, which, I think, just highlighted how it can lower the overall risk in a portfolio and people looking for alternatives that are not as beta- and duration-related. So we just had a strong renewed interest there and very optimistic that, that will continue as markets reach new highs as well. So it's really been more Asia, then Europe and then the U.S.","Robert Lee","Okay. And then maybe going back - it's like the one last question. Going back to capital management from earlier, and I apologize if you had addressed those, but share repurchases, you had the lowest levels. It's been that in a while understanding it did Benefit Street this quarter. But with the cash investment levels having come down as you've used it and returned it. I don't know to what extent the change in CFO and clearly someone who has background and M&A. Is that at all kind of impacting how you think about the level of excess cash you want -- you're willing -- you prefer to keep on hand versus what you may have done otherwise? I mean, just trying to see if that maybe I'm reading too much into it, but I'm just to trying to get your take on that?","Gregory Johnson","Yes. I don't think, as I said before, that the change in the CFO has a whole lot to do with the buybacks. I think you had a very choppy December period in redemptions and you had the acquisition. And we've been pretty aggressive in buying back and we -- if you're opportunistic, you really don't want to set the given level at any time. And also there was much lower volume in the stock through that period. So we don't Like to be the market in the stock as well and just back up a little bit. But I don't think it should indicate any think going forward other than we're going to continue to be opportunistic and use the cash and then have, as we said before, we think the balance sheet provides us with a lot of options. And we're going to continue to look at, whether it's alternatives or other things that we think can add shareholder value over time.","Kenneth Lewis","And there are market issues too. Like, for example, this quarter, our 10(b)-18 volume dropped more than 40% versus last quarter. So there's -- those execution issues as well.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein","A question around -- another one around expenses. So I guess, in the regional marks, you guys highlighted the decision to outsource a portion of the fund admin business. Can you walk us through what percentage of AUM and then what products will be outsourced? Who are you guys outsourcing to? And whether or not there's going to be an opportunity to outsource more over time?","Gregory Johnson","I don't -- we're not looking at the -- we don't look at the outsourcing decision on a product basis. It's more of a process basis. And so I think, specifically, we're talking about aspects of the fund accounting, fund reporting process. The decision to outsource, we feel, brings it more in line with our peers. And it's part of a broader effort to kind of advance our capabilities. And I think one of the things that's changed for the providers is that, they've reached a scale where they can meet our global and unique needs on a cost efficient basis and that wasn't the case before. I guess that's it.","Kenneth Lewis","And it would cover most of our funds, I would guess.","Gregory Johnson","Yes, it covers -- yes. exactly. It's not products specific. It's across the all the funds processed.","Alexander Blostein","Got it. Okay. And I guess when you guys look out beyond 2020, and that guidance is fairly clear. But, I guess, once you get through these cost-cutting initiatives and it sounds like you have the program, but the cost initiatives might end up being ongoing over time. How should we think about the organic kind of net expense growth for the business taking account kind of the initiatives you guys have in place both on the cost side and the growth side?","Kenneth Lewis","One thing I think it's important to point out is we will continue to -- while we continue to invest in the strategic initiatives that Jenny mentioned, there was some frontloading of that last year. Some investments we made last year. And so you did see an increase in expenses there and that were kind of if you were backfilling or kind of globalizing the expense base as the rails of that. So we'll continue to make those investments. I think that this process that we're going through makes us more efficient and more scalable. So normally, we might have seen a certain growth rate as the business grows. I think certain growth rate of expenses as the business grows. I don't think we'll see that in the future because of our -- we're increasing our scale. So I think inflation is a good guideline to think about expense growth, but we will try to keep it under that.","Operator","We do have a follow-up question from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.","Patrick Davitt","You mentioned $1 billion coming out from the VA. Could you scale that relative to what you saw last quarter and remind us how much is left in that bucket?","Gregory Johnson","It's probably similar to this quarter where we -- I can -- I had about $1.1 billion as well go out this quarter and just in -- we've identified another $1 billion next quarter. And I don't have the assets that -- we'll get back on that. But there's nothing, I think, any of the older assets you could put at risk just because that they are at change, but nothing beyond that $1 billion as far as visibility for the quarter -- the next quarter that we are aware of.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Dan Fannon with Jeffries.","James Steele","This is actually James Steele filling in for Dan. Sorry. Just one more on the outsourcing of the funds administration. Is this going to entail any sort of a different ongoing fund admin cost just sort of outside of the onetime cost associated with it?","Jennifer Johnson","I'll just ask -- answer a couple of things. I think that, no, you wouldn't see a dramatic reduction, but there will be some reductions to the fund's expenses. So there is some savings to the individual funds. And if anything, it's as much as a risk. And as Ken mentioned, just historically, one of the reasons that we had it in-house is that the providers just didn't have the global footprint that we had to be able to do it. Now they can and they have a scale that can meet our cost level. And for us, it's also as much a risk mitigation as they are able to continue to invest in the technology.","James Steele","Okay. And is there -- if you -- could you size the difference in the all-in fund expense?","Jennifer Johnson","I mean, it's...","Gregory Johnson","Yes, let me just say that this is -- there'll be more to come on this next year. It's kind of -- it is a pretty early announcement on this. And so even the execution of it will take us -- the beginning of the execution will take us into 2020. And so it's really a 10-year cost benefit analysis on that. So there'll be more to come on that in the future.","Operator","It appears we have no further questions at this time, so I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Johnson for any additional concluding comments.","Gregory Johnson","Well, thank you very much, everyone, for attending and I want to thank Ken Lewis for his tremendous service to our organization over his career. He will still be with us through the transition here, but I just want to thank him on behalf of all of us.","Kenneth Lewis","Thanks. Thanks, Greg. Just a few words. Yes, so it's been over 30 years and over 50 earnings calls here. As Greg said, I'll stay in advisory capacity until September 30. The March has felt like -- the 30-year March has felt like a good times to try to make a change and including a little R&R before the next opportunity. There's no shortage of opportunities in the Bay Area, as I'm sure you can guess. But I do want to say I feel very confident leave you in good hands. I know the Executive team here and we will be successful. One of the reason that I worked for so long is the company's deep culture of honest -- honesty and integrity. ","I know they'll -- those values will serve them. And I want to thank all of you for your thoughtful and thought-provoking questions over the past 13 years. I'm sure I'll miss that quarterly challenge. So I hope we all pass across in the future. So thanks a lot everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

Mr. Johnson, you may begin.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, hello, and thank you for joining us this morning. We know it's a busy day for all of you, but hopefully, the prerecorded commentary was able to answer the bulk of your questions. With me today is Ken Lewis, our CFO; and Vijay Advani, Executive Vice President of Global Advisory Services.","The fourth quarter capped off another record year of operating results with revenues, operating income and net income reaching all-time highs. Additionally, we are pleased with improving flow trends in the Hybrid and equity products, and continue to see equity strategy relative performance improvements.","At this time, I'd like to open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Carrier from Bank of America.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe just a question on the equity and the Hybrid flows. You've seen decent improvement in this quarter, both on the sales side, in the redemptions. I think when you're looking at what's driving those in terms of the different distribution channels in the geographies, I just want to get a sense on how much traction you feel like you have. It seems like the performance is there, things are starting to build, but when you look at the sales levels or the redemptions levels, is there a significant level of improvement that we can continue to see to drive this further, I mean, assuming that like industry trends kind of continue as a -- as they have? I'm just trying to figure out -- it's -- I think a lot of people have been waiting for this, and you're starting to see some traction there, but just trying to look at kind of what you see in terms of the outlook?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think it is encouraging, certainly, to see the strength across the equity side and Hybrid, and also just to note the level of exchanges that are going in those 2 areas, at $1.5 billion going to Hybrid out of other funds and $1.1 billion into equity. So you are seeing somewhat of a rotation part of that, obviously, with munis and people looking for other alternatives. But the good news is it's staying within the complex. I think there is clearly an appetite. We're seeing it for balanced funds as well. That Templeton Balanced Fund is one of our fastest-growing funds. And those that are a little bit uncomfortable with where maybe rates are heading and don't want all of that interest rate risk, but do like the lower volatility, you are seeing an increase interest in Hybrids. And I think the big story that we think going forward is really the global equity one, and we continue to do very well on the institutional side with wins and you tend to turn around faster there on the strength of relative performance. But retail does take longer, and -- but we are starting to see that turn and we're starting to see it by the better Morningstar ratings, things like that that have to happen, and there's just a lag effect there. But I think that trend should continue for us, and it should be a trend better than the industry overall because you do have the turnaround and lag effect of what the Templeton's done with flows.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. Maybe, Ken, just on some of the numbers that you highlighted, went over. I just want to make sure, in terms of the reclass, so it seems like the fee rate was relatively steady, adjusting for that. I just wanted to find out like what was the driver of that? And then on the expense guidance that you gave, we should still see the normal, particularly unlike the occupancy of the IT, the normal decline next quarter, but you were just saying that heading into '14, expect some growth in those buckets. I just want to make sure I had that right.","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes, that's right. The -- there was nothing really significant about the reclass. It was essentially just some new developments, new contracts that we were -- just there was a little bit of a backlog in reviewing and we just caught up on that. So there's nothing -- there's no trend there that you have to worry about in terms of the effective fee rate. I mean, you're right, the effective fee rate was more or less flat. And with regards to the effective fee rate and the industry as a whole, you see some pressures on fees and the institutional, on the institutional categories a little bit, so we factor that in looking forward. And on the expense side, in general, we're going to try to keep the expense growth under 5% next year. But as you said, it is seasonal, so first quarter, we would expect to see a drop, particularly in that information technology line, and then ramping back up throughout the year, as [indiscernible] going away.","Operator","Our next question comes from Luke Montgomery from Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So it looks like you did a 64% capital return for fiscal 2013. I guess that's not inconsistent with your rough targets, but I was wondering, when you think about capital return, is that on a fiscal year basis, or if it's possible that the accelerated buyback this quarter might change your appetite to do a special this December, if can you comment on that?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes. I don't think it will change the appetite one way or the other. We have 1 more board meeting in the calendar year. We'll talk about that in December in terms of whether we want to do a special dividend or not. So generally, the strategy is exactly the same, dividends, the share repurchases being opportunistic, and then perhaps, a special dividend.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess just staying on the capital return, could you give us a little more context in terms of how you stand on the U.S. cash balances, and whether there is sufficient U.S. cash to maintain that 60-ish, call it 60-ish payout ratio this year without repatriating some non-U.S. cash?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, absolutely. Absolutely in the short-term, there's no problem there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just looking at the muni business and listening to your prepared commentary, it seems like actually you guys are pretty positive on the market, kind of versus where the market's pricing a lot of these bonds. I'm wondering, have you changed your marketing campaign for muni bonds at all? Or do you plan to kind of step up given the improvement in yields and potentially, the buying opportunity you see there?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think we feel like muni is -- you have headline events that affect specific cities or areas between Detroit and Puerto Rico, which has been dominating the headlines, and we think the story with munis is a very positive one for the overall market. Most states' revenues are improving, and the quality of ability to pay back the debt has improved over the past year. We don't think that's been really factored in, and so that's the message we're going out with. And just, muni is a nice thing. It's like any fixed income. When you have a selloff and you get more attractive yields, you attract new smart buyers into munis, and I think that's what will happen once this settles. But it is relatively a liquid market, and it does sell off on headline risk and that creates opportunities. So we're out there just trying to get that message out, and Vijay has something to add.","Vijay Chandur Advani","Yes, and in fact, we have stepped up our marketing on munis. We think this is a good opportunity for many of our long-standing clients to get back in, and so we're doing a fair amount of marketing here in the U.S.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just a follow-up on the muni business. Just looking at your 1-year relative performance, I know you guys are generally kind of longer credit, which kind of impacts that, and your yields are probably higher than the average. But the flow trends were actually pretty negative this quarter. Do you think we're sort of at the bottom when you think about even like monthly flows, and that we can improve from here? Or do you think we're kind of going to be -- remain at this level for longer?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes, this is Ken. I'll just take a start. I just wanted to point out that the flows really and the redemptions really did tend to bottom out in August during the quarter. It wasn't something that gradually built up through the quarter. It was a spike in August. So I just want to put that in there before Greg and Vijay add to that.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, I mean, I hope it has. And certainly, unless you have another Detroit in the next few months -- I think the market will start to settle and differentiate between risk, where it's a pretty broad selloff when you have these kind of outflows. And that, again, that's what creates the opportunity for us. So it just depends. You're correct. We have a longer duration on munis, it will always be that way. And the area we don't really worry about as much from a relative performance standpoint when looking at our complex is the short-term numbers on munis because of the -- we do want a higher income and stability, and that's how those funds are managed. So sometimes, you will underperform in the short run on a total return basis, so that's normal for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Kim from Sandler O'Neill.","James Howley","This is actually James Howley filling in for Michael this morning. So first, I'm just hoping that you guys can update on some of the product development efforts, particularly around your solutions or into strategies, and then the alternative capabilities they should get building up in the retail channel?","Vijay Chandur Advani","Yes. We've been building that -- this is Vijay. We've been building that capability over the last couple of years. And it's only in the last 6, 8 months that we've had some funds that we've actually launched, both in our SICAV range in the U.K. under the OEIC, as well as here in the U.S. As you know, we recently acquired K2. We are working with them on a retail hedge fund of funds, our multi-asset strategy. We've started seeing some traction, especially in Europe and here in the U.S. as well, so it's been -- these things take time to build up, but both our marketing campaign, web-based campaign, as well as our sales folks on the ground have been talking about this strategy, and we've been seeing good interest both by gatekeepers on the retail side, as well as consultants.","James Howley","Great. And then just as a follow-up. Turning to the institutional business, are you kind of seeing any meaningful shifts in asset allocations more broadly? And just any insight as to the RFP activity and the pipeline as it stands?","Vijay Chandur Advani","This is Vijay again. I think the 2 big themes, one is domestic fixed income, the global fixed income. There are a lot of institutions, both institutions and frankly, even the retail channel that's yet dominated by domestic fixed income, whether you're in Europe or in the U.S. And they're looking -- they continue to look for global fixed income. And on the equity side, I think global equity continues to lead for us. That's our forte. We've seen performance come back for us in that area, and we are seeing some surges by consultants.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So a question here on the muni business, this is kind of a follow-up. If you guys kind of experience continued outflow in muni but you kind of get an even swap in the equity, is that an accretive proposition for you given the higher fee raise in equity products?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Absolutely. That's correct.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But any way that you can kind of assess the magnitude of that? I mean, if you do get even swap, what does that ultimately mean for the margin?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Well, if it's retail business, it should be -- it should improve the margin, right? I mean, you can just kind of gauge by the industry. And we show this in our disclosures, kind of industry rates and all that, so you can get a feel for what our global equity fee rates are in our U.S. taxable -- I'm sorry, our U.S. fixed income rates, and then most of that drops to the bottom line.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And my follow-up question, completely unrelated. But I know you guys are aware that there's a high-profile portfolio manager leaving Invesco, and I'm just wondering more broadly -- what can you guys do to kind of minimize a potential impact of that happening at your franchise? Obviously, you have a PM in Global Bond that manages a lot of assets, and so could you give us any little color on what you can do, whether it's building the bench, or kind of locking somebody up in an employment contract, would be helpful.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I mean, I think that's one of the most important things that we do, for senior management, is thinking about people, succession, retention and hopefully, that's something we try to get right, and you always have that risk. And that risk is something that we factor into all of our long-term compensation awards on coming up with succession for each area. And then it really comes down to compensation and the quality of work environment, and hopefully, we get those right. So I think it's always a compliment when people come to us and talk about people and risk of them leaving because that means you have the right kind of talent and organization. And at the end of the day, if somebody wants to be an entrepreneur, there's not a whole lot you can do about that, but we try to also create some incentives that are aligned with that kind of entrepreneurship in a large organization. And I -- hopefully, you look at our retention levels, hopefully, we do good job, but obviously, a risk that we have to recognize and deal with.","Kenneth Allan Lewis","And I think if you -- we've shown this in some IR slides in the past. The average tenure of the chief investment officers, the average tenure of the portfolio managers, it's pretty impressive. We've certainly had store managers leave in the past. And it hasn't been because we focus on all of the things that Greg mentioned, the succession planning, having a team built around the -- and the process, that it really hasn't resulted in great outflows. And the other point I'd make is, I think in the example that you had, that's more of like maybe a big fish in a small pond-type of investment manager, where because of our global diversification, it gets spread out across -- you don't see as much of an impact I guess.","Operator","Our next question comes from William Katz from Citi.","Neil Stratton","This is actually Neil filling in for Bill. I just wanted to possibly drill in a bit further on the pace of redemptions. I already know you mentioned a spike in August, but any way to provide a little more color on maybe the magnitude as a percentage as you work through July, August and then September?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Not really. It was a dramatic spike, and it was in our aging Growth Fund and the muni Bond Fund. So it was kind of in 2 relatively large products that we had redemptions for different reasons in the same month. So it's kind of bounced back nicely in September, I can tell you that.","Neil Stratton","Great. And then one follow-up is you already mentioned trying to keep expense growth to 5% in fiscal '14. Is there any other underlying color you can provide with -- relative to comp? I mean, comp to rev or anything like that?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Well, I think we have been on a little bit of a ramp-up in terms of headcount, so that's going to have some upward pressure that you can't avoid. We have a normal seasonality with payroll taxes. We have a merit increase, I think, the average was about 3%. That's effective in December, so you have 1 month of that next quarter, and then 3 months the following. So that's kind of why I think 4%, 5% is a good number to target.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from ISI.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on the expense side. The general spending levels, they increased 7% to 8% in 2014?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","2000 this year, you mean?","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Correct. Correct. I'm just curious if that's for any revenue environment. Obviously, there's discretion expense that go along with soft markets, but curious how much of that is written in stone?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes. So, I mean, we do have flexibility, right? And I think we demonstrated that, and I guess the most recent example would have been in the global financial crisis where I think we did a pretty good job of reducing the expenses where we can without kind of hurting our strategic initiatives. So maybe a couple -- maybe some background on how we look at the budgeting might be helpful. First of all, when we budget, we assume no market either way, so that's -- so we say -- we just kind of rely on what we think organic flows could be and reinvestments and all that, and what the average change in assets under management are, and then we look at the expense growth. And we're just basically messaging to the troops, so the things that we can control, to try to keep it at run rate with, as I mentioned, as in the inherent 3%, 4%, 5% increase in it. So that's what we're focusing on. And when I say the things that we can control, I'm excluding the sales distribution, sales distribution expense line. Because a lot of it is market-driven, sales-driven, and a lot of that is based on average assets under management. So hopefully maybe that provided some color for you. I mean I, think on the IT line, we're seeing -- we're just seeing some increased expenses. There's things that we have to replace.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","No, that's definitely helpful. The other place I need some help on the P&L is in the other income line. You're always helpful and provide that in Slide 19, but just taking a step back and looking at, I don't know, close to $100 million in revenues year-to-date and nothing this quarter, I'm more thinking about the go forward. You have a lot of investments on the books. We can make our own market quotes, but maybe you can talk to us about the major drivers in the year ahead, the composition of the seed investments maybe?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Right. So if you picture Slide 19 in your mind, there are certain things that are relatively predictable, interest expense, interest earnings on cash, et cetera. If you look at -- the thing that drives volatility is the consolidated sponsored investment products, so these are the products that will consolidate because there are some element of control in the product, whether it's our seed money or a general partner interest or what have you. And so what you're seeing is the underlying investment gains offers of those products. It's not something that we have access to, which is something that we're recognizing on the books. And we try to show you the impacts of that in our 10-K. We try to show you the components of investments by investment objective, so you can see that typically, the type of investments are global equity. So if you wanted to try to project that, and by the way, if you get very accurate, let's talk. If you try -- if you want to look at the components of the products that we're consolidating, it's usually in the trading investment line and we haven't broken out by investment objectives, so you can make your assumption on global equity or U.S. fixed income or what have you, and that should be helpful.","Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That is helpful. You had a -- last one is you had a performance fee in the quarter, and then I'm hoping if you could remind us how that -- what percentage is in your fourth quarter versus next quarter and just in terms of assets available for fees, when the fees get paid?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Fees are typically -- it's mostly is in private equity at this point. With K2, we'll have a little bit more of that and we did see that this year. So it's $6 million in the current quarter, which typically have a little bit in December, and then we have a little bit next June. But it hasn't been material even to the revenue line, and I don't expect it to be material going forward either, at least in the short term.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the question on sort of a month-to-month, and a little more color on the flows. When you said you saw the bounce back in September, did that apply to Global Bond as well as muni? And maybe if you can give some color on October, too?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes. I think my comments were specifically on munis and the Asian Growth Fund because that's where we saw the largest redemptions. I don't know, I think -- I don't think there's anything else there really to talk about that maybe you guys...","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I think the only point I'd make that I think may add some color on the global bond flows is the -- if you look at the net outflow and you would think redemption spike, but they didn't spike. They were actually flat quarter-over-quarter. It was just sales were down 47% in that category. So I think that just tells you that the market was in that kind of risk off mode and -- or risk, yes, risk off for that period and just holding to see where it went in the short run, and hopefully, you can snap back. And most of the -- that drop was more in Europe and in the places that have been the big drivers where it slowed down, and that tends to pick up a bit faster when people are more comfortable with some of the macro events and tapering and things that are having an impact on certainly emerging market debt. So we -- I think we've seen it snap back before. We hope it does quickly. And I think the good news is that in Europe, that the flows are more volatile, and that works both ways, so hopefully, you can start to see a pick up, but I think we don't really want to speculate on where we're going this early into the quarter.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. That's fair. I guess just thinking about September, the big macro thing tended to be the shutdown in D.C. and the dysfunction and such, so I guess it was just somewhat surprising that it came from Europe, insofar as the slowdown in the SICAV fund, as far as Global Bond...","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think it was still a -- the more related to the tapering and the selloff in emerging market debt in the prior quarter that affected that, not so much the shutdown. And now the sentiment is certainly the other way on tapering versus the risk that was out there in the prior quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Kelley from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was hoping to take a step back and just ask, when you guys are having conversations with U.S. retail channels at this point, what are -- if you don't mind going into what are the kind of 5 most frequently asked about products, I'm sure Global Bond and Income series are in there, but are any of the newer -- you mentioned success in the Hybrid funds. Are the Global Total Return and Global Balanced Funds entering the conversation, along with Asian Growth? Or any others I'm missing in there?","Vijay Chandur Advani","No. This is Vijay. Absolutely, I think the main theme -- we are seeing the retail clients, really, many of them being cautious even if they don't come straight back into equity. It's really in the balanced suite of products, and clearly, the leader there is Franklin Income. But besides Franklin income, we have several other balanced products that are U.S.-focused, Franklin Balanced Fund. Some of them is the convertible securities fund. So we have a full suite. And then those that want some global exposure are looking at the Templeton Global Balanced, which is our leader. And we have seen that even on the offshore side, so you're really seeing 2 rotations, again, 1 from domestic fixed to global fixed. And then from fixed to those that have more risk appetite go directly into equities, but many of them are initially going into a balanced, whether it's the Franklin or the Templeton Balanced Funds.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","And I would just add. I mean, the 1 fund that is probably not on a lot of people's radar screen, but if you look at our SICAV range, it had more net inflows than we did outflows in the Asian Growth, would be the European Growth, which had $1.3 billion in net inflows for the quarter. So that has a lot of momentum right now on the strength of Europe and a relatively new fund for us.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then the second thing I wanted to ask about is the kind of -- if you could bifurcate the discussions you're having with institutional and retail clients on alternatives. And I know that's a broadly defined concept to pay on which channel, but I'd be curious as to whether, a, you feel like you're well positioned and have everything you need in alternatives? And b, what the kind of demand themes are between institutional or retail?","Vijay Chandur Advani","I think on the retail side, it's really more the real estate. We've been in that market for quite some time now, so the real estate funds, we're also seeing -- as I mentioned earlier, we are looking at launching our K2 capability in both the '40 Act and the SICAV. So those, I would say, are the 2 main. On the institutional side, we have a global summit, which is more a global fixed income, global macro fund, and that's come up with a pretty good track record now, so we are seeing some interest there with consultants and even gatekeepers. So I would say those are the 2 or 3 that are -- that we're focused on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Douglas Sipkin from Susquehanna.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just a follow-up a little bit on some of the products. I think you guys did a good job of highlighting. Just looking to drill down a little bit more on the Global Balanced, can you provide us with the size, and maybe sort of how long of a track record does it actually have? I was trying to dig and figure it out, but I couldn't, so I was hoping you guys could shed some light on that. And then a balance sheet question. If you could just provide the percentage of cash, I guess, that's U.S. I know that normally comes in the Q.","Vijay Chandur Advani","So on the U.S. side, the Franklin Income, which is our main flagship Hybrid, as I think we mentioned, just completed its 65 years, and that's north of $80 billion, and I think that's public record. And we're seeing good flows there. The Templeton Global Balanced Fund which is more -- it was launched, I believe, about 3 or 4 years ago. And so it's yet early days, but we're seeing good traction. It's -- that fund is about $2 billion and hopefully growing. Those are our 2 main flagships. And then, as I mentioned, there are several others that are in the balanced Hybrid category that are a little smaller. Go ahead, finish up.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I'm sorry. Does that have an actual 3-year track record at this point?","Vijay Chandur Advani","Sorry. The other point I just wanted to mention was on the Franklin Income Fund, based on the success in the U.S. and the long track record, we also launched that in the SICAV range, and that has now seen pretty good flows, especially over the last 12 months. I think the flows were north of $500 million.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","So on the Templeton Balanced Fund, I think that was launched about 5 years ago, so it has a 3-year track record. And on the cash side, well, wait for the K to come out. It will be out shortly. And I'm going to say the range is about 55% to 60% -- say, 55% non-U.S. cash.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greggory Warren from Morningstar.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just touching back on the performance and sort of the flows as we look forward here. We're getting to that point where we're starting to roll off 5-year numbers during the financial crisis. Are there any areas on the equity side, either global, international or the domestic, where you guys feel particularly well positioned, do you think that you can get out there in front of advisers and start pushing it first part of next year's -- portfolio start to get reallocated?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, first of all, I mean, I think we've been out it pushing in front of advisers as hard as we can since the financial crisis. That's been our theme on equity, so we think we hopefully are already in good position to do that. I think as I mentioned earlier in the call, the Templeton side, it just takes a while to get back into -- us back on the shelf, with -- especially with retail. But I think on the strength of the 1-, 3- and 5-year numbers now in the history, and the strength of the brand, and really just the bet that was made on Europe and it had a tough time, I think that's the area that it's in the best position. I think you have pockets of strength throughout. Our Rising Dividend Fund continues to do extremely well in this environment, the Franklin Growth Fund. All of those are large significant funds with long-term track records that are very much entrenched right in a lot of platforms. But I think the additional piece would be the global equity side.","Vijay Chandur Advani","Yes. I think, yes, Greg. We're seeing, besides global equity, is even our regional funds that are focused on Europe. As Greg mentioned, the Franklin European growth, Mutual European, I think those we're seeing more interest, and I think both advisers, gatekeepers feel that that's where we're going to see more growth. And the Templeton foreign fund, in particular, that had taken up a big exposure to Europe, I think we're seeing some good traction there as well.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Yes, I wasn't insinuating you guys you weren't pushing this stuff that, in fact, I'll give you credit. You're probably one of the few companies out there in the last 5 years that's actually actively been pushing equities despite the headwinds that have been out there, so good work on that side. On the fixed income side, as we look at sort of the global international platform, I know as well as you do that it's not correlated to U.S. interest rates, but I got to wonder how hard is it really going to be to sell fixed income funds in a rising interest rate environment here, getting -- when sort of the mantra is get out?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think the market, you will really see the market differentiate funds like the Global Bond Fund, which I think in a lot of people's minds gets lumped into a fixed income category, when I was looking at more like an alternative or kind of a fund that's not really correlated with the equity markets and currency's going to be the bigger driver. So I think what you've seen even this year, if we come in and have a positive return against most fixed income funds which are negative, that's going to tell the market that this is something different than a typical fixed income fund. So I think you can. I think it just comes down to, as the records move apart from each other, where rising rates and longer maturities put a negative total return, those will be hard to sell. But I also think that we have a lot of funds positioned and that we know, like everybody else, that the rates don't always go down and we have a lot of funds, we have floating rate funds, one of our top-selling funds right now, that hopefully can do well in a rising rate environment.","Vijay Chandur Advani","Yes. And keep in mind that even on the institutional side in Europe and Asia, yet 80%, 90% of fixed income allocation is domestic. And I think that as they globalize that and get into global fixed income, you can see opportunities both on the institutional and retail side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Most have been asked and answered. Just one follow up on the superstar question. You mentioned you have strategies in place to retain PMs like Michael Hasenstab and Ed Perks. I was wondering if you can give us a little bit more information about how you retain them, if it's deferred stock, is it noncompetes, that would be helpful. And then I think as one of your follow-ups, you mentioned that when other star PMs have left in the past, the assets didn't follow. One of the more unique things about Michael's products is he has a huge SICAV following. When you refer to business that didn't leave in the past, did it have the same sort of SICAV presence that he and his funds had, or was it mostly '40 Act?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","You're not helping my year-end compensation discussions, but anyway, the first question around how do you retain, I mean, it goes back to what I talked about earlier, but we do special long-term awards that hopefully create the kind of long-term incentives that make it difficult for people to consider other alternatives and also vesting on those that talks about things like succession, planning and have the very specific metrics in place, develop successors, and they understand, too. It's in, really, to their interest. I mean, the demands on those 2 are very high, from the retail channel when you look at all the different places where we are sold, so having senior people there is extremely important. At the end of the day, we -- there's no ball and chain. I mean, we're at-will employers. And we just do our best to make sure that the incentives are a little bit different than just your traditional bonus every year. And we try to be as creative as possible in doing that. And things like Mike -- Michael Hasenstab with the global summits fund is something that's unique to that area because we do recognize, obviously, that the fund is so closely associated with what he has done.","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes, and I'll -- this is Ken. I'm trying to tackle the question on SICAV which is a good point that you raised. I think, certainly, SICAV is larger part of our business than it was in the past, and there does tend to be a shorter-term time horizon. But 2 points I want to make. I guess if you go back and think about some of the large departures, 1 was at Templeton a few years ago. And at that point, the overall assets under management were smaller, but we have a huge SICAV presence with the Templeton Growth Fund. And so I think the comparisons are valid now as it was historically. So we didn't see a large decrease in the Templeton SICAV product at that time when that manager departed.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Great. And I'll try this as a data question. I'm not sure you guys would know it, but if you look at Global Bond, Global Bond has kind of divided returns coming from the debt side and also the currency side, and there's been, I don't know, a higher level of color given over time on what comes from where. As we think about 2013, is it possible for you to say how the currency side of his products have done? Have they either positively contributed or are they detracted from returns this year?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes. I mean, we can get that. I don't -- I think if the fund, as I mentioned, if it has a positive return for the year in a raising rate environment, you would think currency was a net positive for attribution. That's my quick summary, but we can get the exact info for you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marc Irizarry from Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Greg, maybe this is for you, but also, Vijay. If you have a perspective on institutional, globally, where are sort of the institutional momentum in your business is building, are there certain pockets where you're seeing around the globe, maybe more institutional momentum, and particularly, I guess as you head into next year, is there any -- are there sort of asset classes that you'd point out as well on a global basis institutionally?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I'll just start with -- I mean, I was looking at the wins over the quarter and ones that haven't been funded yet as well, and I think the consistent category would be global equity and that's not new to anybody, but that's where we're seeing. We also have seen it at add-ons to additional accounts that have been with us a long time, and then not based again on the strength, we're starting to see a positive trend on that. But I don't think there's anything new from a category that I've seen, just more global equity searches and more wins, but I'll ask Vijay then.","Vijay Chandur Advani","Yes. I think in the U.S., you're seeing more of -- more searches in global equities, for sure. We've been talking about that for a couple of years, and our exposure to Europe at one point was a drag on performance. And so, while I think consultants appreciated our value discipline, they are now looking at us more closely. And the second region, I would say, is really Asia. Asia's institutional business is actually growing quite well. In fact, as institutions and sovereign wealth funds try to get more global in their exposure, both global bonds and global equities tend to be our forte, and therefore, we're seeing some activity there as well.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, thank you, everyone, for attending the call today, and we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"10202":["Franklin Resources, Inc. (NYSE:BEN) Q3 2015 Earnings Call July 29, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Operator","Welcome to Franklin Resources' Earnings Commentary for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2015. Statements made in this commentary regarding Franklin Resources, Inc, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

This commentary was pre-recorded.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hello and thank you for joining today to discuss the third quarter results. I am Greg Johnson, CEO, along with Ken Lewis, our CFO.","The current market environment with heightened concerns over volatility, currency exposure, fluctuating energy prices, and rising rates presents a number of challenges to investors.","First, I'd like to share a few highlights for the quarter. Delivering strong investment performance for our clients remains our top priority and we're pleased to see that relative investment performance of our U.S. retail and cross-border fixed-income products remain strong with the percentage of assets in the top two quartiles increasing since March overall standard periods.","The outperformance of our global fixed-income funds helped to ease redemption pressure on those funds resulting in lower outflows. The U.S. and cross-border Franklin K2 Alternative Strategies funds, which together attracted over $600 million in net flows for the quarter have been our fastest growing new fund launch in the history of the company. The cross-border fund is now available in 23 countries after launching in 14 new countries since March with 9 more in progress.","Despite the current headwinds tempering flows we continue to deliver solid financial results and distribute excess capital to our shareholders. Operating income was up for the quarter at $770 million, a 2% increase despite flat revenue. And on the capital management front we've returned $1.4 billion to shareholders over the trailing 12 months through dividends and repurchases. We also continue to enhance our product offerings and during the quarter launched a new range of Retirement Payout funds for Defined Contribution participants. Our retirement planning has historically focused on asset accumulation. Products to optimize the distribution of those assets in retirement require further innovation so we designed these products to support the transition to this draw down phase.","Turning to investment performance of our U.S. retail and cross-border funds on slide six, overall relative performance of our equity excluding hybrid and fixed-income strategies remained solid with the majority of assets ranked in the top half their peer groups.","Of course, there are many ways to look at performance and asset-weighted view of peer performance is just one. In our 10-Q filing this morning we disclosed performance by investment objective against the benchmark and against peers. Looking at that view equity performance strengthened against passive benchmarks for the one-year, three-year and five-year period while having mixed results against peers, which was opposite of what we saw for the U.S taxable and tax-free fixed-income strategies.","Underperformance of the Franklin Income Fund, which represents almost 30% of the assets in the equity and hybrid category, shown on slide six, weighed on aggregate performance for the one-year and three-year periods due to weakness in interest rate sensitive utilities, consumer discretionary and energy sector holdings. Although, the fund had a good start at the beginning of the quarter with strong absolute relative returns, the market pulled back across several equity sectors later in the quarter which led to a decline in relative performance.","As noted, other equity-focused strategies have generally had good relative performance. The Mutual Global Discovery Fund, for example, outperformed its peer group across all periods as of June. On top of strong performance we have been working hard to promote this fund with new marketing materials highlighting our truly active management investment strategy and the consistent low-volatility track record.","In general, I believe that as a firm we are well position for investment capability and strategy perspective particularly when interest rates began to normalize. Such an environment has traditionally correlated with the outperformance of value investing. Additionally, many of our fixed-income strategies have been defensively positioned in terms of duration for some time now.","Assets under management ended the quarter at $867 billion, a decrease of about 1.5% since March. However, average assets under management increased slightly during the period. This divergence was due to the market pullback in June.","The mix of assets under management by investment objective and sales region is consistent with what we recorded at the end of March as we generally experience only gradual changes in the mix from quarter-to-quarter.","Net new outflows increased to $11 billion primarily the result of 19% decline in long-term sales which was felt across all investment objectives. Flows drove most of the decrease in lending assets as market depreciation was only about $2 billion this quarter.","From a retail perspective, we faced continued headwinds during the quarter as a result of a confluence of market factors that impacted the short-term performance of several U.S. and SICAV flagship funds.","In the past we have seen that it takes time for funds flows to recover following periods of short-term underperformance. Often we see a period of sharp redemptions followed by a period of slower sales which eventually recover and start driving improved organic growth. This quarter redemptions stabilized, but we did see a pronounced decline in sales particularly in some of our largest funds.","In the current market climate a number of our flagship funds have been impacted at the same time. We are confident however that this is the part of a natural business cycle and believe the demand for these products will recover has investment strategies of our portfolio teams play out.","In the meantime, we continue to keep advisors informed about the current positioning of the portfolios and the perspectives behind the portfolio managers' conviction. We also continue to look for opportunities to cross-sell and do enhance our product offerings.","Also contributing to the overall decrease in sales this quarter was a drop in institutional business volumes as that segment snapped its streak of quarterly sales growth. While we did book a large funding for a global equity mandate, a handful of large redemptions resulted in net outflows in excess of $3 billion from global equity accounts while fixed-income strategies generated positive net sales.","Clearly, this was a disappointing quarter from a gross sales perspective, but net flows of our institutional business are always impacted by the timing of individual mandates and redemptions as well as client interest, which we think remains very strong.","Looking now at flows by investment objective, global equity flows declined this quarter due mostly to the institutional redemptions I just mentioned, but also because of the increased redemptions from the Templeton Asian Growth Fund.","To the positive, we continue to see interest in European equity-oriented products managed by our Mutual Series team, including the Mutual Global Discovery Fund that had almost $300 million in net flows this quarter. Additionally, global fixed-income outflows improved a bit this quarter.","The Templeton Global Bond and Total Return Funds continue to deliver strong out-performance versus their peers and benchmark. However, short-term absolute performance in broad market flows out of fixed-income due to fears of rising rates and market volatility, continue to pressure net flows. This has remained largely a retail channel phenomenon as institutional investors have not redeemed as heavily and net flows remain positive in that segment.","U.S. equity outflows increased a bit this quarter, but we continue to see interest in a number of growth strategies, including the strong performing Small Cap Growth and DynaTech Funds. Hybrid flows turned negative this quarter due to outflows of about $1.6 billion from U.S. and cross-border versions of the Franklin Income Fund, due to the performance issues I discussed earlier.","As I mentioned previously, our Franklin K2 Alternative Strategies Funds generated over $600 million in net inflows and the cross-border version was among the best selling funds firm-wide this quarter.","Taxable U.S. fixed-income slipped into outflows this quarter due to a large drop off in institutional sales as well as outflows from some high yield and government bond funds. Tax-free fixed-income funds also experienced outflows this quarter, though we did see continued interest in intermediate term strategies.","I'd now like to turn it over to Ken to discuss operating results.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Greg. Overall, the quarter's financial results were strong. Stable revenues and disciplined expense management drove the growth in operating income, which increased to $770 million. However, the impact of non-operating items decreased net income to $504 million and diluted earnings per share to $0.82.","Looking at revenues, investment management fees remained essentially unchanged at about $1.3 billion this quarter. Lower performance fees and a slightly lower daily average fee rate were essentially offset by the additional day in the quarter.","Sales and distribution revenue was $567 million this quarter. Lower average non-U.S. assets and a decline in sales drove the decrease, but this was partially offset by a higher U.S. assets and the impact of a longer quarter.","Shareholder servicing fees were about $67 million and were relatively unchanged over the prior quarter and other revenue was about $27 million due to the increased interest income from some consolidated products.","Looking now at expenses on slide 18, sales and distribution expense was $694 million this quarter and the majority of this decrease was due to the changes in assets under management that also impacted sales and distribution revenue.","Compensation and benefits expense decreased this quarter to $364 million, which was lower than I originally anticipated back in April, due mostly to lower variable compensation as well as a foreign exchange benefit of about $5 million. Based on where we are now, I continue to anticipate that the full year compensation expense will only increase by about 1% over 2014.","Information systems and technology expense increased to $58 million this quarter. Although it's hard to predict the exact timing of these expenses, as I mentioned before, this expense tends to be higher in the fourth quarter due to the fact that some larger projects like software renewal and infrastructure development are typically finalized in the second half of our fiscal year.","Investments in our security and communications infrastructure and desktop server and storage updates have driven these costs higher this year. And we continue to have a healthy pipeline for strategic projects that will enhance our fund administration, performance, risk and human resource management platforms. Due to these items, I now expect the full year expense to be in the range of 2.5% to 3% higher than fiscal year 2014.","Occupancy expense decreased to $31 million this quarter, and general, administrative and other expense increased a bit to $85 million.","Looking now at profitability, the operating margin increased to 38% for the fiscal year-to-date period and we remain focused on expense control in the current environment. The quarterly tax rate increased to 28.9% due to some prior quarter benefits that did not recur which brings the fiscal year-to-date rate to 29.2%. We continue to expect the fiscal year rate to be within the range of 29% to 30%.","Other income net of non-controlling interest negatively impacted earnings this quarter by $28 million. By far, the biggest detractor was the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, which resulted in realized and unrealized foreign exchange losses of $30 million.","Interest expense increased to $13.7 million this quarter, while the rate of our 10-year notes issued in March was actually lower than that of the five-year notes that matured in May. There was a net increase in debt outstanding and we obviously only realized a partial quarter benefit from the maturity.","Moving on to equity capital management, we repurchased 4.3 million shares during the quarter at a total cost of about $218 million, which represents an increase over the prior few quarters and was one of the highest quarterly levels in the past several years. In fact, open market repurchases increased 20% versus the prior quarter despite an 11% decrease in 10b-18 buyable trading volumes.","As you can see on slide 23, over the course of the past year, we returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders via repurchases and dividends, pushing the nominal payout ratio well above the 50% level which approximates our U.S. cash flow generation.","Finally, we are pleased to see signs of increased bipartisan support for international corporate tax reform on the horizon which may include favorable repatriation provisions.","With that, I'd like to conclude our comments.

My name is John, and I'll be your conference operator today.","Statements made in this conference call regarding Franklin Resources Inc., which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.","These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including -- in the risk factors and MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. (Operator Instructions).","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin.","Greg Johnson","","Hello and thank you everyone for joining the call today with me in our studio in San Mateo is Ken Lewis our CFO. Before we address any questions you may have regarding the earnings release of 10-Q that we filed this morning, I\u2019d like to make sure that you are all aware of our upcoming Investor Day in New York on May 22. Key leaders and investment professionals from across the Franklin Templeton organization are joining us for what should be a very informative day, so hopefully we\u2019ll see you there. If you cannot attend in person, the event will be webcast. The agenda and registration instructions are available from our website or by contacting investor relations.","Now turning to our quarterly results. I think overall we feel that it was a very solid quarter. Most importantly, investment performance remained strong, and although we did experience heightened redemption activity in certain products and regions during the quarter, pre-market organic asset growth was strong in several other areas.","With that, we\u2019d be happy to answer any questions. So I\u2019d like to ask the operator to open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Bill Katz from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Bill Katz - Citigroup","","Ken a question for you, perhaps just sort of curious what\u2019s driving the increase in the comp into the second half of this year? And then, what\u2019s the outlook as you roll into the New Year?","Ken Lewis","","I would characterize it as planned spending, a little bit of headcount. There is a couple of things on the horizon that might be -- I wouldn\u2019t say are a trend, more of one-offs that may occur. So I was just kind of giving you a heads up on that, but in terms of the general business, there is just a couple of planned initiatives that I thought might -- or we think might increase headcount going forward slightly, as I mentioned.","Bill Katz - Citigroup","So would you expect to build off of that as you roll into the new fiscal year?","Ken Lewis","No I don\u2019t think so. I think after kind of an initial increase in the next two quarters, it should level out.","Bill Katz - Citigroup","And my followup question is just on the Global Bond outflows this quarter, could you perhaps give us a sense of what happened as the quarter progressed and where you\u2019ve seen the deepest rate of attrition? I guess the second part of the question is, do you need to crank up the ad spend to get the gross sales to accelerate?","Ken Lewis","I wish it was that easy regarding the ad spend. I think, if you look at the progression and redemptions and clearly that area has been under pressure. I think, first of all, just looking where the majority of the assets came in in Europe and a lot of money as a safe harbor was going into Global Bonds, and then when you had European equities take off, you had a reallocation. So I think that\u2019s more of a shorter term trend in pressure where people are now investing in European equities, especially European, so that puts a near-term pressure. I think for the quarter, the heightened redemptions were around the Ukraine situation and having some exposure, we don\u2019t think very much, I mean certainly 3%, 4% is a well-diversified risk for the fund, but I think if at any time you have that kind of headline risk in a fund, that can lead to some redemptions as well. So, the redemptions were clearly higher earlier in the quarter, and we feel like as we\u2019re progressing in a newer quarter that that trend is certainly improving. ","And I\u2019ll just also add that if you look at the U.S versus the SICAV fund, it really has been concentrated around the SICAV fund where you have more concentration with gatekeepers and probably heavier portfolio allocations to individual investors that own them for a very different set of reasons with the question of the euro at the time and problems overall in Europe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Kim from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Michael Kim - Sandler O'Neill","Hey guys, good afternoon. First, just a follow-up on the Global Bond Fund, just given sort of the volatility across the FX markets and the impact that\u2019s had on sort of the returns for the Global Bond Fund, I know that longer-term track records remain strong, but do you feel like the recent performance pressures maybe make it a bit harder to differentiate that fund in this type of environment?","Greg Johnson","Well, I think any time you have equity markets as strong as they have been, that\u2019s going to put pressure on this type of fund. But again, how sustainable is that going forward. I think that\u2019s the question. And with regard to shorter-term performance, this fund is positioned for rising rates, and if you look at the year-to-date, anybody with longer duration, which is our peer group in the global bond area, had the benefit of rates declining, so that's put some near-term pressure, but the performance looks really fine from a standpoint of currencies and its allocation, so we feel good about it and we\u2019re always going to have under or over in the short-term, but the underperformance is very small and most of that's due to, as I said, the duration of the fund.","Michael Kim - Sandler O'Neill","Got it. And then second question, just seems like one of the themes that maybe emerging across kind of the institutional equities landscape is just rising demand for more concentrated equity strategy. So, just wondering if to what extent you might be seeing signs of that trend, and then which of your strategies might be in a position to capitalize on sort of institutions looking for higher-asset type products?","Greg Johnson","Well, I think that\u2019s been characteristic of a lot of our different funds that have concentration, and certainly you can look at an example, our Asia growth fund and our U.K. (inaudible) fund, which are concentrated -- more concentrated portfolios, so we think that trend as an active manager that making bigger bets does ultimately make sense, it\u2019s going to create more volatility versus the index on the shorter run, but again for institutions that understand that and have a longer-term perspective, I think that that trend should continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Chris Harris - Wells Fargo","Thanks. Good afternoon guys. Greg, just want to follow-up on that first question that you answered regarding the global bond redemptions. Is it possible to kind of quantify how much of those redemptions were coming from, kind of, European investors moving up the risk curve a bit versus how much is coming from kind of issues surrounding Ukraine and maybe China slowing down?","Greg Johnson","No. I mean it\u2019s really difficult, I think we just do our best job, but I think if you look at the global bond fund in the U.S. it didn\u2019t experience anywhere near the redemptions of the fund that primarily has been distributed to Europeans. So, a very different set of reasons and issues I think on each side, but clearly the global bond and total return represented about $8 billion of outflows from our SICAV fund, and the U.S. fund had just about $0.5 billion in total outflows, and that\u2019s a similar sized fund. So you can see just how different the reasons are, and in the same set of issues, I think if performance was an issue or Ukraine was an issue, I think it would hit both. I really think it\u2019s more about you had a heavier allocation for a different set of reasons for the average investor and now they are much more comfortable with more of a risk on view of Europe than they had before.","Chris Harris - Wells Fargo","Okay. Yes, that\u2019s an interesting point. Okay. Follow-up question then on the U.S. equity side of the business, I mean obviously a great quarter for you guys, I am really surprised that how strong it really was and so just wondering, whether this quarter had any kind of one-offs that might affect the growth I mean I assume seasonality had some impact. And then more broadly based on the trends you guys are seeing in that part of your franchise, do you think this rate of growth is sustainable?","Greg Johnson","Well, I think it really was the highlight of the quarter. I mean when you look at gross sales at 8.2 billion on U.S. equities, that\u2019s been a big push for the firm to build awareness and distribution on the U.S. equity side. There really were no one-offs as far as large institutional mandates that were funded during the quarter, so most of that was through the traditional mutual funds. ","I think the $2.6 billion in net flows, overall gross up 35%, I think the only concern would be that one of our best sellers was biotech which has been somewhat under pressure more recently, but everything else, you parade down the line U.S. opportunities fund, rising dividend fund, all have been strong drivers of growth, and I think that will continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Worthington - JPMorgan","Okay. This is sort of a follow-up on the last question. So in domestic equities, can you flush out more, so you mentioned biotech in terms of -- in rising dividends, but the -- as we look at kind of the publicly available data, the strength seemed to be bigger than we would have been able to maybe figure that on our own. So was there something beyond just the funds or maybe it\u2019s coming out of the SICAV products as well, so any more color you could share in terms of products and distribution would help me? Thank you.","Greg Johnson"," ","The only thing I can think of that exchanges somehow could come into that number, maybe more difficult to model, but I\u2019m not really sure why that you would have trouble figuring that out. It\u2019s really the SICAV that's been the bigger driver with U.S. growth and biotech in terms of flows versus the U.S. funds.","Ken Worthington - JPMorgan","Got it, okay. Thank you. And then in terms of K2, what should we be expecting here for the next quarter or two in terms of performance fees, if you could help us with the outlook there, it would be great. Thanks.","Jim Giertz "," ","I think if you remember back last quarter, we had -- I think it was somewhere in the 20s of performance fees. So, in an order of magnitude in the June quarter, I think you\u2019re talking about, as of now 20% of that number maybe or a quarter of that number.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Lee from KBW. Please go ahead.","Robert Lee - KBW","Maybe just going through the balance sheet and capital a little bit, in the past, you guys have taken on some debt here or there which partially funded some special dividends and share repurchases, and clearly it would seem that you have more capacity to do that, so could you maybe just comment a little bit on maybe what are some of the -- in order for you guys to be comfortable doing that if that\u2019s a possibility, what are kind of some of the metrics there that you take into consideration? Are there specific leverage ratios or credit ratings that you\u2019re focused on that kind of put a governor on your willingness to maybe put a little more debt on to return a little bit more capital?","Greg Johnson"," ","Yes, so I think we got a similar question on this last quarter as well. There is no reluctance to take on debt I would say. We don\u2019t have any plans to do so either, but I think we continue our practice in the past kind of look at the overall debt ratio, look at the maturities of debt coming up, look at the interest environment and forecast and just be opportunistic like we\u2019ve been in the past. I think that also out of current cash flow generation, we have the ability to be flexible on the capital management side. The Board does look at the payout ratio that we\u2019ve been putting, putting on earnings report, so that\u2019s why we put it there, and also the total share of the return of the stock will be the two overwriting metrics.","Robert Lee - KBW","Okay, and Greg, I'm just curious you talked, mentioned in Europe saying better demand in the marketplace for equity strategies and that's coming somewhat at the expenses of maybe Global Bond, but can you maybe talk a little bit about how you feel about your positioning in Europe from an equities perspective? I mean, clearly you\u2019ve built the big SICAV fixed income products but given that you still have some modest outflows from global equity strategies, did you feel like you\u2019re getting your fair share over that movement in Europe from fixed to equities? Is that -- kind of what\u2019s the strategy there to pick off more of that flow?","Greg Johnson"," ","I would argue that if you look at the world Europe we -- it's probably our best market for equities overall where if you look at the European growth fund, the mutual European fund, these are all top selling funds and it\u2019s really due to European distribution. So, as a percentage, it\u2019s heavier, the drag in Europe's been over the last quarter or two has been the Asian growth which again is not U.S. equity but in our overall equity number and that\u2019s been the third highest level of outflows for any fund. But the good news is that the performance is doing better there short-term and we had some pension redemptions in Latin America that we will then fund, but we think that's subsided as well. So, overall Europe probably the strongest shelf space and distribution position for us for equities in any other region.","Ken Lewis","Rob, if I can just chime in to, I know, you\u2019ve asked about equities but just made me remember -- we\u2019ve been experienced a pretty positive trend on the Franklin income fund in the SICAV products too over the last year. So either that might be kind of an indicator or investors taking on more risk, and then as Greg mentioned, we have some strong equity showing as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Can you update us on how much cash that\u2019s outside of the U.S. right now and also your estimate of how much free cash flow you\u2019re getting from your businesses outside of U.S?","Greg Johnson"," ","The cash flow generated, it's about 50% range that\u2019s the generation part I think, it\u2019s in our filing but I feel like the numbers are 60% non-U.S.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Okay. So 60% of current amount.","Greg Johnson"," ","Right. And so when you\u2019re looking at net income, it's probably a descent proxy for cash flow and we\u2019re generating about 50-50.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Got it. And given no plans for a tax repatriation holiday in Verizon, what is your plan to do with the cash that sits outside of the U.S. right now and also the future free cash that you\u2019re generating over the next few years here?","Greg Johnson"," ","I think the cash is there to reinvest in the offshore business and that we\u2019re going to continue our practice there. And as you know, all of the capital management activity as well as the income tax and all that are come out of the corporate holding company, the U.S. holding company. But there is a lot of cash being generated there as I mentioned, 50% of the income which keeps growing. So, I think we have a lot of flexibility to do both fund our international growth as well as our capital policy requirements.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","And Ken one more question, do you have the CapEx number for just reinvestment in international businesses on let\u2019s say the last 12 months?","Ken Lewis","Yes, I don\u2019t have that number, but we\u2019ve made small acquisitions and we\u2019ll continue to do that, I\u2019m getting a little feedback on the mic, but I don\u2019t have that number Andy.","Operator","And next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dan Fannon - Jefferies","Good afternoon. I guess Ken just following up on your comments about the salaries and benefits and where you\u2019re hiring or hiring, can you talk about the regions or the areas which that hiring will take place? And then any other color on any of the other expense line items for the rest of the remainder of the year?","Ken Lewis","Yes, I think in general the kind of the planned expenditures relates to portfolio and also some distribution expanding our global footprint through distribution, that\u2019d be the focus of it. The business grows, we continue to support it but number that from a back office perspective, we have those low cost jurisdictions, so it doesn\u2019t impact the comp line that much. And in general I think the only other area that we\u2019re seeing increased spending is on the technology side, so I don\u2019t think it will be a lot, but may be in another 1%.","Dan Fannon - Jefferies","Okay. And then just in terms of the redemption trends, Greg you mentioned in hybrid there were some one-off outflows and then obviously international being the area where redemptions picked up. Can you talk about specific regions outside the U.S. that might have been more elevated than others?","Greg Johnson","Within hybrid?","Dan Fannon - Jefferies","Hybrid specifically about those outflows and then just generally for the rest of the buckets and international?","Greg Johnson","Yes, I mean, the hybrid, the couple of factors that I think affected the quarterly flows. One, we had two or actually two separate accounts but all related to one client that with K2 that was close to a $1 billion that we previously announced and that affected the quarter and hit the hybrid number, so that was a one-time lower fee $1 billion effect. ","The other was a large -- one of our large distributors in their model and they had a very significant exposure to Franklin Income Fund reduced that exposure and that affected, it hit some exchange as well and the balance fund but just because of the high yield exposure they reallocated that and that resulted into what we think is again a one-time quarterly pressure because the underlying strength for hybrid in the Income Fund continues to be very good and actually this quarter with rates declining year to date that that fund did better and is back to being top in every period, so it has continued momentum.","As I mentioned, the only trend around redemptions I think of note I mean Asia Pacific was actually did very well. For the quarter it was really Europe and focused on the three funds, it was the global bond total return in Asian growth and everything else would have been a great story specially on the equity side, but those three have been under pressure, they are under pressure in Europe and that\u2019s where most of those assets were raised. So, that\u2019s really the only one to highlight.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks guys. Ken, maybe just a couple of number things, so I hear you on comp in terms of the outlook, I guess just when we think about the current environment whether it\u2019s on the flows or the market backdrop, I guess when you factor in the outlook on headcount versus that just is there any change or you just saying the 1% based on hiring needs, but then obviously there is variability in the operating environment?","Ken Lewis","Yes, I think there is variability in the timing, so that\u2019s why the time's a little squishy there. But generally we think we\u2019re -- when we talked a few quarters ago we talked about keeping expenses kind of in the low single digits range and I think we\u2019re sticking with that, it\u2019s just that there\u2019s a lot of planned expenditures and if the business environment supports it, we know we\u2019ll go through with those plans but it\u2019s something that we have ultimate flexibility on. ","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay got it, and then two other items which I know they\u2019re always hard to predict and they move around, but just wanted to get your sense on the non-controlling interest just seemed like it was you know more of a positive into this quarter and then the tax rate was on the opposite side and you had a little bit of a headwind, so anything in terms of the outlook, you know on either of those items, obviously they move around a lot but any color.","Ken Lewis","","Yes the non-controlling interest and all of the activity in non-operating income related to sponsored investment products and VIEs, I mean that\u2019s really hard for us to predict, we try to give you some colors to where, all that\u2019s related to our seed money basically in investment so we try to give you some color in our filings about what those, what categories those investments are in, but I sympathize with your task of trying to project that line item. In terms of the tax expense, we\u2019re still feeling that we\u2019re in a kind of 29.5 to 30% range.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay, all right thanks.","Ken Lewis ","","No, it\u2019s a factor of mix too, but based on the current projections, that\u2019s our position.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken - UBS ","","Thanks, good afternoon guys. First this question quickly, I think you highlighted in your three recorded comments, in the mini funds there was some relief in the outflows in March and was just curious if you saw that carrying through to April or if that was, if that period could just be a March phenomenon .","Ken Lewis "," ","Well you know we don\u2019t disclose flows, because -- and I think one of the reasons for that is we don\u2019t disclose flows inter quarter because it\u2019s pretty short term and things can change, but all of the -- let\u2019s put it this way, all of the commentary that we\u2019ve made you know we do see that continuing in terms of decreased redemptions in muni bonds and some of the other products that Greg was talking about.","Greg Johnson"," ","And I would just add that I think it\u2019s encouraging that the gross sales were up over 20%, quarter over quarter and certainly with Puerto Rico having a strong offering and strong demand, I mean that helped the market but overall, really the intermediate to shorter term is where you\u2019re seeing strong inflows and that\u2019s the same for us the Fed intermediates been the strong one. So I think any longer duration that you are still going to be under a little bit of pressure, but certainly a lot better than where they were a quarter ago.","Brennan Hawken - UBS ","","Terrific, thanks for that color. And then another one on capital, you all mentioned and you highlighted a couple of times in answering Craig\u2019s and Bob\u2019s question that, and you mentioned prerecorded comments that 50% of earnings in the US, is there to support dividends and buybacks but you know is that a way to adjust and make us think about a 50% of earnings payout ratio as opposed to you know the 60 to 65% ratio that you guys targeted in the middle of last year. ","Greg Johnson"," ","No I don\u2019t think that changes, I think using the word targeting is even a little bit strong but that\u2019s been a part historical rate and I think we\u2019re kind of, we\u2019ve realized that and we realized that that\u2019s where the expectations are and if we were going to change it, I think we would transmit that well in advance, so there\u2019s really no change there, I don\u2019t think you should imply that there would be a change from the 50-50 comment, but we\u2019ll continue to be opportunistic and obviously it\u2019s a function of a lot of things including the market but regarding the international, there was a question earlier on CapEx, but really I think one of the largest uses of our offshore cash is product development and seeding new products. We have a lot of offshore cash in new products that are sold around the world to generate a track record for that. So, in our mind it\u2019s kind of R&D, international R&D that we\u2019re using a lot of that balance sheet for.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Douglas Sipkin from Susquehannah, please go ahead.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehannah","","Yes, thank you good afternoon guys. I hate to beat a dead horse but I think it\u2019s an important topic for you guys, particularly in light of what your comments on the last question. I guess I\u2019m just trying to reconcile, you guys haven\u2019t changed the target at all, the last two quarters it\u2019s well below the target, I guess what am I missing, because either, and for at least from my vantage point, either you\u2019re kind of cautious on the markets, that\u2019s what I\u2019m reading or maybe there\u2019s a strategic opportunity that no one seems to be picking up, just looking at trailing payout ratios versus your guidance. So maybe you could shed a little bit more light on that I apologize if it\u2019s repetitive, but it\u2019s definitely I think a good topic for you guys, one that matters a lot.","Ken Lewis","On the previous targets trailing 12 months, so a while back we had a special dividend and that kind of rolled off, so that\u2019s where you really see the decrease happen. The special dividend at that time was primarily tax driven, there was tax reasons to do that and that is a special dividend and there wasn\u2019t a special dividend this year. So you see that the other factor is in the first quarter of this year, the markets were in a pretty good run and we just felt we kind of scaled back the share repurchase because of the overall macro-environment. But then pulled back in January and elsewhere you saw this quarter we stepped it up probably about a third over the previous quarter.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehannah","Got you. So I guess then just interpreting those comments, it feels like maybe the stock's out of place where you guys would be more aggressive?","Ken Lewis "," ","Well I think it\u2019s a function of, it\u2019s a function of a lot of things including the overall market and so we\u2019re in there on a regular basis assessing the market and what opportunities are available. So it\u2019s kind of a day by day thing.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets","","I think in response to earlier questions, you indicated that you\u2019re global equity business had a number of pluses and minuses to it with the end number obviously being a minus 1.2 billion. Would you mind just going over a little bit more slowly than -- a little bit more slowly sort of where the strength was? I believe you indicated it was in Europe but if you go over the funds then enjoyed inflows versus those that enjoyed outflows leading to the net outflow?","Greg Johnson","The areas of strength within global equities would be our European growth fund which is managed by one of our local asset management team in Europe. Our mutual global discovery is another one that has done well in terms of net flows the Templeton side not -- I wouldn\u2019t say dramatic changes one way or another as far as flows and more even on a net basis. The pressure was really as I said earlier the Asian growth fund which has had about 1.9 billion in outflows and that\u2019s had a tremendous long-term performance but it is a more concentrated portfolio and obviously with pressure on emerging markets and some of the fed tapering issues, those currencies and things and some of those places got hit during the quarter and as I said earlier on the call we had some rebalancing or partial redemptions of some large institutional accounts from Latin America that we hope are kind of one-time hits and the recent performance has been very strong over the last three months. But that would be the summary in general on global equities.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets","So my second question is really a follow up to the first. As we look to the June quarter, obviously you can\u2019t get into the details of what the flows look like but conceptually would you -- is it right to be thinking of an improvement, a significant improvement in these very substantial outflows from the global fixed income area and at the same time getting more help than you got in the quarter just reported from global equity business, directional is that?","Greg Johnson","Yes, I mean I think it\u2019s early and why we are so careful because you know how quickly a headline can come out or something can change that can affect the quarterly flows. So as I have indicated earlier, I think some of the headline risk that affected some of those other funds appears to have moved that type of money out and hopefully that that is slowing down and we\u2019re seeing that and I hope that trend continues. But I think you\u2019re right, if I indicated we think they are one time quarterly effects on things then that would mean in a normal environment it should be better.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marc Irizarry from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Marc Irizarry - Goldman Sachs","","Greg can you give us an update on K2 and maybe some of the new initiatives on the product side around the alternative opportunity for you guys?","Greg Johnson","I think the first goal is to introduce a retail 40 Act fund and that took a lot of work to get that done as we\u2019ve said on previous calls. I think as far as distribution we\u2019re now on 45 platforms, so that was an undertaking as well. And I think we\u2019re near 380, 350 somewhere in that range million in those funds. It really hasn\u2019t the new platforms were kind of the key ones, the bigger broker dealers out there that specialize and have mandates to increase in alternative. So that I think that that side of it, the integration with people continues to go very well with the teams, so we\u2019re still very optimistic. I don\u2019t have any -- we\u2019re also very careful about setting a forecast or what is our expectation, I think it\u2019s to get the awareness out there and educate about the capabilities and then we see where that goes. But I think all of the trends around looking for alternative setting specific goals and this being one that people are pretty comfortable with or still pretty optimistic on the retail side.","Ken Lewis "," ","And also following the launch of the U.S. version of that fund, the cross border SICAV versus our funds in the works probably be launched sometime in the fall.","Marc Irizarry - Goldman Sachs","Okay and then just on hybrid, you may have mentioned this Greg but the uptick in growth sales during the quarter, can you give a sense maybe where that\u2019s coming, where those since some of the sources of strength there in terms of the uptick in hybrid and is that something also that you\u2019re seeing as may be more sustainable on the environment that we are in?","Greg Johnson"," ","I think there is a lot of factors, one the we\u2019ve mentioned earlier that the SICAV version of our Franklin Income Fund is starting to get traction and we had about 300 million in net inflows going into that one, also just the strength of our flagship income fund has contributed. And then some of redemptions in other areas have gone into the hybrid funds whether it\u2019s Global Bonds others that we\u2019ve seen exchanges moving into more of the balanced funds and that affects the overall gross and hybrid. So we think that that\u2019s a trend that will continue and especially the fear of rates rising and having different type of exposure to that will also contribute to more balanced hybrid funds.","Marc Irizarry - Goldman Sachs"," ","Okay, then, I know, it\u2019s tough to get too much color around this but just in terms of your seed portfolio on non-op gains, how should we think about what we saw this quarter maybe what the book looks like today and what the non-op, how should we think about non-op free cash?","Greg Johnson"," ","I think the best thing and the thing that we can do too is just kind of look to see generally speaking, so a lot of that is our trading investments, so you look to see like what categories are trading investments? As we go through the quarter, if it\u2019s global equity or if it\u2019s fixed income markets, you can kind of get some feel for where that line will be, it gets a little more completed because as funds get successful, we'll deconsolidate the funds, so that\u2019s a little hard to predict even for us, so there\u2019s always going be a margin of error for that but at least in our filing, we show you where the money is invested. It hasn\u2019t really changed that much in terms of composition by investment object over the last few quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","I guess this is a two part on performance, I\u2019m flipping through the queue. I noticed a pretty material improvement in the one year performance in both hybrid and in fixed income, so much so that, I guess, question is, one, was there a roll-off of a tough period four quarters ago because improvement is significant; and two, given that significant improvement, does that change your near-term ability to cross sell or to sell through both hybrid and tax rate just on these better results because they are much better?","Greg Johnson"," ","Well, I think that, I did mention earlier that Franklin Income Fund is a driver for us for hybrid flows to $90 billion fund in the U.S. and it was lagging I think last quarter, and the difference is rates have dropped that has more longer term duration in it\u2019s typical categories, so what rates do we\u2019re are going to drive that fund's performance specifically with exposure to groups like utility that has unperformed a quarter or two ago. So that will drive the shorter term number. It\u2019s not really -- it was just a better recent numbers, not -- there was nothing unusual or dropping off of prior quarter. It was just if rates go down, that one tends to do better than its category because it does have a higher yield than other hybrid type funds in its category.","Ken Lewis "," ","And I think last quarter was below the second quarter.","Greg Johnson"," ","Just below, right, just below.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","But tax free is a little bit different story?","Greg Johnson"," ","Well tax free for us again, it\u2019s really the function of duration because we position ours for lower volatility, higher tax free income. When rates drop, we tend to underperform in the short run but because we have lower fees, we tend to fine, in the longer term when we find that, that area if I have to wait, total return is less important than certainly equities, as far as how our market looks at them because our markets buying them more for stability and current income than they are trying to get an extra 20 or 30 basis points total return.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Greg Johnson"," ","Okay, well, thank you every one for participating on the call and we look forward to seeing many of you, May 22nd, New York. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating.

My name is John, and I'll be your operator for today's call. Please note that the financial results to be discussed in this conference are preliminary.","Statements made in this conference call regarding Franklin Resources Inc., which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future risks -- from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

[Operator Instructions] Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Ken Lewis and I are glad you could join us again today. This morning, we reported fourth quarter results capping off another solid year for the company despite the various challenges that have been faced with the global financial markets. Most importantly, our relative investment performance generally improved from strong to stronger, and head into our new fiscal year on an optimistic note. We also continue to execute on our strategic initiatives, including expanding our alternative capabilities and positioning the company for further international growth.","Now we'll open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Kelley from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So guys, I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about the CCAB fund range and what you're seeing going on there. Any substantial kind of one-time dynamics or is it more consumer sentiment shifting both in the third quarter, the calendar third quarter, and what you're seeing so far in the fourth quarter?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Okay, I'll take a crack at that. I think the real difference between the CCAB flows and the U.S. flows, U.S. flows tend to be a bit more stable because of the munis. And you've seen how municipal bonds have gone from outflows last year to probably $5 billion or so in inflows this year and continue to be very strong. Also the Franklin Income Fund, another one that's turned around significantly in the Hybrid category and had very significant inflows. The CCAB range had a much heavier reliance on the Global Bond Fund. I think the primary difference with the Global Bond Fund in the CCAB range is that a lot of that is driven by gatekeepers. And as we've said on prior calls, once the gatekeeper decides to lighten up, then you have an effective redemptions over a longer period. And even over a year, based on the volatility that fund had back in last September, just rebalancing can cause fairly heavy redemptions even in a period when that asset class is doing very well. So I think that's the real difference when you look at flows. Hopefully, most of that rebalancing is done. But our sense is that you had a lot of first-time buyers with global bonds and maybe some of the gatekeepers, based on the volatility that, that fund went through back in last September, they probably allocated less than they had before. And that would have an unusual and lingering effect on redemptions, and I think that's what we've seen. The other one, just Asian Growth Fund, which is a big driver, intends to move fairly quickly one way or another, it had still had net outflows for the quarter. And nothing really to call out there other than I just think it's just that lack of confidence overall and certainly even maybe a bit more negative in Europe than what we're seeing here in the U.S.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then if I can ask another one on the institutional side. Obviously, the global equity institutional inflows that you saw, pretty good results given what we've heard from some of your peers. I'd be curious to get your thoughts on what institutions are asking you for at this point, and how K2 kind of works into your thinking there as well?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I think the institutional flows have been steady, and they've been right around the 2 areas that, again, we've been talking about in the past, the global equity as well as fixed income. And global equity, especially Templeton, has really had a tremendous turnaround in performance. Now we're seeing that flow through to the 1-, 3- and 5-year periods as well. So I think that, that should bode well for future wins. And we had some nice additions to existing, some big sovereign wealth accounts that we've had for a while where we had an addition. And then we had a big win in Canada with for -- with our Bissett group in Canadian equities that had an effect on the current flows. What was the second part of the question? I'm sorry.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sorry. It was on K2, and how it fits into your institutional thinking?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes. I think it's a little early for us to figure out exactly because I think we have to understand where the best opportunities will be. And I think our feeling at this stage, is it's an excellent fund of funds business. We think we can take that and hopefully help distribute that with our relationships around the rest of the globe on the institutional side and possibly introduce it to our high net worth base through fiduciary. And then from there, it's really how we build out whether it's an outsourced CIO model. Build out some more solutions capabilities for institutional clients. I think that, that remains to be seen as we get a better understanding of the skill sets and how the 2 fit.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. If I can just ask one quick follow-up, and then I'll jump back in. On -- just in terms of the outlook for that overall industry hedge fund of funds, what's your kind of view there? Do you think you can bring K2 on and grow it pretty substantially? Or is it just more of an offering that your clients are asking for, and maybe there's some growth, but the industry has challenges? How do you think about that?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think first of all, the attractive part of K2 is that it was an organization that grew in a very difficult contracting market. So obviously, doing something right there. We have seen some fee compression there. We feel like we're comfortable in how we model that out going forward, and feel that it is really another natural area for us. I don't think, relative to our huge asset base, that it's going to have a dramatic impact on us. But obviously, a nice fit into something that a lot of our clients have been asking about. And then I think just on the ability to customize other portfolios with all of our capabilities, it gives us a skill set that we don't really have internally. So I think that's another opportunity there.","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess, Ken, first just in terms of the expenses, it seems like there was some seasonal or kind of year-end push in some of the line items as we think about this past quarter. But maybe if you could just kind of walk us through, kind of thinking about the set up into next year and maybe from a budgeting process, how you're thinking about the P&L and -- or even just the kind of sequential changes that we should think about, quarter-over-quarter?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Okay, Dan. I think absolutely there's some seasonality in this quarter. And when you look forward to next quarter, I would expect to see a little bit of the margin bump back up a little bit because, I mean, that's typically our pattern. In addition, we are in a somewhat of an upward trajectory in assets under management. So that's going to carry over not only into the next quarter but into the next year. In terms of the budgeting long-term, recognizing that the markets have helped us out in the last couple of months, we're still somewhat cautious about letting go of the expense range too much. So it'll be measured. But I do expect in the next quarter to see the expenses come down a little bit and the revenue up a little bit.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess in terms of capital, the slide on Page 21 is helpful. I guess the $6.5 billion post the notes offering, how much of the cash is in the U.S.? And then kind of thinking about how you guys, or the Board is thinking about a potential special dividend at the year end? Any update on that would be helpful.","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Sure. So if you look at our overall cash and investments of maybe around $5.8 billion at the end of the year, roughly about $3.2 billion is outside the U.S. And in addition to that, we have a little over $1 billion that we view as restricted, either because it's part of our banking operations or just through policy. So what you're talking about, the residual there is about $1.5 billion of what you might consider unencumbered U.S. cash. Keeping an eye though, in October -- or, we have refinanced that debt and then we have the K2 acquisition as well. So that's the picture. In terms of the special dividend, that's a decision that the Board will make before the end of the calendar year. But obviously, based on the numbers I just rattled through, I think we have the flexibility to do a special dividend, if they decide to do so.","Operator","The next question comes from Roger Freeman from Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You mentioned, I think in the prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about an equity campaign. It sounds -- that's somewhat similar to maybe what you did a couple of years ago. And I'm just actually curious kind of what stage that's in, and how it does compare or contrast. I think last time it was very focused one on the advisers.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Right. I think this campaign just takes it a step further and something that is somewhat unique, and I think it's being very well received. We partnered with the university and professor that specializes in this area and really trying to look at the investor behavior, and then try to help the adviser have tools to get people over the hurdle of focusing on short-term events and fear. And I just think it's beyond just the generic kind of piece on buying equities with a mountain chart. It really gives them something to think about and talk about that they haven't had before. So we'll just keep trying to get the investor to do the right thing sooner or later, and this is another way to provide more tools to get investors focused on the longer term opportunity.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And the second question's just on the bank, some of the bank restructuring that you're doing, there were some costs on that. What are you doing? And is this Dodd-Frank-related or Basel?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes. So we were looking at our depository entities, and I think we mentioned on previous calls, we were looking to restructure that. But we kind of ran into some roadblocks on that. Still looking for options there to basically lessen the regulatory burden, if you will. But it's really, it's not so much financial. It won't have so much of a financial impact than a business impact on specifically our high net worth operation.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Hopson from Stifel.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","It appears that equity flows in Europe in September were positive and particularly flowing into emerging market equities and global equities. Did you see any of that from your end?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes. I think we, like most, we definitely have seen an improvement September, October, in those flows. But I, in particular, haven't seen what the emerging markets or global equities look like specifically.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then follow-up. On the global fixed income, just to kind of make sure we get what has happened there. So do you feel like you have been taken off some platforms by the gatekeepers or just a lower allocation that's rolling through that eventually will kind of correct itself I guess?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I mean, what I've been told -- and it's really more about a lower allocation, that it's a relatively new asset class for a lot of retail investors. And that kind of volatility, I think, they just felt like they wanted to reduce the exposure in some of the large financial firms' platforms. The growth sales are still our top-selling fund in the CCAB range. So I think that's an important point that obviously still very attractive in a lot of distribution channels. It's just that getting that reallocation in some of the really big banks that, as I said, had that lingering effect on redemptions. But you went from a period where you were bottom decile for a little bit, quickly back to now we're top decile for the 1 year. So, I mean, that's a big change.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Sure. And in the U.S., those funds have done so well. Could there be some potentially negative reaction because they're up so much, and people take gains or step aside? It's hard to say, but any thoughts on how the global fixed category will do in the U.S. from here?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes. I mean, I think all of those are valid points when you have the kind of macroenvironment and the negative press everyday talking about a lot of the risks that are out there, anytime you have a rebound. And that's certainly I think part of the problem with equities right now, as soon as we get back to certain levels in the market, it increases redemptions instead of increasing net flows. And that's something we haven't seen in the past. And I think global bonds, we have seen those snap back, I mean, even quarter-over-quarter in the U.S., it had plus $300 million of net inflows compared to $300 million in outflows last quarter. So we are seeing a snapback because that's more individual sales with advisers versus gatekeepers. So we're still very optimistic and look at, the penetration as still very low relative to the asset base here in the U.S.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe to follow up to -- from a question earlier about K2. Just why did you settle on K2? It seems like they have been underperforming. They have a number of plants that have either fired them or they're on watch in Massachusetts, Chicago, Florida, cautious comments from some pension plans in California. So why was this one the right one for Franklin?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think we've looked at many of them. And I think part of it is that it's the right kind of structure for -- where it wasn't founders selling out. It was a private equity situation with debt. So the key people are still very much engaged and have equity performance shares. So nothing changes from the client perspective on that. I think that's very important. This is a group that's grown in a period where others have contracted. Yes, I mean, there's some short-term performance, but that's not an issue. They're not in any more lists than anyone else with big public plans. I mean the whole industry has been put somewhat on watch as groups go to smaller and more custom. And we looked at that exposure, and it's not a big exposure from concentration of assets with any one given client. So we got comfortable on all of those issues and felt like the people there were the right cultural fit. It's a business we've wanted to be in, and just felt like that to us was the most important part of it.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And is this a growth business anymore? I know that was sort of asked, but it seems like if we look at the big fund of funds, it's like 18 of the 20 biggest ones are in redemption right now. And it seems like the industry has changed. So I know you think you can do some things with the business, but does the nature of the business change? Is what we're seeing just temporary for the industry?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think the business is going through a change where there's some pricing pressure from the traditional model. And I think that, that could continue for a while. But we also feel that certainly, the endowment foundation area, that there's still a huge opportunity for this kind of business. So we're still optimistic about the business. And I think the other important part is, at this stage, you don't -- when a business is contracting and facing those same issues you brought up, that also affects the purchase price and the opportunity and the multiple. And those are all things that get factored into a decision to do something.","Operator","The next question comes from William Katz from Citi.","Neil Stratton","This is actually Neil, filling in for Bill. On the prerecorded call, you mentioned that alternatives and multi-asset are increasing the areas of focus for the firm. And the question is do you have the footprint that you want today? Or should we expect some more acquisitions to get into this area?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think we have a pretty broad footprint today. And if you look at the areas we have, whether it's private equity, real estate, tactical asset allocation, we've added 20-some-odd professionals in that area alone and grew $4 billion to $5 billion in assets in a new category for us in the past year, and introduced a lot of new funds. And then the Pelagos piece as well that it brings managed futures into the equation. We feel like we have a pretty robust platform right now. I think the question of what do we need? I think we need to tie this kind of all together. And K2 will come into that equation in how we work that through. But there's nothing right now that we feel like we need to go out and get. I mean, we have real estate. We have real assets, funds that should do well when inflation comes back. And those are the kind of things that we're trying to do. So the other pieces, whether it's taking existing managers and introducing other types of hedge fund-like products, I mean, we'll continue to do that where it makes sense. But I don't think there's anything on the wish list from an asset class that we feel like we have to go out and get.","Neil Stratton","And my second question is you mentioned penetrating China and some other Asian markets. Should we expect any incremental investment spend from here? And would there be any impacts on margins if that was the case?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, I don't -- I mean, I think we're in those markets. I mean, there's no market that we'd move into in any dramatic way that we're not in that would have an impact on margins. I mean, I think we're just about everywhere we need to be and it's a question, in those markets, do we want to build local asset managers and some capabilities or purchase one? But again there's nothing of any scale or size that I'd put in that category that would move the margin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Kim from Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First, just to follow up on the capital management front. So if we look at the payouts for share repurchases and dividends through the first 9 months of this year, it looks like they're lagging sort of the trajectory looking back to next year -- or I'm sorry, the trajectory looking back to last year. So how should we be thinking about that dynamic as it relates to returning excess capital to shareholders, just as we get into the final quarter?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Okay, Michael. So that -- let's see. I don't know if I would necessarily characterize it as lagging the payout ratios lower. We had a couple special dividends in the prior numbers. So that's probably why you're seeing that lower number. As I mentioned earlier, the Board could decide to do that in the fourth quarter, that's an option. And in terms of the share buybacks, a few things to keep in mind is we continue to be opportunistic. The stock was on a pretty good run at the end of the fiscal year. And in addition, we kind of refrained from trading because we were in discussions with K2 and all that. So that kind of limited our trading ability as well. So those are not trends that you would think would carry forward.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. That's helpfulAnd then, can you maybe touch on Fiduciary Trust. It's been a while since you guys talked about that part of the business. So just maybe an update on trends that you're seeing across that business. And then more broadly, can you just sort of refresh us on the synergies that you see across the high net worth platform versus the retail and the institutional franchises?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Sure. I think we've made a lot of progress just with the group in our investment process and really trying to use Franklin and Templeton's capabilities wherever we can. But also having a more consistent process versus an individual process, which is the old model versus the new model. And we're not entirely one process, but we're much, I think, much more consistent in how we approach that. And that took a while to get there, and I think you'll get efficiencies from that. It's a business, we'd like for it to be a bigger business. So when somebody talked about an M&A wish list, certainly that would be one where if the right opportunity is for us that we can continue to build that platform, that makes perfect sense. It is a complementary business to us in the sense that the more we can drive and more leverage the investment management capabilities, and clients certainly in the U.S., the more that, that makes sense. Today, it's not going to again move our needle very much in terms of the bottom line. But a good solid business that I think has made a lot of progress in -- certainly on the investment side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Nomura Securities.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I guess the question goes on the institutional side. It's a weird year, I think people came in still maybe underweight their equity benchmarks. And then you have lots of reasons to be uncertain about the world. And what do you know? Central banks inflate assets, and equity markets go up a bunch. So just curious what you're seeing as we roll into year end? And what you're expecting in terms of pension allocations? Are they underweight, overweight? Do you think it's possible for them to be actually doing the reverse commute and rebalancing out of equities after what's been a decent year so far?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I think those are good observations. And, certainly I don't have the answer on what they're thinking about now. Other than, when you have the kind of run-up that it's always a time when you do see rebalancing. But where are you going to rebalance to would be the other question to go into fixed income right now with a heavier allocation. So I think we are in an unusual period and I don't think there'll be a big change, one way or another, on where the overall allocation is this year versus last year.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Got you. Okay, appreciate that. And 2 quick modeling questions, Ken. One, with the wind-down on the auto business, is there much of an impact on the other revenue line going forward? And then better news, with performance so good across the board, how should we be thinking about the comp line going into 2013?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Okay. So I do think it would be reasonable to expect that less of the other net revenue line that we've seen in the past, it's difficult to say with 100% precision. But I guess if you look back maybe 2 quarters, that's probably a reasonable run rate. Let me just say that thinking about the activity of the Auto loan business in that quarter. In terms of the comp line, yes, I think it's reasonable to expect a little bit of an increase in that line for a couple of reasons. We do have some open RECs. [ph] We'll be careful in filling them, and also they're in -- most of them, or at least more than half of them, are in the low-cost jurisdictions. We did put into effect, or we did approve some merit increases, and that shouldn't have a very significant impact on the line item. It's effective December 1. So for next quarter, it should have on the -- shouldn't be that noticeable. But, I mean, you're probably talking in the neighborhood on a full-year run rate there about 1% to 2% of the comp line. And so -- and then you have the variable aspect of it because as you said, as performance has been good, that should bump up. So I would expect a little bit of upward pressure on the comp line. Like I said earlier, I do expect to see some help from the other lines to offset that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Sipkin from Susquehanna.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Two questions. One, just to follow up on the prior on the expenses. So just for modeling purposes, thinking about G&A and technology, I guess should we sort of be trending back to prior quarters when we think about sort of just the general trajectory of those lines and sort of accounting for the one-off nature in this quarter?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes, exactly. I think that's exactly spot on. You'll see the lower seasonality spending on the IT line, I would expect.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And then the G&A obviously as well, right?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","In general, I will mention there is -- in terms of pent-up demand, there is a lot of pent-up demand for technology projects. So when that hits, it's hard to say because these things are kind of big projects and take a long time but I think as a general secular trend, we would see a little bit more spending on that line item. But in the next quarter, it should probably drop off a little bit.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Great. And I know the flow trends through -- even the end of October don't bear it out. But any sense of any fatigue on the part of investors for putting more money into bonds? It just seems staggering the amount of money that continues to plow into bonds. So I was just wondering anywhere in the chain, are you picking up any sort of fatigue on the part of investors that may not show up yet but could in a couple of weeks, a month, what have you?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I'm not. I haven't seen any change there.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And what -- I mean, what is it going to take -- and I know you guys have been at this for a while and you run campaigns, I mean, what do you think -- is it -- like if you had to sort of create a scenario that would be perfect to get retail investors back into longer dated equity products, what would that scenario be?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well I mean, you'd want less volatility in the marketplace. You'd probably want some inflation just to create a little bit of uncertainty around fixed income. But you could argue that could hurt us or help. I mean, our asset mix is pretty even between the 2. So I just think the quieter, steadier environment. And to me, when we get past election time when there's so much negativity out there on what's happening. And maybe Europe, things just quiet down, that's my wish list for the next year.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And then just final question, I mean, obviously a lot of success in the balance category. Are you guys worried at all? Maybe, is there -- is capacity an issue at some point there? Or is it not something really to worry about right now?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","The Hybrid category?","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes. I don't -- that fund and its flexibility, there really is no capacity. I think we're at $80 billion in total Hybrid assets there. And it just doesn't appear to be an issue for capacity at this stage.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marc Irizarry from Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Greg, just a quick one. When you look at the global institutional equity business and you think about the fees and active versus passive, how do you think when you're sort of going out with there with the good numbers, I mean, is this a threat of a passive in that channel growing? Or is your sort of alpha and differentiation sort of worth being active in that category?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, again, I think that's a good question and certainly I think on that side of the global equity side, you have a little bit less pressure than you do in U.S. equity and large cap. So we haven't seen any increased pressure there. I think there's always pressure on institutional fees. But I think the more institutions use a passive approach, obviously, the more pressure that puts on fees. But that hasn't dramatically changed on the global equity side. But I think it's a continue -- it's a pressure that will continue to be there.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Now where are you also in the ETF business? Is that sort of when you look at to-do list and the product list for you guys, where are you -- what are you thinking in terms of the opportunity for Franklin on the ETF side?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, we did file one. And I think part of it was just to -- as a reaction to some of the potential changes in the money market world and have short duration alternative. Most of our assets are sweep assets that are funds-used. So if somebody required capital or something like that, we certainly wouldn't want to sweep into that account. So to have a short duration ETF available, and for us to get a little bit along the learning curve in how those are going to operate, that's our thinking right now. The passive side, there's going to be a few big winners. And I think the market's kind of shaking that out right now, and you're at a race to the bottom in terms of fees. And that's just not something we want to spend our time on. And obviously, huge market, profitable one, but more operations and low-cost provider versus active management in what we do. I think the question around active ETFs is still an open one. And my personal feeling is that they limit the portfolio management capabilities of what an open-end fund can do, and the market will start to understand that. But we never say never. And we look at ourselves as investment management. The content whatever the pipeline or vehicle, if the market wants that, we're open to doing that. So I think that's the question for us is how do we look at active ETFs and especially in the fixed income world.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greggory Warren from Morningstar.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to go back to this behavior of focused campaign that you guys have launched. You obviously said there was a step-up from the, what was it, the 2020 campaign you had a few years back. I'm just wondering maybe at that point in time when you launched that one, it was -- we were still freshly off the financial crisis. I don't think that this fear of equities, or at least beyond, in this unhappiness with sort of performance on the actively managed side, had really sort of kicked into the system yet. And you look now, I mean, you guys see the same sort of flow data that I do. You look back over the last 4 or 5 years, actively managed funds have just been bleeding assets. And I'm wondering is this money that you think is going to generate flows at this point? Or is this more like a goodwill action to sort of stay in the good graces with the financial advisers, make sure that they know that you're there and that you've got their back? That you're trying to help them generate the business?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think part -- it's always a little bit of both. I mean, I don't think we think it's going to suddenly turn the wave around of the flows going from 27 months to negative to positive because we've put out this campaign. I think we're just trying to send -- and like we did, we did something similar with fixed income when equities were selling quite a bit. I think part of what we try to do is partner with the advisers and try to give them tools that help them do their business. And I think that they're somewhat frustrated even with investor sentiment. The survey that we did that said most investors thought the market was down the last 3 individual years, which was not true. So I think there is -- it's more than just a lack of confidence. It's somewhat misinformation, too, out there in the marketplace. And we think is the right thing to do. I mean, I just think the amount of money pouring into long-duration fixed-income funds at this stage is really not healthy for our industry with the risk\/reward. And that's the message we're trying to carry.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. That sounds reasonable at this point. The other question I had, it was directly below this in your prepared remarks this morning. I mean, when you talking about this three-pronged approach, can you give some examples as far as where you're looking to enter in new markets, where are you looking to build scale in existing markets? And I guess, along those same lines, deepening the penetration here and sort of more mature markets, where do you see these real opportunities?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I don't know. I think, again, each market is in such a different state. And for us, that's example of a new market that we entered on institutional basis and put people there, it was in Malaysia. And we had some early success in that market on the institutional level. Now we're looking at registering local funds there. We're looking at a tree of funds that we now have in our -- that's a whole market, with Islamic investing, and trying to export that capability across border. I think that's interesting. And then the other markets are the traditional big markets. I mean, for us, Italy still had a very strong year despite some of the focus on global bonds, but we managed to cross sell. And I think the demand for us, it's more -- the people that have been selling a lot of the global bonds are looking for other options for us. And we've been very successful with the tactical allocation in Europe, and we hope to do more of that in that market. But there's really no market I'd call out that all of a sudden, for whatever reason, has a big opportunity. I mean, most of this is dependent on world growth and confidence. And that's just a little shaky right now.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Well I'm happy with what you guys are doing and where you're projecting. And in fact, to your comments recently about the -- no sense in jumping into the ETF market at this point because the game is going down the path that unless you're already invested, heavily invested, it's just going to be harder to get in.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cynthia Meyer from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just maybe a very targeted question on Global Bond. I think on some previous calls, you guys have talked about how the Global Total Return Fund might absorb some of the flows or attract investors who wanted a more corporate bond mix. And it looks like it has grown pretty fast and it is top decile year-to-date. But the flows recently turned negative, too. And I'm just wondering are advisers differentiating among those 2 funds? Or when you see advisers maybe move out of the Global Bond Fund, are they treating that one as a twin and doing the same thing?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Cynthia, I think that's a good question. And I was a little surprised actually that the quarterly number declined from the prior quarter in that fund. I mean, not by a significant amount on a net basis. It continues to be our #2 seller on a gross basis to the Global Bond Fund. I think the 2 are viewed very closely. And if somebody's uncomfortable with the allocation to global bonds, that probably would affect that fund as well just because the currency is the big play there in terms of risk. So I -- we'd certainly, I can ask our -- I don't have a good answer there on why and how the market's looking at that. I think at first, it grew a lot. There was some capacity constraints and probably having too much concentration in one fund. So that was an easy way to diversify. But it could also be that now that they're looking at it, and looking at how closely it follows the other fund, maybe they are putting it the same category. And we could certainly get more information to you on that.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just for my second question, back to alternatives just briefly. Could you maybe talk about what channels you see the most promise in? Because you talked about institutional and fiduciary, but you're obviously really strong in retail distribution. So should we expect to see you introduce a bunch of alternative-slavered CCABs at some point or '40 Act Fund?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think you have to be careful. I mean I think the liquidity of some of these securities or derivatives that are in there, I think, make it traditional '40 Act or in CCAB somewhat challenging. So those are all the things that we'd go slow on trying to figure out the right place. The first step, as I mentioned, was to have sleeves or buckets in our tactical asset allocation funds and having things like managed futures that give us hard asset-type exposure in a '40 Act Fund, it would be the first step in that versus bringing out an entire fund in the one category. So I think that's where the first steps are for us in alternatives. And then determining whether it's a global summit's fund that takes our global bond expertise and introduces that to high net worth clients, institutional clients. That's something that we're doing right now. But again, these are going to be smaller pieces to our business, not really big core ones.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for participating on the call. And we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"10048":["Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN) Q3 2012 Pre Recorded Earnings Call July 30, 2012  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chief Executive Officer, President, and Director","Kenneth Allan Lewis - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting officer and Executive Vice President","Operator","Welcome to Franklin Resources Earnings Commentary for the quarter ended June 30, 2012.","Statements made in this commentary regarding Franklin Resources Inc., which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. This commentary was prerecorded.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Hello, and welcome to the third quarter earnings commentary. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. We're pleased to report another strong quarter of results despite persistent global market headwinds. Most importantly, relative investment performance remains solid across all time periods.","Long-term net new flows were $4.7 billion, reflecting continued penetration of our global investment capabilities into institutional distribution channels. And profitability remains strong, as did capital management for a combination of opportunistic share repurchases, and cash dividends have returned $1.7 billion or 92% of net income to shareholders over the trailing 4 quarters.","Overall, U.S. relative performance rankings remain strong, especially within our fixed income and hybrid funds, taxable and tax-free fixed income. Relative performance percentages were essentially unchanged for March with strong long-term performance in municipal bonds and global fixed income. Franklin equity performance continues to be a standout with strong relative performance across hybrid growth and value strategies.","Mutual Series was essentially unchanged, although we did see modest improvements in long-term performance since March. Eurozone exposure in a corresponding underweight to a more resilient U.S. market contributed to weakness in Templeton equity performance. As and when Eurozone market conditions improve, we expect to see a rebound in the performance of Templeton products.","Assets under management ended the quarter about 2.5% lower at $707 billion, and the simple monthly average AUM increased slightly to almost $711 billion. The change in monthly average AUM, however, does not fully reflect the daily market movements that we experienced. Daily average AUM, which was about $711 billion in Q2, decreased almost 1% to $705 billion this quarter. And as you know, it's the daily average AUM that drives much of our revenue.","The European debt crisis and concerns of a weakening global economy pushed equity markets lower during the quarter, reflected in the 7% decrease in equity AUM. However, as I already mentioned, AUM ended the quarter only about 2.5% lower because of the strength of our fixed income and hybrid products, illustrating a key benefit of diversification.","The decline in equity AUM is also evident in the change in AUM by sales region, where internationally sourced AUM declined almost 5% compared with only a 1% decrease in U.S. AUM. This is due to the mix of international AUM that is more heavily weighted in global equities compared with the U.S., which has the benefit of our strong hybrid and tax-free strategies.","Long-term sales decreased by 14% this quarter as all investment objectives in sales regions experienced slowing sales as investors stepped to the sidelines. The one exception to this was our institutional business that attracted slightly higher sales. Redemptions also decreased 14% resulting in long-term net new flows of $4.7 billion.","The U.S. based and CCAB-based Templeton Global Bond Fund remained our two top-selling funds on a gross basis this quarter. However, both funds experienced slightly negative net flows this quarter. Overall, global fixed income net new flows were $2.4 billion, a strong improvement from last quarter due to the continued interest in our CCAB Global Total Return Fund and several institutional global fixed income and emerging market debt offerings.","Although we continue to promote equity investing in the U.S. and internationally through a number of ongoing campaigns, equity sales decreased 18%. The CCAB Templeton Asian Growth Fund remained our top-selling equity fund on a gross basis, but it did experience modest outflows due mostly to lower sales. Interest in our rising dividend in Franklin Growth Funds remained strong, and we did have several institutional fundings this quarter, primarily into emerging markets equity mandates.","Within hybrid, the Franklin Income Fund remains one of our most popular strategies, but also had lower net new flows. In June, we initiated the launch of the next phase of the U.S.-based 2020 Vision equity campaign with the sub-campaign themed, Time to Take Stock. The pullback of the stock market in 2008 left a lasting impression on many investors causing anxiety about investing in equities and trillions of dollars sitting in low-yielding savings instruments. The new campaign is designed to help advisors and investors take stock of their current situation. It discusses key emotional biases that may be holding investors back and the key points that most investors are missing. It also shows how investors can rebuild their portfolios to reach their long-term goals, including actionable solutions to help them get back in the stock market.","Focused campaigns and themes are an important part of our approach because they align our messaging across all delivery channels and represent a value add to the advisor intended to help them grow their business. During the quarter, we also expanded our product offering in the cross border and private fund markets. Our cross-border CCAB umbrella has been an important part of our international growth.","In South Africa, we received regulatory approval for the launch of 3 local funds designed to meet the needs of the domestic retail market. We also received regulatory approval to complete the launch of our 4 local Malaysian funds. Regulatory approval was granted to launch the Franklin Templeton Shariah Fund. It will be the first Sukuk sub-fund launched as a UCITS in Luxembourg. Since opening our office in Malaysia in 2009, our assets have grown to $2.4 billion.","And now, I'll turn it over to Ken for operating results.","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Thanks, Greg. We're pleased to report another solid quarter of operating results, despite the challenging market backdrop for asset managers.","Operating income for the quarter was $643 million, a 4% increase from the prior quarter due to a combination of lower expenses in the current quarter and the nonrecurring items that impacted last quarter's results. Net income was $455 million, a 10% decrease from last quarter, as net nonoperating expenses were $28 million.","Earnings per share was $2.12, only a 9% decrease due to the continued net decrease in shares outstanding. Investment management fees decreased 1% due to the several elements of the change in assets under management that Greg highlighted.","First, it's important to remember that we earn much of our revenue based on daily average assets under management. And sometimes, the daily average can differ from the monthly average as it often does during more volatile quarters.","For example, the daily average of the MSCI All Country World Index was 1.6% lower than the monthly average this quarter. And second, the slight mix shift in assets under management away from equities and internationally sourced assets under management factored into the quarter's effective fee rate. I'd like to remind everyone that the effective fee rate is only a ratio of revenues to assets under management and does not reflect a change in product level fees. Those factors were partially offset by $10 million of performance fees in the quarter.","Sales and distribution fees were lower by 3%, reflecting both the decline in average assets under management and lower sales in the quarter.  Shareholder servicing fees increased a bit, reflecting the increase in billable accounts and the normal shift between open and closed accounts. During the quarter, 200,000 closed accounts were purged in Canada. In July, about 4.3 million U.S. closed accounts are expected to be purged from the system and will be reflected in next quarter's results.","Other net revenue was $23 million due more to the lack of nonrecurring items that affected the prior quarter than anything else. Operating expenses came in at 4% lower this quarter. Sales distribution and marketing was lower as expected due to lower average assets under management and sales, as well as the nonrecurring items that pushed the second quarter's expense higher.","Compensation and benefits was $314.6 million, a decrease of 3% from last quarter, due mostly to lower payroll taxes and variable compensation. We added to headcount this quarter, and now have 8,563 employees. While many of these staffing increases were located in lower-cost jurisdictions, we should see an increase in this line item next quarter.","Information systems and technology and occupancy expenses were in the range we expected, and I expect these lines to be a bit higher next quarter as we tend to see some seasonality here, particularly with technology projects wrapping up and being expensed in the fourth quarter.","General, administrative and other expenses was $10 million lower this quarter. This line has several moving parts, but the majority of the decrease was related to the consolidation of sponsored investment products, which was a net benefit of $1 million this quarter compared to $6.2 million expense last quarter. You can see this on Slide 18 of the presentation as well.","Other income net of noncontrolling interest was a loss of only $1.2 million. As you can see from the waterfall chart on Slide 17, there are a number of moving parts that contributed to the net loss this quarter.","Equity method investment losses and the mark-to-market losses on trading investments of consolidated sponsored investment products were the primary detractors this quarter, as expected, given the market declines this quarter. Our shares of these losses were largely offset by other items, including about $17 million of foreign exchange gains caused by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. These gains reflect the revaluation of U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents held by non-U.S. subsidiaries with a non-U.S. dollar functional currency.","While the consolidation of our sponsored investment products, variable interest entities and limited partnerships had a $17.1 million impact on earnings this quarter, it should be noted that their impact is immaterial on a year-to-date basis increasing net income by less than $1 million.","Looking at Slide 19. The effective tax rate for the year-to-date period edged up to 29.4% due largely to the losses incurred by consolidated investments. And that caused the quarterly rate to come in at 30.1% as we had to catch up for prior quarters that were accrued at the lower rate.","Slide 20 is a new addition to the deck this quarter and focuses on longer-term profitability. Borrowing a phrase from our Head of Global Distribution, we manage the business with bifocal vision, that is to say while we're focused on the long-term growth of the business, we also have to be mindful of the near-term environment.","Last quarter has a lot of attention on the reported short-term margin where seasonal and nonrecurring items can have a more pronounced impact. We believe that a better metric is our fiscal year-to-date margin. At almost 36%, this margin is lower than fiscal year 2011, not unexpected given the market environment, but still very strong. It's worth noting that fiscal year 2011's margin also benefited from insurance recoveries and higher-than-normal carried interest from the Darby products in the fourth quarter.","Profitability versus nominal assets under management is a characteristics of asset management that seems to be unappreciated relative to the focus on nominal net flows. We don't manage the business with the goal that we need to be bigger just for the sake of being bigger from an assets under management perspective. We focus on serving the needs of our clients with value-added products and generated profitable growth. In our view, strictly looking at nominal assets under management growth ignores the quality of the flows. What should matter is our ability to translate assets under management into earnings, and we believe that we do that better than most peers. Fiscal year-to-date, our return on average assets under management was 27.6 basis points, essentially flat versus 2011.","Moving on to capital management. We've made some enhancements to this presentation as well. The strength of our balance sheet allows us the ability to invest in long-term growth projects and the seeding of new products around the globe. We're also giving comfort to clients that are understandably more focused on the financial strength of the firm. It also allows us to return available U.S. cash to stockholders through stock repurchases and a regular dividend that has increased annually since its inception in 1981.","We steadily decrease shares outstanding as share repurchases have significantly exceeded equity grants, adding compound annual earnings per share accretion of 3% over the past 5 years. The payout ratio for the trailing 12 months increased to 92%, reflecting over $1 billion in stock repurchases, as well as $660 million in regular and special dividends.","And finally, included on this slide is a snapshot of our net cash and investment, which excludes non-Franklin interest in consolidated sponsored\tinvestment products and variable interest entities, as well as the banking business and is net of debt. While this calculation could be derived from our disclosures, hopefully, you'll find its inclusion here helpful in your analysis.","That concludes our comments, and we look forward to the live call at 4:30 Eastern Time."],"10326":["Franklin Resources, Inc.

Although outflows remain a challenge, year-to-date flows improved significantly from last year and we remain optimistic because we continue to make significant investments to enhance our investment management processes, bolster our global distribution capabilities and build out our solutions.","Given recent market dynamics including heightened volatility and a rising interest rate environment as well as cyclical nature of growth versus value, we believe that our investment teams are well positioned for potentially significant outperformance going forward.

At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question here is from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. So I kind of agree that you might see this switchover from growth to value. Curious on why you think we might not have \u2013 haven't gotten there yet. And then maybe more importantly, if you look across your whole franchise, why haven't we seen a bigger move towards being style agnostic across the franchise? Anyway, in other words, why it'd be in a position such that you are more exposed to style preference over time?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I think both good questions, and I think the growth\/value cycle clearly hasn't played out yet. I mean, the same stocks tend to keep bouncing back and you've had \u2013 you have more volatility there. I just think the macro environment is set for that as rates rise, and you're discounting future earnings with the growth stocks and, historically, value tends to outperform.","And the one thing we are really seeing, I think an interest in right now is, you do have \u2013 we talked about it, more gatekeepers looking at funds and positioning portfolios and having more influence than the broad-based advisors. And we are getting a lot of interest in those traditional funds that actually have been underperforming in this environment, significantly in the three to five numbers that have had very good long-term numbers and much better downside protection. So, we are seeing a renewed interest on the shelf space side to position those funds.","But like anything in the retail side, it's going to take some time to see the rotation really happen before you'll see the flows really happen. But we just believe right now that based on where the markets value and based on the backdrop of rising rates that that should take place and I think, as I said, it's being supported by many other gatekeepers.","The question of value versus growth and it is interesting too, because I mean it's something we debate quite a bit and we'd have the same kind of, why would you have a fund that specializes in one versus the other. And looking at our performance and our growth area which is excellent, but it's just not as big as \u2013 to the franchise is the rest, so it gets a little bit less. But you look at the Franklin DynaTech, Franklin Growth Fund, Franklin Technology and the CCAP (00:05:29), all with just outstanding performance and record flows right now, but that doesn't offset the other side when you have the deep-value players like Templeton and Mutual Series.","I think we thought of more core type offerings is something that we think about, but we also think there's solutions group and having more of a tactical allocation between the value and growth is a very simple alternative to just creating a bunch of new funds, where we can offer the allocation between value growth and really have core offerings with our solutions group, so that would be probably where we would address that.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","Definitely appreciate that. I'm glad you brought up the gatekeepers getting more involved because I agree. How do they look at \u2013 how do they balance the 1 year, 3 year, 5 year with the 10 year? Like your performance is borderline amazing long term and the last handful of years is tougher. How do they balance that? You said they're looking at some of the better funds right now. I'm just curious on how that changes.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","I mean, I think you will find it's all over. I mean, I've had consultants come in and clearly they would say the 10 year is the most important number. But they also recognize that the patience level and it's a little bit different of a time horizon on the retail side.","So we think the 10 year is still very important and it's still measured. But I would say, the 5 year is probably weighted higher on the retail side. But many look at really \u2013 really try to evaluate the cycles and how you do over time.","I mean, it was interesting for us, somebody was pointing out and it was a slide that they used in a retail presentation on the Barron's ranking overall for family and up until ninth (00:07:27), right before the last big reversal in growth value, we were last on the list for three years and then we were first on the list for the next five or six years. And now we're back to near the bottom of that because of the cycle.","And they were just pointing to how important the macro moves affect an overall franchise when your assets are concentrated in one area. So that \u2013 I think his point in that slide was that, who do you want to partner with for the next 10 years? Don't look back on the 5 years.","But to your point, I mean it's really \u2013 the 1 year is not very important, the 3 year and 5 year are, and the 10 year is right there as well.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Morning.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","First just starting on capital management, and actually I'll just ask two questions here. What is the level of excess capital that can be withdrawn after you make the $700 million debt repayment and the April 12 special dividend?","And then secondly, could we see another special dividend over the next year? Or should we assume the $3 was it?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Right. So I think we were estimating, and it's in the filing too, that our kind of operational capital needs are about $3.5 billion, and then you could do the math where you could see all our liabilities.","Remember that the dividend was paid in April, so that \u2013 you'd have to take that out of the cash number. All the debt, the tax repayment and all that, you'd have to factor all those in.","And then regarding the special dividend, I wouldn't assume anything. I think that capital management is a long-term process. Being shareholder-friendly is a priority, we'll continue to \u2013 I think we have demonstrated and we'll continue to demonstrate that it's a priority.","And so, over time, the board of directors will assess where we're at in terms of cash requirements and needs, and whether they should do another special dividend.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And, Ken, can you...","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I would just add that, M&A activity obviously falls into why you have to be flexible in answering that question on what your intention is. And there's always a possibility of another one, but there's also another strong possibility of M&A activity.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Ken, how large is that tax repayment?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","It's $1 billion.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Correct.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Got it.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","$1.1 billion.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you very much, guys.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Invesco announced like an hour or so ago, a pretty big insurance mandate loss. How big is \u2013 I guess maybe first, how is your insurance business doing? That had been an issue for you in years past. What is the latest in terms of AUM here? And what are the recent trends in terms of sales and redemptions? Thanks.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Their insurance business right now is $2.5 billion in the variable annuity. Is \u2013 sorry.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","No, it's more like $30 billion I think.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","No, I don't mean that. I meant like \u2013 I'm sorry, I meant the variable.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","I would say, it's probably somewhere $30 billion to $40 billion. The redemption activity has slowed down. Still some of that at risk and we're really \u2013 we've been working with the insurance companies to come up with alternatives through our solutions group for more lower volatility type equity exposure in the markets and retain some assets through that.","But right now not in a growth position, although we are seeing I think the viability of variable annuities going forward in the market and some of the repricing of annuities, and continue to have very strong relationships with the insurance companies and hopefully get that back into net inflow. But for now, I would still say, it's more of a potential net outflow looking at a year or two ahead.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then on Ken, shareholder service fee expect to be flat compared with last year. I guess, is there a new level of seasonality in the March quarter. To get your guidance of flat, kind of need that to really pull back in the last half of the year, and I couldn't quite get there based on the description of how they're now calculated. So, anything there?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah, that's correct. Yeah, last November we changed the model on how those fees are calculated. It's combination of fixed and variable, and the variable is related to transactions. And because of \u2013 in this particular quarter, we have all the tax transactions that have increased the seasonality of that line. So that should fade out and that's why we're saying overall year-over-year should be flat.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. But next March and the March after and the March quarter after that, we should see the pickup in the first quarter typically.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So in terms of seasonality, the March quarter is going forward will be elevated and the rest of the year will be sort of depressed. Is that how we should think about it...","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Correct.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","...in years forward?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Correct.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. That was it.","Operator","Year next question is from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow up. You guys put in some good clarity on updating your expense guide, and saw how Edinburgh is going to provide an uplift to some of those line items. Could you help us think about how we should be modeling the revenue pickup from the Edinburgh AUM coming on, what kind of fee rate, et cetera?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","I think that, overall we talked about the Edinburgh acquisition as being not material to earnings and that's still true. I think what I've been doing with the expense guidance is, previously we've talked about some of the initiatives that we've invested in and that's why I've given the \u2013 I think the 5% guidance. And what I'm trying to do now is just to factor in all of the expenses. I wouldn't say Edinburgh Partners is a big part of it, but we had the severance in Korea this quarter and all that. So when you factor all of that in, that's why I'm giving the 6.5%, 7%, 7.5% guidance.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So, effectively Edinburgh being just one contributor there and not really a driver, and therefore the offset from revenue isn't going to be material either. Is that what you say?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Correct. That's correct.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for clarifying.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. In the prepared comments, you talked about the pickup in retail redemptions outside the U.S. I guess, is there anything specific that happened like platform related or how should we think about the trends there may be going forward?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","No, I don't think there was anything trend wise. I mean, I was looking underneath trying to answer that question as well. I think you did see a pickup in some redemptions in Global Total Return, but you had clearly steady flows into the Emerging Markets Bond. And some of that pickup, just quarter-over-quarter, could have been a platform moving or a major reallocation in a platform because you do get that more in Europe than you do here certainly in the States.","But no real underlying trends to report there. I think the performance is lagging a little in the short run, but picking up here in the last \u2013 this month, as rates are climbing up. And we also think still the defensive nature, this is a fund that kind of shines. And down markets, as it's not correlated with anything else, so hopefully we can get some absolute return in a tougher market environment and get flows back. But it just seems like right now the Emerging Market Bond Fund continues to get momentum versus the other two.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then just to follow up on another comment from the release. You talked about an outreach program for at-risk assets. I guess, can you put some color around that, maybe how you size those at-risk assets and, I guess, how that outreach is going?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, I think that there is no \u2013 I think, again, the institutional is just looking at areas where you have had deep value and long-term relationships, and making sure that we are being proactive in meeting with those. And I don't think there's any one category, I think like at-risk, we \u2013 certainly on the VA side and that's where Ken's number came at-risk. We'd say $2.5 billion was the number that he came up with off the top of his head and that was the at-risk assets for this year that we just know based on the relationship that they may be shifting that to something else.","And I think it's just recognizing everything's at risk every day, but certainly the deep value assets that have underperformed, we've got to get out there and make sure people understand how that performance should turnaround based on the macro environment. That's really the effort that we're doing with the institutional side.","I think you have to recognize that a lot of \u2013 when you have big assets and styles out of favor a lot of your efforts are defensive versus going out and trying to get new business. You have to make sure you maintain the relationships with the existing business, because you're under pressure as well.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Hey, good morning, guys. Thank you. As a follow-up to Craig's question, it sounds like you're still optimistic on the M&A opportunity. Have you noticed any changes, I guess, in the willingness of sellers to sell through the recent volatility? And within that, should we think of the repurchase authorization as separate from the pool you're keeping to do M&A, or is it kind of a placeholder for capital return until something gets done?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","It's the latter. It's a placeholder. It's not a separate part, no. (00:18:13)","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Right.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","And I wouldn't say the volatilities changed the opportunities here; certainly not in the traditional space. But we are seeing more, I think, opportunities in the alternative side.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay, great. And as a follow-up, the management fee rate I think was probably a lot higher than people were expecting and you mentioned periodic revenue sources as one driver. Is that really just the performance fee, or is there something else there? And how much of that was really just driven by the average equity component?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. So performance fees, it was \u2013 it was our Romanian operation fund dual that was part of it and then regular performance fees. I mean, I think that the daily average assets under management kind of clouded the calculation a little bit. But the takeaway is that we're not really seeing a big dramatic shift in the effective fee rate at this time.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Carrier from Franklin (sic) [Bank of America Merrill Lynch] (00:19:23). Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks guys. Just one on capital management. Just given the pace that you have in buybacks and in the authorization that was announced, just trying to get a sense of what we should be expecting as maybe like a run rate basis versus where you can be opportunistic. And then still wanting to have a strong balance sheet in kind of firepower for M&A. So any color on what might be a good run rate, given the elevated level we saw this quarter.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Right, and it's a tough one to say. A lot's depending on so many different factors. So I don't think I feel comfortable actually saying that this is a run rate. I just say that it's a priority, it's a high \u2013 it's a continued priority to return capital to shareholders.","This quarter there was a lot of reasons for the elevated repurchases. We might have better \u2013 we'd have \u2013 might have \u2013 next quarter might present more opportunities or less opportunities. So it's tough to say.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Got it. And then, Greg, I think you mentioned in some of the commentary, some of the things you guys have been doing given the industry changes. So whether it's investments in the business, some of the M&A stuff.","And so I just kind of want to get a sense, like when you look at what you're doing, say in 2017, 2018, heading into 2019, what are some of the \u2013 kind of the big maybe investments that you think can kind of start to shift some of the flow trends? Obviously, there is the performance aspect. But maybe take that away and whether it's on like the product side, the distribution side. Where we might be able to start to see some traction as we head into 2019?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think the investments that we have made and continue to make, recognizing the changing distribution landscape, and we certainly have added to the number of people calling on the home offices and gatekeepers.","And we have seen I think results from that already, where we target the number of funds on platforms, and we've exceeded the targets for the year on making sure that funds are either maintained on the new lists for advisor platform. So I think that's been a very important area of investment.","The ETFs is another very important area for us that we continue to build out. We added seven new funds in the last quarter. And have to have a separate distribution approach to that, so that's an incremental investment for the firm.","The solutions team, we've added very senior people there over the last year and think that that's just going to be increasingly important. And now, in a position to really offer a better suite of multi-assets and target-date funds and customized solutions. And in the last quarter, we got a $300 million mandate in the multi-asset category, which is something we would not have been competitive in last year.","I think the other areas around just data would be a longer term, but we have made \u2013 we bought Random Forest and really that's more of a fixed income effort now in the non-bank lending section. But just having the data scientists here and then building it out with each of our investment teams with the hub and spoke in India is going to be important in how we consider \u2013 or how we look at and build our capabilities in looking at data. So those would be a few of the areas.","And then private equity would be another that we have \u2013 as we think about technology changes and disruption and fintech and we've approached it kind of the piecemeal and one-off. Well, now we have a much more organized way of looking at it, where we have a specific strategic pool of money, we have the dedicated teams that are actually raising private equity funds now, and we have partnership with a firm looking at data and AI investments, where we've already made a significant amount of those.","And all of those help us, as we think about tools for our investment teams and better information and better data.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Just a couple of questions around just investment and spending trends. I guess \u2013 can you, I guess, help us bridge the \u2013 and I know there's a couple questions in that, but what I'm trying to get to is, relative to the 5% in expense grow that you outlined last time, going up to the current range, how much of the initiatives kind of \u2013 so the Edinburgh acquisition, Random and the JV with Korea, how much did that add? And should we assume the rest is basically incremental growth spend? That's part one.","And I guess part two is, as you look out at the next couple years, I guess where are we in the investment cycle? You guys are clearly implementing a bunch of new things. But just thinking beyond this year, what should be the expense growth for the foreseeable future?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, I think the \u2013 yeah, on the expense growth, the main part is like I said earlier, it's just kind of \u2013 given all of the activities that we've done \u2013 but I'm trying to just give you an estimate of where expenses will be in this fiscal year. Part of it is the seasonality also of the comp line. So, that's why I gave the specific guidance on the compensation, but that's just kind of in the short term.","I think going forward, next year \u2013 and I made the comment in the remarks that it's a year for us to assess the investments and call those that aren't working and look for ways that we can kind of temper that expense growth to something more in the inflation range. So that's going to be looking forward for next year, and there'll be more to come on that the next time we get together.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe just on that thing on the \u2013 just the last comment you... [Technical Difficulty] (00:25:55)","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Can you repeat the question?","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Can you hear me?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yes. Now, it's working. Yeah.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Just Ken, relative to the comment you made in the prepared remarks about assessing the investments. Just your view again of outsourcing the custody fund accounting and back in middle office. Obviously, custodian banks are talking about an increased trend of outsourcing from asset managers.","I know you guys have always wanted to keep that in-house, because you can scale that. But is that something that is part of that assessment, or would you rather just keep that? And I guess also, how do you think about the market environment to the extent that if we do go into a bear market, obviously better to have a variable cost structure with that.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Sure. And I think we have a nice \u2013 I do think we have a nice mix of fixed and variable comp. And I think also, as we mentioned before that our presence in these low-cost jurisdictions really does make a compelling argument for not outsourcing. But having said that, it's not something we do on an annual basis that assessment, but it's certainly something we do cyclically.","And so, maybe three years ago we did that analysis and decided, oh, that we should make some investments for the internal systems. But going forward, we're going to continue to look at those things as well.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And then question for you, Greg, on the U.S. retail redemptions this quarter \u2013 this first quarter or the March quarter. If you could maybe \u2013 maybe hard to do, but if you could parse that out between what you think is more due to the market conditions with the corrections we've had versus the platform, product line of changes at the warehouses and the other broker dealers. Just maybe your view of where we are on that platform consolidation for the industry broadly. I know we've done a lot of it, since \u2013 obviously since DOL. But is that \u2013 are we most of the way through that or do you see a lot more to happen?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, good question. I don't think there is any real quarter \u2013 or shifts in retail flows. I mean, I think you have the drag of the significant value assets and our larger funds, and then you had volatility in the first quarter for the first time where you had a big risk-off kind of moment there, and then a fairly \u2013 a decline in the market at the end of the quarter. So you did see a spike up in retail redemptions.","I didn't see anything by asset class or product line really to call out other than you just \u2013 again, first time we've had some real volatility in the market. And I think we did a little better redemption rate wise through that period; and certainly, performance wise for that short period of volatility like we would expect with some of the value funds. And the other part of the question was...","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Was on the warehousing and... (00:29:16)","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Oh, right. Right, right, right. I think that's a good question and I was actually talking to some of our sales heads about that. And I think it's interesting this \u2013 the new, call it, the higher standard of conduct or new best interest standard that is under common period with increasing the suitability requirements and disclosure. I think what's important in the proposal is that, certainly brokerage, as it exists today, can survive and doesn't have to be modified to a level where you can't have differentiated commissions. So I think that's important.","I think the other, obviously not being enforced by plaintiff attorneys is a good thing for that proposed legislation. And so, I think it would slow down the acceleration of movement from brokerage to advisory accounts. The urgency to do that would not be there, and I think that's a good thing certainly for our mix of assets that has high exposure on the brokerage side.","So, I think the \u2013 we're not done, I don't know what inning we're in in this shift. It seems like \u2013 I was looking at one of our major distributors and partners and they probably had a ratio of 65\/35 still a brokerage to fee base. But the other side of that is the new assets coming in are probably 70\/30 fees. So I think regardless, you have to get your model positioned more for the fee side. But I think the deal well being vacated and some of the difficulties in complying with that rule, certainly will slow down that trend and brokerage can run off in a more reasonable way instead of having to convert.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right, and that gives us great color. And indeed, from the actual number of products on the platforms, do you see that continuing to come down significantly or do you think we've gone through sort of a house cleaning... [Technical Difficulty] (00:31:23)","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I think we've gone through it, but I think the \u2013 clearly, there is less on there and that means that you have to rationalize your product lineup which is something that we've spent a lot of time in the last year, really looking at deciding what is going to be viable to continue to promote in the future. And that's really where the initial investments we've made and more relationship specialists and consultants have been important to make sure that those funds get that shelf space.","But I think the \u2013 you have a narrowed funnel and the question is, how quickly the brokerage assets move to that narrow funnel and you'll have \u2013 that's where you're really getting some of the accelerated or higher redemption rates for your traditional base.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. okay.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","So it's a narrower funnel, it hopefully will not get much more narrowed. I don't think there's any reason for that. But really it's the speed of the movement, that's a question.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And that's still coming, is what you're saying...","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","...in terms of the actual flow, yeah. Yeah, okay.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yes.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Lee from KBW. Please go ahead.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Good morning.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","I guess a question on kind of, I guess, retail distribution. I mean, some of your competitors have talked about other success they're seeing in retail distribution because of their SMA presence. Others have talked about how they've invested in building out that capability, because it kind of recognizes a need if they want to be in that distribution channel. And I mean, I don't have a sense that that's been a product lineup where you've traditionally had as much focus.","So could you \u2013 do you think that's \u2013 maybe as you get the centralization on a lot of platforms of decision making and a lot more advisors shift to kind of SMA-type wrap products that \u2013 I mean, is that \u2013 do you feel that your position is you should be there? Is that one of the places you're focused on making \u2013 rolling out new products and making new investments? Just trying to get a feel for that.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","I would say, yes. I mean, I think as we've said before, we do view ourselves as the content in (00:33:45) active investment management and the vehicle we're not agnostic to, whether it's commingled trusts, SMAs, ETFs. We're going to do all of that.","And I think, now with technology improvements and efficiencies, we can do SMAs much more easily than we could say 5 or 10 years ago. So that is an area that I think we will continue to expand and offer more products. And certainly, the commingled trusts and flexibility with that is something we've been doing here in the last year.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Great, and then maybe one last question, not to beat the capital management horse too much. And understanding you had the $3 special and the increased dividend 15%, I guess it was back a couple quarters ago. As I think of your kind of, let's call it, regular dividend payout ratio, it's still kind of hovering around or just around 30%. And if I think of your \u2013 many of your peers are kind of in that 40% to 50% range. And you now have access to worldwide cash.","So I mean, can you maybe talk about just kind of your regular dividend? Is the goal just to kind of start low and just keep your track record of increases? Or is there a possibility that you kind of raise that normal payout ratio up towards kind of more of a peer average?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, when we talked about this at the February meeting, we talked about all the aspects of the dividend, the payout ratio, the yield and all that and the special dividend, shareholder preferences. We went out and talked to our major shareholders.","And I think the answer to your question is, time will tell. The regular dividend will probably be a topic at future board meetings. And so I wouldn't rule out a larger increase, but I wouldn't count on it either. It's definitely a board decision.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, that was it. Thanks for taking my questions.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Katz from Citi. Please go ahead.","William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for taking the question. Lots have been asked already. Just in terms of coming back from a bigger picture perspective, Greg, seems like your verbiage is that you're still open to transactions, but you're \u2013 as a firm have been more tactical in approach, either in terms of what you've acquired or what you're building out. Where are you from a bigger picture perspective of a bolder move that might be needed to jump start growth?","I hear you on the long-term performance, but you have great performance, but you're not leveraging that in any way across the platform, whether it'd be equity or fixed income. And I hear what you're working on a little bit.","Is there something larger to do that could either accelerate earnings growth or accelerate the flows, rather than just sort of trying to see if some of these more skunk-work things actually get hold? And how do you think about the risks of something like that today?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I think the risks are great to think about a large-scale merger and what you're left with. So I think that's again, as we've said, less probable.","But you look at something like a K2 now that is generating $0.5 billion a quarter in net inflows. That's fairly significant to us in balancing some of the rest of it.","So I think that those kind of incremental adds are still going to be very important to us. And the priority is to find more non-correlated alternatives that we can offer, specifically through retail and institutional.","But we're open, as we always say, to look at everything that we think can jump start or be incremental. But I think the thought of combining two large firms that have multiple styles underneath them, gets a little bit daunting and risky for the shareholders and trying to understand who they are and what they do.","So we, as always, have \u2013 are looking at many different situations and are finding firms in that medium size. We have done a series of smaller ones and sometimes they take as much work as the bigger ones. And so, we want something that's going to move the needle and we are seeing things more in that mid-size versus tiny or extremely large; and that's really what we'd like to do.","William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then just one quick one for Ken. Is there anything in your numbers here in terms of revenue recognition restatement some of your peers have had to sort of adjust certain fee waivers and\/or distribution payments that may have affected the optics of reported numbers this quarter or comparably from prior quarters?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","No. No. That's effective for us next year.","William Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Thanks for the follow-up. It looks like global bond is top decile again year-to-date. The last time we saw improvement like that \u2013 I think post-election we saw a pretty quick kind of uptick in sales there. Curious if you're seeing that again, and if there's any reason to think that this period would be different than that period in terms of the improvement?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","I don't think it was \u2013 that's fairly short term and that was news to me, so I doubt the market knows it yet. I know we certainly had a big move in relative numbers in the last few weeks which I've seen. But I think it will take a little time. But again, I think the more volatility you have in the market and then people start looking for alternatives. And this is a fund that really \u2013 it was pretty obscure and small and so it had a 10-year record. During the last decade of equities, it was up 10% a year. So you really do have an alternative that can add some balance to a tougher market environment, and that's what people are looking for. And it's been competing with a ripping market for the last decade in places like Europe where it was an alternative to the euro. Euro stabilized, has been strong.","So it's had a lot of headwinds just from local debt in its local markets, and that tends to be when it really does well in Europe. But in the U.S., clearly, we think it's an alternative category that if the markets get choppy and if rates go up, there is not going to be many places to hide and I think you can do very well in that environment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just I want to clarify, one thing you said, Ken, I think about the \u2013 prior question about the revenue contribution from the recent deals. I think you said the expense obviously is going up from those deals. And then part of that was severance I think. And then, I guess, you said it was \u2013 if I heard it correctly, it's not material. So, is that a match of revenues and expenses or do we see a profitability profile for that next year after you get through the severance?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I don't think it's material on revenue or expenses. I think that \u2013 I was just trying to \u2013 try to clarify maybe added more confusion, but I was just trying to clarify the effect of what's been done this year and how it will play out in future quarters.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, okay. So just not that big, okay. And then just on the cash, the $10.4 billion, if we look at that pro forma for the dividend payment, the tax payment and your bond pay down, we would be a little bit north of $7 billion, not including any other factors. Is that sort to make sure you I have that right?","Kenneth A.

My name is Lorraine, and I will be your conference operator today.","Statements made in this conference call regarding Franklin Resources Inc., which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.","These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, in the risk factors and MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. [Operator Instructions]. The company asks that you limit questions to one initial and one follow-up question. [Operator Instructions] ","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin.","Greg Johnson","Hello and thank you for joining Ken Lewis, our CFO and myself for this quarter's conference call. Financial results and relative investment performance remained solid. The institutional business had one of its best flow quarters and fiduciaries secured one of its largest new wealth management relationships in firm's history.","Although net flows were weaker, retail clients showed an increased interest in key products within our U.S. equity tax-free fixed income and global bond franchises.","Now, at this time, I would like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Carrier from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","First question just on the flows in the quarter and then in the outlook. I think on he recorded call, you just mentioned that your institutional is really strong. Then in December you had a spike for a couple of reasons on the retail side. I do not know if you could give any color on how significant that spike was in December, just to kind of get a better run rate axe some of the volatility that we saw around whether it is global bond fund or just the market new environment.","Greg Johnson","Right, I think, we felt like it is certainly worth discussing. We did not try to go back and quantify because of the difficulty with omnibus, but what happened with the Templeton Global Bond funds is we had a $0.60 special dividend rate at year end and there is not a warning for that kind of a currency dividend and it kind of got the market a little bit off guard and we saw a real spike in redemptions.","Also, it's hard to quantify, because many of the omnibus accounts track that as a redemption and then reinvest it. We think it is somewhere in the $1 billion range potential overstatement of redemptions, but we didn't want to adjust any numbers. We just kind of went the number that we had, but we know that that December number is higher and as we have said January is a more normalized redemption rate.","Michael Carrier","Okay. That's helpful. Then, Ken, maybe a couple of things to clarify on some of the expense guidance that you gave, so first just on the comp, I think you mentioned 2% higher in the next quarter. Just wanted to find out if that excludes or includes the $8 million Darby comp related number.","Then just two other items that seemed a little bit lower were the shareholder service revenue and the other revenues. I think, other revenues you said this could be at the higher end, so just wanted to get some color on what's driving that.","Ken Lewis","Sure. The 2% is our estimate of the absolute reported number, which includes the Darby.","Other revenue, we are forecasting that to be lower, because basically because of the bank no longer have that banking business, but the other items that is unpredictable that goes through that line relates to consolidated SIPs. Excluding that, we do think the run rate for other revenue is going to be lower going forward.","On shareholder servicing, we think that this is probably about a good run rate for shareholder servicing going forward.","Michael Carrier","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Ken Lewis","The shareholder accounts have been stable and increasing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Luke Montgomery from Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","Luke Montgomery","Good morning. Thank you. Just first on the special dividend, obviously, that is appreciated by some investors, but it was about half, what you did a couple of years ago.","I know the tax and legislative environments were different then, but if you could give us a little insight as to the discussion with the board on the size of the special and really how that intersects with where you are and your cash flexibility and the U.S. cash balance.","Ken Lewis","Sure. Very robust discussion, at the Board Meeting in December, dividend is very much a Board decision. One of the factors that they looked at they felt like it was appropriate to target returning 50% of current year's earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","They looked back at 2014, they saw that we that goal, so that was a key influencer on doing a special and the size of the special dividend.","Essentially, as I mentioned in the pre-recorded remarks, I am targeting 100% of the U.S. cash flow seem like a reasonable objective at that time and that was factored into their decision.","Luke Montgomery","Okay. Helpful. Thanks. Then I was hoping that you could update us on your latest thoughts around liquidating in the emerging-market portfolios.","I think that Templeton Global Bond fund keeps about 15% of total AUM in cash, and I realize also that management liquidity is a quarter of what your PMs do, but does Michael continue to believe that cash level is sufficient?","If you could comment on the potential for selling, because there have been some new less than favorable articles in the press that cite the large percentage of certain countries' sovereign debt that you guys are on and how you will be positioned if those drop in value and the fund expenses more redemptions or redemptions.","Greg Johnson","I think, obviously, that is something that all of our portfolio managers monitoring and take very seriously looking at liquidity and cash and I think we just felt like some of the coverage, looking at fixed income fund like an equity fund and trying to look at the turnover and extrapolate that for liquidity doesn't really give you the whole picture, so I think the combination of the high cash positions along with the very low duration and maturities of securities that happened within a very short period in the fund, those two factors alone and then sometimes the flexibility of working directly with Central banks and selling positions creates liquidity that is not always measured, so there's many sources of liquidity that I feel like that area is probably one of the best as far as the liquidity, but it continues I think because of the nature of some of the holdings and a 2.2% position in Ukraine gets a lot of focus with the headlines right now.","I think they feel comfortable, the team, and I think we feel pretty comfortable with liquidity there.","Luke Montgomery","Great. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.","Ken Lewis"," Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Kim from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Michael Kim","Hi, guys. Good morning. First, as you highlighted earlier, just looking at sort of the relative returns across some of your bigger flagship funds. The three year numbers generally remained strong, but some of the funds have been underperforming a bit over shorter timeframe, so just wondering how you are thinking about where you see the biggest organic growth opportunities, particularly assuming the markets remained choppy and risk appetite remained sort of lackluster.","Greg Johnson","I think there are pockets of the strong even on a shorter term basis and some of the Franklin funds, Franklin growth fund, another fund that we started a few years back, our focused equity fund was doing very well, so that is kind of gaining traction.","I think, looking at the short-term relative underperformance. There is no question that the strong U.S. dollar has taken its toll certainly on Templeton that has a longer term approach and doesn't hedge against the dollar, so this kind of unprecedented move does create headwinds for certainly that area.","The other big one that moved just slightly into the bottom, the third quartile would be the Franklin income fund. Again, very consistent with how those funds run with high yield bonds some of the volatility during the quarter in that area. Then also, high yield bonds tend to have a larger percentage in energy and oil that had an impact as well, so that is just slight in the third and does have a big short-term effect on our numbers and it is nothing unusual there.","I think, some of the good stories in areas of continued growth, the Franklin, the India fund, which is in our SICAV, had a very strong quarter in-flows and that is up I think about 45% for the year, so that continues to do well.","Then the institutional opportunities, I think we fell like the pipeline is as strong as ever in categories still, global equities, emerging markets debt and we continue to see opportunity for growth there.","Tax-free has come back to slightly positive flows for the quarter and it has take while to get there, but again we think that that is well positioned and has good relative performance to hopefully get some organic growth.","Michael Kim","Got it. That is helpful. Then maybe just a follow-up for Ken. Beyond some of the more specific line item guidance that you referenced, any just sort of broader thoughts on expense growth looking out to the New Year, particularly given sort of the step-up in market volatility and at some point do you maybe start to pull back on some discretionary spending and just curious where you might have some of that flexibility.","Ken Lewis","I think, history can show you that, we have a fair amount of flexibility and controlling the expenses and certainly with revenue levels where they are, it is something that is top of mind so we are talking about that I think you will see the expense levels that or you see the expense growth start to level out going out a few quarters as we tapped the brakes on expenses, but that does take a little bit of time to work through the system too, but certainly we are thinking about going back on the expenses.","Michael Kim","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Worthington","Hi. Good morning. Greg, just one kind of big picture question, so as you look out over the next three years what drives Franklin to the next level of growth?","I would say Templeton brought in that big level kind of pre-tech bubble, and I think it was income series post-tech and global bond franchise post credit crisis.","You have got different initiatives, different regions, different products that also seem like maybe they have potential, so kind of let us know what you are most excited about and what at least has the opportunity to be the focus for Franklin over the next couple of years.","Greg Johnson","I think it is hard just to look at one area and say that is going to drive organic growth like global bonds or like Templeton had. I think they are all hopefully, we would like to see is a very diversified organic growth with all those areas and I still think the strength around the hybrid area, the balanced area still continues to be good grower and good potential for organic growth. The tax-free has had a tough run, but there is no reason why in a stable rate environment, we can't get growth back there.","If you look at the global bond, I would still argue that the performance continues to be very consistent. It is an alternative category. While it is the 800 pound gorilla in its category, it still has very low penetration for the average retail owner.","I think in a sideways, with auto market, that stands out as a very good alternative. You look at one area for us just this year, which shows I think the strength of our distribution and product line and where opportunities we didn't talk about a year ago, but with the yen devaluation in Japan, we have seen our global bond funds really take off in that market and that is at the very early stages. We are just this quarter we had over $1.3 billion in flows into global bond and that's a new channel for us.","I think it is hard just to call out any one area. The K2 fund continues to grow. We think that is a nice one and the alternatives we just kicked it up in the cross-border area and we are getting a lot of interest there.","As we talked about the institutional initiative, I mean, if organic gets somewhat lost in the numbers, but $4 billion in-flows coming outside of the U.S. into institutional net is again a very significant growth number that we think is getting better and better, so that would be a few.","Ken Worthington","Okay. Greta. Thanks very much.","Ken Lewis","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Bill Katz","Okay. Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate thinking the question just sort of following up on growth may be a little more tactical in nature. as I run my eye across some of your gross sales dynamics, yes, there is a little improvement, sequentially, but when you look on a longer-term basis now last couple years you seem to be sort of a relatively down to flattish type of backdrop.","What specifically, what might you be targeting in terms of growth initiatives to try and capitalize the net flow dynamics sort of adjusting for the spike in redemptions towards the end of the year. Just trying to see what gets the nets going at this point.","Greg Johnson","We do target organic growth rates, but I mean at the end of the day, you look at where the opportunities are with the specific products in different markets and position, and $50 billion in gross sales a quarter is a pretty strong accomplishment for a distribution, but when redemptions, the pressures of volatility and movement, even in this last quarter there were a lot of our European growth funds, which tends to attract a little bit faster money and added $1.2 billion in net redemptions, which put a lot of pressure on the equity flows.","Then you look our Asia growth fund and another one that reversed from a positive quarter to a negative, which was about $1 billion difference quarter-over-quarter, so you hope you can reduce those and get back to steady, but I think its volatility in specific pockets and a lot of headwinds, certainly with currencies in emerging markets, those create pressure and make it just harder to get that organic growth.","I think it is difficult to sit here and say, well, this is where it is going to happen or not. I think, again, the focus is going to be on delivering performance, consistent returns. Then hopefully the rest takes care of itself. I know that is [ph] exactly answering the question.","As I said before, a more diversified mix and strong performance is really what we can control and hopefully that organic growth takes care of itself.","Bill Katz","Okay. That is helpful. I just want to follow-up. Second question is, just as you mentioned the global bond fund is low in sort of early stages of retail opportunity, when you step back and you think about sort of franchise risk. I do not mean to use that term to lightly, one of the lessons I think we have learned with concentration, it cuts both ways. When it looks good, it looks good. When it hurts, it goes bad pretty quickly.","How are you thinking about that just given the size of the aggregate portfolio? You used a word 800-pound gorilla in your response to prior question. How you think about that sort of letting that business continue to grow versus thinking about what might be some franchise risk if there was a problem with building that going more deeply.","Greg Johnson","Well, I think it is like any business. You want to make sure you watch carefully the risks in the larger portfolios and where assets are concentrated. I think, we do a pretty good job. Also, whether you would consider closing something that is more related to investment performance and liquidity than it would be to the risk to Franklin Templeton, but I think we do have still a very well diversified asset base.","If you look at every category, where we have investment management, I would still put it up there against anybody in the industry, so I think like any business you make sure you watch carefully those larger concentrations with assets, and I think we do a pretty good job of that. I think from a growth standpoint, it still has potential to grow, because sovereign debt is large and getting larger.","Bill Katz","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian, your line is now open.","Brian Bedell","Can you hear me?","Operator","Yes.","Brian Bedell","Yes. Okay. Great. Hi, good morning. Greg, if you can talk a little bit of more about some of the differences between what you are seeing in sales demand in Europe versus the U.S. for really the global and international equity products. Just trying to get a sense of that tempo as we come into the first quarter, again, more on the sales side versus the redemption side?","Greg Johnson","Yes. I think the press, it is a little bit different. Our mix in certainly Europe and Asia versus the U.S. and the big drivers for us, tend to be that Asia growth fund, which is sold in all over Europe as well as Asia.","You do tend to see more volatility in both gross and redemptions and that is more of a sector-oriented norm, more the platform-driven model and that is really what has put a lot of pressure on the global equity outflows for the quarter, where you had volatility in the currencies as well as emerging markets, they are having a relatively weak quarter against the rest.","Europe, obviously, it was, a lot of money moving into it a quarter or two ago and now it seems to be the reverse and probably the same in Asia, but the good news again is that when those markets rebound you will see the sentiment change.","I think for the U.S. it is more of a steady state for us and I think the challenge has been, more recently we had a strong rebound in Templeton performance, but again the value approach, the overweighting in Europe and the exposure to the U.S. dollar is going to create some retail headwinds for us in the near-term, but you just have never seen this kind of markets where the S&P has had such strength against the MSCI.","I think for the year, what was about 13%, 14% return for the S&P versus 3% for the rest of the world and minus 5 for emerging markets, so that I think tells a little bit of the story right there.","Brian Bedell","Then maybe just adding to that on the fee mix shift, obviously if you had the worst fee mix shift coming into the December quarter, as we move into 1Q, I guess, first of all was there anything unusual that changed that.","Then second of all, I guess, would you see that trend continuing into the quarter given some of the dynamics of what has happened most recently coming into quarter end?","Greg Johnson","Right. I mean, the only maybe unusual thing would be that we had less performance fees. I think that was the delta quarter-to-quarter was maybe like $10 million less of performance fees.","Brian Bedell","Okay.","Greg Johnson","\u2026so you factor that in, but excluding that, asset under management mix shifts relatively away from global equity to U.S. in percentage terms or relative terms than you are going to see that decline, so it is really a factor of assets under management shift, then maybe also but to a lesser degree, the mix between retail and institutional.","Brian Bedell","Right, and you are seeing greater strength in institutional right now. Is that correct?","Greg Johnson","We have seen that. Yes. We have seen that last couple of quarters, so that is reflected in the decrease in the effective fee rate.","Brian Bedell","Right, Okay. Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Lee from KBW. Please go ahead.","Robert Lee","Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just want to go back to the balance sheet a little bit. I understand, clearly, the desire to return 50% of cash flow, I guess to U.S. earnings, and that drove the special dividend, but can you maybe talked a little bit about kind of how may be they thought of it that versus a step up in share repurchase, particularly since as you guys rightly point out over the years you have actually done a good job of driving down the share count over time, so I am just trying get a sense of that dynamic.","Then maybe the second part of that would be, I know you have some debt that comes due in a couple of quarters. In the past, I think the only reason you really put even leverage on the balance sheet was to fund some specials and share repurchases, so given the capacity you have for additional borrowings and kind of what may be the appetite you can put a little bit more leverage on to step ups some share repurchase going forward.","Ken Lewis","Sure. Greg, just talk about the S&P up last year, and the board have the benefit of hindsight looking back and seeing that the share repurchases were not maybe at levels they were previously. Since we are opportunistic that was clearly understood and justified in their minds, so they said this would be a good way to top that up and meet our objectives.","Going forward, it does not change really our strategy going forward in any material way, so we will continue to be opportunistic in share repurchases. If there is a significant pullback in the market, we will step it up and vice versa, so that will continue.","Regarding the debt, the other thing that is kind of in the back of folk people's minds is, the whole discussion about tax reform and there is recent news and talk about a potential building introduced regarding repatriation for infrastructure, so we are keeping an eye on that and that may change the view of the board and the view of management in terms of share repurchases or dividends, so we will wait and see on that.","In terms of the debt, you are right. I do not think there will be any significant change in our overall debt position, which I guess implies that we are leaning toward refinancing it, but that decision has not been made yet. We will probably talk more about that next quarter.","Robert Lee","All right, great, then I have question maybe actually look at the DCIO business. I mean that has, I think, been a good business for you guys over time, but certainly the DC business has been changing a lot the last several years with growth target date more pressure on plan sponsors in terms of fee disclosures and all kinds of things, so can you may be talk a little bit about how kind of the changes are reshuffling in that space and kind of what the current strategy is or any thoughts on, are you going after kind of an open architecture target date, just trying to get a sense of how you are viewing that market segment?","Greg Johnson","Well, I think you have kind a hit on the big changes. For us, going after open architecture target dates is kind of a difficult road, because there is really limited access to do that.","I think what has happened part of the reason why U.S. domestic equity and large cap and traditional core funds continues to struggle. As a standalone fund, it is just hard to get access and you are going to have to get access through a target date fund.","In the past, you could get on the platform as a standalone independent fund. Today that is very difficult, so target date, especially where you have proprietary client contribution plans continue to be I think I am appropriate way for individuals to get a better diversified portfolio that changes over time.","For us, I think the net effect is that you have more specialized funds, which are still accessible or still in demand on those platforms, but it is just going to be harder and harder to get say the Franklin growth fund get distribution in a DCIO plan versus other types of products that could be a small cap or could be a global bond ones that are viewed as separate from the core holdings.","I think that the net effect, I mean, DCIO is still very attractive channel of growth for us certainly versus defined benefit. We put a lot of resources into it and we have seen incremental growth there, but I think the target date area is just hard for an independent asset manager do well versus people that have the proprietary plans.","Robert Lee","Great. Thank you for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Yes. Good morning. A quick question on the global equity sales, it seems on a gross basis, and the trend has been pretty steadily downward in that and for those products. Can you help us understand what is driving that and what efforts are being made in order reverse that trend?","Greg Johnson","I think as I have mentioned, I mean it is just this kind of strength of the dollar has created headwinds for Templeton and then Europe more recently, so I think we are always looking at ways to strengthen the process and diversify and look at risks. Those are the things that we are doing, but as I said earlier what are you focused on, you are focused on investment performance delivering long-term results and that is really what we are trying to do there, but I think we are more sensitive now to the difficulties and just one factor, which has been the strong dollar and looking at whether or not you would hedge those or kind of things you can do going forward.","Those are the kind of things we are going to look at, but as we have seen in the past the short-term numbers can turn pretty quickly and general consensus is the dollar continues to run, but who knows. I mean that can turn too and that all of a sudden short-term relative performance looks fine, but I would agree with your assessment, that is an area where we have lost share and one that we are very focused on right now.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. If we think about it on the constant dollar basis, what would those numbers look like on the gross sale side?","Greg Johnson","Yes. Again, I just do not really look at, we study the market share numbers and I just do not have that in front of me what the gross sales for the global equity looks likes over time.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thanks.","Greg Johnson","Try to get it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Greggory Warren from Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Greggory Warren","Yes. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I know we touched on this a little bit sort of the near-term performances issues, so I am not going to go down that path.","I was just kind of curious when you think about sort of the global international bond portfolio, I know you have talked about the fact that it is negatively correlated to U.S. interest rate. We should see better performance out of that platform as rate start to rise.","Do you think you face a deferred headwind sort of that investor mindset that they should not be buying fixed-income funds when rates are rising?","Ken Lewis","Yes. I think there are some absolute some truth to that, and I think certainly and that is why we debate even health advisers place it in the portfolios to say, this is part of their fixed income and it is almost we would argue it should be an alternative or global macro or something other, because the duration exposure is so low and it is part of the redemptions that we saw when rates rose earlier was exactly that that people to say we were going to lower exposure to fixed income, so you do a risk there.","I also think that the market will differentiate fixed income once you have a real rising rate environment and you look at returns and this will stand out something that holds up very well in a rising rate environment.","I think that will be the bigger driver over time. If you do well in the rising rate environment, there is not going to be many places to go and hopefully that is where you get some attention and growth.","Greggory Warren","Okay. Good, on that front. I guess my other question relates sort of to where we are looking at expenses and margins for the year. I think you noted in the pre-record call and also a little bit here, but our compensation expenses might be a bit higher this year than it was last year and try to make up for another in the P&L, but is the assumption that margins won't be significantly better than they were last year, there we are not going to see sort of expansion of margins. Is that sort of a takeaway we should have from that?","Greg Johnson","I think it is revenue story as much as it is an expense story. We have seen assets under management level declined last two quarters. That is eventually going to reflect itself in the growth rate of revenue year-over-year.","When we have some flexibility on expense side, and we will react to that, so it is really challenging to say what the margins will be the same or different from year-over-year.","I think the best guidance I can give you is to look back to see what happened in 2008, 2009, 2010, and some of the actions we took back then to see what flexibility we have.","Greggory Warren","Well, I hope it doesn't get that bad.","Ken Lewis","That's a worst case scenario.","Greggory Warren","Okay.","Ken Lewis","Which I think we reacted pretty well there.","Greggory Warren","Yes. It was fantastic. We have gone through that period. Thanks for taking my question overall. I will get back you if I have anymore.","Ken Lewis","Okay. Thanks.","Ken Lewis","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Eric Berg","Thanks very much. Good morning it is Eric Berg from RBC. Greg, it seem like a number of your competitors, your direct competitors are reporting strong flows in fixed income despite the prospects for rising interest rates whether it is in passive strategies or in active strategies that are less than traditional, unconstrained total return. There are a number of competitors that I could cite that that are reporting solidly positive fixed-income flows.","I have sort of had one question with two related parts. How are you feeling about your over all around the world fixed-income flows and what are the prospects near-term?","Greg Johnson","Well, I think the fixed-income picture, while there is certainly a consensus that rates are going up, the other consensus is not within the next year, so fixed-income has performed extremely well and those with the longer duration have done even better. Then you have had a little bit of dislocation in the marketplace as we know and that created some movement. I am sure there is one firm that is not enjoying large fixed-income flows right now. That has resulted in some other ones having very strong in-flows.","I think, we have very strong funds in those areas, we have seen growth not to the level that the other more institutional-oriented players that matchup take a little bit better as far as what the consultants are going to drive and we are getting some of that opportunity, but probably not to the level of a couple of others.","I still think that is a good opportunity for us and one that, again, we have seen incremental growth and positive flows, but I think not to the level that the couple of other names have and that is really what you are speaking to and I would still think that I would put that in the list of still a growth opportunities for us, we have funds, we have strong records in that area and sometime it just get pushing up between the two or three more obvious names there institutional markets.","Eric Berg","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time.","Greg Johnson","Okay. Well, thank you everybody for participating on the call and we will look forward to speaking next quarter. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Mr. Johnson, you may begin.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, thank you, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning, especially accommodating our earlier call. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to listen to our recorded commentary on first quarter results. And as a reminder, our 10-Q was also filed this morning, and you can access that form from our website as well.","We are pleased to report solid first quarter results, starting our fiscal year on a positive note, led by a strong investment performance and asset growth. Operating results were also solid with record revenue and the best quarter for operating income in over a year. I'd now like to open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just looking at operating revenue growth versus comp growth over last year, they were actually quite a similar, looks like around 12%, despite the fact that revenue growth is very strong. I was wondering if you could maybe provide some details why there hasn't been more operating leverage between comp and revs?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Sure. And yes, and it has been -- looking back 4 years, maybe with the exception of 2009 and the global financial crisis, it has been pretty stable. It's not a metric that we target or manage to. But it's just an outcome of our process. It has been pretty stable. I think the answer is a lot of -- there is some -- it is based on operating income. So that's going to keep things relatively in line. There is a component of compensation that is related to sales activity and commissions. So as the business grows, that tends to grow, too. So I think that's the main factors why that has stayed the same. Most of the -- if you look at our increase in headcount, much of that has been in low-cost jurisdictions. So the cost per capita has been actually decreasing I would say.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just you mentioned Riva a lot in the prepared commentary. What's the current EBITDA or income contribution from this business? And actually, how large could it get to?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes. It's -- well, it's basically nil. And up until this point, it's probably -- it's been an investment that we've been making. The question is, we have a 51% ownership in the entity, so if -- when people see the functionality of the product, we think that there's a pretty good opportunity to grow that business.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So that's consolidated on the income statement. I guess it's up in other net revenues?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","It's -- it could be in nonoperating income. It could be in G&A, bits of it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Hopson from Stifel.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So obviously, the U.S. has seen a big pickup in flow activity in January. And Europe and other areas, I guess, did not fall off as much. Any sense that you could give us on European overall industry activity in January and how you think you're positioned there?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I would just -- Jeff, we try not to talk about the next quarter. I think, just speaking generally, January tends to be a very strong month for flows with retirement contributions. And with the strength of the markets and momentum, we expect to see that to carry through and are seeing that for us. Europe continues to be strong and also was one of our improving areas, certainly over the last quarter where we had pretty good net inflows in many of our countries throughout Europe. So that trend is continuing as well.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on the global fixed side, can you give us some updates on the institutional, I guess, pipelines and interest level? And particularly, have you had much success in introducing that product to -- on 401(k) platforms where there doesn't appear to be much embedded penetration, I guess?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes. I think there continues to be strong interest institutionally. We have had a very significant win that we expect to fund this quarter in emerging markets debt. I think the 401(k) side continues to grow. It's still not a big portion. But looking at the overall flows of over $5 billion of international bonds last quarter, it's safe to say that the momentum that we had back over a year ago has certainly returned on the strength of the performance, and we expect that to continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Lee from KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I guess my first question is, in the prepared remarks and looking at the balance sheet, I'm just curious, the -- I think, Ken, you mentioned that most of the $5.9 billion or so of cash and investments is offshore. So, I mean, between the special dividend and continued share buybacks, I mean, is there a need to build kind of U.S. liquidity to some degree? And should we think that maybe even for a period of time, there could be kind of a moderation in the rate -- the slow -- of buyback, at least for a couple of quarters as you build liquidity in the U.S.?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes, I do think that that's a fair comment. Both the percentage of cash and equivalents and investments is about 40% in the U.S. When -- obviously, when things like the Global Bond Fund grows quickly and all that, we can replenish that pretty quick. So I think, generally speaking, you could see a moderation in the short term for share buybacks. But if there was an opportunity, we certainly have the flexibility internally and externally to raise capital to take advantage of that in terms of the stock price.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Right, great. And maybe I guess my second question is with K2, I mean, you closed on it. I know there's about a month or so in there. But can you maybe just update us strategically on kind of how you're thinking of maybe incorporating it more broadly into the business, where you see the opportunity to really use their skill set? And maybe some color on things you may even be working on right now would be, I think, helpful.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes. I think the first step -- I mean, it's still very early in coming up with a definitive plan how to leverage it. But I think the first step was to get our own distribution system very familiar and then look at whatever areas of overlap we have around the globe and where we can get their message out. So we've done that. That seems to be working well. We're getting RFPs where we -- where they wouldn't have gotten RFPs without the relationships we have around the globe. So that's the first step. And then we're studying the retail. There has been a movement towards having a '40 Act fund to funds and a more liquid kind of strategy there, and that's something certainly we're looking at as well. But really, it's educating our force first and taking their traditional business and trying to leverage that, and then start to figure out where we can help out on the solution side and in the high-net worth space as well as the retail space.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Greg, I think, on your prerecorded call, you mentioned on the international equity side just some redemptions on the institutional side. When we look at the industry trend, it seems like the interest in international equities continues to be there. And it seems like just given the Templeton brand, that you guys should be a beneficiary of that trend. Yet the flows seem like that it's not there. So I was just wondering, like on the institutional redemptions, is that masking some of the more favorable trends that are happening on the retail? Or is there something on the retail side that you're not quite getting those net flows into that channel? Or is there a reason for that driver?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes. I think it's a good question and one that if I had to look at any area and say where we underperformed as far as distribution, it'd certainly be in that category, and a lot of that on the retail side. I mean, Templeton had underperformed for a while, had made an early bet on Europe and financials. And fortunately, that's paid off considerably. If you look out how quickly the long-term records that were lagging are now back in the top 2 quartiles, 1-, 3-, 5-year, 10-year even pulling back. So it just takes time. Once you fall out of favor with advisors, it just takes -- it just doesn't snap back as fast as, say, the institutional world that looks more real time at performance. We did have a couple of large redemptions in Canada with global equity in the last quarter, which totaled about $2 billion between Canada and Asia. There were a couple of redemptions in that category. So that certainly contributed to your net outflow number. But I think we feel confident that -- and we've been very focused on getting the message out on the retail side over the last year, and we have a pretty strong story to tell with good performance. So I hope and we expect that to snap back. But on retail flows, it just takes a little bit more time.","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Right. And this is Ken. I'll just add that in January, we are seeing an improvement in global equity, the global equity group's flow, both on a gross and net basis. It's early days, but it's positive.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just as a follow-up,  on the fee rate and just how we try to calculate it, it just seems like it was roughly flat, maybe even down a slight amount. And there's always moving pieces there, so it's always hard to gauge exactly. But I think the performance fees were pretty similar this quarter and last quarter. The only thing that was new would have been K2 coming in, and I guess assets will probably end the full quarter and then the revenues really 2 months. But other than that, was there anything else from a mix standpoint? It just seems like international market is strong, global bond flow is strong. All should be higher fees, but it just seemed like it came in a little bit shy where many  expectations were.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes. Yes, that's fair. I think the answer lies in the mix, both in terms of the products and the channels. So as we see more of a trend relative mix towards fixed income and hybrid products, I mean, also some of the institutional business, which a year ago was 20% but now it's 23% of assets under management, so they tend to be lower fees. So we're seeing maybe a slight erosion of the effective fee rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Katz from Citi.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just want to come at the Riva opportunity from a different angle. Given these synergies that you're getting from this platform expansion, is there a chance to pass along those synergies to shareholders in the form of lower expenses to further drive volume growth?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","We think so. We think it improves Riva. And things like Riva improves our scalability globally, faster time-to-market without the incremental increase in expenses. And we're able to handle multiple share classes, multiple currencies. Everything that you need in a global -- to be a global investment manager is automated now. And so that and the combination of us continuing to use low-cost jurisdictions, I think that we will -- I'm not saying reduce expenses, but we certainly won't have to increase them at perhaps the rates that our competitors would have to do.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Helpful. And the second question. You've spent a fair amount of time on your prepared remarks and the prerecorded call so highlighting at least Switzerland and Germany, I believe. And are there specific initiatives there at the margin that you're focused on and that could accelerate growth on top of what we've already seen?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Well, I think each one -- those markets, generally, is global bond. I mean, that's been a driver in Europe. So you look at the last quarter, that's where flows really turned around, and so that's going to affect those specific markets more than most. I think the initiatives have been to diversify while we have had one of the top-selling funds in those markets to sell more of the multi-sector approach, which we've been pretty successful with in Italy, which continues to be our top -- one of our top net markets and still a tough environment there. So our goal is always to try to build a more diversified base there. And because global bonds have been so big, we try to introduce other funds. But there's nothing really specific to call out other than that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Kim from Sandler O'Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First, just a follow-up on the Global Bond Fund performances. It has obviously been very strong more recently, and now the 3-year numbers are quite strong as well. And so you've seen a rebound in flows, but it's still sort of below prior levels. So I'm just wondering if there are any catalysts out there to maybe jump-start flows even more so going forward.","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Well, the question of whether you get back, I think the volatility that we expect, but sometimes maybe the market or investors don't expect, is somewhat of a good thing going forward. Now we've called that  out on prior calls that you want to make sure people understand that this type of strategy, that it's somewhat fairly aggressive, alpha oriented, that you can have periods of underperformance. So that may turn away some investors. But I think, again, like I stated earlier, January tends to be strong flows and the momentum that, that fund has built coming off of fourth quarter where it had significant flows. And I'd also point to Global Total Return Fund, which outsold the Global Bond Fund last quarter. That's another positive trend.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then you highlighted the success you've had selling the Franklin Growth products on the prerecorded call. So just wondering how you think those strategies are positioned, assuming retail investors do you continue to get more comfortable sort of moving up the risk curve, if you will?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, I think it positions much better that it has been in the past. So we've said, I mean, the Franklin Growth Fund now is on many of the different of the retirement plan platforms, so you would expect to see that flows and flows over the last quarter in the Franklin Growth Fund. It was one of our top-selling U.S. equity funds. Also, Franklin Balanced Fund has been a new fund that we offered that has kind of both an income piece as well as an equity growth piece, and that's had excellent performance. And we've seen decent momentum there, certainly, and we think that's going to continue to build. So I think the -- we're much better positioned as U.S. equity flows come back, and we would expect to see, like many, a stronger number this quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, on marketing. Can you talk about the approach that you're thinking about for the year? What are you doing similar to years past? And maybe anything that you're contemplating doing differently in '13 versus what you've done in '11 or '12?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","No, I think the message is pretty consistent versus '11 and '12, and that's that we want to continue to focus on the importance of equity investing and make sure that we're recognized as a leader in that area. So that message will continue. But I don't think there's any big changes of strategy other than that, that will continue to be a focus for us. We also have our tactical asset allocation funds, things like that, that have been out there, continue to develop our solutions as far as product development. But I don't really, right now, expect to see a big shift in our strategy and our spend and really our flows from what we've seen over the last year or 2.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So even if we are seeing engagement, we're seeing better sales activity in your equity products, you think the positioning is just -- it's going to be consistent with what you've been doing?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Right. I think it moves the needle on the margin. But, I mean, the strength of hybrid Franklin Income, global bonds, munis are going to continue to be the major drivers. And performance is good in all those areas, so I would expect to see a continuation unless you have changes in the market. But for now, fixed income is still driving equities picking up, but I don't think there is going to be a huge shift unless rates back up or something happens.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just on Global Bond and sort of this ongoing capacity question. So Hasenstab is talking about the lack of attractiveness of safe sovereign debt, and it's been driving them into some of the other markets like Ireland, where I think he's now 10% of that market. So I know in the past you said that there's plenty of capacity in the areas that he looks at, but now it seems like there's been at least a recent shift in his strategy. So based on that, is the business now too big for what he is trying to accomplish? And then as managers, what do you do about it?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, it's something we monitor very closely and look at defining and measuring liquidity as an art itself, and we spend a lot of time doing that in these markets. And I would also point, too, that this fund carries a cash position because we know there will be shocks in the market and liquidity dries up when you need it. But you look at the demand in the last offering of Irish debt that I think was 3x oversubscribed, you can argue liquidity is pretty high right now. But we know that's not there when things turn the other way. So I think we're sensitive to that issue. We spend a lot of time with the team and with our risk group measuring that, but we feel very comfortable today that it is the appropriate level of liquidity. But for those that want to be more aggressive, we have other type products available in the less liquid markets with more of a -- restrictions around what you can do with redemption. So I don't think for now. I think the good news is that we are diversifying with the Global Total Return Fund, which again has a much -- is a much larger overall market. And we still feel comfortable, as Michael does, with the liquidity in the global bond side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Kelley from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to expand upon the K2 acquisition a little bit and just broadening the scope a little bit towards just the alternatives platform in general and the fact that you've gotten more traction with institutional clients. What other sorts of asset classes outside of the fund to funds business might make sense for you? Would you consider more kind of global real estate, private equity or anything else that you're thinking about?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I think we're in both of those, private equity and global real estate. And whether there's an opportunity to expand that platform, that's certainly something that we're always open to doing if it makes sense. So as we've said before, there's no hard rule one way or another. If something makes sense and we can build scale and build a stronger group, we'll do that. But we do have that capability today certainly with Darby and our Franklin real estate group.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. I guess just to follow up on that, I was asking -- I was trying to get more along the lines of there's obviously increased retail penetration or demand, at least, for some alternative products here in the U.S. But do you see more potential growth in the retail channels or in institutional for the alternative asset class as a whole?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, I think it's hard. I mean, I think, again, and as you define what -- alternative covers a lot of ground, whether you call it a solutions and a target date and is that really an alternative. So the answer is that there's an appetite to -- always to do things a little bit differently, and we're going to continue to build. But whether or not -- the liquidity concern in retail, I think, is something we're sensitive to and are going to be careful about less liquid-type private equity investments vehicles like that, even fund to funds, hedge fund to funds. Whether or not you can really do that in '40 Act form, I think, is a question that we're still analyzing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marc Irizarry from Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just want to get some perspective on your growth outside the U.S. versus inside the U.S. relative to margins. Is there -- if you -- if your growth accelerates outside the U.S., how should we think about sort of the near-term margin potential? And then maybe I don't know if you have a view on sort of long-term trajectory there as well?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes, I'll start with -- I'll talk a little bit about the margins. To the extent that the growth occurs in our -- the -- I would call it a retail product even though sometimes that's sold on the institutional channel. The -- our CCAB funds, I think the margins -- I don't think we'll have incremental expenses, so you could see some margin expansion. To the extent that the growth would come from maybe our local asset management groups, the in-country funds, they are more expensive, but, on the other hand, they're such a smaller part of our business that they shouldn't really have a big impact. So I would say that if we did overall have international growth, that it would -- you could see some margin expansion, or at least flat or at least stable, but not compression.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Greg, can you just comment on your appetite for deals given all the capabilities that you've added already and what you're building, what you currently have in the product lineup, how the sort of acquisitions fit into your thinking there?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","We have a lot of styles. We feel like we've addressed most of the needs out there. And -- but if something pops up that, again, we think can be accretive over time, we're going to look at that. But I wouldn't put any -- if I had to -- if we had to put a wish list together, I don't -- I think it'd be difficult for us to say 1, 2 and 3, what do we need right now. I think we've got a lot of pieces that we can actually build new products with some of the capabilities that we've introduced. And we've also haven't fully leveraged the distribution that we have with many of these newer acquisitions. So we're going to continue to look. But again, the breadth of what we offer, you do get diminishing returns at some point through distribution channels. And what we're looking at today is whether or not things like -- we are investing and building out our alternatives distribution as a separate platform, and we think we're going to continue down that road. So that enables us to potentially add more products and styles to that. And so that would be the one area that we're going to continue to be open to.","Operator","Our next question comes from the Greggory Warren from Morningstar.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Looking at the fixed-income flows you saw during the quarter, how much of that do you attribute to the positive flows you saw from Global Bond and from Global Total Return? And I guess sort of a follow-on to that, do you think that this is kind of an appropriate quarterly run rate to assume as the year progresses?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","I think it -- again, January tends to be a little stronger, so -- to extrapolate or to take this quarter, and we all know how difficult forecasting where rates are going to be. So you look at the strength of muni bonds. Even in a period where you had some questions about tax changes that could have affected them and probably contributed to some redemptions but still had relatively strong flows, you would expect that to increase if, with the increase in tax rates, it just makes that much more attractive. So I think it's a fair, certainly, run rate if rates don't change or maybe higher, hopefully.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay, that's good. And then just a quick follow-on. Looking at equity flows overall, I'm sure you guys have seen the same sort of data and you look at what's been happening within your own funds in January, It seems like a lot of the money is flowing more into international equity funds, and I would assume more in the active side. Has that been the case where you guys? Are you seeing more activity on that side of the business and less on the domestic?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, again, I mean, I -- we really don't like to talk about this -- the current quarter as far as flows. But, as Ken mentioned, certainly for us, a drag has been the net global equity flows, and we have seen a significant improvement. I don't really have an answer whether it's passive or active, but you certainly have more active in retirement plans, and that's going to generally drive more of the immediate flows in January.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo Securities.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Want to come back to this point about global equity flows not really catching up with the better performance you've had. Curious, do you think enough time has passed here where advisors will actually start coming back to this product in a more material way? And I guess maybe to help us frame up the answer to this question, in prior periods we've had some performance issues. How long did it take for the advisors to come back?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, a couple of points. I mean, one, we are seeing an increase in certainly the gross level, and much of that was masked by some of those big institutional redemptions. But it -- I don't have any answer to tell you how quickly. I think I'm a little disappointed it hasn't come back faster. But we tend to focus on it more than -- and it's even getting our own channel. And that's been a big focus of ours, is getting our own people to talk about it more than kind of ignoring it, which could have been the case in the past. So we have to get that message out. That's been our focus certainly for the last 6 to 9 months. And we are seeing a turnaround. We're seeing interest on the gross sale level. We're seeing a turnaround in net numbers more recently. So I -- we are seeing that turnaround, and I couldn't tell you what the -- what a number is because there are so many different factors in timing and when flows come back.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then a real quick follow-up on performance. Clearly, Templeton doing great. But Mutual a bit less so. Can give us a little color on what's driving the underperformance you're seeing at Mutual?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, I think it's just the value -- their deep value style, and some of its currency moves as well that can affect the shorter-term numbers. Cash, they generally hold a little bit more in cash than most equity funds, and that tends to create a lag in the kind of markets that we've had. Much more defensive posture risk that -- and that's been traditional for them versus this kind of risk on market over the last year or 2.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess to follow up on that, could you -- for Mutual Series, could you just kind of highlight recent flow trends? And I guess remind us in total what the asset levels are there in that complex.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, I don't have that -- we'll dig that up or you can call our Investor Relations group. But I don't have the exact numbers in front of me. Sorry.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then I guess just one on the global fixed. You talked about on the prerecorded call some of the geographies that have improved. Is it some of the same customers coming back or some of the same channels that are resulting in the gross sales improvement? Obviously, the geographies seem to be similar, but is it the same kind of end users as well?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, I think that's certainly -- I don't think there's been any real shift in distribution. We saw some shift based on volatility that created some lumpier redemptions because of the gatekeeper approach, too many of the big banks in Europe and things that may have just felt it was a little too volatile for what they were -- how they were selling it. But we're seeing a pretty consistent pickup really across Europe and the U.S. And Ken has some numbers.","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes. While Greg was talking, I did a little research there. We have seen an improvement in Mutual net flows in the month of December. And that's -- and we've even seen some positive flows early days in January. And their assets at December were around $55 billion.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for adjusting your schedules to participate on our morning call, and we look forward to speaking next quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Just wanted to sitting and provide more color, the likely options and any update on your exposure in the retirement channel and maybe how you know this uncertainty has been weighing you know on flows so whether it's the sales or the pickup in redemptions?","Gregory Johnson","I mean I think it's tough to really estimate what effect it could have on sales, but I think it clearly has been very disruptive, to the advisors business right now and sorting out, what is going to happen. I think from the last call you know we continue to make a lot of progress a lot of work being done.","On getting ready for April I think you know the good news is that there seems you know our concerns always been that it's not workable to come out with a different pricing structure for every broker dealer out there and we seem to be narrowing those options down to hopefully two.","And then you saw the recent you know announcement around a plain share class or super class or whatever you want to call them and you know having more of a stripped down version available at some point in the future that that could be an option as well where you have you know the pricing handled at the broker dealer level.","All of that you know I think is happening the question about what effect will it have I think you know the net effect there was some surveys done that said one said you'll have 10% to 15% less advisors out there. I think that some would retire the transition is going to be very difficult to go to the new model.","So I you know I think that that can be disruptive as well. And I just think overall you know our sense is once we get past this you\u2019ll get to a more normalized environment but right now it is a very disruptive force for the advisor you know last Tom Regner who's been involved more day-to-day if he has anything to add.","Tom Regner","So we\u2019re spending a lot of time getting ready for next April. On the retail side, we\u2019re doing a lot of training and kicking off some internal training for both the internal team and the external sales team because we\u2019re moving towards an advisory business, which is really selling funds within a portfolio of context, which is different than we have and our competitors have been doing that so. We\u2019re getting ready as fast as we can for that change.","Michael Carrier","Okay, got it. And then just as a follow-up, I guess just on the cash. Do you guys have been active this year with buyback and dividend, but for the non-U.S. cash, if we do get repatriation holiday next year or the year after. And this is I guess for Greg or Ken, just what would be the plan or the options with that cash? And then if not, how you thought about ways that you can maybe create some value with that non-U.S. cash, given that you don\u2019t tend to get much credit for it sitting outside the U.S.?","Gregory Johnson","I guess by the way I would answer this question is it\u2019s hard to say exactly what we do, because we would have to see what the new rules are if and when they come out, but I just point back to what we did in the last time, which was probably over 10 years ago now, we repatriated the cash, and I\u2019d like to pay the special dividend. So those are all the options, but we would definitely try to take advantage of whatever was in the best interest of shareholders based on the law.","Kenneth Lewis","And I would just add I mean how we think about it, I mean I think we all would maybe agree now that the probability is higher as we get past the election on having some form of repatriation and you look at that offshore cash and you could discount it, well it would be probably a 20% haircut or so if you take it back to the U.S. So I think as far as how the board and management think about it, if you have an opportunity offshore, it\u2019s 20% cheaper than one onshore. So we continue to look at anything that would be accretive and additive to our lineup offshore first.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Daniel Fannon","Thanks. Good morning. I guess Greg, you highlighted the variable annuity outflows that have been occurring in our \u2013 I guess slated to occur over the next couple quarters. Can you talk a bit about why that\u2019s occurring again just to refresh us and if it\u2019s DOL related and then ultimately what\u2019s the AUM left in those buckets that maybe longer-term might be a risk?","Gregory Johnson","Yes, I\u2019ll start and again I have Tom, because we figure those questions would come up today the DOL and specifically VA. And have a very strong business in that area sub-advising as well as separate funds that are for the annuity business. And really many of the large players that we grew I think at a high of about $70 billion in assets in that category.","Many of the big names have gotten out of that business and as they wind down the assets, many are going to in-house and passive or low volatility strategies and we\u2019re trying to capture as much as that transition is possible, but it has put a large block of business in transition at risk. I think for next quarter, we\u2019re estimating another $2.6 billion in outflows and today we\u2019re at $35 billion approximately in assets that are remaining. And I\u2019ll let Tom, if you have anything to add on the business itself.","Tom Regner","Yes, Greg covered what\u2019s going on well. What we\u2019re doing in response is we have established dedicated insurance solutions group within our overall solutions portfolio approach and where we\u2019re developing portfolios that have less basis risk. I mean one of the issues is with the insurance companies that there was a high basis risk in some of their underlying portfolios for the VA contracts. So we\u2019re working on reducing that.","I think you\u2019ll see in the next four or five days, one of the top five insurance companies by sales is going to be announcing a new VA living benefit that\u2019s backed by a customized Franklin Templeton portfolio. So we\u2019re working very hard to make sure that we stay relevant with the firms that are staying in the business.","Kenneth Lewis","And as of quarter end, we had $46 billion remaining in VA assets.","Daniel Fannon","Great. And then just a follow-up I guess maybe Tom for you on the DOL. It seems as if the industry is facing a growth sales issue today because of the uncertainty. I guess as you kind of \u2013 we get closer to the implementation date are you guys assuming or as you talk to advisors as their assumption, is there going to be a step function higher in terms of assets in motion whether that \u2013 whether we see redemptions pick up or obviously gross sales could pick up as well. But I guess, where are we \u2013 you think in this transition phase for advice or behavior at this point?","Tom Regner","Yes. I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re going to see a pickup in redemptions. There are some awfully attractive living benefits out there historically, which frankly hurt some of the insurance companies. I think what you\u2019re going to see though is initially there\u2019s going to be a slowdown in sales within the VA business because the commissions are coming down, there is no question about that, there\u2019s going to be shorter surrender time.","So the VA business is going to be in a state of flex, but we know from working with our clients that we work with the top five in the industry that they\u2019re not standing still, right. So they are coming out and will be coming out with new products to stay relevant in the new \u2013 with the new DOL legislation.","Daniel Fannon","I guess my comment was just on mutual fund sales, not on the VA. So just generally in terms of the advisor behavior broadly not just with VA?","Tom Regner","No, I mean I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s going to be I mean look people still need to invest, they still need to retire they still need to provide for college education. As Greg mentioned that it\u2019s going to be difficult for some advisors because a lot of the business is going advisory. I think that the number is you need to have about $30 million as an advisor of assets under management to have a viable business. So it\u2019s going to be hard for some people to stay in business if they don\u2019t have a sizable book. So there will be some transition in the advisors themselves, but there\u2019s still a very, very strong demand that\u2019s not changing.","Gregory Johnson","And I just think it\u2019s still early to kind of forecast there\u2019s a lot of people that would argue that the amount of money in motion. It could slow down because the tax considerations to that if you have taxable gains and one you can\u2019t take and move it to another and this obviously outside of the retirement world. And then how the incentives line up post this changed as well and then that could affect behavior on how assets moves and just stay old versus new, if just would all move at once.","Daniel Fannon","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Kenneth Worthington","Hi, good morning. Greg I think earlier this year you called out that you thought the institutional business have a lot of promise. I think particularly when it came to effect exposure management. Each quarter we tend to hear about these big, big outflows and it seems like there is broader base sort of institutional redemptions. So I guess the question is help us understand what\u2019s going on in the institutional side of the business and maybe characterize how you see the outlook?","Gregory Johnson","Well, I think it\u2019s been as you know I mean challenging with Templeton and a deep value philosophy I mean that cycle has \u2013 the timing and the market\u2019s been working against getting new mandates. So the good news is that we\u2019ve seen things switching \u2013 moving in the right direction there for performance, so hopefully that\u2019s historically has been our area where we had the strongest institutional business and still have large facet, so it\u2019s been more defense and offence as far as wins.","I think the opportunities we\u2019re seeing in local debt around the globe especially in Asia, we continue to work hard on those and have \u2013 I think a lot of opportunities that are still there in the pipeline. We\u2019ve gotten feel, but we still think that that will be the strongest area of growth and Tom if you want to add any\u2026?","Tom Regner","Yes. I mean what we\u2019re seeing in the U.S. is a re-risking of portfolios if you look at the public pension plans that are severely under funded, they need higher return. So they\u2019re starting to look at portfolios or asset classes that provide a high risk adjusted return. So I think that speaks well for some of the capabilities that we have on a global basis in fixed income and as Greg pointed out with value coming back that that speaks well for Templeton group too. But they have to re-risk those portfolios and we want to participate. ","Kenneth Worthington","Great. And then I think just to follow-up on Mike\u2019s question earlier on repatriation. How much time do you think it will take to evaluate the chances of repatriation or repatriation holiday after elections? Is this something that you think is sort of apparent pretty quickly or is this going to take two or three years and if it does take two or three years as long as the chances of a repatriation holiday [aren't zero]. Do you think it's just best to sit on the cash and way or do you start to get frustrated and make it a priority to maybe better utilize the cash?","Kenneth Lewis","Yes. This is Ken. As Greg mentioned, we are always looking for opportunities to grow the business and that won't change internationally. Greg mentioned that all things being equal and acquisition is cheaper if we use on for cash. And so that it's not that we're sitting and we're not doing anything else waiting for repatriation, I do want to make that clear. We are looking for opportunities and so that's one of the strategic advantages of having all that cash would be able to move on something if the opportunity presented itself.","But regarding the timeline for repatriation, there has been a lot of momentum and we feel like it's gaining momentum. Congress is working on the issue. We feel like when they come back in session, January is something they might be talking about it. Our advisors remind us all the time that four of the last five presidents enact a tax reform by August of the first year. So we are optimistic about it, and but we're also looking for other ways to use that cash.","Kenneth Worthington","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Katz with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","William Katz","Okay, thanks so much. Ken, one for you to get started. You gave some guidance on expenses for fiscal 2017 and 2016, so thank you for that. Within that construct, you also talked little bit about some investments being pick up on the tech line. Stepping back more broadly, if you would have to sort of replicate 2016 and 2017 we're sort of defined by choppy markets and some sluggish organic growth.","How much expense flexibility do you have at this point? I guess the question we're really asking is, are you sort of reaching the point now where you get a little more limited on expenses absent eating some maybe the revenue generating part of the company?","Kenneth Lewis","I think there's still flexibility on the quality expenses, but having said that I do think we're in a phase where those opportunities are take longer to execute. They tend to be more linked with strategic initiatives. So we continue to look at all that, is the business the right size et cetera, are we leveraging technology the best way we can. So I do think there's opportunities, but I don't think there's a lot of quick hits that would move the dial.","William Katz","Okay. And then Greg, so curious, it\u2019s been some merger of equals between [Janssen and Henderson] businesses and I think you go up again in various geographies around the world. Does that transaction in and itself for the implication of that transaction, does that shift the mindset a little bit and could you maybe move that in with the allocation within repatriation between acquisition versus buyback versus dividends?","Gregory Johnson","No, I mean I don't think it changes the mindset. I think in that case there was a clear benefit for the two firms to get into two different markets and leverage the distribution of each side to do that. I think the consensus out there of consolidation does create a wave of consolidation that obviously this is a slower growth business, it's a more mature business and one way to gain efficiency is through consolidation. So I think companies as I've said before are going to be much more open to looking at that avenue to create value.","William Katz","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Alexander Blostein","Hey, good morning. Thank you. First follow-up on the I guess evolution of the distribution channel and that potential implications for you guys. I heard you on the prepared remarks around potentially launching your share class and that's something you guys talked about in the past as well. But any thoughts around the implications for management fees for you specifically in the industry broadly as we go through this adjustment in the distribution channel?","Gregory Johnson","Yes, I mean I think as far as the preparation and effect, I mean management fees is something that again, I mean this is a extremely competitive business, we all see the battle versus passive every day. So the pressure on management fees is there regardless of DOL or not.","I think the question around your product lineup and it's something that maybe Ken touched on a little bit on just where do we see potential savings and streamlining and what is DOL I think probably for us pushes us further down that path of trying to simplify the lineup and rationalize funds that may in a post DOL world may not fit neatly into more of an advisory model versus the traditional brokerage model, those are the debates we\u2019re having internally now and that could create some efficiencies.","But I think from a cost side this is a business that every basis points going to matter and I think the good news and some outcomes of the DOLs as you are going to have a lower front end sales charge that will help with some of your relative rankings.","And then as we said I think in our announcement that Morningstar, is now on the A shares is not going to use the maximum charge because most of it's done it at net asset value and that's going to make us more competitive where we see a lot of our funds will increase its star rating. So I think those are very positive outcomes and I think our concern of having 35 share classes at least now we feel like we will only have to add a few.","Alexander Blostein","Got it. And then my second question along the similar lines I guess but historically you guys were very successful kind of keeping more assets within the Franklin fund family in the broker channel, partially because I guess waived commission. Once the client already paid that commission on one fund moving to another. As you migrate over to the advisor channel can you help us understand how that could impact asset retention and maybe just from a historical perspective kind of like what sort of the percentage of the gross sales that has come from kind of folks switching from one fund to another?","Kenneth Lewis","Yes, I don't have that number I think anytime you go to more of the advisor type gatekeeper driven model the pros and cons I mean you can get significant assets quickly and you can lose significant assets quickly I think that's the net effect I think the advantage of the transition.","It's like a funnel where there's going to be less funds available in the new model, but if you have large assets a probability of your fund being included even in a period of underperformance it's highly unlikely that it's going to be eliminated from that lineup.","So I think size matters quite a bit as far as continue to get shelf space in the new model, but you know it is a higher risk from a retention standpoint than your traditional brokerage model where it\u2019s more a one on one relationship here it's more of a gatekeeper consultant driven more institutional type relationship and we've transitioned our model to I think adapt to that and have more people you know with consulting experience at that point of contact with the home offices.","Alexander Blostein","Yes, great. Thank you very much.","Kenneth Lewis","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line Ken Hill with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Kenneth Hill","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on something from earlier in the call you mentioned looking at the opportunities you continue to do that but it\u2019s kind of pretty consistent with how you've talked about that in past quarters. I'm just curious how you're evaluating some of those opportunities and these related to the cash you guys have and maybe what criteria or metrics you might look at to base a decision on to essentially grow something versus look to M&A that jump start some activity there?","Kenneth Lewis","I think in previous calls. We've talked about the share volume of things that we look at every year and you know that continues and you know that we - I would say the criteria that we use is a lot of it's qualitative you know we focus on the institutional process, institutionalize investment process can be repeatable key man risk all of that because this is a people business and cultural fit and that quickly eliminates a lot of perspectives. But so that that really hasn't changed and Greg touched on what's - some of the criteria that we might look at. So I think you know no change to what we said in the past.","Kenneth Hill","Okay. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Davitt","Hi, good morning, thanks. First, I just wanted to clarify the $46 billion of VA is that before or after the $7.4 billion of outflow you talked about it in the previous quarters call?","Kenneth Lewis","That\u2019s before.","Patrick Davitt","Okay. And then, the other question I have is on first liquidity rule and then broader regulatory concerns, one, do you have any initial thoughts on the expense associated with compliance with the rule and\/or potential performance impacts on your funds that invest in more liquid assets. And more broadly does your expense guidance for 2017 include any associated expense for becoming complying with that rule?","Kenneth Lewis","Yes, I mean I think it\u2019s probably early to answer any cost associated with the rule. I mean I think it hasn\u2019t been out very long, you have two years to comply my understanding. I think it\u2019s a much better rule than it was first discussed as far as something that appears to be workable for us and I don\u2019t think we have any major concerns on at this stage.","I mean, we\u2019re still studying it, but our first reaction was that it is \u2013 would not create issues on the portfolio management side for any of our funds. But again it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re studying the rule like most right now, but I think it\u2019s a better outcome than what was first discussed. And I think liquidity is something that we manage very carefully with our boards and I feel like that\u2019s one of the most important parts of our business is managing liquidity, especially in the open-end 40 Act type funds.","Patrick Davitt","Thank you.","Kenneth Lewis","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please go ahead with your question.","Robert Lee","Great, thank you and thanks for taking my questions. Just going back to the DOL and just maybe kind of feels like beating a dead horse a little bit, but you talk a lot about the impact on the fund business, but if there\u2019s going to be a movement to advisory, presumably that should increase demand for the SMA business.","So I mean that\u2019s not a part of the business that I think in the past you\u2019ve talked about much. Can you maybe update us on how you feel your position maybe with \u2013 in the SMA part of the retail world and that\u2019s a place where you feel like maybe you need \u2013 also need to make some changes or some investment?","Tom Regner","Yes, this is Tom. So that\u2019s a good observation. We\u2019ve actually added to the SMA business. It had been kind of a \u2013 if you will a quiet part of the retail business, but we\u2019ve added to it over the last two years. We\u2019ve moved into our private wealth division because we think that there is a big role for that in the high net worth part of our business. And we\u2019re working on adding some ESG screens to that part of the business as well, because we\u2019re seeing that as a kind of an increasing demand in the high net worth business. So good observation, we\u2019re building it up.","Robert Lee","Okay. And then also sticking to the DOL, I mean I hear different things from different advisors and different managers, obviously you\u2019re going to have to have a level field setting and for doing it back and all that, but one of the things that seems to people different pains on is what [indiscernible] things like platform fees inside the revenue share I mean. So what\u2019s your current thought, do you think that in many cases distributors won\u2019t be able to charge platform fees or some argue it\u2019s going to go up others just going argue it\u2019s going to away. So what do you kind of hear?","Gregory Johnson","All of the above. Yes. That\u2019s why I really \u2013 it\u2019s almost daily on some of different opinions on whether how do you retain it or how do you have a level platform fee across different groups that have different perspectives with different levels and different asset levels and how do you include or exclude the ETF that wouldn\u2019t have that ability. There\u2019s all kinds of issues that are still being worked through between and that\u2019s why I had to sit and say well it could cost us more, it could cost us less. I would answer, yes, because I\u2019m not really sure at this stage, we\u2019re working through it. Tom, do you have anything to add?","Tom Regner","I mean that\u2019s a great point. We have one very large client, so they are not going to take any revenue sharing post at April and any new assets they put in the books. And we have another large clients that now they\u2019re going to continue to look at revenue share as part of the business. So we\u2019ll see how it plays out.","Robert Lee","All right, great. And if I could just maybe one more quick question. On the ETF business, I mean you\u2019ve been investing in it and you\u2019ve touched on I think in the prerecorded call about it, another place you want to continue to invest. So how are you \u2013 from outside looking in how are you think about ultimately what kind of landmarks that we should look for success in that.","I mean do you kind of feel like to you this is \u2013 we think we can really scale this quickly or that it\u2019s kind of a slow build and it\u2019s hopefully five plus years when you\u2019ll see an impact. I mean how are you thinking about whether you\u2019re going to be successful or not over the next couple of years.","Gregory Johnson","I think it is a slow build, I think part of it was just getting in the business understanding the business and getting the right people that can operate a very different product in a very different skill set then what we traditionally have. I think that has been we would call that a success of having a very strong team in place and it\u2019s really building from here and recognizing any new funds or ETFs that we rollout will take time. So it\u2019s really about building shelf space awareness and I think we continue to do that, and Tom, if you want to add any thoughts on that?","Tom Regner","Yes. So to Greg\u2019s point, we\u2019ve added significantly to the ETF distribution team and they\u2019re working with our 100 or 90 to 100 wholesalers to leverage up them as subject matter expert, so that's on the building brand part of the business. But we\u2019re quite excited to be able to have \u2013 you will hear them we are going to be building out more of our strategic beta platform because we want an advisor to be able to come to Franklin Templeton and we want to be able to build a portfolio that is either fully active or is partially strategic beta, partially fully active frankly are agnostic, we want them to be able to come to us to build out a fully featured, fully diversified portfolio, so as it we\u2019re all in on that initiative.","Gregory Johnson","And expanding it outside the U.S. too as part of the initiative, which will take time.","Robert Lee","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Brennan McHugh Hawken","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First on DOL, can you \u2013 is the idea that you\u2019ve got some upward expense pressure next year on technology. Is that a function of the indications of working with your distribution partners and as they make those changes to level pricing and some of the adjustments that you need to make to your own system and therefore that piece is somewhat inflexible?","Gregory Johnson","I think it is not so much that it\u2019s other projects and initiatives that are underway. Particularly in the part of the business that does things like fund accounting and pricing and all that. I think that\u2019s we\u2019re trying to invest in technology to make sure that we can scale that going forward and support all of the \u2013 all of the product demands that are out there in the industry. So it\u2019s more of that unless really of the DOL. I mean we think we have a lot of share classes. We think that we can do that with just incremental spend but not too much.","Brennan McHugh Hawken","Okay. Okay thanks for that. And then appreciate it must be pretty hard to manage all the different distribution partners and all the different approaches. But as you have those discussions and it seems firms are becoming more and more clear in what it is that their policies are here in recent times. Do you have an update to the amount of AUM that you think is exposed to this rule and as you\u2019re having discussions with distribution partners. Are you seeing any of those partners actually have an impact in the current iterations and in the prep for the current rule on assets beyond just retirement accounts? Thanks a lot.","Gregory Johnson","I mean I\u2019ll just start by saying this rule puts all assets in a different place because again I think I\u2019ve said this before, but the thought that you could \u2013 you can run one pricing structure under retirement and then have the other business at a different pricing structure creates all kinds of problems as well. So I think many are just thinking about moving to one standard at some point. Now again there\u2019s different philosophies on that in different phases and so it\u2019s hard to say X percent, but I\u2019d start by saying all of it. At some point this will, is a game changer for the traditional way funds are priced. And Tom, do you want to\u2026?","Tom Regner","Yes. I think that you\u2019ve seen Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan, I think today Commonwealth came out and they said look we\u2019re going to treat the non-retirement business exactly like we\u2019re treating the retirement business because it\u2019s just too complicated to do something different. We\u2019ll see if that trend continues, but it\u2019s likely to if you think about it especially dealing with the same customer with their retirement assets and then their non-retirement assets and trying to explain to them why there's different pricing.","Brennan McHugh Hawken","Okay. And then any update to the AUM exposed?","Kenneth Lewis","No actually I don\u2019t - I think I mean to Greg\u2019s point, we're going towards an environment where I think it's all exposed. There's going to be very little difference between retirement assets and non-retirement assets just because it's just going to be difficult and I think someone asked the question and perhaps it was you about the technology associated with trying to keep track of all of this.","It's much more difficult for the broker dealers than it is for Franklin Templeton. So when they look at the cost of the administration of two different buckets of business. I think they're coming to the conclusion that we're going to have one bucket of business and leave it at that.","Brennan McHugh Hawken","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, but appreciate how difficult it is given how things are moving, but appreciate the color.","Kenneth Lewis","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","John Dunn","Hi. This is John Dunn in for Glenn. One more on repatriation. Let's say it did happen, about how much would you say spoken for and how much is deployable at this point?","Kenneth Lewis","Yes. Well, I think that $8 billion or so maybe $6 million is international or outside the U.S., well all that\u2019s deployable that remains to be seen, but the bulk of it should be.","John Dunn","And then just one more on cash. With the amount you guys have, I would think that 100% payout could go for a long time. Is that a fair characterization and what might your willingness to do that would be?","Kenneth Lewis","Well, keep in mind that we do \u2013 we paid our 100% of consolidated net income, but part of that is earned outside the United States. So that's sustainable indefinitely. I don't think it's sustainable indefinitely, but we certainly have flexibility in terms of the ability to raise capital or just other things.","John Dunn","Gotcha. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks very much. Thanks for all the color on the Department of Labor. It's really good. Maybe just another one on that, obviously a lot of confusion we're hearing that as well. Just as you think is from a timeframe perspective. Do you sense that things will be pretty well buttoned down by year-end and advisors will be in a position to sort to make decisions about where they want to allocate and all the difference will have everything to wind up even if we do have two different ends or two different spectrums say by year-end or do you think this will go on for a while. And then Tom also maybe just what you're hearing from the wholesalers about the broad desire for advisors to move \u2013 to pass their products from active?","Tom Regner","Let\u2019s start with the last part of the question first. As you move to an advisory business model, if you're charging 1.5%, you want to make sure that the underlying investment fees are if you will cost effective, right. So there is \u2013 as Greg\u2019s pointed out, there's a heightened interest in management expenses and that's going to continue that\u2019s one of the reasons that we launched our strategic beta lineup because we want to be able to play in more of an active space within the retail business.","What we're seeing from advisors is frankly there's a lot of confusion because a lot of advisors have built a commission based business and that's where you're selling a product to a client. Now they're being looked at as having to or being required to build portfolios. That's a very different business model. That's a very different skill set. So we're working, again we're doing extensive training internally to be able to work with advisors to help them with that.","And as Greg pointed out, we started building out our investment platform team seven, eight years ago because the platforms if you will, the gates research, gatekeepers become even more important, more powerful going forward. So we're working on it from both ends.","And I do know just attending meetings, summer meetings with our clients that they've been working on this for quite some time. They are not standing still and I think many of them and you're starting to see the announcements are coming out with here's what we're going to do come April. So a lot of them have started to make those decisions already.","Brian Bedell","Great. Just another question on the expenses. Ken you mentioned on the fund accounting side that you're reinvesting in that area? Have you looked at that versus outsourcing it and are you committed to non-outsourcing it at this stage?","Kenneth Lewis","Yes. We have definitely looked at that and we probably every five or six years look at it again and again. And the conclusion historically has been the same and currently right now we think it makes more sense to do it ourselves and I would say the biggest determinant of that is our existing cost structure.","So as you know we have extensive operations in low cost jurisdiction and so when we compare the cost of doing it ourselves to what do we cost for outsourcing it makes economic sense for us to keep it insourcing. So that's the current thinking, but as you know things change outsourcing companies get more efficient. So it's a continuous evaluation.","Brian Bedell","Great. It sounds like for now you're keeping it in-house and certainly\u2026","Kenneth Lewis","For now yes that's our conclusion.","Brian Bedell","Okay and then maybe just last one for Greg. Obviously the acquisition question is always asked especially in this type of environment, but I mean as you think about the types of firms that would be interesting. Just from a strategic standpoint. Would something that enhances your distribution capabilities which are already extremely large and build out different types of products, would that have a preference over say a rationalization and scale type of acquisition where you'd be combining funds into say merging weaker performing funds into stronger performing ones to get the track records and looking at more like a cost synergy play.","Gregory Johnson","Yes, I mean I think obviously there's a lot more opportunities to go out and just target a strong investment manager and bolted on to your existing distribution system and that's one that certainly in markets that we've talked about before and you know the pound so weak that makes the UK more attractive market despite Brexit we see that as a more of a near-term opportunity to acquire something that that would be you know additive to our lineup and strengthen our presence in a market where we don't really have a strong presence in the U.K.","Outside of that I think the others become much more difficult and you know a larger one. That is much harder to do and much more disruptive obviously to the entire organization, but one that you know in the right situation again is something that we would certainly look at but I think it is much more difficult to execute.","Brian Bedell","Great. That\u2019s great color. Thank you.","Gregory Johnson","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Harris","Thanks. We\u2019re looking at your hybrid category here, I mean redemptions have improved substantially, but sales keep ticking lower. It\u2019s kind of interesting that that\u2019s happening because performance is improving so much. So you can talk about that a little bit. What is going to take to get sales going here given the performance already seems to be improving quite nicely?","Gregory Johnson","Yes, I think was exactly the question I had to our group early this morning when I was like going through some of the numbers I thought that stood out on hybrid gross dropping and there are some other moving parts in that number is actually the Franklin income fund, its gross sales were exactly level quarter-over-quarter despite that the number of hybrid declining it had almost exactly the same level of gross and that\u2019s the key driver that some other parts in that, I mean K2 falls into the hybrid category and that had a little bit of a drop off quarter-over-quarter. So that contributed to the gross number dropping down.","But I think it \u2013 we are very optimistic that that fund should continue to be a strong driver of outflows in this kind of environment and I think it takes a little bit of time for people to realize that it\u2019s back in the top decile for the one-year and you have a lag effect of energy prices and what that did to a lot of funds and I look at across the lineup and I am very encouraged right now.","I think we talked about in the past as a value, with a value discipline, you tend to get more energy exposure than sometimes the market and a lot of that has come back along with materials and whether it\u2019s our high yield area, the income fund area and hybrid, Templeton area and Mutual Series all of our rising dividend fund, all those funds now are performing very well.","So I would hope that we will get some momentum back now on the strong one-year numbers and actually our hybrid and equity assets, 75% of them are in the top two quartiles for the one-year. So I think that\u2019s a big change from where we were six months ago.","Christopher Harris","Got you, okay. And then a quick one on DOL, I think when we all think about those risks, we tend to think about in terms of flows. But just wondering whether you guys think ultimately this rule might force a management fee changes across the industry?","Gregory Johnson","I think I try to answer that, before that I think the pressure on fees is there. I think those components of your overall fees, which are in a state of flux and you can look at parts like the revenue share piece in it, you do away with that that\u2019s going to make it a little bit easier to lower overall management fees and make you more competitive on that basis.","Other areas, I think distributor retention, the historic number that actually was going away anyway over time. But that goes away immediately if you give a pricing at the broker dealer level in these new class of shares. But as the world was transitioning more to advisory, the traditional A share was getting smaller and smaller as part of our business, so that changes as well. TA fees all of those things, sub-TA fees all of those are again in a state of flux. So I think it\u2019s early, but just to say that it puts everything kind of in play at this stage.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks. Just want to see if you have any early thoughts on how the global bond fund, your new products and also K2 share with the new highly liquid invested in the SEC\u2019s new liquidity risk management role?","Gregory Johnson","Yes. I mean I think that\u2019s a good question and I think our initial reaction is it should be okay, but I think again it\u2019s too early for us. This just came out. We\u2019re assessing it. And I think that\u2019s the obvious one you\u2019re going to look at and see how it works, but too early to really give you a definitive answer one way or another.","Craig Siegenthaler","And just as a follow-up, how much that excess cash is sitting in the U.S. right now?","Gregory Johnson","Excess, I think we\u2019re roughly in total about $2 billion and maybe $1 billion excess.","Craig Siegenthaler","All right. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question has come from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Cyprys","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious if you could talk a little bit about how you see pricing evolving product management as more and more assets shift to lower fee passive price products and DOL going into effect. We\u2019re seeing price cuts in ETFs business there to drive more flows to the ETF player. How do you think about the price elasticity of demand for active massive products?","Gregory Johnson","Well, I think it depends on how you\u2019re performing against the passive. I think you\u2019re never going to be passive on price is the consensus view like it is today that passive will outperform that\u2019s not a view I share and I think in the next decade, I think active do very well. And then if you outperform the passive pricing becomes less of an issue.","But I think the world is overly focused today strictly on price and isn\u2019t really looking at anything else and I think that will change as well. But again as I\u2019ve said before I think any industry that\u2019s slower growth and has a lot of managers out there is going to be continued pressure on pricing, but an active manager you\u2019re not \u2013 if the consensus view is passive is a way to go, you\u2019re not going to increase your business by cutting your fees in half, it\u2019s just you're not going to get there.","Michael Cyprys","And then are there any areas that you could speak to today where you\u2019ve reduced fees or put any waivers in effect and then just how you're thinking about the opportunity and interest for repricing act maybe in some structures with pay for performance perhaps using some sort of Fulcrum freight.","Gregory Johnson","I think you are absolutely right. I think that you have to be more flexible that\u2019s something we certainly are doing in the institutional market right now, we\u2019re looking at new categories for us and coming with more of a performance based type fee because I think that fits what people are willing to do that will pay for more alpha.","I think that the openness to consider those something we have to do right now because of the consensus view you know on passive versus active. So I think that that is something that we are studying as well on just making sure our fees are competitive in markets and whether that means cutting into profits to maintain share, I think that\u2019s that something you have to consider.","Michael Cyprys","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of William Katz with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your questions.","William Katz","Okay. Just two follow-ups and thanks for taking the extra one. Tom if you comment \u2013 I will just move on that specific angle. Could give us a sense what the mix of your assets are between brokerage and advisory, if you have that kind of look through lens just given [indiscernible] on the bus and so curious given most likely going for the rotation to an advisory and brokerages. What kind of sort of money most we might be talking about?","Kenneth Lewis","Well, the large majority of our business takes place without a commission. I mean, this has been taking, this trends has been taking place for a number of years, now it's accelerating under the DOL. So frankly we're almost there. As Greg pointed out, there's going to be a new share classes and less breakpoints and some other changes, but the business overall. Franklin Templeton\u2019s business and the industries business has been moving towards \u2013 on the bus and no load.","William Katz","Okay. And Greg just sort of speak by your comments about the UK market, so when \u2013 the news mentioned that's maybe particularly more interesting given the currency dynamic. What kind of framework are we talking about? We are talking about a market extension type of transaction, consolidation and some of the redundancies or could you be wanted by something out from a parent that might have a majority stake in a third entity?","Gregory Johnson","Those all sound attractive. And I think we continue to look at anything that would make sense and I wouldn't rule out any of those different scenarios.","William Katz","I mean just one follow-up to that, in terms of size just given that where you are. Is a [merger of equal] is something that makes sense strategically or is it more of a fill in, maybe something that make more complimentary to your platform?","Gregory Johnson","I think I spoke about that earlier that the merger of equals is difficult for a lot of reasons especially as you get this big, but they can be \u2013 that are done and executed properly they could add a lot of value over time. The easier one is just going out and buying a strong player in the market. That\u2019s available, that's not always easy to do, but specific to that market that would be attractive to us. But again, I just wouldn't rule out any of those scenarios.","William Katz","Okay. Thanks very much for your patience.","Gregory Johnson","Thanks.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. It appears to be end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.","Gregory Johnson","Well, thank you everyone for participating on the call. And again, we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you."],"10053":["Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN) Q3 2013 Earnings Call July 29, 2013 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and Member of Special Equity Awards Committee","Kenneth Allan Lewis - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting officer and Executive Vice President","Analysts","Michael S.

My name is John, and I'll be your conference operator today.","Statements made in this conference call regarding Franklin Resources Inc. which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.","These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the risk factors and MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. [Operator Instructions]","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Hello, and good morning, everyone. Joining me is Ken Lewis, our CFO. Hopefully, you all had a chance to listen to the commentary we made available earlier this morning.","But to quickly recap, we're pleased to report another strong quarter of operating results despite the headwinds that arose during the quarter. Long-term net new flows were $7.4 billion, and operating income was a record $772 million. Importantly, overall investment performance remains strong.","Now we'd like to open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Kim from Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First, Greg, I know on the prerecorded call, you kind of talked about the outlook for maybe a gradual shift in favor of equities, and you spent a fair amount of time walking through the differentiating factors for your global fixed income franchise, assuming rates continue to rise. But just wondering if you could walk through your thinking as it relates to maybe a potential trade-off playing out between maybe a step-up in demand for some of your equity income strategies versus higher redemption risk on the fixed income side of the business.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think you probably summarized it correctly. I mean, one, the Great Rotation, I mean, I think first of all, you have to remember that buyers prefer fixed income for specific reasons than prefer equity. And some of the different time horizons and demographics are shifting. So it's not just all of a sudden, you move from fixed income to equities. But you will see a shift certainly on the margin. And I think like most right now, with equity stronger, we're still seeing increased interest on the equity side. And certainly, with the Hybrid funds that have been stronger here lately and continue to grow in interest as a way to participate in a little bit of both, and that may be a nice entry point. But I think as far as the fixed income investor that's afraid of duration, you're probably going to see a Great Rotation more into shorter-term money funds, and I think you are seeing that happen. And then maybe over time, that could rotate into equities. But I don't think it's just a simple from a fixed income jump into equities. But with that said, I mean, at the end of the day, looking at the fear of rates going up and where else can you put your money with interest rates this low, I mean, I think it has to be a bullish case for equity certainly here in the short run. That, that should continue to grow with less alternatives. And as we mentioned, looking at our fixed income franchise, global bonds, if anything, this rise in rates highlights how duration risk is not as sensitive to this portfolio. And we've always talked about it as more an alternative category. Currencies are going to be the main drivers of alpha, not interest rates, not duration. And having a 1.5-year maturity in those funds has served it very well. So we've been positioned for this with the majority of our fixed income assets, but the other one, certainly munis, anything with longer duration, will continue to be under pressure.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then second question for Ken. You mentioned on the call an expected sort of seasonal step-up in expenses looking out to the fiscal fourth quarter. So just wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of the step-up maybe on a percentage basis, year-over-year or in terms of absolute dollars and anything incremental.","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Well, it's the best estimate, I guess, I wouldn't put too much compass [ph] on the accuracy. But a couple of things that I think are worth highlighting, on the comp side this quarter, we're probably about -- the variance of about $10 million was due to a couple of things. The first one was the payroll taxes, and that decreased. But then, also, a large part of the variance this quarter was due to the reduction in valuation of the long-term awards for employees that are a function of either mutual fund prices or BEN [ph]. So that kind of gives you some color on the comp line. The other expenses, I guess, my best guess is about 1% or 2% up for the quarter. But as I mentioned, that's just seasonal adjustments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Katz from Citi.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just maybe, Ken or Greg, in your prepared remarks, in the prerecorded call, you mentioned that your payout ratio relative to sort of repurchase and dividends was a little bit low this quarter. Wondering, given the split, what your thoughts are on incremental repurchase versus dividends at this point in time.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Can you repeat the last part of the sentence?","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just what your priorities are for free cash flow given that the payout on earnings was a little bit soft this quarter.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, I wouldn't say that you're going to see a big change in our strategy. I think it's reasonable to assume, given the stock valuation, that in the short term, we're going to see a pickup in share repurchases. But overall, no real change.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And second question is, you called out both some wins and some losses on the equity side of the portfolio. Could you give me maybe a couple of sentences on the sort of the details behind those lumpy account wins and losses? And then maybe more broadly, what you're seeing in terms of the institutional pipeline for new business into the new quarter?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes. We had -- there was one large insurance redemption that affected 3 retail funds. It was about $1.6 billion, and $720 million was in mutual shares, $500 million in Templeton growth and $500 million in the income fund. So that was the large one that went out there. And then we had some larger wins on U.S. fixed in Taiwan, another -- and then some large additions to existing accounts in Asia as well, one into a Chinese mandate, another a Shariah mandate. Other than that, nothing -- I think just more in the 100 to 200 in and out range. Those were the larger ones.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. And broader question just being -- sorry I'm asking 2 questions. Yes, but the broader question is, in terms of the pipeline into the new quarter, what are you seeing in terms of demand?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I don't think anything. I mean, the pipeline looks strong, and we've had some nice fundings already to date in the new quarter. So I don't think anything's changed from the disruption in the market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","You mentioned on the call that redemptions in July broadly subsided. I guess, if you could talk about the gross sales kind of aspect of that, as well as if it was the same funds that were heavily being redeemed, if there's been any change in terms of demand, just on the more shorter-term basis.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, again, I'll speak in generalities because that's what we do as far as the forward quarter and what is happening now. And like the market, I mean, when things settle down, obviously, the spike in rates and how that affects the longer-duration funds, I mean, I think those continue to be under pressure. Municipal bonds, because they've kind of been in a perfect storm as far as policy and some problems in the market, with Detroit, obviously, that continues to put pressure on the municipal bond market. But overall, I think the funds that had the highest redemptions, and for us, on the equity side, was the Asian Growth Fund. So as things settle, that tends to be a fund that comes back faster than others and tends to -- and redemptions increase pretty quickly when you have a selloff in those markets. So that would be one. And global bonds on a relative basis, again, you had the backup. But we've had excellent performance and very strong prior month for that strategy. So I think that, that helps that hold assets and stem redemptions as well.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then another just question on the buyback. Is there -- was there anything that happened in the quarter? Were you restricted at all as to why, if we look kind of on a historical basis, the numbers, either this quarter or even kind of year-to-date, look lower than previous?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","No, I have nothing really important to highlight. I think I mentioned, and maybe it was misunderstood last quarter, it's tough -- sometimes it's tough for us to execute our plan, but it's not a change of philosophy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier from BofA.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And maybe one follow-up on just the fixed income business. You mentioned just a pickup in redemptions, I think you said maybe 50%. Not wanting to focus too much on like month-to-month, but did we see sort of that same level of moderation in July? And Greg, just when you think about the longer term, yes, it seems like when you guys give the description of the fixed income business in terms of global, focusing on currencies and credit, less rate-exposed, all that makes sense. I'm just trying to get an understanding from a client standpoint, are you seeing a decent amount of differentiation among fixed income products? And maybe it's just too early to tell, but it seems like all those are setting up in the relative performance for Franklin to stand out well, but I think there's the issue or the risk that just fixed income gets painted as an asset class. I just wanted to see if you're starting to see some differentiation there.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I think that the answer is yes. I mean, I think you're absolutely right that it does get painted as fixed income, and probably a lot of investors feel that they have more exposure to rising rates than they do. But the other point is that, in that fund, when you have a selloff of risky assets and a stronger dollar that we've had, that's going to put pressure on that fund as well. So those are other factors that happened in that time period. In a flight to quality, as much as rising rates, it'll put pressure on the global bond strategy. But we do think it is a nice way to diversify a portfolio. And I think you're absolutely right, that it will be highlighted by the relative performance going through the cycle versus some other funds that have that longer duration. But it remains to be seen how quickly, and we've seen -- we went through this cycle before, but the difference this time is that we've had very strong performance through it, where the other one, we had short-term underperformance. And I think that, that strong relative performance should create stickier assets pretty quickly.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, you mentioned on your -- the prerecorded comments just on Mutual Series, some of the dip in the short-term performance given their strategy. Anything of concern there, or is it, as you said, the typical strategy, when the markets are going up, it'll underperform, but over time, you expect that to pick back up?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes. I mean, to me, it's really more about how Lipper and how they're measured against the peer group and the S&P. And historically, the Mutual Series funds, one, have always owned a fair amount of cash relative to -- and that's part of their strategy how they buy in dips. And they have exposure to Europe in many of the funds, and that exposure has not served it very well versus the U.S. And certainly, with the stronger dollar, that's another -- it creates a little bit more headwinds. But more recently, Europe now is starting to outperform, had a very strong July. That's helped Templeton and Mutual Series. So I think it's -- for us, it's always important to just talk about the philosophy and how they run money, and it doesn't fit neatly really into any bucket. And sometimes, you will have underperformance. But if there's nothing there that's inconsistent with how they built their returns, over time, it's just cash in Europe, and that's what we've always had in those funds.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the $1.7 billion redemptions from the U.S. life insurance company. Can you help us provide any of the reasons behind why they redeemed and why it was the 3 different strategies?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, I think if you look at that entire business in the variable annuities, having gone through the drop in markets, '08, '09, and how they priced and have to prepay commissions and then earn those back over time, that there's a big risk to the insurance company, if they can't measure and hedge. So you have any active manager that doesn't fit neatly into a way to hedge that risk has had challenges. And that's why the managed volatility funds have done much better and taken up some of the slack in that product, and that area hasn't been the kind of growth that it's had for that reason. So for us, it wasn't really a performance issue. It was more about the insurance company changing how they manage their risk overall, and that active managers have been under pressure there.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just one follow-up. You closed international small cap growth and the Frontier fund in kind of this quarter. I'm wondering are there any other very successful strategies that could be close to either a soft or a hard close in the coming quarters here that we should focus on?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","No. I think those were the 2 that had grown quite a bit. And we've told the market, as we raised capital in those funds, that at some point, they would be closed. But I don't see anything else right now that is nearing that decision point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So in your prepared comments, you mentioned a little bit how fixed income markets tend to be self-healing over time. Just wondering if you can maybe expand on that topic a little bit more, and just kind of really wondering how like maybe in prior cycles how long it took for investors to actually come back to the fixed income class as interest rates were rising.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, I think it's important, again, to go back to why people invest in fixed income and the difference of equities. I mean, equities tend to look backwards on performance. Fixed income, somewhat backwards, but also, you have this dividend yield -- or you have the current yield, which is there every day and attracts new buyers. Take municipal bonds, a very inefficient market in terms of liquidity sometimes, and you get very strong relative yields when you have market disruption. And that attracts an entire new buyer into munis, and it's the same, you have fixed income, you want to match liabilities. As rates go up, you have new buyers that will do that. So I think that's a big difference. Now if the perception is rates are going to just continue to rise every day, then that's a little bit different. But remember, it kind of steps, and you'll have periods where that's the best guess of where the market is at that point, and people get attracted to higher yields as they go up. And I think that's very different than equities, which has more of a psychological effect and just net negative news coming every day on economic growth and things, tend to just put a damper on that. So I think it's a very -- it's just very different, and fixed income just has a very steady buyer that tends to always be there.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. A follow-up question then on the equity side of the business. The last couple of calls, we had talked about financial advisers being a little bit slower to come back to the Franklin product. I'm wondering if that behavior has changed at all, whether you're starting to see a little bit more uptake by financial advisers selling your products.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think we are. I mean, I think the -- certainly, some of our funds continue to do very well. And as I mentioned, I mean, anything for a little bit of yield, or Hybrid, is doing very well. We have a Templeton Global Balance Fund, which is new, was up 50% this quarter. It's had very good relative performance. Again, a nice way to get a little bit of the global bond side, plus some of the Templeton equity in that. So you are seeing this Hybrid balance category continuing to grow. And that's, again, as investors want to get more equity exposure, our rising dividends fund continues to be a top seller for us on the equity side. So I think we're still very encouraged on equity flows. And I think, again, like the industry in the past month or so, are doing better as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Luke Montgomery from Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So Templeton Global Bond Fund's predominantly been a retail product. I think, historically, the international bond asset class hasn't been a mandate institutions look to fill. I've been hearing that it's changing a bit. You mentioned you can kind of position it as an alternative strategy. So I was wondering if you might comment on the institutional demand for the product, and whether you think that could bring in some more strategic funding to the strategy.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I mean, it could. I still think emerging market bonds are an institutional category that we do fairly well in, in the marketplace, global ags, the other. So those are categories that we're very active in searches, and I've said in many calls in the past, that's an area where we think we can still get a lot bigger. So we are getting wins. We had some nice institutional wins here over the last quarter in that area, and I think it will be -- continue to grow.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then, Greg, you've taken over the Chairman role. I think some in the press and a few investors have asked why the firm didn't take the opportunity, on Charles' retirement, to consider maybe separating those roles. Perhaps just a comment to put that decision in the context of the firm or the board's philosophy on corporate governance.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think it -- again, that's something the board felt comfortable doing. I think it's certainly a factor that was considered in the decision. But we just think this structure is really aligned with shareholders, and there's no real issue there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So really helpful to hear about global bonds sort of direct exposure there, particularly U.S. rates being limited. This quarter, it seemed, though, definitely currency movement hurt performance, and currency movements are clearly impacted by rates. So is it possible to give investors color around how you guys view and manage that risk and how investors should think about it?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think there's many factors in what moves currency. And I think if you listen to our portfolio managers, they would say that probably duration loss is more permanent today than currency loss. And I mentioned that flight to quality, that a lot of money goes to the -- moves out of the emerging market currencies, for a few factors, obviously, over the last month. And that's similar to what we saw in the last selloff, but the difference with currencies is that if the long-term trends are in place, you'll get that loss back. Where I think the interest rate losses are more permanent in nature, it's going to be very difficult to have rates swing back down. But I think you're right. I mean, there's factors to consider, but it's relative rate moves by country, not overall pressure on rates moving up. And I think the other point with currencies is that unlike equities, you don't really rely on -- of course, you do, economic growth's important, but it's relative economic growth. You can still get alpha on a relative basis by just picking the right currencies, where fixed income, you need rates to stay stable or go down. You're dependent on that. In equities, you're dependent on overall economic growth and growth of earnings. So I think that that's a distinction that, certainly in this market, where there's headwinds on the other side, that is attractive to people.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And I also noticed that the proportion of U.S. cash ticked up here versus last quarter. I think it's at 38%. I think I saw it out of the Q. Now, is there a number that you guys want to drive that to, or do you think, not think about it in proportional terms but rather in absolute terms? Can you help us maybe think about how you're viewing that?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","No, that's right. We do think about it in absolute terms, and it's not something that, that's a target. It's obviously something that we monitor. But in absolute terms, the pie is getting bigger and this is enough U.S. cash to meet our needs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, just to call out global bond one more time. Is the franchise in redemption in July? I think it was in redemption in June. In your comments on the prepared remarks and to other people suggested that at least the growth redemptions have slowed, but I couldn't tell if the net had turned positive or not.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, that means I gave you the correct answer. We don't really talk about specific flows because I think we don't want people to make that assumption, that just because you're in a shorter period one way or another, that's where we're going to end up for the quarter. So I think I'm going to have to leave it that it's still under pressure, but better, and not get into exactly where we are to date on that.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe to follow up on Craig's question earlier. Can you talk about the variable annuity business you have? How much AUM do you have under management? And maybe, to what extent are those assets at risk, given the low vol strategies being employed by the life insurance companies?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes. I don't have that number in front of me. Probably, our Investor Relations could get that for you. I just think it's a pressure that's there, but I think it doesn't cover all of the assets, and certainly some -- many insurance companies are comfortable with their hedging strategies on existing active managers, it's just by group. So I, we can give you more color through Relations, but I don't have much here on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Kelley from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I was just hoping if you could -- going back to 2 questions ago, if you could kind of simply for us what portion of your -- roughly, what portion of your cash flow from operations is coming in the U.S. versus international currently, and how you think about how much capital you're returning to shareholders of the U.S. cash flow?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Well, we -- I'll start with the last part of that question. We look at the overall company's earnings, and that's our payout ratio. I mean, we do point out that dividends, taxes, et cetera, share repurchases come from the U.S. cash. Roughly, I think it's probably 60% non-U.S. generating, but that's kind of a guess, anywhere from 50% to 60%. And obviously, the non-U.S. cash component is growing. But we're going to continue to kind of maintain a capital policy that's been consistent with our historical. I don't really see any change to that.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then switching topics a little bit. I wanted to get a sense from you guys as to how the K2 acquisition has gone. If you could tell us what your end-of-period assets are on the K2 platform and how your flows are trending and what opportunities you see there.","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes. I think the integration's going well. One of the important points of the K2 is their process and their transparency. And I think some of our clients are finding that attractive. There's been a lot of cross-selling activity going on, and just everything's on track. Greg, you want to add anything?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, I just -- I think we've spent the last few months really educating our sales force, and we've seen the results already with increased RFPs and actually had a few wins to date from clients that are Franklin Templeton or have been existing clients. So for us, the next step is the retail side, and we're in the process of getting that ready. It's a new product area for us. So one that has taken a lot of, I think, pre-work, but we're getting close to offering their expertise in the 40 Act Fund.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Lee from KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Maybe just going back to the capital question, and I guess understanding that you guys have always liked to run conservatively with a lot of excess capital in different operating subsidiaries and taking into account a lot of your cash is offshore -- is outside the U.S. and it's also being generated there. But as that continues to grow, the non-U.S. cash, and that part of your business grows faster, how is that influencing how you're thinking about using cash in the U.S.? And obviously, you return most of your U.S. earnings through dividends or share repurchase, but how about -- because at some level, the cash held somewhere outside the U.S. is available in \"an emergency.\" So as those levels build, is there any thought to maybe thinking that, gee, I can bring the U.S.-held cash down to lower levels because I still have -- and maybe that translates into some increased buyback or whatnot. Just trying to get a feel for as the dynamics of the business kind of shift, how that's impacting your thoughts on capital management.","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Sure. Well, first I'd point out we did add a little disclosure in the Q this quarter about kind of -- we've always disclosed our discretionary uses for both U.S. and offshore cash in terms of seed capital and all that, and now we've added like what's kind of required by the regulatory and other kind of external factors, so you can get a better feel for that. I think it's something that we monitor. We know -- I don't think it changes. Like I said, it doesn't change our approach. We still think there's a lot of opportunities to use offshore cash, and just new product development is just one example of that. But looking forward, the business changes. The business changed, and we've done this in the past. We've taken advantage of the way products are managed, changes. And whenever we see an opportunity to bring back U.S. cash, we do so. The other thing to factor in is we always bring U.S. cash back that's been previously taxed in the terms of interest earnings. So I mean, that's a factor that helps out the equation as well. As we earn money on the offshore cash and we pay tax on it, we bring it back. So that's something that might be overlooked.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Great. That was helpful. And then secondly, maybe just going back to some of the expense items. I mean, I understand there's some seasonal increase that's coming. But in general, I mean, I guess there's been some pretty steady step up and whether it's -- well, G&A and I guess maybe some other places. I understand you're investing globally, but are there any specific projects or initiatives underway that's going to maybe keep some of the pressure on? I mean, I know you've put in place that new global shareholders servicing platform. I don't know if -- I mean, are there any legacy costs related to that, or are you starting to see that actually start having a positive impact on your expected expense growth?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","I think -- I don't think there's any -- there's nothing on the horizon that I can see that would be -- that would drive up expenses materially. We haven't talked about the sales and distribution expense. But we did add a little, a schedule on the back to give you an idea of what the net distribution expense is by both asset and sales type. And that might give you some insight as to operating margins and the various expenses we have from distributing the products. There's nothing, as I said, no major products that I could think of going forward. But we do we expect to leverage some of the investments we've made like the Riva platform and the low -- and our centers in low-cost jurisdictions. So I think that the work that we've done in that area kind of offsets any incremental new spending initiatives that we have, and that's what you've seen in the past. We have probably ramped up in the last couple of years. I don't know that, that level of spending will continue in the future. We're kind of having budget talks right now and trying to slow that down a little bit. So more to come on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Chiaverini from BMO Capital Markets.","David J. Chiaverini - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So I just want to follow up on the payout ratio. Looking over the past, going back to 2001, the average payout ratio combined is 78%. Do you guys -- you mentioned about getting back to historical numbers. Should we imply that you're going to get back to 75% to 80% payout from here?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes. So that is -- we don't focus on that as a target. We're just trying to give you guys some general idea, but I think that number is probably a little too high. I think when we're talking about historical, we might be talking about more recent historical experience, and that's more like 60% to 65% or 66%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Douglas Sipkin from Susquehanna.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just wanted to drill down a little bit on Templeton equity. And I'm just curious, obviously, the near and intermediate term is really, really good. I guess, the very long term is still a little bit lower. I'm just wondering, are there any platforms out there still penalizing you guys for the very, very longer term, i.e., is there an opportunity to gain some platform market share with Templeton equity given their very strong performance over the last 5 years?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I mean, I think every day, the performance improves. Obviously, the probability of improving your share and platforms improves as well. And I think if you look today, 1-, 3- and 5-year for Templeton now is very strong. 10-year is still lagging. But 10-year is a little less important than 3 and 5. So I think as we've said, again, in past calls, it's been a focus of ours to -- it's a flagship franchise in global equities, and we want to make sure it's right up there with everybody's first choice. So I would expect that to increase again. It just has taken a bit longer than we'd like. I think there's also some people specializing. We've seen places, like Asia growth, frontier markets, more specialty, China Fund. As people look to global equities, there's more differentiation, I think, than in the past. And maybe that doesn't fit exactly neatly into the Templeton strategy, but we feel like it's a big, growing and important place for us. It's going to continue to be a place of focus for the firm, and I think we -- our expectations are, especially after the very strong July, that it will continue to be a focus for us.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Great. And then just a follow-up on the balance, which continues to be very strong. I know you guys touched on it in the prepared comments about the global balance product. Can you maybe put a little bit more parameters around that, the size, the opportunity, et cetera?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes. I think in our terminology, you might be referring to the Hybrid category...","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes. Yes, that's correct.","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Another product, called the Templeton balance that Greg mentioned...","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, it's just the demand for having a little bit of both, that the 2 complement each other very well. The market's now very familiar with both strategies, and the demand's been there to kind of combine the 2. Again, a way for -- to somebody who's a little bit not comfortable moving 100% maybe into global equity is a way to get their toes in it with a percentage in that. So that's just an area that, like all Hybrid, we've seen increased retail demand. And I think that's going to continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greggory Warren from Morningstar.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","You guys touched on this briefly in your prerecorded call on the Mutual Series being down from performance level, but it's pretty dramatic from what we saw at the end of March to the end of June. And it just seems like it's got to be more than the large-cap value or value being out of favor and perhaps carrying more cash. And then I just had a follow-up on Templeton as to -- is there anything you guys feel you can do additionally to really generate sales within that channel, because it seems like it's ripe right now, that part of the market.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, again, I think mutual, the -- a couple of things. One, the deep value will tend to underperform in a rising market, and that's consistent with how they operate. I think you've had the headwind of a strong U.S. dollar for their European holdings, and then you had a very weak Europe during that period, which a lot of that, certainly Europe, is reversing and expect that to look better more in the near term for their results. But nothing -- those are -- that's enough to knock you out of your box on a relative basis over the last 4 or 5 months. So it's very consistent with how they operate in the holdings. There's nothing -- no bets there that look like that would have contributed to underperformance and the stock-picking continues to be strong. I think Templeton, it's a focus. It's been a focus for us. We talk about it quite a bit, and we do think it's probably one of the best near-term opportunities we have in terms of those flagship funds and getting the attention they deserve in the retail channels. We're going to keep pushing that, but it's been frustrating. But again, as those longer numbers get better, that's going to make it just that much easier.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Did you feel like there's some hesitation on the part, at least in the adviser channel, to put people into more active equities, and it's just a safer bet to put them into passive right now?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I don't think that's the case with global equities. I mean, I think possibly a little bit more with U.S. But on the global side, I think active managers continue to do well. I just think there's just more demand for more satellite-type offerings with -- on the retail side of regional funds and versus your just big global equity fund. So that's -- but our focus has been also to talk about global equity as the core holding and then build your -- and differentiate your holdings around it, instead of just having the big U.S. large-cap value or growth, but starting with Templeton, starting with the growth fund. And I think that, that is making progress as we see global equities continue to dig into share. But certainly, U.S. has been the strongest market here in the last few years. So that's not really helping that. But performance eventually is the lead, and that looks good. So I think that we're optimistic.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Hopson from Stifel.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I may have missed this, but have you, in terms of the global fixed higher redemptions, have you made any comments about the geography or distribution channel, anything that, in June in particular, as to where some of the higher redemptions came from? Anything that make, may be striking, as to potentially be an indicator of future flows? And then in terms of the -- some of the new disclosure, one of the pages said that 11% of the sales are commissionable sales, I guess, which seemed low. Can you comment on that as far as what's driving that in terms of movement to fee-based plans in the U.S., but also geography, and where would that number have been a few years ago?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes. That number really hasn't changed for us. We started to see changes like 10 years ago, perhaps, in that number coming down, but it's been relatively stable for us. It doesn't change that much. And that's the commission part of the question.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Okay, but I think you're right. I mean, I think that number, there is a movement around the globe and with things like the RDR moving front end and even banning front-end commission. So you'd expect to see that number lower and lower over time and more of a wrap approach. We haven't given any color, I think, on just trends around global bond redemptions because I don't think there's much to offer there. I think it's fairly spread across. No one area is a whole lot heavier than another as far as U.S. versus international or Europe versus Asia or anything. It just seems to be fairly spread across the board.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Freeman from Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just on the duration differential on global bond, do you -- has that been pretty consistent over time? I forgot what you just said on that. And did it decrease at all this past quarter?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I mean, I know it's been the theme of that management team that they were concerned about rising rates, and we were at a historically low level. I don't have the exact numbers as far as whether that has decreased over the last year. So I know it's been on for at least a few years, and it's been headwind in performance over that -- if you look at over the 3-, 5-year period. When rates dropped, that fund, from -- in that standpoint from attribution, was relative weakness against its peer group. And the difference today is it's helping. But I don't know if it's been -- if they've lowered that over the year or not, but it's certainly been the positioning of the fund relative to its peer group for a long time.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just in U.S. equity, I think you said in the prerecorded call that the flows would have been positive ex 3 redemptions there. I just -- can you quantify how much those 3 were? Was it basically a little over $1.2 billion to get it back over [indiscernible]?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I mentioned those just 2 of them that come to mind. You had about $720 million with that insurance redemption from mutual shares and $512 million from Templeton growth. So those were 2 large ones, and then the other one was the [indiscernible] fund.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Okay. Well, thank you for participating on the call, and we look forward to our call next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources' Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, good morning and thank you for joining our quarterly conference call. With me is Ken Lewis, our CFO. We're pleased with this quarter's results as flow trends improved, performance remained strong, and operating income increased. Our international retail business continued to gain traction as solid performance drove demand for many products globally. We implemented a new commentary format this quarter and we hope you found it useful and we welcome any additional feedback you have.","I'd now like to open up the line to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. In the pre-commentary, I read like the unusual items in G&A made it lower than it should be. If that's right, could you help us better understand the disclosure in the Q in terms of, I guess, what you consider the net amount of the unusual item impact?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Sure. I don't know that it was lower than it should be, but \u2013 and there were some \u2013 I would say, the net of the one-offs were maybe just $2 million, in that very small neighborhood. But I think, more importantly, what the question is going forward, what do we see? We do see a little upward pressure on that line item and some of the other line items, offset probably by the comp line item, which that compensation was a little bit high this quarter than run rate.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Then more broadly, there was some chatter last quarter about a wirehouse trying to force revenue share, kind of, across the board as they become compliant with DOL. What has your experience been on that front? And do you think it is settling out better or worse than maybe what you are paying before the DOL rule?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, we can only pay the limit in the prospectus, so that has created, I think, in some cases, a protracted discussion on how we get to a standard number. But I can't think of any case where we have not been able to work it out. And, again, it's maximum by prospectus, so it shouldn't increase with the changes.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. In terms of international equities, it's still a meaningful source of outflows. If it was just the U.S., the asset class, it's the one that seems to be working the best. So can you talk about your global equity business? If possible, give us a little more color on the continued weakness, really, in the gross inflows. Is there, sort of, region or client type? Or can you help us point us to maybe why that weakness, or why we're seeing this weakness compared to \u2013 like, prior to 2016, it seemed like that gross sales rate was at a more normal level. Thanks.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yes. I mean, I think that that is an area that we were hoping would turn around a little bit faster based on the performance. I think just a general statement first, just looking at the overall flows on global equity and, obviously, that was an area where we had over $6 billion in outflows. $3 billion of that was due to three accounts on the institutional side; the largest, a sovereign wealth fund, not performance-related but just reducing for cash needs there. And I still think getting back to the gross levels in any equity category is difficult, looking historical when you still have the pressure of indexing happening and replacing the traditional fund. But we have \u2013 the Foreign Fund has turned around to positive flows for the last two quarters. That's much better than where it was, but that category's not as large as the overall global equity category, and that's the important one that we need to see turn around for the Templeton Growth Fund.","So we, I think that the \u2013 and also part of the \u2013 still the value growth side and some of the headwinds there, but Templeton, for the first time, is getting a little bit of benefit from currencies, which we haven't had and that trend continues. And, obviously, the bigger positions in Europe and financials have helped quite a bit, too. So if you look back, we just got improvement in our star, the number of stars on those funds, and so it takes a little bit of time and, certainly, in the retail channel to get back to the kind of positioning you had, and that's really what we've been trying to do. And if the performance trends continue, we'll be successful there.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Any color on some of the non-U.S. parts of global? You've got a Korean business, you've got some business in India, like there's definitely different pockets outside the U.S. Is there anything there that is contributing to kind of what we're seeing as you aggregate the global equity AUM in commentary?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah, I think as I said before, I mean, I think certain markets get lost in the numbers, and if you just look at, for example, the India business at $800 million in net inflows for the quarter, very strong relative and organic growth there. Taiwan, $0.5 billion in inflows there. Germany, very strong as well. Asia, as a whole, about $2.2 billion last quarter inflows. So those are probably the standout countries in terms of where we're seeing good retail and institutional flows.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just one more. A number of competitors cutting fees to hopefully drive better sales. To what extent do you think reducing fees would help you either in international equities since you've just been talking about that or maybe more broadly across different areas of the firm?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think that's the big question for many firms. It's very hard for everybody to be in the lowest quartile of expenses. It's also very hard to compete with just straight market beta at two, three basis points. So if you can reduce from 50 to 30 and you're losing business to two or three, that's probably not a great decision. I think what we've tried to do is look at every category. We're doing that right now, working with our distribution partners and finding out if any asset classes that we have that are being priced out of the market that have competitive performance and that pricing is an issue.","I think most of our funds are on the lower side so we don't see that, but there are some that we think we probably will reduce. I don't think there's anything from a substantial impact at this stage, but like many, if the pricing side of the equation is much more important and you have to be competitive and that may mean some near-term revenue loss to continue to get share, and we've been doing really a review that we're in the middle of and are getting closer to probably reducing a few funds.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Again, just on some of the expense guidance that you gave, you mentioned just in comp that there was some severance. I don't know if you can size that just so we kind of get a better run rate?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","The were some nonrecurring items but also I think something important to keep in mind is due to the performance of the company and the increasing average assets under management, et cetera, we took a look at some of the variable comp components and adjusted our estimates of our liability there. In this quarter and since it's the third quarter of fiscal year, you pretty much have the whole year impact of that adjustment in this current quarter, so that had the effect of inflating the quarterly number a little bit. So that's something to keep in mind. Overall, as I said in the commentary, I think when you look at the comp line year 2017 versus 2016, we're looking at that to be down around 2% to 2.5%.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And then, Greg, just as a follow-up, just given a lot of the industry changes and trends that we're seeing, you guys have done some to try to \u2013 whether it's expand distribution, diversify products with K2 and ETFs, anything changing \u2013 I don't know \u2013 the outlook in terms of cash use and doing more on the M&A side. I guess, particularly just on the product side because I guess on the distribution, you guys have a lot. But just wanted to get your thoughts. Just given that we are seeing a lot of industry changes, if anything is changing in terms of priority of the cash?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","I mean, I don't think anything has changed as far as priorities. I think we're always looking to add strong investment teams that complement the lineup. I think, obviously, in the alternative space, we've talked about why that's not always easy to do. I think we'd like the high-net-worth and Fiduciary Trust, that business to grow so that's something that would move up the list on priorities for us. But overall, we continue to be very active in looking at everything and I wouldn't say the list has changed from what we've talked about before.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Generally, we've heard from some other of your peers about uptick in expenses and spend. And so, Ken, I wanted to get just kind of a thought around kind of the longer-term expense profile as you kind of start looking into next year, how we should think about maybe some initiatives that are going to be coming online, whether they're tech or other investments and how that might mean for the overall kind of expense outlook.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Sure, sure. So we are just starting our annual budget process so it is a little early for me to give you any definitive guidance with a lot of confidence. But I can tell you that we're really taking a hard look leaving no stone unturned, looking for ways that we can harvest expense savings to fund those new strategic initiatives. I could say, overall, from what I know today, I mean, it is looking like it will be a challenge next year to reduce next year's expense levels from the current levels. But beyond that, it's kind of too early to tell exactly, but I'll definitely have more for you next time we meet.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And just a follow up, Greg, on some of the international comments and success in retail. Obviously, the Global Bond seems like it's a big driver of that, but are there other products underneath that are seeing some of the benefits of the improvement in the broader kind of international retail segments?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, I think the other standouts in the last couple of quarters on the fixed income side \u2013 I mean, obviously, Global Bonds, it's a tremendous turnaround from where we were, where we had $2 billion in inflows for that category, where a year ago we probably had $7 billion, $8 billion in outflows, so we're certainly pleased to see that that's turned around.","The other areas, the floating rate was very strong and it's a little choppier because some of it, we get some institutional accounts in that, but especially as rates ticked up, that category, we've seen momentum, certainly in Asia. One of the big headwinds was Asia growth. That's turned around just as far as actually redemptions, and performance is very strong there. And the other one that has been a drag would be emerging markets, but very strong performance continues despite even growth outperforming value, but those funds have been well positioned through that. So those would be the areas that we're seeing strong interest outside of the U.S.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee of KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess the question I have is on the distribution front. I mean, as you've expanded your product range, obviously, there's the EPS (14:43) initiative and other products. I mean, there's only so many things you can kind of fit through any pipe, so to speak, and I don't get a sense that there's a lot of \u2013 you may trim your product line every now and then with small, underperforming things, but how do you kind of manage all these new initiatives, and getting in through your distribution and without kind of...","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Cannibalizing...","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Yeah, cannibalizing your existing products?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I think that's the question we wrestle with quite a bit, and to Ken's earlier points on some of the initiatives and funding that we need to do. Take distribution and ETFs, we probably need to continue to build out our ETF specialists and not rely on the existing retail wholesalers. And I think that's something that we've been out telling the story, but really feel like that's going to require a separate effort.","Now there would be alternatives and supporting that group versus just having a generic institutional sales group. I think the specialization in distribution is becoming more and more important, especially as there's more gatekeepers that expect that expertise and closeness with the portfolio management team. So that'd be another area that we think we're going to continue to make an incremental investment in. Because I think you're absolutely right, you cannot rely on one platform to sell all different products and have that same kind of credibility in the market.","We think that more specialization is required. That's an investment we've been making on the retail side as well, in building out more consultants and even bifurcating our sales teams for different types of advisors in the field, even in the same territory. So I think that the bar is being raised and we have to continue to specialize and focus the distribution efforts.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. And then maybe just a follow up on a capital question. I mean, I know every quarter, I believe, in the Q, you highlight the amount of your cash and investments that you have kind of set aside for regulatory and operational needs. And I don't remember the precise number, but it's roughly $3 billion or so. I mean, should we think of that as kind of the minimum that you kind of think you need on an operational basis? Or is it really kind of somewhat higher than that just because you might have other cash just in the event of transactions? Just trying to get a sense of what you feel is like your kind of your bottom-line can never go below this type number?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Okay. I'll try to answer that question. I didn't hear all the parts of your question, but I think I got the main idea. So right, so in our filings, we do highlight the minimum amount of cash in the U.S. and outside the U.S. that we feel we need for internal purposes, things that might come up, regulatory issues, amounts to cede, (17:56) new products, et cetera. The U.S. cash is approximately like $2.3 billion of that number.","I think we \u2013 say, we have $800 million that we going to hold aside for operational and regulatory requirements, and international, that's 6.3 and of that we hold about 2.2. So, I think your number of $3 billion is about right, and I think your characterization is also correct. That is the amount that we think we would need, kind of bare minimum, to have on hand. Keeping in mind also, though, that if we needed more money, we have the ability to borrow more money.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","And maybe just one last question. I believe you have some debt that's maturing pretty soon. Should we expect that you do pay that off? Or look to just kind of refinance that?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","The debt. Yeah, we do have debt maturing in September, and I think because of our strong financial position we have the ability to be opportunistic in what we do. Like I said...","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","And I think we'd add just, it also depends on the tax repatriation and how that shapes in the next few months based on what we would do there.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","And that's definitely a factor that we're considering.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Hi. Good morning, guys. I think in the prepared remarks you guys highlighted some institutional wins. I think it was roughly $2 billion on the international side. Can you elaborate a little more, I guess, which products that's coming in from? And anything else you're aware on the positives and the negative side on the institutional front so far in the quarter?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I think, first of all, it was very quiet from the standpoint of funding for the quarter, there were no significant one-time separate accounts coming in during the quarter, but we do have \u2013 we had some wins during the quarter that are funding now in this quarter, and that's what we mentioned it was $2 billion. And I believe most of that is in Fixed Income, Emerging Markets, Global Bonds and in the Global Bond category, most of that $2 billion.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. A couple of cleanup questions. I guess when we look at the fee rate, it looks like it's slipped out a little bit sequentially, just wondering given the fact that the global products just from a beta have done obviously better, and the currency probably were maybe a little bit more helpful. Just surprised we didn't see a bit of an improvement there. So maybe just peeling back the layers kind of what's going on, and the outlook for kind of the fee rate given where the business is today.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Could you repeat the question? Especially the first part.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Sorry. Just on the fee rate, excluding performance fees, if you just look at the management fee rate, looks like it's slipped out a little bit sequentially. So I'm just curious whether it's a mix or it's a currency issue or something like that?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I don't think there's anything noteworthy to call out there. Performance fees weren't that much this quarter really, and I think it's just a function of mix really other than anything structural.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just the last question. As we look out into 2018, with MiFID II obviously many of your competitors kind of commented on what they think the implication could be on the business given you're obviously a large global footprint. Just curious how you guys are thinking about it? And any incremental expenses we need to be thinking about related to MiFID II into 2018.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah, I think the question, obviously, around the unbundling and what does that mean, and I think, like everyone, we're still very much studying it and have a group committed to doing that. I think if it's narrow in terms of how it's implemented, it wouldn't have a very large impact on us. If it becomes more of a standard across the rest of the globe, obviously, we'll have a bigger one, and I wouldn't even want to estimate, at this stage, what that would look like.","I think, overall, as far as the regulations and complying with them and having new clean share classes in place, we are ready to do that and in compliance, and I don't see any real issues just aside from the unbundling and the uncertainty, and we know some have decided to pay for research directly, and that's something that we have not made a decision on one way or another right now.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe switching over to DOL, Greg, just your views on sort of the current tempo there given that we've obviously pushed out to the June implementation deadline and now maybe your views on where you think the best interest contract exemption ends up, and what you're hearing from advisors on their view on allocation between active and passive. And then sort of in conjunction with the comments you made earlier on the revenue share, are you seeing sort of pressure on your share classes there? Or do you think development clean shares will follow out of those problems?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","That's a lot of questions in one. I think, first of all, with DOL, we're in a comment period. It's a little bit quiet right now. People drafting responses to both the SEC and the DOL. Our sense is that the two now are talking and have been public in trying to work together. So our view is that the January 1 date will be pushed back. That'll be the goal, I think, of most in the industry to try to give time to have a thoughtful overall standard developed with the two groups.","And in terms of the BIC, in the best interest contract, I think having some level of higher suitability will probably be the outcome but not be as onerous as having a contract in place that creates issues. And then having the private right of action and some of the weaknesses in the current structure, we think that will be addressed in the future as well. And you also have momentum on the legislative front to do away with it completely. So I think that's still a possibility. But I think the more probable is the delay and then the two groups working to coming up with a workable standard. And I think everybody needs to go back and start with why are we doing this in the first place and then come up with an appropriate solution to that.","On the active\/passive, no matter what the DOL, where this all comes out, you have a move towards fee-based and you have to think about how that affects your business, affects your line up, puts pressure on expenses as there's more pressure around what the advisor is charging around that portfolio. So I think that that pressure continues one way, we'll continue regardless of where the DOL rule goes. And we talked about that earlier, just making sure your funds are competitive for as these platforms are narrower than the traditional one and may have a third or half of the funds available that were there before. So you have to be competitive on both the expense side and the return side there.","Revenue share, I think that's still probably one that has more uncertainty about where it ends up in the future. Some large advisors are adopting a no-revenue stance. Some are \u2013 have revenue sharing in, some are going to adopt clean share. So I think that'll \u2013 the market forces, where that prevails, I think it's too early to tell but I think it's going to be a difficult world where one adopts a clean share and another doesn't. So I think that that's more of a probable outcome over time that you'll move towards that clean share class.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. Okay. Great. And then just a big picture question on the M&A environment, just for the industry I guess. As you think about active performance generally has improved this year so far, do you see that fostering consolidation because the conditions have improved from a large manager consolidation perspective? Or do you think that actually creates a dynamic where there is less pressure on major players to consolidate? And how do you guys view yourselves as potentially merging with another big asset manager versus looking for more sort of small tuck-in acquisitions?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I don't think that there's been any kind of shift between active\/passive and how a large firm thinks of their business in terms of probability of consolidating. It's very hard to just say, well, put two big firms together and not hurt each of your businesses as you combine the two. So I think the other \u2013 the real story is on the small to medium and how, in this environment, the traditional \u2013 say you're a niche-active equity manager, the investment you need to make to be competitive and to stay on platform. As I mentioned, the narrowing of funds, the availability, and some of that's based on the size in the system, and because there are costs to have diligence and follow X number of funds, it's just harder and harder for the smaller player. Where they may have had relationships out in the field with specific offices, or branches, or whatever, it's just going to be hard for them to get the shelf space when it's channeled through one central gatekeeper.","So I think there's going to be more opportunities for those type of firms that have seen assets decrease, don't have the balance of fixed income and other categories that will need to sell or consolidate or become part of a bigger platform. But I think the larger firms being forced is more of a bear-market deal than it is an active\/passive question.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. It's great. Thanks very much.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much and I still have a bit of laundry list of questions for you. So first question, just going into the \u2013 fleshing out the expense dynamic a little bit. Just sort of wondering where you think you could still harvest some savings from as you think about next year? Because many of your peers are showing some pretty substantial year-on-year growth of expenses, even those that are very efficient themselves, and I say that as I look at your gross sales, which are relatively flattish, and by both region as well as I think by most asset classes. So how do you sort of jumpstart growth here? And do you need to sort of deepen the spend to get there?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, I'll handle the expense side of that. You know, as I said, I guess my comment was, no stone unturned. I think you are exactly right. It is getting more challenging to find expense savings because we are efficient. Our competitors are efficient as well. We do have, I think, a competitive advantage there with our presence in the low-cost jurisdictions, where we can do more investments in technology and things like that at a lower cost. So I think that is something that differentiates us.","But in terms of specific areas that we're looking at, it could be just things that \u2013 procedures and processes that we set up a long time ago for a specific business model. The business model has changed, so we're just questioning ourselves, do we need to do that process, or do we need \u2013 has business changed, where we could perhaps approach the problem differently. So things like that. I can't give you a specific quick hit list of things, which implies that changes will take a little bit of time to identify, and then to execute on them, but I still think there are opportunities in the organization to do that.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Okay. And then, just maybe...","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","And then, Bill...","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Go ahead.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Your question was what, on growth and jumpstarting what?","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Right. I mean, to me, it looks like \u2013 just to expand on my thought, it looks like your net sales, your gross \u2013 your redemptions were the driver to sort of the reduction for the most part sequentially in terms of the net outflows. And when I look at your gross sales, the good news is they've stabilized from where you were, maybe two, three quarters ago, but sort of flattish at the margin. And so, I guess I see some mix performance trends, good positioning outside the United States. You talked about pricing a little bit, which I want to come back to. So how do we think about really jumpstarting the growth on the gross sales side?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think if you look at just international, that a year ago was $6.5 billion in gross and its run rate now was 12.5 for the last quarter, so you can see that there has been a jumpstart there, and, again, many, many, very strong stories in a lot of regions and countries around the globe. I think the U.S., it's just been a much more difficult environment, where you would be seeing in a normal environment a pickup in those numbers, but because of what's happening in some of the transitions in the industry that we're all too familiar with, it's been harder to get the kind of rebound.","And it also, as I mentioned before, I think the key areas for us in jumpstarting, I mean, obviously the Global Bonds you get a little move in rates up and you saw how quickly that can change perception, being one of the few in that category that actually can show that it's done very well in a rising rate environment. I still think that that probability is real despite the consensus view that rates have to stay low and down.","We think it's one of the few real flagships that's well positioned for that. The Income Fund has had a huge rebound in performance. I'd say that's the one that hybrid category in a normal environment would be doing much better than it is, and kind of treading water right now, and part of that again is just due to some of the changes in the industry.","I think that the outside of that, we've had a history of innovation and doing new things, and I think when you say jumpstart, we think we have a lot of exciting things that, as Ken mentioned, that may require a little bit more investment, but that we think can jumpstart organic growth as well. And part of that is around the ETF side, the alternatives with K2 and the KMAP initiative, having a platform for distribution, those are the kinds of things that could jumpstart growth in the near-term.","And then I think there's been a lot of discussion around data and how we look at that and that's another area like many in our industry, and we think we're uniquely positioned with the Silicon Valley presence and relationships that our teams have here with technology companies and our India presence to do some exciting things there. So I think there's always \u2013 there's always going to be opportunities for new ideas in growth, and we've got many that we think are very exciting. But in the near-term, it's really making sure that we're well positioned with these changes in the U.S. retail and getting as much shelf space as possible and retaining assets as they transition from brokerage to advisory.","And the next question will be, what does that mean? What's the number? And I don't think any of us know that, but we want to capture as much as we can in that transition and that's really why the retail side, you just haven't seen the more normal rebound for the industry in flows.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then just one quick follow-up, thanks for taking all the questions. You mentioned that you're reviewing some of your pricing. Could you quantify the amount or dollar size of AUM that are at risk for the change? Risk may not be that word. And then where you are relative to peers in that re-pricing?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","I mean, first of all, as I stated before, I mean, we've always been on the lower side of expenses, and I think having gone through every fund in the last few months, I'm encouraged by where many of them do stand. There's a few outliers that we're looking at right now, and it's really weighing, like anyone, what the revenue impact and how distribution feels, that \u2013 how does this contribute to redemptions and how does it contribute to sales and modeling that out and understanding what we need to do in the near-term versus the long-term. And those are hard decisions but most of our \u2013 again, I would say all of our large categories are in pretty good shape as far as the expense ratios versus peers.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for taking all the questions.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Why do you guys think that institutional sales outside the U.S. aren't doing a little bit better? I know you've got a mandate that you're getting ready to fund but it just seems to me that it's a pretty wide disparity between the recovery we're seeing on the retail side of the business, institutional, and just not clear. Why that's the case?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I think the institutional, it's hard to \u2013 you get the \u2013 it's a little bit chunky and hard to kind of just look at and get any sense as to what the trend is based on quarterly numbers. And I think it was an unusual quarter in that you didn't have any significant findings for that. But as we've said, I mean, $2 billion coming in and that's I think was offshore institutional relationships that we feel like the interest is very strong on local currency, Global Bonds, Emerging Markets Bonds and we hope that that trend continues. But it is, you get $1 billion here, you get \u2013 it's just large chunky and hopefully this quarter will be a lot better than last quarter there.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And just bigger picture, what are your general expectations for your ETF initiative?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","As we stated before, I mean, it's a new line, you're not coming out and just coming with a low-cost passive, you're coming with smart beta and factors. And that's an education process that requires time, and we're committed to the business, we built a very strong team, and we continue to thoughtfully build that out. We just kicked off our Canadian ETFs, we're looking at Europe next. We know it's going to be an important part of our business over time, but like many initiatives we don't come out and state how big it has to be within a certain period to be successful.","We're operating them. We want to make sure that we know what we're doing first. And I think we feel pretty confident that we have the right team and resources and we're going to continue to build out the distribution side. But like any new product, it takes time to get on the platforms, and we've certainly been pleased over the last year as we've been out in the market for over a year that we're now getting on the major platforms. So, hopefully, that'll give some momentum on the retail side.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Just a follow-up on the institutional side. You noted that you have a new head of U.S. institutional. I wonder if you can just share just at the highest level what they'll be charged with doing. It doesn't include a broader fixed income build. Just curious from the top down, why the move? And what they're charged with?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, I think they're charged with raising institutional assets. That's pretty straightforward. But this person comes with a very strong background with consultants and so that's going to be very important. It's also very important to work with our teams in making sure that the process and how we articulate the process to the institutions is right. And I think that that partnership is something that we would hope this person would continue to build on, and I think that's going to help us on the retail side as well as the gatekeeper, as all of that, I think, becomes very intertwined in how we talk about what we do with investment management team.","So that person will take some time in looking at what we're doing and how we're doing it and probably have some input on some changes there as well. But it's just bringing in more experience to a team, and I think the overall business will benefit from that kind of talent.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","I know it bugs you a little bit in the past about it, but with such a great retail fixed income platform, would their responsibilities potentially include, if this client feedback is there, the consultant feedback is there, a broader institutional platform, on the fixed income side, specifically?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I think we are open again, as you know, to anything, and I think that person having that experience there and looking at what we do, we'd certainly listen to that if that was something that we feel we need to do.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Switching gears. I saw that Cryer versus Franklin got class status this week. I mean, I personally have strong opinions that the case won't hold water, and you can't be judged versus a passive fee on every product you put in the funds. But actually that's not the question. The question I have on that is, does a case like this making class status have the ability to influence behavior in the retirement channel in general and make people risk averse and just toss in the towel and go passive as much as that might be a terrible move?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","I don't think so. I mean I think this is an example of, to me, why the DOL rule is weak in its current state, that just extrapolate all these suits times every retirement plan. It's a trial lawyer's dream to have that, and our belief is that this case has no merit. Just about every firm has been sued that has their own funds in their own offering. So we're going to fight it and like you said, I think we believe that we're on the right side and did all the right things.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah, while I'm with you there. Last one is a tiny one on buyback. I heard all your comments on cash. Does a broader buyback get hold up on waiting on tax reform and repatriation specifically? Because use of funds kind of matters of whether or not you get to return the cash or not. There's a lot of people that would like to see a bigger buyback.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","No, I think, certainly, not in the short-term. If there is some tax reform that might have some impact, we'd have to wait and see the details of what that tax reform is. But in the short-term, I don't expect us to change our thinking on share repurchases.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. So more in line with current levels?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah, from the current levels. I'm sorry; I didn't hear that last part.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Said more in line.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","Yes. All right. Yeah. Thanks very much. I'm good.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thank you.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to come back to the M&A point. Just curious how you're thinking about prioritizing waiting for clarity on repatriation and the potential tax reform? What sort of impact does that have in terms of on your thinking for doing a deal? And then just I know in the past you had greater preference, it sounded like, for institutional and non-U.S. potential properties. Just how are you thinking about M&A today to improve your longer-term positioning to drive growth? What type of properties could make sense as you're thinking about it now?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, I'd say that it doesn't really impact the thinking now. I think the earlier \u2013 well, you have offshore cash. I mean, I think the probability is you'll have a territorial system in some form. You'll be taxed on your earnings \u2013 not your cash, but your earnings in the past. So it doesn't matter if we use the cash for offshore acquisitions versus waiting to bring it back. You're going to pay a tax based on what you earned in those offshore to free up the existing cash. So that creates kind of a level playing field as you look at the world, and I don't think it precludes us at this stage from favoring U.S. or saying, well, we'd have to finance a U.S. today versus not. I think if it makes sense, we would do it in the U.S. equally versus the rest of the world. I don't know if that helps, but that's based on where we are with the taxes.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just any thoughts on potential properties on the M&A front, how you're thinking about that, broadly?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah, I think I mentioned it earlier that there's no high priority. We look at where we can complement the lineup, so maybe, if anything, continuing to build out the high net worth business with fiduciary would move up that list today versus anything else. But we have, like always, many active \u2013 we're in many \u2013 doing diligence at any given time on different firms. Have a team (45:32) dedicated to doing that.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And just lastly, on risk premia, you acquired a team from AlphaParity earlier this year. Just curious if you could update us on how that's progressing? And how you're thinking about the opportunity set there? And how this could potentially fit into building out an expanded institutional business?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, I think it's just, it's again, just bringing in talent with outside expertise and views and a different way of thinking about the market and a different way of customizing portfolios. And we didn't talk a lot about the solution side and building that out as a separate team now from the alternative side, as far as having a head and a new dedicated person to do that. So this is just another tool in the box that allows us to do things that we couldn't do before, and it's really about bringing people in that can bring a broader array of customized solutions.","And we're already, I think, starting to see some wins in places we haven't had before, and one more recently on the variable annuity side on a new asset class, and a lot of that was just having that solutions build out and depth. And that's really what these people bring.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to circle back from an earlier question here on revenue share. So just to clarify your comments there on being limited by the prospectus, I'm guessing that that's based on like 12b-1 and payments that would be included in the expense ratio, but how about revenue share payments that would be made that are funded by Franklin's P&L and not within the fund?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Yeah, you still have to disclose that in the prospectus and we have caps on fixed income and equity by fund in the prospectus. And I think today there's probably only one relationship that would be affected by our caps, where we can't meet the revenue share number. And that means we're not going to be able to wholesale in that one channel, and it's not a significant one for us, not one I'm going to mention, but if you haven't read about it, it means it's probably not that big. And I think all of the rest we've been able to meet, so that's the point. It is out of our P&L, but it's also disclosed and it also has a cap on it for us.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for that. And then I think you mentioned a factor that drove the increase in the comp expectations for this year improved investment performance. So I know the one year performance has improved a lot, but some of the longer-terms, not so much. Which timeframes tend to drive pay for performance by your guys' calculations? And can you help us understand that a little bit better?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","I mean, it's a one, three, and five, we feel like that's an important way to kind of look at it in the right perspective. But, again, sometimes the numbers, the five-year number, for example, $90 billion of that is Franklin Income Fund that's in the 52nd percentile, and probably moved into the 48th percentile in the last month, because it's outperformed over the last month. So immediately, that number shifts from a 48 or something to a 70 with one fund in a few weeks.","So I think, overall, if you look at the investment teams, the big shifts are Templeton. That's a fairly significant pool for us. The Global Bond group is excellent over mutual series. So a lot \u2013 there's been a pretty strong rebound, and I think the number was if you take our top 10 flagship funds, nine out of 10 in those three periods we're talking about, we're in the top two quartiles. So that shows you a real consistency across the line up, and they are revenue generated pools based on performance, so you will have upward pressure from that.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for the color.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Hey. Thanks for the follow up. As a follow-up to Glenn's question, you've added a lot on the distribution side, and high profile, both non-U.S. and U.S. can you give us an idea of a timeline to expect some tangible sales traction with those changes?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","I wouldn't have a timeline. I think it wouldn't be appropriate, and I think the driver is still going to be relative performance more than just putting new distribution people in place, and certainly with the U.K. hire, that'll take time in assess that market and how we build out there. It's a market we historically have not put a huge effort in on the distribution side just because for us, historically, they've had a lot of global equity managers and that's been our lead product, so it hasn't been something that we've made a big effort, but that may change with this person. And so, I don't have a timeframe for what that means. I think first, that person gets in, looks at the market, and then comes up with a plan and we maybe will be better suited in three months or six months to talk about that.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. And then just quickly on the $2 billion institutional guide, that run rate historically is very consistently kind of in the 2 to 3 range per quarter. So should we take the fact that you're actually giving a specific number to mean that you feel like this is unusually high for where we are in the quarter?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","No, I just think it was a certainty that we had, and it's already funding, so I think they felt like they'd mentioned it. And probably the importance of not seeing anything in this quarter to say, hey, there were wins this quarter, they just funded next quarter to get to more of a normalized, so you don't put it in at zero.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Of course. All right. Thanks.","Operator","There are no additional questions at this time.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Franklin Resources, Inc.","Well, thank you, everybody, for attending the quarterly call, and we look forward to speaking next quarter.

Mr. Johnson, you may begin.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, good morning and thank you for joining Ken Lewis and me to discuss the company's second quarter. Although we continue to experience net outflows in the March quarter, the nature of the mid-quarter market rebound marked an encouraging transition for us. As many of the weakest performing sectors of 2015, we're among the strongest performers in the quarter. As the quarter progressed, investment performance of many of our key strategies improved as did redemption trends.","Overall, our financial results were solid as we continued to exercise expense discipline, notwithstanding some notable onetime items that are discussed in more detail on our 10-Q which was also filed this morning. Now, Ken and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I guess, Ken, if you could clarify some of the one-time items in the quarter, I know you called out some of the $40 million or so in severance but I believe there were some other things in the G&A line and others.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. We did have an impairment charge in G&A that was about $30 million. That was offset a little bit by contingent liability. So those were the two major large lumpiness in the G&A account.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","I guess in the context of last quarter, we had 3% to 4% expense decline for the year and now you're seeing 3%. What are the variables in terms of that change?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, one of them was that impairment charge. We weren't counting on that in the 3% to 4% guidance. And also looking out for the remaining quarters for the year, we might have another non-recurring charge in the fourth quarter, although that could roll into the first quarter as well. So those are two things that weren't known last quarter that we're factoring in as well as there's a lot of moving parts to this. We're rationalizing business lines and departments and all that. So we're just refining our estimate.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. I guess and then, Greg, as my follow-up, if you could talk about the DOL and now that the final rules are out, and how you guys are thinking about that?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think a lot obviously has been discussed already. I mean, it affects a huge part of the industry. I think, for us, it's difficult to get an exact number on the amount of assets that it potentially could affect, but we did our best, and with omnibus accounts, that's a little bit tricky. But we estimate that it affects about $130 billion of our assets. I think we're probably a little bit lower than most because of our heavy concentration in retail assets offshore, as well as municipal bond funds, and the fact that the key area around 401(k) tends to be in U.S. growth, and that's an area where we don't have huge penetration.","So I think, overall, a little bit lower, but like everybody in the industry, very concerned about and still trying to understand what a 1,000-page document means to our business. And that's really where we're focused today is working with our advisors, working with outside legal assistance and really making sense of the proposal. I think the good news is that some of the most unworkable items have been adjusted, but that obviously a very difficult rule that will eliminate advice to many people that need it most and that's the smaller end of the market.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks and good morning. I guess my first question, I'm just curious if it's \u2013 I mean if we can \u2013 you have a couple of new initiatives underway. You mentioned the NextStep strategies in the prepared remarks, and I know you've obviously taken some steps in the ETF market. Can you really kind of update us on maybe where you are with both of those? And then and particularly NextStep maybe kind of fleshing that out, what the opportunity is there and is that part of the relationship you have globally with the Citi?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. I mean that is and it's addressing that area of the market using technology and trying to penetrate those that may not be large enough to be able to get individual help or advice. So it does address a new market for us. I think our partnership, a lot of that was based on our global reach and the fact that we can help them get the marketing message out in markets like Asia and Latin America where Citi has such a strong reach. I think that will take a while to develop, but it is off and running now.","The other area is just around the alternatives and multi-alternatives, and we continue to extend our capabilities there with the Long Short Credit and Global Macro Fund that was recently introduced. And then our Liberty shares ETF, which will be available in June, and we expect to continue to build out that line as well. Those are just a few of the newer initiatives.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And maybe going my follow-up, just curious if you could give us an update on the institutional demand you're seeing for the global bond and related strategies. I know that's been a place in the prior quarters. You've talked about seeing increased interest and activities. Can maybe update us on that?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We are seeing that, and I think that's clear when our team's out visiting various countries and meeting that there is a strong interest in diversifying their currency exposure. So we continue to see a strong pipeline there. And I couldn't give you an estimate or number of when, but that would be highest, I think, on our list of opportunities in the institutional space.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. thanks for taking my questions.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. So just coming back to the $130 billion, did that include all retirement accounts, variable annuity, commission-based IRA, 401(k), and is there anything else in there?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, it doesn't. I think that one did not include annuities, which you probably would \u2013 you'd want to include in that number, and that's probably another $50 billion in sub-advised annuities which obviously could be affected as well. That's a good point.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. And then just a question on M&A. Is my understanding both the UK and Canada fall under the U.S. in terms of how you're domiciled from a tax standpoint? If you guys wanted to acquire a business in the UK, could you restructure the business so you could use your international capital to do that acquisition?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Craig, could you just repeat the question a little bit? You're a little faint.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Sure. So, I believe the UK and Canada are under your U.S. domicile from a tax standpoint. So, I'm just wondering \u2013 and you've recently done Rensburg. But I'm wondering, if you did a future acquisition in the UK, could you use your foreign capital to do that acquisition?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The answer is yes, we could.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It would not require a restructure.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It wouldn't even require a restructuring. We could do without that.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Did you use foreign capital for Rensburg?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I don't recall. We probably did. Yeah. We probably did.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Okay. That's it for me.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Katz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks so much. Just want to come back to the impairment you took on K2. I guess that's been an area of growth for you, so I'm a little surprised to still see the impairment. So could you talk about what drove the impairment? And then, if you just sort of step back and you talk about maybe your incremental appetite for alternatives which seems to be a pretty big area of growth still for the industry.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So the impairment wasn't related to K2. In total, it was related to a specific component of the K2 business, which would have been the old business contracts that we put a value on. And so we were just adjusting that value based on there've been a couple of redemptions and there've been sales having met the original projection. So, that's why we impaired it. So, it's just that one stream of business, if you will, not the entire enterprise.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And just your bigger picture view on appetite for alternative capabilities?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I hand that to Greg.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, I think we still view it, as you said, in a strong area of growth and we're going to continue to look at expanding the product line in less traditional types of investments. So, we're \u2013 whether it's M&A or building it organically, that's certainly part of our plan.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And this is follow-up. You had mentioned in your pre-recorded call, maybe just happenstance, but you had listed deals first within your use of cash \u2013 cash flow. Sort of wondering if you step back, how you're thinking about capital management priorities given when the stock recovery versus growing out the business. And within M&A, what kind of things are you looking at?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think that it might have been happenstance. Probably that ordering \u2013 I don't think it was intentional. And I say that because nothing has changed in our strategy, our capital management strategy. I mean, we don't say the stock is up or down so now we'll place more or less emphasis on M&A. They're all kind of independent positions. And we're continuing to focus on M&A \u2013 evaluate M&A opportunities. That hasn't changed.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Thanks for the time. Going back to the expense guidance quickly, I just wanted to clarify that the 3% decline does include kind of all these onetimers we're talking about.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It does.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Yes. Okay. Perfect. And then on the DOL, can you speak to Schwab decision to stop selling loaded funds today from the standpoint of your own exposure to them, if at all? And then more broadly, what that could mean for your sales, in particular, if that becomes a trend for the broader distribution world?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, I have to say I wouldn't make much of that decision. I doubt they do anything in what we \u2013 particularly you called loaded sales and everybody looks at the A share sales and assumes somebody's paying commission. For us, it's now less than 9% of our sales have a commission on them and we are traditionally what you'd call, I guess, load-based firm. So for Schwab, that's an \u2013 I would say it's a non-event that they're not doing that because it's probably less than 1% of their sales.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Right.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And the world, as we know, continues to move towards fee-based and with the fiduciary changes probably more with R6 or shares that don't have 12b-1 fees associated with them, you'll see more and more of that.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","And you say 9%, that means kind of all kinds of commissions frontload, 12b-1, et cetera.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's 9% of U.S. commissionable sales.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey, guys. Good morning. First, Greg, I know you called out the two global equity institutional redemptions at total $1.8 billion, but it sounds like there were some other lumpy institutional redemptions related to allocation changes and\/or sovereign wealth fund redemptions. So just wondering if you could sort of provide any more color on maybe the size of those losses and\/or the strategies impacted, and any sense of sort of the residual AUM that might be at risk for further attrition.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think the \u2013 there's probably another \u2013 there were two accounts that were \u2013 at total $1.8 billion global equities, one Middle Eastern sovereign wealth and another in Australia doing a rebalancing of a global equity. And then really only \u2013 there was only two other large global equity that were about $300 million apiece in Canada.","It's interesting. I think looking at quarter-to-quarter, our global equity was actually \u2013 while the net number was very high out, it was mostly due to this institutional redemption fee. Retail trend is actually better, and I think the retail trend is important, too, to call out just in general that it was a lot better than the prior quarter with redemptions declining as well during kind of a choppy quarter. It's really the institutional quarter-over-quarter change in flows that mask, I think, some of the improved trends within the retail side, especially the hybrid side.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Got it. That's helpful.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Nothing else to really, I think, call out on the large institutional ones.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And then just to come back to M&A, any color on what you're seeing across the landscape in terms of pricing and\/or competition, particularly in light of the recent rebound in the markets? I guess been hearing anecdotally that maybe the pipeline is starting to pick up, if you will.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean I would just \u2013 Ken can jump in. I think that's right. I think when you're kind of in market lulls and volatile periods, you don't really see a lot. And I think that's been kind of true that there hasn't been a ton of M&A activity. And as markets rebound, I think that people start thinking about it, so I think that's fair. I don't know if we could say specifically that we've seen that, but that certainly has been the case historically and pass it to Ken.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I agree. We haven't seen any specifics \u2013 changes in the trends. I mean, there are a number of targets out there that are always being rumored to sell and whatnot. And perhaps some of those are changing from non-actionable to actionable, but we haven't really seen a pickup in opportunities.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Gross sales across the board look weak over a multi-quarter period and it's driven by those cyclical and secular issues. Are ETFs in these multi-asset products, do they have big enough potential over, say, the next three to five years to offset the redemptions that Franklin is facing? And if those products don't have the potential, what's your next step into kind of driving the business back to positive organic growth?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it's hard to ever know. I think the multi-asset's a huge category that continues, I think, to garner more attention in the distribution channels and I think for a lot, it makes a lot of sense. I would look at the organic growth rate trends are more the flagship areas like the Income Fund, which somewhat has been a multi-asset before people started calling it that.","You've seen a pretty strong rebound in two quarters of performance, and that can translate pretty quickly into organic growth. If these trends continue, that have really been moving that last couple of months. And we have seen that fund move from, just the fund alone, $3.5 billion in net outflows in the prior quarter to $1.9 billion this quarter and that continues to improve. So, that's always been a big driver of net flows.","I think the Global Bond one is a little bit harder, a different category and not \u2013 while it's doing better with some of the emerging currencies, I think the duration in rates continuing to decline. Need to back up in rates. If the rates back up, that will see significant organic growth and I think pretty darn quickly because it'll be one of the few funds that will do well in that environment.","So, I think you continue to bring new products out there and hope you catch on in a way that it can grow. But certainly the multi-asset category is a huge one and you've seen what's happened in Europe with it. So, there's no reason why that can't happen here in the U.S. as well.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hill with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Just had one on repurchases, so you guys have come \u2013 had a few really strong quarters of repurchase, but I'm assuming some of that was opportunistic in nature. I'm just wondering how to think about that moving forward and kind of what level at your stock price might cause you to purchase more or purchase less from a U.S. cash perspective. Thanks.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So, I think \u2013 I was anticipating I might get this question looking back at our history over the last eight or nine quarters and I think the message that I want to give is that our strategy for repurchases is consistent. I don't see anything today that would cause us to change what we've done historically. And sure, it's definitely in terms of activity ramped up when the prices declined in the opposite, but we continue to believe in the stock and we'll continue to be opportunistic.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, I know you guys mentioned in the pre-recorded call expanding into some of the local markets. I think Poland was the one you mentioned. Just wondering the strategic rationale for that type of investment in a smaller market versus maybe some of your key geographic centers on the distribution front.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it's a question of resources being taken away from some of the bigger markets because of our initiatives in the smaller one. I think we have always felt that part of the competitive edge we have is our presence in all these different markets. And for us, Poland is also one of our operations and servicing centers for Europe, and we have a lot of employees that have strong presence there and it is a growing middle class in that market.","And you take markets like a Taiwan that, for us, years ago, somebody would've said why are you bothering with that. But they can become very meaningful if you have an early dominant position. So it's not taking away any resources for us; it's just continuing to build out that retail capability where it makes sense, and you add it all up and it can be very meaningful.","Kenneth Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Appreciate the color there. Thanks.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks a lot. Greg, on your \u2013 the pre-recorded call, you just mentioned as the market rebounded, both performance and redemptions were showing signs of improvement. I just wanted to get some color on what you saw.","And then, I think sometimes when we look at the one-year to three-year performance, you've mentioned when some of the larger funds are maybe just under the 50 percentile. So just wanted to get any color on the larger funds, if they're kind of approaching that threshold to see the performance start to pick up.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, I think it is significant because I would look at the first two months of this last quarter as in a risk-off environment where it was \u2013 the underperformance was getting worse every day and just the last six, seven weeks, it's been probably the best overall performance and we talked about some of the concentrated exposures that we have overall as a firm.","But I think that to me, it's almost also a leading indicator to the market where we were saying, hey, it's been 10 years of this growth value cycle and, all of a sudden, value is starting to outperform and you look at even emerging markets had a better quarter. Value was up 7.5% and growth was up 3.3%.","So you have \u2013 I think the turnaround and what people have been looking for whether it's currency is doing better abroad, oil obviously rebounding, and that affects probably four major groups' performance right now with the energy exposure and also the high yield exposure in the Income Fund. I think all of that can turn pretty quickly. I don't know exactly which ones are right. I haven't looked at that to say the three-year number who is within two percentage points or that. But I think the more important number is the market kind of gets the drivers for our bigger funds and I think for the first time in a while, we're getting some wind behind us as far as the relative performance goes.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And can you just \u2013 a quick follow-up. Just on the impairment, I think you mentioned there was maybe an offset. Just wanted to try to understand maybe what the net impact was on maybe the G&A line just to understand from \u2013 what the build-off (25:03). And then I think you also mentioned about $20 million in performance fees. So I know those are hard to predict but maybe just in terms of locks or when you typically realize the outlook there.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Maybe it's better to just give you what we're thinking about in terms of G&A going forward. We do think that that line is going to come down a little bit so we're not expecting a lot of upward pressure there, keeping in mind that there's a lot of market-driven items that go through that line.","So assuming a flat market, we just generally expect for the remainder of the year for that expense to come down from where it's been in the last two quarters. So, I mean, I'm not avoiding your question. It's just that you don't want to, like, waste all the time with the in-and-out accounting details. But generally speaking, we're thinking for G&A and other to kind of come down a little bit from where it's been the last two quarters for the rest of the year.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the performance fees.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sorry. Yeah. The performance fees, yeah, they are hard to predict and they impact over $20 million. If I think about it in terms of seasonality, typically we might have a little bump-up next quarter. So I mean, it wouldn't be unusual for us to see some performance fees next quarter and then, the fourth quarter, typically we don't have too much.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. A larger question, big picture question I guess on the flows. If you look at this quarter relative to last, things got a little worse, but we've talked about some of the drivers, the institutional impact and so on. But also I guess there's another impact and that's the market selling off as much as it did in the first part of the quarter. And so I'm wondering, I know this is probably really hard to gauge or frame up, but how much impact do you guys think that had on the flows? And I guess what I'm getting at is if we sort of didn't have this mini blow-up in the market, might the flow picture looked even better than actually what occurred?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it would. I mean, I don't think there's any question it was \u2013 when the market sell off to a 10% down through the first couple of months, that \u2013 and generally what is a very strong month this January. So, it's always very hard to say what would it mean, what would the number look like, but certainly, it definitely had an impact. And especially as I said for us, I mean, the positions that we had and with the dollar, oil and energy value growth, everything kind of moving the wrong way for the first couple months, that didn't help in the key areas where we had the largest assets.","And we've seen the impact, and redemptions were actually a little bit lower for the quarter, which is kind of counterintuitive a little bit, but gross sales dropped quite a bit. That's what generally happens in that --when you get in that really volatile period.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it, okay. And follow-up question on the taxable U.S. fixed income business. There's still outflow in there. Can you speak to that? Is that primarily a performance issue? And if so, what's the driver?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The U.S. taxable?","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Correct.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, I think a part of it was just the high yield exposure and for us having a fair amount of assets in the high yield area and the overexposure to energy there, I mean that led to some of the outflows.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe, Greg, just go back to the $130 billion of assets that you thought were at risk from the Department of Labor perspective. If you could just stratify the 401(k) part of that, I think we were spending \u2013 less than $20 billion of that would be 401(k). And then, if the rest of that is IRA-related, are you just looking at the accounts that are with brokers in that regard? So would IRA assets be higher than that, overall?","And then, is there \u2013 to any extent you think pricing dynamics might change in a post-DOL world, would that influence some decisions, longer term decisions on changing pricing structures in your funds including 12b-1s?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, as I've said, I wish we had an exact number because it's a little bit hard to collect and we did our best to collect from various sources. And I think the 401(k) specific number, which mostly is investment-only business, is about $31 billion, $30 billion, somewhere in that range. And IRAs are probably in the $70 million to $100 million range, I guess, is our best guesstimate there.","And I think when you say it \u2013 I wouldn't say it's at risk. I mean, I think there's clearly \u2013 it means there's going to be some changes in how they're serviced and how we service and how we deliver through the advisor community, and still a lot of work to be done there. We have the share classes already in place that are being used today and some of that could move to those types of classes.","We think the net result will be there will be more motion of money and we want to make sure, first and foremost, that we're doing everything with our advisors to make sure that the burden \u2013 we can help them manage this huge change.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No, that's helpful color. And then I think, Greg, on the last quarter comfortably, you mentioned there were some large variable annuity accounts, so we're doing allocation changes. And I thought you said there was one that looked like it was susceptible coming in that. I don't think that came in the \u2013 correct me if I'm wrong, did that come in this quarter or is that something that still remains a potential redemption?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That got moved back for a while; I think probably six to nine months from hitting this quarter. So we'll keep you posted when we get better color, but it's still, I think, still hanging out there.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, guys. So one more to DOL, if I may. So, speaking through \u2013 obviously the rule is still fresh and I'm assuming we're all kind of collecting information from various distribution channels on how things will continue. But when you take a step back, the $100-plus billion as I'm assuming it's grandfather and obviously because the sales already occurred. But taking a step back, do you guys think performance will be a much bigger kind of point of influence on the way financial advisors decide how to allocate assets from here? And I guess the reason I'm asking is if a fund underperforms for a brief period of time, is there greater risk redemptions other than new contract (33:08) versus what we've experienced in the past?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, I do think it's early to speculate on those types of thoughts. And obviously, it'd be nice to have clear rules and, here, we don't in a lot of cases on the suitability and standard and how it's enforced and risks, and how advice is delivered. And I think a lot of that has to be vetted and figured out and a lot of legal fees to get there. And then, you're still going to have some exposure in doing it. So even the question of figuring out performance and what time period is the right one and at that at end of the day, anybody can question an underperforming fund versus an index during any given period. And I think those are the questions that we have to somehow address.","I think at the end of the day, a lot of it is always performance-driven and more than ever. Today, you have more consultants involved in the selection of the platforms. So I think that has been in place for a while. And regardless of a fiduciary rule, I think that was just the trend where a lot of the 401(k) plans having a strong kind of \u2013 consultants helping pick the options, I think, that performance will always be critical.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Right. Thanks. And then kind of just one follow-up on expenses. You guys have done a good job maintaining margins at the current levels and keeping expenses well managed despite of severance and a few other onetimers kind of running through the numbers. Just curious if you were to kind of strip all that out and say, okay, the base line is maybe a little bit over $2 billion for the year, how much more room do you guys have to drive the non-distribution expenses lower into the next 12 months or so assuming markets are flat?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think we're at the point \u2013 I think there's room. I think there's room to drive the expenses down more in a number of different areas. And kind of \u2013 what's left, though, is a little bit more complicated to sift through and come up with definitive plan. So, it's going to take a little bit longer to execute those cost savings than the ones we've done so far. But that doesn't mean that there's not more room to trim expenses, it's just going to be harder to see that impact in the P&L in the short term. It could take longer.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I see. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more just on your last point on some of those additional expense savings that could come through that could take a little bit longer, what some of them might be. I think in the past, I mean you referred to potentially greater outsourcing. Just any update on that and just generally how you're thinking about additional actions that you could take on the expense side.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think it's more just looking at the way we do things and challenging our business processes that may have been set up when the business environment was different, and just seeing if there is ways we could leverage technology to do things smarter and better and more efficiently and gain more scale. That's the point I'm trying to make.","When you start to take that approach, it gets a bit more challenging and time-consuming to go through and that. But those are the type of things. So specific lines of business, perhaps specific functions. Just are we \u2013 is our processes best-in-class right now or can they be improved? That's what we're looking at.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. And then just as a follow-up, just trying the M&A. Just curious how active the dialogue has been on the M&A side and to what extent we gotten close on a deal and if that's the case, sort of what's been the hang-up? And if you could just talk more broadly to your M&A strategy, what sort of AUM or deal value magnitude you think makes the most sense, characteristics that you're looking for right now?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, there's different ways of looking at M&A. I mean, we never start with, okay, we need an AUM target so let's look at the targets that have that assets under management and consolidate. It's more of a strategic-driven approach and the debt you have to marry with what the supply is and what the targets bring to the table. So everyone \u2013 every single deal that we look for the strategic rationale tends to be bespoke and adjusted for that target, so very difficult to generalize like in terms of AUM targets or specifics.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Just on the activity of the dialogue, have you gotten close to anything and what's sort of been the hang-up, if you have?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, again we have dedicated people that are out there looking at the industry and like I wouldn't say anything been closed and we probably wouldn't mention that anyway, but we're going to continue to look. And as we said on the last call, it continues to be a priority with the offshore cash to utilize that in a way that enhances shareholder value and that's really what we're trying to do.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think looking back, if there's one common theme for why deals weren't done, it tended to be cultural fit","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Berg with RBC. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much and good morning. On the area of expenses or in the area of expenses, would you say that if the equity market were this volatile as it has been and if equity prices were higher, not off the way they are compared with a year ago, would you still say that given the state of the business, what's going on in your industry, that there would still be a need to lower expenses?","Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think there would be perhaps more of a desire or want than a need, but we would still focus on that. And I think that that's a lesson that we've learned during the last two downturns that it's human nature when times are good to relax the purse strings and do things and do the nice to haves. But I think as a firm, we've grown up and realized that we need to be disciplined so that we don't get into those situations where we have to have massive layoffs or something at downturn and disrupt the business. So...","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But I would also add \u2013 I mean, your question just beyond what are the obvious issues the active manager faces in today's marketplace with \u2013 and changes in the distribution model and regulatory environment. Even in a robust environment, you'd probably, yes, be looking for more efficiencies, but I'd also say you don't cut your way to prosperity. And we have always felt like there are times when we have to continue to invest, to be strategic, to do M&A, to bring out new products. I mean, I think it's a changing world, and just trying to cut your way to maintaining margins, you'll be out of business at some point.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And if I could just have a little discussion with you following up on the matter of share classes and the DOL. I find it almost a full-time job keeping track of share classes A, B, C, R, L, I, Advisor class, Investor class, Admiral class, it goes on and on. The lexicon differs by company.","I'm wondering whether one of you could maybe make it a little bit easier for us by offering any general comments you think hold true as to what is going to happen here. In other words, can we say just as a general statement that irrespective of what the share class is called, A, B, C, R, L, I, whatever, that lower expense ratio share classes will be doing better as a result of DOL? That's what I'm sort of looking for, some general guidance on how to think about this.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, I think that's right. I think there's more pressure, especially for newer business, to utilize what we call an R6 class. But again, I think it \u2013 there's still a lot of work to be done before you can draw any conclusions on how fast that'll move. And certainly, you can conclude that the lower end of the market will be more passive, robo, and less people-intensive or advice-driven.","Those conclusions you can kind of draw how quickly the pace moves to specific classes. I think, as you said, there's a lot of work to be done in the meantime before you can just say X percent's going to be there by this date.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Dunn with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. It's Finn (43:24) in for Glenn Schorr. Can you guys give us a little more color on that composition of the sales and distribution fee line, maybe what's the recurring fees versus the 12b-1, et cetera?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I can. So think it was \u2013 let me just get your reference there. I think that we included a slide. Maybe it was it was 27%-ish or something. It's in the back that kind of breaks down. So there is a component of those two lines, distribution, revenue and expense that is sales-based and we've talked a lot about what percentage of the assets are sales-based. It's very small. And then the percentage that's asset-based.","And so part of the reason that the net line has been going down is because of the assets under management be going down. So if you look forward a couple of quarters, I would expect that the net number would be a little bit less than it has been. I think it's been, I'm going to guess, like 115, something like that and probably it might \u2013 we're thinking now flat markets. It might go down to like 105 net per quarter.","Unknown Speaker","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi. Thanks for the follow-up. With the understanding that DOL's really focused on the relationship between the broker and the client, do you guys think there's any risk of increased expense load at the manufacturer level and thus at your level as a result?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think there's an increase in just your \u2013 I don't know if I'd call it specifically on your share class, but certainly the potential for an increase in how we did business versus how we're going to do business and terms of compliance costs and how we assist the adviser. Think all of that it's still there. We have a close partnership with many of them in delivering this and a lot of that has to be done, but there's no question that there's a major cost burden of compliance to \u2013 between all of the disclosures and sign-offs that has to be done that will increase costs.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Is any of that in your expectations right now?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. I think it's too early to try to budget that or figure out how that's going to be worked, but I think we would anticipate that based on everything we've seen.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Yeah. Okay. And just one last one, it looks like for some of the larger funds that have been underperforming, that short-term performance is starting to bleed into the three- and five-year numbers. Are there any large platforms or consultants that may be more focused on those longer term numbers that you could be worried about right now?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think you always worry about that. But as I said earlier, I think what people \u2013 if you could understand that performance in relation to the market, simply whether it's value growth or different exposures in portfolios and then look at more near term and just \u2013 I don't think I've seen a better six-week period of relative performance for our flagship holdings, and so that's going to bleed in pretty quickly, too.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Right.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","When you have 500 basis points, 800 basis points of outperformance in a six-week period, that's going to help pretty quickly. And I think that's the momentum certainly with Templeton energy dollar, more recently some financials. All of that moves to numbers pretty quickly. So I would be more encouraged about the six-week trend than I would worrying about bleeding into the three and five because that's going to be more important. And as I said, that will bleed in, too, pretty quickly.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Great. Thanks a lot.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking a couple of follow-ups. I think you mentioned, either Ken or Greg, on the pre-recorded call about the \u2013 that the fee rate being different on a simple monthly average versus an average \u2013 daily average. I think you said a basis point differential. Just wanted to sort to get color on the go-forward fee rate given the mix, is that then therefore fairly stable with the fourth quarter or do you see that lower?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right. So I just pointed that out because \u2013 and it was my feeling that we're not seeing a big change in the effective fee rate for the mix. In general, over the last longer term, it's been coming down a bit but it comes down very gradually. It's been coming down very gradually and it's effectively very stable percentage. So that's why I tried more to point out the anomaly this quarter.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. It looks exacerbated by the average in calculation is what you're saying.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. And then I missed your response to the question on the performance fee outlook in the next quarter or two, if you want to repeat that.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think the caller before said it correctly, it's very difficult to say it because obviously it depends on the markets. If the global equity has a good quarter, I would expect to see some performance fees in June, maybe July that were similar to perhaps last year, but it's very difficult to say.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's fair. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Katz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks so much. I joined a couple of minutes late, so I apologize if you did cover this. How did you stratify your platform that you came up with $130 billion of assets that might be at risk? And then when you thought about that, what kind of risk do you anticipate?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, it's a great question and I couldn't tell you how much \u2013 in terms of quantifying risk, I think we did our best in a, for us, in a world where we have omnibus and assets. We don't seem to come up with a fair guesstimate around how much is in 401(k) and how much is in IRAs, and we didn't include \u2013 if we include VA, that number is probably $180 billion of exposed assets, breaking out between about $50 billion in VAs and $20 billion, $28 billion in 401(k) investment only, and the rest in IRAs.","So I don't think there's a big \u2013 certainly there's more risk than an average account because of the changes that are being imposed on the industry. But I don't know how I could possibly quantify that right now, Bill.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Just a matter of segment, what you chose. Just what is an IRA \u2013 I just want to understand, just an IRA or 401(k), then that's basically the selection criteria you used against the $130 billion.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right. Right. Right. Yeah, and then VA on top of that.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I understand. Okay. And then just one last follow-up. Ken, you mentioned that there may be another impairment coming down either in the fiscal fourth quarter or early next year, fiscal next year. You probably won't be specific on the call, but can you generally talk about where that might be and is it an AUM level? Is it an exit-of-business strategy? I'm just trying to understand what that might be.","Kenneth A. Lewis - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, I was referring to we're winding down a defined benefit plan in the UK and I'm not really sure on the timing of that but that's what I was referring to. It could be fourth quarter. It could be first quarter next year.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","All right. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for the follow-up. Just curious if you could provide any sort of color on April flows and performance trends so far given some of the positive commentary that you've provided around the end of March.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, as you know, we're careful about any looking-forward pass the prior quarter. I would just say that the trends that were in place continue even today with oil continuing to move and energy moving in the right way, the dollar weakening, helping our assets and relative performance for some of our areas. So, all of that helps and certainly helps with the pressure on retail redemptions that you have a nice sort of rebound there, so I'll kind of leave it at that.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, anything that we should be keeping our minds on in terms of potential lumpy institutional inflows or outflows?","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, I think there's still pressure on the VA business as some of it closed out, so there'll be some lumpy timing items over the next year but nothing to really call out the next quarter.","Michael J. Cyprys - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time.

We are please to report overall investment performance, sustained recent momentum, despite some market volatility during the quarter. Sales improved again as a result with encouraging trends in both the wirehouse [ph] and institutional channels. We remain very focused on managing our expenses while simultaneously making the necessary investments in the business to deliver strong performance. This month, we announced several senior-level additions and organizational changes to certain investment teams designed to enhance our portfolio management, research, and data analytics capabilities.","With me today is our President and Chief Operating Officer, Jenny Johnson, and joining us for his first earnings call is Matthew Nicholls, our CFO. Matthew has been with us for three months now and is already very immersed in our business. We're glad to have him with us.","I'd now like to open the line up for your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Your line is now live.","Glenn Schorr","Thanks very much. And this might be a little complex, but sales were basically 50-50 split between inside and outside the U.S. while the AUM is more like two-thirds-one-third. I'm just curious if you could talk about what's driving the more balanced mix in sales and what are the free rate implications going forward. And maybe you could do that assuming kind of a flat flow environment.","Gregory Johnson","Yes, I mean I would -- first, I think there was a lot of institutional movement kind of moving around so much where I would draw a conclusion that that number percentage of sales is here to stay. We'd have to kind of take a look at that. And I think the -- from just a general statement some of the pressures that you're seeing in the U.S. and certainly from retail side and the move to passive and things, on the retail channel you're not really seeing that as much globally. So I think that that -- you don't have that pressure like you do. So I would think that some of those numbers should increase. And probably just overall, the global side relies more on global bond sales, and that continues to do pretty well, especially over the last few quarters in the retail channel outside of the U.S.","Jennifer Johnson","And I'd just add we have had some success selling some fixed maturity plans, both in Asia and in Europe.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. And that's in the one but yet -- not yet funded pipeline, I take it?","Gregory Johnson","No, that one funded during the quarter. I think the total was -- that was a $500 million one during that quarter that funded.","Glenn Schorr","And then maybe just one on Benefit Street, just talk about how performance is going, and then more importantly, what you're doing to leverage both their capabilities and to distribute more of their products across your broader platform?","Gregory Johnson","Yes, I mean I think we're very pleased with how it's going. As you know, it's a different kind of sales cycle, then more like private equity and building it into the retail channel, we're making great progress, but to get -- those are going to be new products, whether they're interval funds for the retail market, we're working with wealth management platforms to leverage the BDC as well as the public REIT and having success there. So we're optimistic about that. And I think in the last five months we had over 375 meetings globally, and feel like we're getting very strong reception in both the institutional and retail channel.","Nothing to report as far as the very stable business right now in terms of AUM and profitability, and we're still very optimistic looking at the pipeline going forward on growth. And I'll ask if Matthew or Jenny wants to add anything on BSP.","Jennifer Johnson","We funded $125 million CLO in the quarter, and I'd just -- I would say just to add to Greg's comments on the interest globally, both on the institutional and the retail side. There's strong interest, and it does take a little bit longer on sale, but we've been very pleased with the response in the market.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, thank you.","Gregory Johnson","And the first -- I think their first -- the next large fund is targeted to close in the second-half of 2019 senior opportunities fund.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Gregory Johnson","Morning.","Craig Siegenthaler","Of the $5 billion in discretionary cash and investments what level of this would you feel comfortable deploying into an acquisition before considering any debt raise?","Matthew Nicholls","Good morning. I think the answer to that is that we are flexible in terms of how much cash we'll use for an acquisition, but I would cautionary way to make the point that we're going to remain conservative in terms of our balance sheet. The structure and consideration of any transaction would always result in a conservative pro forma outcome, which means that the probability of us using all of that cash for a single transaction or a series of transactions is quite low. And for any larger transaction we're most likely to use a combination of cash and stock.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks, Matt. And just as a follow-up on M&A here. I saw the commentary on wealth managers. So I'm thinking what type of D2C businesses are you targeting for a potential acquisition?","Jennifer Johnson","So one is we think we have, obviously, Fiduciary Trust, and we think that that's a great business and benefit from scales. So we'd be looking for strategic acquisitions in markets where we don't have a big presence, so that would be one. We think there's some interesting kind of fintech type of acquisitions that can enhance the high-net-worth business, and when you're dealing with a high-net-worth you have multi-generation. So the younger generation is often more interested in more self-service in technology and so buying some startups that have that capability is interesting to us.","Matthew Nicholls","And Fiduciary Trust is a great business, and we have a good foundation to build upon. I think all know that the activity around wealth management across private equity investing in particular is very significant. And the amount of different integration and roll-up transactions into wealth managers is very pronounced in the marketplace. And frankly, that activity is being concentrated in private equity, and there isn't any reason why strategic with no net wealth managers could not be more active in that transaction flow.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ken Worthington from JP Morgan. Your line is now live.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning. Maybe first on the global equity business, it's been about four-and-a-half years since your last quarterly inflows into that asset class. Since then you've seen about $1 billion redemption on a business that's just $170 billion in size. So if you can solve the problem here, it would seem as though there's a lot of upside. Maybe where do you see the biggest issues in the global equity franchise today, sort of leading to or contributing to those outflows? And then, as you think about the next two to three years, maybe what are the steps you're considering that could stop or slow the asset losses. And with Matthew joining the team, might there be something more strategic on the M&A side that might help turn the tide here?","Gregory Johnson","Yes. No, I think you're absolutely right. And even if you look at this quarter and just say, all right, look at the overall flows, and that -- that without that category you'd probably be in positive flows. So for us it's really the deep value style of a Templeton, of a mutual series that we've all talked about it just about on every call. But we have another quarter where you have 200 to 300 basis points in differential and performance between your MSCI value and growth indices, and that trend has continued. So Templeton has stuck to its knitting and is a deep core value manager, and until that reverses it's just -- it's very difficult to get a lot of attention back.","And then you have the pressure in the retail channels, which is the active and passive. I think the more successful managers through this cycle have had the flexibility of core mandates. That's what our solutions group allows us to do is build that. We have a very successful global growth manager. It's one of our fastest growing funds. But it's $1.3 billion today and with inflows, and just getting on platforms with long-term -- with its record getting past five-10 years now. So that doesn't make up when you have a franchise as powerful as Templeton on the other side, but any deep value manager it's been very difficult. So I think that that needs to change.","We continue to make changes within that organization, and Jenny will speak to some of that in a minute. But for us it's really, when you say the future, and how do you -- I think the flexibility active manager is important and not to be bound by a strict discipline or at to have an offering out there and we can do that. We have all of those capabilities of very successful global growth managing and very successful value. And we have the solutions capability to build core assets and that's what we are doing with some of the sleeves within our SMA accounts and things.","But Jenny can speak to maybe just specifically with Templeton some of the changes that we have\u2026","Jennifer Johnson","Yes, so we acquired Edinburgh Partners and brought back Dr. Sandy Nairn who as you may recall was John Templeton's Director of Research. And he has been working and he is the chairman of the global equity group. And he has been working with the team there very closely. And we just announced two big hires there; Alan Bartlett coming in when Norm Boersma retires at the end of the year as the CIO. Alan is probably a little bit better known in Europe. But Sandy and Alan have had a long relationship and very excited to bring him in. And then key hires Peter Sartori in Asia.","And this is one of the things were when value underperforms and we've obviously been through this cycle a few times. But you look at it and while there is outflow, the reality is take the Templeton growth fund it's got average PE of about 13.5 versus say the SMP at 21. People who are building a full portfolio want to make sure that they hedge the risk. And so we still think that this is a great franchise. And when things shift back to value, people would be rewarded with this. But in the meantime, we continue to invest in a business and give great focus and make sure we have good talent there.","Gregory Johnson","And I would also add just when you look at Templeton, we did make some changes with the emerging markets group and successions with Mark Mobius and that team and more flexibility in I would say in style where the IT has become a bigger portion of the emerging markets indices. And we felt we need flexibility there.","We have managed through that change. And the performance is excellent for that group. And also the quality as far process and we think it's a real opportunity on the institutional side for the first time with many changes in that group. So, I think we are examining it. But I think with Templeton's large institutional base, it's very hard just to suddenly say it's going to be more flexible in how we become more growth year to RP [ph], but I think the flexibility to figure out new ways to figure out how to be more efficient in the value space is something we are very committed to.","Matthew Nicholls","With respect to your question on M&A not withstanding all the great internal organic growth we have going as referenced by Jenny and Greg, we have a very proactive approach I would say to M&A in both asset management and wealth management. We are specifically not shy of large scale transactions to create growth and promote diversification of our business, but frankly only a small handful of those really make much sense.","Amongst other things, we are very focused on certain international locations where we are subscale and we can win growth and make sense because of the demographics of those countries. We think expanding and globalizing, I would turn to asset business and build upon our acquisition of Benefit Street makes tremendous sense. We believe accelerating scale in certain investment objectives make sense. Institutionally is very important to us. A big focus on strategic activity,and then as we mentioned a second ago, expanding our wealth business on the fiduciary trust.","Ken Worthington","Okay, thank you. And maybe just following up on insurance, you had outflows in the quarter in the DA business, any -- does this foreshadow anything over the next 12 months? I remember last time we had outflows for a number of quarters. And then just to play good cop as well, you highlighted the opportunity on the asset allocation side for the insurance channel. Could you flesh out your comments there a little bit more?","Gregory Johnson","Yes, I mean any of the traditional assets that are still in the mutual fund you put under a watch list. I don't there is anything from a significant flow standpoint occurring next quarter. But, all of those assets continue to be under pressure and whether it's transitioning to passive or lower volatility or asset allocation models, we continue to do that. I think we have had plenty of interest on these new models and new allocation within insurance companies, and we continue to see that growth. There is nothing to report as far as new wins this quarter, but hopefully, as we have said before that we can replace a lot of that, suppose older mandates and be competitive in the new lowball and asset allocation area. And that's what we, build teams to do. And I would just say generally, that from a pipeline and flow and this is always a hard one for us to kind of forecast for you as what we think next quarter. I think we've seen some significant wins. But we also know that we have a few big mandates and they're all, in the very lower fee ones, moving out one, a couple of big ones in Canada that were Canadian equity and Canadian fix specifically, but relatively low fee, but we had a big win in the K2 side.","So we kind of look at and say that we have 4 billion in and 4 billion out between just those wins and losses. And some of that will come out next quarter so we will come in next quarter. But it's kind of as best we can look at the pipeline in somewhat of a wash right now. And I give I think, we can't give much color beyond that. We don't know, specifically when the funding dates are for some of those mandates.","Ken Worthington","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Gregory Johnson","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live.","Patrick Davitt","Hey, good morning, guys. I guess, Matt, also with you another, you've been in the position for three months, because you may be frame a bit more what you see as the key priorities and opportunities over the next year or two for you. And within that theme, any potential changes and how you think about parameters around looking at the evaluation of potential M&A targets?","Matthew Nicholls","So my priorities have been to get up to speed as quickly as possible on the finance group. First of all, that's a big group here doing lots of different things across 35 countries. So the first thing I've done is that. Second thing is to form a more centralized corporate development function and focus more on corporate strategy on the centralized level across all the different groups that we have in the firm been working on that. Third is to really select where we want to focus our time on strategy. There's lots of things we can do across wealth and asset management, and in different geographies, different asset classes, as I've referenced.","So focusing on a few of those where we think is going to make the biggest difference to our firm, expeditiously without panic is been very important to me and what I've been focused on with both management team and executive committee here. So that's been my primary focus.","And then, obviously, to focus on the capital structure making sure we retain the financial flexibility that we have today that we talk a fair amount in our prepared remarks about and that's not going to change as I referenced in the beginning. But our ability or willingness, if you will, to deploy some of that cash is certainly the top of our mind strategically. So that's the -- my main parts to begin with.","Patrick Davitt","Okay. Thanks. And then, the expense guidance, including BSP year-over-year and 2019, is that on the fall of 2018 number including all one timers and through that lens, any updated thoughts on moving to non-gap reporting and when you could make that kind of change and what you think the size of the potential adjustments could be if you do make that change? ","Matthew Nicholls","Yes, so fiscal 2019, including BSP and non-recurring items net of S&D is about plus 11% to 12% from fiscal 2018 and no adjustments to 2018 on that. So that's correct. What's your second question?","Patrick Davitt","Thoughts about moving to a non-gap reporting where a lot of these one-timers would be adjusted out of your reported earnings number. And to the extent you do make such an adjustment? What you think the scale of the change would be to a 2020 type number?","Matthew Nicholls","Yes, I think at the moment, the way we see is the gap reporting is the cleanest way to report our financials. We do obviously have adjustments that we try and highlight in our prepared remarks. But until we take one step further in complexity, we intend to keep it as it is and just make sure we have as helpful prepared remarks as possible. And we have our Chief Accounting Officer Gwen with us also at the table who is staring at me from the right [indiscernible]. So yes, we are sticky with GAAP finance. So we do something more complex.","Patrick Davitt","Fair enough. Thank you.","Matthew Nicholls","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is now live.","Daniel Fannon","Thanks. I guess just to follow-up on that question on just to clarify here for the fiscal 2020 expenses, inclusive of BSP that's on a fully loaded 19 number or it's going to be flat?","Gregory Johnson","Correct, yes.","Daniel Fannon","Okay. And then just a follow-up on kind of the commentary at the beginning in the prepared remarks around kind of some of the changes you've made, obviously you talked a bit about the global equity with there also changes on the fixed income side so curious if you anticipate any changes or I should see any push back from consultants are intermediaries around some of these changes are just kind of flush out a little more detail kind of what you guys have done so because I'm sure you know internally is probably much bigger deal, but externally it's a little hard to see what you guys actually are doing in terms of some of these changes.","Jennifer Johnson","I mean I say one thing is as a firm that has long tenured investment people, people do come to the end of the career and choose to retire and I think none of these have been a surprise around that. Having said that bringing in Sandy Naren on the Templeton Global Equity Group and having sort of to say as a new CIO, they're going to put their own stamp on the investment process and so the feedback, it always takes a while and people puts you on kind of a wait and see as the process the changes.","We had good feedback and that we were very proactive in reaching out I think over 200 institutional clients on the Templeton team to explain the changes. On the fixed income, creating this quantitative Insights Group actually we've had it somewhat internally, but what Dr. Selma [ph] decided when she came in is recognizing that there was opportunity to leverage the Group more broadly across the very fixed income teams in addition to that, while we had acquired Random Forest and we're incorporating data science in some of our fixed-income groups, there is obviously opportunity to continue to do that. And so, by having Roger based just focused on data science and really kind of new Fintech investment opportunities as well as the quantitative strategies, it really highlights and make sure that as a firm, we have the focus on that.","So we really view it as strong evolution in the investment process, I don't think anybody could sit that out there and think that they're going to not evolve with the way information is now available in technology and data evolve their investment process to incorporate this until we really see it as a natural evolution, but in a time where things are evolving quickly. So far it's been well received, but it always takes time -- little time for these things to settle.","Gregory Johnson","And I think it's your question reminds me that old Mark Twain [ph] line of a mall for progress it's change, I don't like. And I think we recognize that these are some take it in a very positive way, some are a little more cautious. And at the end of the day it could cost you short term, some business, but we think it's the right, these are the right moves to put us on the strongest footing going forward and that's I think the way we have to look at the business.","Daniel Fannon","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bill Katz from Citi. Your line is now live.","Bill Katz","Okay, thank you very much for taking the questions. Most of my questions have been asked already. Just on staying on flows for a moment, appreciate the ins and outs on the institutional side just sort of wondering if you could speak to what you've seen in the month for retail made by asset class or by geography.","Jennifer Johnson","So on the retail side, on that from an asset class, I mean the areas that we're seeing positive flows are tax free, fixed income, the global and international fixed income. The positive on sort of the Franklin equity side, we've made some big investments in personnel on the U.S. retail side to have a focus on, we talked about the New York Stock Exchange channel and in last quarter I think we had a 26% uptick in sales there and we're continuing to see progress there. We're seeing progress and traction on the SMA business. We've had some good wins on the collective investment trusts in the -- it with our partnership with Wilmington Trust. So areas that we have focused on you know with some hires and new personnel, we're seeing some really good traction, it's still early in that process, but we're seeing good traction there and then of course our Dynetek fund, which I think is in the top decile 1, 3, 5 and 10 year is having -- it had its greatest quarter yet as far as net flows\u2026","Gregory Johnson","Was that the question, Bill? I mean were you talking about this closed July or I couldn't quite\u2026","Bill Katz","I appreciate the strategic answer but I was hoping to gather more of a tactical update about how July was looking maybe on a net basis.","Gregory Johnson","Yes, I mean I don't I think it's the market have been relatively stable through that, so the trends that you're seeing are continuing with uncertainty on the retail side with tax, I think is the one that's emerging and has gone from $2 billion in outflows, a few quarters ago to close to a $1 billion in inflows this quarter. So that's a pretty big reversal and then U.S. equities continue to be strong as well as multi-asset balance. But nothing and I wouldn't call out anything I think global bonds has had a little bit of a short term underperformance, so that may affect things in the short run as a perception of rates and the Fed cutting rates versus our position generally which has been more position for a rising rate environment. But with that said I think that fund has done very well with its other big bets, so it's not a big drag on the fund. But nothing I think I wouldn't really call it any big changes in terms of just the retail fund flows.","Bill Katz","Okay, that's helpful and thanks for the combined answer. And just as a follow-up let's come back to fiscal 2020 expenses for a moment, I guess as I look at the last couple of conference calls and sort of reread some of the transcript in the dialog about the Q&A. It does seem to be a little bit of a difference of how you sort of think about fiscal 2020 today versus maybe where we were three months ago. So is it really now a sort of a flat to slightly lower as you had tried to ring fence that and within that the annualized savings that you highlighted in your prepared remarks earlier. Is that what's the timeline to sort of getting to those savings?","Matthew Nicholls","Hey. Hi, Bill, it's Matthew. I think a couple of things there. First of all our guidance has changed a little bit in the sense of bringing it down a fraction. I don't want to overstate that it really is a fraction. So I think beforehand we were talking about it being marginally higher now we're marginally lower. So that's the first point. That includes by the way and this triangulates back to some of the questions on capital management, it does include some meaningful investments that we continue to make organically around multi-asset business data, science technology and so on that that Jenny referred to. So while we are very disciplined around our expenses, we're also making sure that doesn't compromise the growth strategy that we have internally around our capital. So that's the 2020 answer. Did you have another question on 2020?","Bill Katz","No, that's helpful and having met all the tax guides you gave for the fourth quarter. Is that a fair look forward into fiscal 2020 or is it an opportunity to bring that down even more?","Matthew Nicholls","Yes, I think actually there was I read all of the initial preliminary reports this morning and I think there was a bit of confusion around the tax rate, so I just want to clarify what we meant and what's in the prepared remarks. So inclusive that the revision that we talked about in this quarter, we estimate that our fourth quarter tax rate will be between 22% to 22.5%. That means the full-year 2019 tax rate would be between 26.5% and 27%, the 21% to 22% that we referred to is referencing 2020 onwards.","Bill Katz","That's great. Thank you very much. That's perfect. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you, our next question is coming from Mike Carrier from Bank of America. Your line is now live.","Michael Carrier","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First one just on the expenses the amount you mentioned on the guidance for 2020, I guess just maybe longer term and bigger picture, how are you thinking about your margins in the business over time just given the focus on efficiencies yet some of the investments that you're making in some of the flow trends that you guys are facing currently?","Matthew Nicholls","Look we're obviously as a business focused on running our margins to go back up. I'm not going to give any guidance on that. I mean we have reported that if you exclude the non-recurring items that our margin is closer to 29% or just above 29%, we'd obviously like for it to be higher than that. But we can't let that impact what our long-term strategy as a company and the investments that we need to make to achieve some of the things that Jenny and Greg talked about. We're very focused on investing for the future while being incredibly disciplined around expenses. We already have a new budget process that we're putting in place right now. We've been working through that and that is all about making sure that we stay on top of our expenses. But at the same time making sure we have enough investment dollars to recirculate into the business as I described a moment ago and that's why we're fairly comfortable with the guidance we're giving on 2020. Well I should say it is early days.","Michael Carrier","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the flow side, I think you guys flagged few known institutional platform redemptions in July. Greg I think you mentioned maybe in that $4 billion range. And then on the growth side you guys mentioned the $2 billion pipeline and then some traction on the solutions maybe just provide an update and some additional color on where you're seeing like increased demand. You've given whether it's the performance that you're seeing in some of the products seeing improvement or some of the investments that you have made over the past few years and where you're starting to see more progress or traction there?","Gregory Johnson","Yes, I mean I think Jenny mentioned we made a pretty significant investment just to restructure some of the U.S. retail and New York Stock Exchange focused generalization and more specialization and we saw pretty good pickup year-to-date there of about 24% I think or something. In sales I think if you look at just market share despite flow numbers I think in the last quarter something like four out of six or four out of five of our major categories, we picked up market share and I think that's a result of a lot of different things that we've been doing that we've been talking about, I think over the last year that we've seen some additional investment there.","I think where scale comes to play for a business, our size is really the business than being in the solutions business in a real way and then taking all these capabilities into separately managed accounts or asset allocation and that that's a big push right now that we think there's only a few people that can do that and we think that's going to continue to be a very strong growth area for the business outside of the traditional fund side but I'll ask Jenny if she wants to add anything.","Jennifer Johnson","No, I think that's right, and I think the model portfolios we've had some wins on model portfolios and one of our advantages is that we allow open architecture models, so we have some internally and sleeves that are internal with some portion external and so having that real solutions business both with the breadth of capability that we have as a firm as well as due diligence team that can evaluate outside managers, I think has been given us that advantage in that area. And I think that the SMA business is an opportunity for us. It was just in the last four months that we got approval from our board to do some kind of completion type funds that we think can take a strategy like the income fund strategy and be able to sell it through the SMA channel. And so we think that that will pick up there.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.","Alexander Blostein","Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks. Just another one around M&A for you guys. Just your comments around targeting either kind of distribution channels or continue to expand in the alternative space have been pretty consistent for the last couple of quarters. Curious to get your thoughts on your appetite for deals for most of the traditional products where you might still have some product gaps whether it's on the kind of core equity growth side or some of the fixed income core plus type of products or money market fund, so some of the gaps in some of the traditional products and the appetites there? Thanks.","Gregory Johnson","Yes, I just say all the above of your list. You hit it pretty, pretty accurately.","Matthew Nicholls","Yes, exactly I was going to say I think one of the points I made earlier on was accelerating and certain investment objectives. We have practically everything but there are some areas and you just referenced a couple of them right there that we should be much larger in. So yes we're very, very focused on this.","Alexander Blostein","Great, thanks. And then just the question around capital returns, I think in your release you talked about targeting 100% payout going forward. Is that on a GAAP net income basis because you're non-operating could be pretty lumpy, so I'm just kind of curious how that plays into the kind of the more tactical capital returns given some of the volatility in the non-operating income side?","Matthew Nicholls","Yes, GAAP net income and target 100%.","Alexander Blostein","Great, thanks so much.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question is coming from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks very much. Most of my questions have been asked also but maybe just one more on M&A. Some other areas that maybe a potential answers just to get your thoughts, any view on either quantitative strategies or smart beta going up your organic smart beta with an acquisition. And then also you mentioned some distribution in Europe whether there were certain geographies where you could do small acquisitions that you think you could scale into your organization and also get a lot of traction.","So wrapping that together with the timing of M&A and the cash that you have, you've always been patient obviously with a look with M&A, but is there a little bit more of a urgency is the wrong word, but through to be a pickup in appetite to do to deploy that cash sooner rather than later?","Gregory Johnson","Yes, I mean that we use the word action quite deliberately, I mean we're just being very active in assessing the various options that exist, but we're also focusing those down to a handful, instead of getting confused across too many places in to me investment objectives and so on. So we're focused on it.","In terms of timing, we really, we can't put a time on that. We can even put a label on what we're going to do immediately. Next, I think that would be a mistake to do that. These are complicated transactions where small, medium, or large candidly, but our observation is, and we've said this in our prepared remarks is that there is a lot of strategic activity that's being discussed in the asset and wealth space and we are very well positioned to capitalize on that when we find something that fits well with us.","So when that exactly is that I don't think it's the right thing to comment on but if we find something sooner rather than later, we will act upon it. And I would just add to I mean timing when you're making large, larger bets on asset classes. The performance and net flows will be secondary to what the markets do over the, over the next cycle. So that's important, it's a hard thing to do to anticipate but I think you just don't want to and then that's back to Matt these point of not blowing out blowing the balance sheet up or that your capital reserves by making a big bet on a market segment when we're near ten of the expansion. I think those are just factors that you have to weigh in to be prudent about where we make our strategic bets and I think if you see a smaller one less correlated you could move probably quicker or one where you use a little bit more equity in there to get new categories and get some scale out of it that would work as well.","Jennifer Johnson","And I'd be remiss but in take this opportunity to plug the smart beta team that we have because it's, got stellar performance and it's been our fastest growth area, in our ETF space as well as some of our separate accounts. So from that I think that we would probably not be a buyer. We would continue to grow what we have.","Brian Bedell","And that's great color, yes, maybe, just one other and related follow-up would be on Matthew your view of potentially outsourcing some of the administrative and back office fund functions as opposed to running them into and I know you've used the scale internally over a long-term period to maximize that, but is there any kind of change of view potentially in doing that going forward?","Matthew Nicholls","So we already announced the outsourcing of our fund administration as you know and in fact that brings you back to answer the second part of Bill Katz's question which I didn't answer, which was about the cost savings that we announced of between, I think we said between $80 million and $85 million and I just want to be clear, I think those question was, how much of that we going to achieve in 2020. I think the answer for that is about $70 million to $75 million fully in 2020 - fiscal 2020 that is.","The reason why those 10 missing from that is the other 10 is associated with the fund administration outsourcing, which we expect to save around that amount from 2021 because obviously that takes some time to implement. In terms of going further than that, we don't intend to outsource anything else at this time, but of course we continue to review our options around technology to be as efficient as we can. But right now we\u2026","Jennifer Johnson","Well, I would just say that our philosophy hasn't been necessarily that it has to be in-house for outsource it has been in many ways it - you do it as efficiently and cost effectively as you can. It was historically difficult to find outsourced providers that have the global footprint that we do. And because we were aggressive in leveraging low cost locations to support our business, it was -- it didn't make sense economically to do it, that is changing over time. And as that evolves, we always look at what makes the most sense for this business. So it is something we evaluate. And that's where we concluded with the fund administration, although we had looked at that many times before and concluded, it wasn't cost-effective at that point. But now the things have changed.","Gregory Johnson","Yes. And also, earlier on that there wasn't a provider that existed that could serve what we needed to be served in front of administrations for that change. So, we took the action that we did, so same thing happens with transparency in the future, maybe that changes our view of that.","Brian Bedell","And is fund accounting looped in with fund administration?","Jennifer Johnson","Yes, yes.","Gregory Johnson","Yes.","Brian Bedell","Okay. It's okay, great. Okay. Thanks so much for all that detail. Really appreciate it.","Gregory Johnson","Thanks, Brain.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now live.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, just one here. So, you guys have spoken a bit about the elevated quarter day redemptions and some of these strategies. Did these strategies happen to overlap with any of the organizational changes and staffing adjustments that you flagged to PM teams?","Jennifer Johnson","Did the redemptions have, is that -- is your question, did the -- were the redemption specifically the results of the organizational changes? If that's your question, no, the redemption -- ","Brennan Hawken","Or did they just overlap with the PM teams that were impacted by those adjustments?","Jennifer Johnson","They did overlap, but they would. For example, one of the large redemptions was a result of a firm that had been acquired in the decision for them to bring the asset management business in house. So while it was, I believe, a global equity mandate, it wasn't correlated or anything to do with the PM changes? It was really because they had made a strategic decision to bring the assets in house.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, got it.","Gregory Johnson","And most of these changes were announced just recently.","Jennifer Johnson","Yes, yes.","Gregory Johnson","So it wouldn't be reflected in this quarter anyway on the PM changes.","Matthew Nicholls","Yes, I was referring to -- ","Brennan Hawken","Oh, you were saying that a result of the redemptions? You're making these changes that\u2026","Matthew Nicholls","No, I was referring to the July color but I'm thinking that maybe, there might be something\u2026","Brennan Hawken","All right. All right. Okay.","Matthew Nicholls","Right, that we should prep for.","Gregory Johnson","Yes, I mean, I think we expect some, but I think at the end of the day, this category, the devalued categories just under tremendous pressure of underperforming core and growth over the cycle. So I think the people that are left believe that this is a safe way to protect the portfolio that you really have, you've read the article, you have never seen more common holdings across active managers today than ever, where 50 top stocks are held by just about every fund. That's not the case with these, and I think, there are investors who like the fact that, you own a portfolio at 12, 13 times earnings and much more defensive and I would say Templeton today, if anything in the last quarter even got more defensive in their positioning where markets are. So I think at the end of the day, they will stand out, when you have a downturn or rent interest rates rise and growths under pressure.","Brennan Hawken","Yes, those of us to cover financials can commiserate.","Gregory Johnson","Yes.","Brennan Hawken","Thanks for taking the questions.","Gregory Johnson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is now live.","Robert Lee","Great, thanks. Thanks for your patience. And Matt, welcome and good luck. Just a real quick question most of mine been asked but going back to the recurring M&A and strategic and organic growth. I'm just curious as you think about it, there any change in terms of your willingness to think of in a different ownership structures. I mean historically, like with benefits treat pretty much of -- then 100% acquirers, some competitors are more willing to do, majority ownership transaction. So as you think of the landscape, maybe particularly in the alternative space, there are also a shift taking place and your willingness to think of different structures that you've done historically?","Jennifer Johnson","Well, I'll say that there's, we have some situations of joint ventures, I mean, actually, internationally, there'll be markets where we make decisions around, it's better to partner than it is to own 100% because maybe it's a difficult market for foreign manager, so we have an openness to that. Having said that, one of the things that has made us successful acquisitions is that we keep the independence of the investment team, and we take advantage and leverage all the support capabilities. And that's where you get real scale out of it. And so when you leave it independent and you see it with managers out there, you don't get that benefit. And you get confusion around distribution and you get a lack of commitment, and the conversation doesn't get as focused on the investment team. But obviously in the alternative business you have to structure compensation appropriately even when you have 100% ownership. So we're cognizant of that. And if it made sense we would do it, so like I said, we're not completely against it, but it is complicated to try to manage a JV much more so than it is when you have a 100% ownership.","Gregory Johnson","Yes, and I think that that's probably a great summary on the distribution side somebody brought up or you opened and we've talked about that. And certainly minority stake in a captive market with captive distribution for a platform makes a lot of sense to own. But as Jenny said, I think creating a corporate culture and integrating and getting really all the leverage from what we offer as a global platform from the distribution and servicing side is very difficult when you own 60% or 70%, it just gets very complicated. You spend a lot of energy on things that really are not that production.","Matthew Nicholls","Yes, I mean subscale transactions along those lines really don't make any sense to us at all. And I think anything around M&A, from a financial perspective, this is sort of needless to say in a way, but we would expect the margin to be accretive to us. So we are absolutely driven around M&A by growth and diversification versus cost cutting, but obviously some of the larger transactions do come with very significant margin improvement opportunities.","Robert Lee","Great, I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Matthew Nicholls","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.","Michael Cyprys","Hey, good morning. Thanks for your clarifications and taking the question. So you've made some senior-level additions and organizational changes. I guess as you look forward from here, what additional hiring are you making and other potential changes that could make sense next as you're focused on optimizing the cost structure but also investing for growth? And related to that, as you're thinking about the pace of expense growth beyond 2020, would you envision that being more in line with inflation, how should we be thinking about that?","Gregory Johnson","Well, I would start with -- I mean I think we've made a significant number of hires. I don't think there's anything on the horizon right now that say there's a big gap here or there that -- and I think we spent a lot of time working on succession, and that's the norm for any CIO transitions. So I don't think we have any big plans of adding senior people in the area.","And second part of the question, I'll flip to Matthew.","Matthew Nicholls","Yes, and I think our cost structure will be guided based on how we're doing in the business overall, and where we need to invest, and how we're growing or not.","Michael Cyprys","Great. And just a follow-up, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about your approach in China to sourcing growth there, how that approach is evolving just given some of the recent regulatory changes? I understand you have a JV in China. Is the focus more with the JV partner or any appetite for building outside of the JV, and any sort of color you could share around AUM, flows, staffing, any progress that you can share?","Jennifer Johnson","So we do have a JV, and we're excited about the opportunity to be able to acquire a 100%, and so that -- they've accelerated the pace of that, so we're certainly looking at that. We also have a [indiscernible] there where we have some investment personnel that are out of as well as some kind of support distribution side. The JV has great investment performance, and so they've seen some good flows. It's a difficult market, and it's always more complicated when you're in a JV structure, so we think that there is just great opportunity to own a 100%, and continue to try to grow in China.","Gregory Johnson","And it's about $4 billion to $5 billion, so it's not included in our AUM, and it is profitable, the JV today, but not of the size where we'd like it to be.","Michael Cyprys","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.","Gregory Johnson","Thank you everyone for participating on the call. And we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time. And have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today."],"10208":["Franklin Resources Inc.

Mr. Johnson, you may begin.","Gregory Johnson","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining Ken Lewis and me as we discuss this quarter\u2019s results. I hope you had a chance to read our commentary this morning that you find our written transcript approach providing commentary useful.","Most importantly, investment performance against peers and benchmarks improved significantly this quarter. Although we continue to experience outflows, I believe we are much better positioned to outperform in this environment and we're seeing some early signs of flow improvement.","Once again, we demonstrated effective cost management and extended our track record of annual dividend increases and share repurchases that more than offset compensation related equity issuance in the first quarter.","We'd now like to take any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I guess, maybe, first, in terms of the pending DOL rule implementation set for April, are you seeing kind of activity in advance of the rule changes worth calling out?","I guess, in particular I'm interested to see if you're witnessing any transitions from kind of brokerage to advisory. And I guess, are you set up to do kind of those tax-free exchanges or any transfers from like the A shares, institutional shares? And, really, is there any uptake of that? Thanks.","Gregory Johnson","I mean, I think like everyone we are still preparing for the rule in its current form, but I think like everyone, we expect to see the delay, but haven't heard anything formally. But I think the consensus view right now is that you're looking at least a 6 month to 12 month delay of implementation and I think that that's just something that a lot of the broker dealers and advisors are really digesting right now.","So we do expect a delay. We expect you know, potentially a complete replacement or repeal of the rule. And I think how it affects you know the advisory models over time that remains to be seen. But like everyone we still have to prepare for the existing one.","Ken Worthington","Okay. Great. And then for Ken, the fair value adjustment in G&A, I think that was with regard to K2. Walk us what's going on with K2. It seems with the negative adjustment, it's not all going well with K2 right now. My impression was things were going well. So, what's the fair value adjustment and what's going on?","Kenneth Lewis","Things are going well, when - I think there's a couple of things to consider. Last year we had upward adjustments in that line now downward adjustment, so it\u2019s just quarterly valuation. And I think part of the valuation - large for the valuation relates to the legacy K2 business and not the new business that has resulted from you know, our acquisition.","So on balance, I would say, yes, I think aren\u2019t going well. But you know, the legacy fund-to-funds business a little bit challenged and that probable - that was what the - our models were based on in terms of cash flow when we valued it. So that's where the adjustment comes from. It\u2019s not the whole business - it\u2019s not a reflection of the entire business, just a reflection of the older part of the business.","Ken Worthington","Thanks, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell","Hi, good morning, folks. Maybe just staying on the DOL theme, I know you don't like to give intra-quarter commentary on flows, but obviously with the sharp improvement in performance in the fourth quarter, if you could give us a sense of whether you're seeing that translate into improved sales in January. Obviously, we have seen that in the fourth quarter. Do you see that trend coming through?","And then, just looking at the performance year to date, we do see a reversal of performance for some of the funds just in January. I know it's a very short time period, of course, but you also mentioned in the prepared remarks how there are some advisors that do look at that short-term performance. Maybe if you can give a little bit more color on that.","Gregory Johnson","Yes. I mean, I think first of all, I mean, the larger drivers global bonds and obviously that's been the biggest headwinds in terms of flows, and the rebound in performance and you know, just how that fund is managed against or not managed against the benchmarks that you do see significant swings and you know still a tough quarter for global bond flows, actually had higher outflows, despite you know, you could say while you had very good relative performance, but that relative performance all came right at the very end of the quarter.","So a lot of it just takes time to kind of work its way into the broker dealer, I think you know, network and advisors and in kind of understanding performance. And our big message has been for the last month that here you know, here is bond fund in a quarter where the index down was 7% or 3% depending which aggregate index you are looking at in the bond market and here is the fund that that was up, that provides income.","So that I think puts its - put that - puts that fund in a very unique category that again you know we think when advisors are looking for protection in a deflationary environment that it should do very well. So we would expect to see an improvement there and are seeing an improvement in the short run.","You said well, some of that performance 1300 basis points we got in a very short period, but that's a significant number against the benchmark, given a little bit back on rates declining, but not you maybe 90 basis points of that you know, really in January. So nothing significant\/","I think we are very hopeful that that fund will be viewed very differently in the market, but it does take a little bit of time and that's been a real focus of ours to get - to get that message and get that case study of the quarter of what this fund did in a rising rate environment versus other funds. They did position themselves as flexible, total return, absolute return kind of bond funds. It didn't do well in that environment and you know, I think again that just expands the audience potentially for the global bond fund.","So performance is always a key indicator, I look at the - looking at our six largest funds, every one of them was in the top quartile for the 12 month period and 15 of our 20 largest funds were in the top quartile and that's about as good as we've ever seen for a short period.","Brian Bedell","That's helpful color. And then maybe just, I guess, more broadly on the advisor behavior trends, I mean, I guess, as you talk to your wholesalers, we've been under the impression that there was going to be a lot more implementation ahead of the DOL deadline, before the Trump win, obviously and then now with the uncertainty on the delay of DOL, and on top of that, this perception that active management is going to have a resurgence, you know, again, post Trump the lower cost correlation and higher rates that historically have impacted that.","What are you hearing from your wholesalers in terms of the advisor mood on that and whether advisors are actually going to dally that decision themselves? Or are they moving ahead?","Gregory Johnson","I don't think there's one consistent view. I mean, I think you have a trend that was already in place pre-fiduciary rule of going to you know, more of a planning model, you know, against the advisor pickings individual funds, that's going to continue.","I think the fiduciary rule accelerated that. I think some large firm's favor that rule because it helps them move towards that platform even faster. And that's where you get a little bit of I think some mixed opinions on what to do next.","I think your common around this market, it\u2019s being a more normal market in terms of winners, losers and less correlation and less kind of central bank risk on risk off, it will favor active managers that appeared to happen out last year and that we think will continue to happen and that's why we still remain very optimistic on active investing.","But I think to give one simple answer around fiduciary, I think you get some firms moving ahead like there's no change some that have stopped you kind of us stopping that implementation right now.","But at the end of the day, I look at it from somewhat from an outside view that says you know, anything that took thousand pages to layout a rule that then took months of consultants and the accounts try to figure out what it means.","And then I've seen all these different broker dealers interpret things differently to me that\u2019s not a good rule and one that is very open to trial lawyers to defining what really is the right rule.","And that's not the - I think a good design of a rule and I think that's where you know the industry has to kind of take a step back and front five figure out what problem we're solving and then work from there.","But there really is no one general answer on how the advisor side right now is moving, I think, we get different answers from different groups, almost on a daily basis.","Brian Bedell","Do you see longer term, I guess, if the rule gets restructured, the DOL working with the SEC to restructure that rule back to what it was originally intended to do?","Gregory Johnson","Absolutely, business I think also the intended or unintended consequence of a rule of affecting just retirement is that it tends to affect everything you know, as many again go back and interpret, it\u2019s very difficult to have one segment of your business different from the rest of it.","So it does, I think lend itself to that discussion of you know, is it - is the SEC the appropriate place to provide a rule, but I'd also start with the, do we need a rule you know, as part of that discussion, as well.","And I think that's really where the industry now has to meet with a lot of different groups and kind of determine what is the appropriate next step, but I certainly think that if you decide you really do need a rule that the SEC now is an appropriate place for that to be done.","Brian Bedell","Okay. Thanks for all that color. I'll get back in the queue for a couple follow-ups, thanks.","Gregory Johnson","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes on line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Davitt\u2019","Hey, good morning guys. Thank you. To the point you made earlier about performance changing sales patterns for global bond, I think in the past a few years ago you were talking about when your equity performance had started to get better, that it can take years to really turn the ship in the retail side of things.","Is there something about the degree of outperformance that we saw in the fourth quarter at global bonds that may make the experience different this time? Or do you think this could be a multi-year turning of the ship process like you said in the past?","Gregory Johnson","Yes, I mean, I think it's a little different with this category and just based on what's happening in the amount of assets that think about it, I mean the amounts that has duration risk, you know, in a unique environment and still very low rates, that likes to have income where can you go and that question is being asked right now and you've seen it in floating rate flows and you know, tips and things that tend to do better in a rising rate environment.","So if you do have a kind of non-correlated alternative asset in that category, I think you can turn pretty quickly. I think equities are a little different, it takes a little bit longer because of the consultant driven side of that equation in returns and if you recommended redemptions on its hard, you just put it back in based on what happens in 6 months or 12 months.","But you know, I think this is a different category and the question we hear it everywhere on how do I protect assets in a rising rate environment and here is a case study you can show pretty cleanly that you know, did that in the first real move in rates.","So I think it can move you know, little bit faster than say your traditional equity turnaround.","Patrick Davitt\u2019","Great, that's helpful. And then as the probability of a repatriation holiday increases, has your thinking around the size that you could do and what you could do with it changed, any more specificity there, and to what extent M&A is still on the table?","Gregory Johnson","Yes. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed our philosophy, as we've we talked about on previous calls. We've been optimistic for a while that something\u2019s going to happen. I think probability of that's increased now, as result of the elections, perhaps the size of the dollars that we can bring back increases, but you know, to tell us in the detail when they come out with this law.","And so we have to wait to see what the law says and then evaluate that and what's in the best interest of the shareholders. But it hasn't philosophically changed our point of view.","Patrick Davitt\u2019","And M&A is still something you're looking at or\u2026","Gregory Johnson","Of course, yes, absolutely.","Kenneth Lewis","Yes, I mean, I would say, we look at still the world, I meant - if you have repatriation you factor some level on your cash that you'll pay, let\u2019s says its 15%. So you still have an opportunity to buy something outside the US at 15% cheaper than the trade-off of buying shares back and having that cash onshore.","So I think it's still an attractive time, especially when you look at you know, the euros gotten cheaper, the sterling\u2019s down close to a third over a short period. So those are all factors that still make it attractive for us consider you know, M&A activity in Europe. We haven't put M&A activity on hold.","Patrick Davitt\u2019","Okay. I guess, we've been talking - I guess, we've had that conversation now for a while and there's been no movement, and I understand the bar is probably pretty high. Could you maybe update us on the puts and takes of why nothing's happened? Is it a lack of opportunity that makes sense? Is it pricing? Is it people don't want to sell?","Kenneth Lewis","It\u2019s - we've had these discussions over previous calls\u2026","Patrick Davitt\u2019","Yes\u2026","Kenneth Lewis","We look at so many deal a year, probably dozens, I would say, maybe more. And you know, we have made some and small ones and you know the first thing that we look at is what is our need, with what product needs do we have, what it is can we - there are certain market that there's a will meet a need that we have in a certain market.","And then we look at institutional, the institutional investment process, because you know, key man rescue [ph] is a huge issue in M&A deals. And then lastly, we look at culture, so - and then also price. So you know, those of the factors we've screened through and you know, and a lot of the - a lot of the targets don't have the screen, but some do.","Patrick Davitt\u2019","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of William Katz from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","William Katz","Okay. Thanks very much. I do appreciate the streamlined disclosure. It makes life a little simpler, so thank you for that. A couple questions that come up just from both the commentary and some of the Q&A now. As I look at the gross sales for the franchise, you're running about $24 billion, plus or minus a little bit. It's really nice to see it stabilizing and trend up a little bit.","Any plans to change the ad or marketing spend to potentially capitalize on this that might be able to jump start gross sales anymore? And, if so, any shift in how you might go about doing that between maybe product or distribution or digitalization? How are you thinking these days about that growth?","Gregory Johnson","Well, I think, first of all we have increased our ED exposure over the last six months and we'll probably continue to do that. And I think you know the efforts in distribution that have been well underway on continuing to build out a digital strategy and combine the - we've had outbound sales groups that are now being combined with the traditional wholesaler you know, those efforts will continue and ultimately the goal is to reach more advisors in a cost-efficient manner and use technology to do that and that's something that we've been pushing hard for a while.","But I like it is you know, it's a fair question just around advertising and building out also the consultant side of our business on the retail and continue to invest there, especially as the advisors are narrowing the funnel of funds they're going to deal with that we need to make sure that we're providing the best level of institutional service there.","So those are the areas that we're going to continue to I think invest in, but I think that's a discussion we'll have as well - upping the strategic kind of spend near-term on the advertising from where it is.","William Katz","Okay. And just playing devil's advocate for a moment, you were very successful in gathering assets for the gold bond fund in the up cycle, but I think one of the constraints on the stock was the asymmetry that created for the franchise. Presuming you were at the early stages of a potential recovery from here, any behavior, any strategic decisions to potentially limit the amount of AUM that could come back into the platform? Or no?","Gregory Johnson","Yes, I hope that's a problem we have, but reality I mean, I think if you look at the conditions that led to that that kind of flow, I think it\u2019s going to be very difficult. If you look at when the global bond really took off, that was a period where it had an average annual return of 10% a year against the lost decade of equities.","So it was in a position that that - and it was also the top-performing fund - that of any type of fund for that decade as well. So those are you know, pretty unique set of circumstances to have from a marketing side that I'm not sure you're going to have.","Again, I also think the - that the volatility of the fund that you always talk about it and want to make sure investors understand the risks that they're getting for that return, but the reality is you don't control all of the sales and I'm sure some of the sales were done like a more traditional low volatility type investment when it probably is more like a global macro and now that we've gone through a cycle you know, where investors have held and seen the volatility, that may or may not be attractive to certain investors.","So they have that experience now in a new asset category. So I don't think you're going to see the kind of explosive growth because of that volatility, but I do think that you'll see steadier growth and hopefully the kind of investors that can withstand those kind of moves up and down that you could have.","William Katz","Okay. And just one last one. Thanks for taking the questions this morning. In the, I think, press release or maybe your commentary - your commentary, I guess - you had mentioned that commissionable sales were down, I think about 15% or so, from prior quarters. As you look forward, maybe DOL goes through, maybe it doesn't, how does that impact the mix shift of the business and the blended fee rate, leaving aside market FX impact, all else being equal?","Gregory Johnson","Repeat the question one more time please.","William Katz","Sure. I read, I think it was in your supplement, where you suggested that your commissionable sales segment was down, part of the issue is that was down about 15% versus some prior quarter comparison. If that were to persist, what does that mean for the fee rate for the Company, leaving aside - I understand markets and FX can be very big swing factors but leaving those aside for a moment?","Gregory Johnson","Right, okay. So the FX part, so leaving that aside, I would just generally talk about the effect of fee rate, because I don't - I think there are some positive signs in the traditional business in terms of sales, the global equity sales were good this quarter.","So you know, we do see pressure on effective fee rate, gradual pressure, though, I don't think there's going to be anything significant, but over the years, forward, we do expect to see our effective fee rates to come down a little bit and we've seen that in the last year or two.","Some of that has to do with just the product mix, so whether its fixed income, more fixed income, you know, more fixed income at the expense of say in emerging markets mix that will drive us down. Some of it would have to do with the mix of retail and institutional, institutional tends to have lower rates, supplemented by performance fees.","So you know, it\u2019s all of those things put together, but generally I think that's a fair statement to that we're seeing the effective fee rate decline gradually.","William Katz","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Brennan Hawken","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Can you guys please update on how much AUM there is left in the sub advise VA? I know there's the pending roughly $4.5 billion redemption here in Q1 still expected, right?","Gregory Johnson","Yes, that's right. And I think it\u2019s right around 44, right now. So after this next quarter around 40.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, terrific. Thank you\u2026","Gregory Johnson","And we'll keep you posted as - as we see the - if there's any probable redemptions, we'll keep you posted on that\u2026","Brennan Hawken","Excellent. And then thinking about G&A on the expense side, if we add back the $12 million-or so one-timer that was referred to earlier, is that the right jumping off point? And I know that this quarter was seasonally lower than last quarter, but it looks like, generally, there is even further typical seasonal declines over the next quarter or two. Should we expect that off of that now lower jumping off point than we have seen in previous?","Gregory Johnson","Yes, I think there are some - there were some other things in G&A this quarter that were seasonally depressed the number or reduce the number, one of them was advertising and we do expect that to ramp up, that was probably about $8 million, less than last quarter.","And that is an annual seasonal thing that we see, where it ramps up in the fourth quarter. So that would continue - we would expect that to continue this year, professional fees was little bit down. We expect that to come back this year.","But as I mentioned in my comments, when you look at all the expenses, we're looking, we're expecting expenses to be down around 2% year-over-year.","Brennan Hawken","And that was for all of the expenses, not purely for G&A, right?","Gregory Johnson","That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s correct.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Carrier","Hi. Thanks, guys. Greg, maybe just on the variable annuity, you mentioned there's new products, I think, on the solutions side that you guys have been working on. Just wanted to get a sense. When you think about that $40 billion and some of the new things you guys are coming up with, if you're starting to see any traction or demand versus the reasons or the rationale for the assets leaving, and if some of these things can start to stem that trend?","Gregory Johnson","Yes. I mean, I think it\u2019s - part of it is that you have firms that have exited the business, that are in a wind down mode. So it's really how do I manage this liability that the insurance carrier has, so you\u2019ve seen a lot of lower volatility or more transparent products that they can hedge, the risk out on those are really versus a traditional active fund, it\u2019s harder to hedge.","So you know, we have developed some lower volatility funds. We have actually gotten some wins in that and hope we can continue to grow that. But you know, I think to expect - and I think our guys are fairly optimistic on the potential there on this change to get some new assets from others as well. I just don't have a sense for what the probability of that is and can that that offset a potential a decline of another $20 billion, who knows, I don't know.","But I think whenever there's change like that there's opportunity and we have developed products there. We are getting some wins in the 100 million, 200 million range, but we need some bigger ones to offset the other numbers.","Michael Carrier","Okay. And then just a follow-up, it seemed during the quarter the performance overall was very strong. And when we track it, I think on the fund side it looked like it was, on a blended basis, up maybe 2%. But in the fund table it seems like the market appreciation was very muted.","So, I'm just trying to figure out, was there something on the institutional side, was it FX, was there anything on the distribution side in the quarter? I know we have that line in there now. But I'm just trying to understand. It seemed like the performance versus the appreciation in the table isn't lining up.","Gregory Johnson","Yes, and there was some affects in the numbers this quarter, related to you know, assets under management in non-US dollar price funds and that almost $5 billion in the quarter.","Michael Carrier","Okay. It just seems more pronounced but maybe we can follow-up. Thanks a lot.","Gregory Johnson","Yes, and distributions are not in that number where there were before, that you're looking at quarter-to-quarter, because of changed.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee from KBD. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee","Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Gregory Johnson","Morning.","Robert Lee","Just another capital management question. Share repurchases continued at a pretty high rate, $7 million this quarter. It's been running above your US cash generation for a while now. So, can you just give us a sense of, assuming your appetite is still there for share repurchase at a high rate, how much more capacity you have to continue to repurchase or return capital above what you're generating in the US, obviously excluding any potential repatriation holiday or what not?","Gregory Johnson","Yes. I think one of the things that's happening is the mix of the earnings, US and non-US is increasing, so our US cash flow is increasing. I mean, that\u2019s a function of the increase in assets under management for funds managed in the US. That's something that you might not see, right away, but you'll see over time in the disclosures.","And so we feel pretty comfortable that we could continue our share repurchase activity for you know, at least the short-term one year period, with no problems.","Robert Lee","Okay, great. Then maybe a quick follow-up. I know you mentioned in the prepared remarks a little bit about, almost in passing, a non-managed volatility product for the insurance channel. But, more broadly, the one thing we don't hear maybe quite as much from you guys every quarter is where you stand with expanding the franchise into - I guess it's called non-traditional strategies, whether it's the managed vol [ph] products, whether it's alternative products.","Could you maybe update us and, number one, roughly size how big maybe some of those buckets may be, what they are, and what your plans are, or at least the sales trends have been in those areas?","Gregory Johnson","I mean, I don't - we don't have that in front of us on the breakdown. I think in terms of the commitment, I mean, we think that's going to continue to be an important part of our growth strategy, especially as you know the industry battles the traditional active passive and wherever we can you know add less correlated type assets to that fold and that's going to important that are also less - that are harder to replicate.","So we have a lot of investments made in a lot of different areas and a lot of funds, but I just don't have the rolled up number here, I mean, we're in private equity and real estate and a lot of - what some would call traditional alternatives, but I just don't know what that number would look like\u2026","Kenneth Lewis","It\u2019s clearly a strategic priority we're looking at, you know, our business right now, in the alternative side the solution side, that we have the right products in place, [indiscernible] in place, is that an area we want to focus on in M&A that\u2019s probably you know, if we were to do M&A acquisitions that be clearly an area that we would focus on versus traditional assets under management.","So, kind of it\u2019s definitely priority for us, and we recognize that segment of the market that presents opportunities for us.","Robert Lee","Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Harris","Thanks, guys. You sound a little optimistic on the institutional pipeline. Just wondering if you guys can talk a little bit about the breadth of that and anything else that might help us gauge the size of potential things that might be coming in.","Kenneth Lewis","I mean, I think it looks like it's more from the pipeline - you kind of global lag emerging markets, local currencies, you know we are getting a lot of interest as good numbers and those can result in some larger type wins, probably a little bit lower fees, but in terms of assets bigger. So that's really where we're seeing.","I don't - we don't really present a number and probability like some others do for the quarter, but you know, it\u2019s certainly you know - that's the area that that we are currently have a lot of searches that are underway in presentations and identified some probable wins in the next quarter, those two categories.","Chris Harris","Okay. And then the discussion around the fee rate, you'd mentioned safe to assume long-term pressure there. But if we do see a pretty dramatic recovery in global bond, is it safe to assume under that scenario that's going to put a pretty big upward bias on your fee rate? I believe that tends to be one of your higher fee products.","Kenneth Lewis","Yeah, I would say that it would mitigate any further down pressure on the fee rate versus actually increasing it.","Chris Harris","Okay. All right Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Cyprys","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious how you're thinking about possibly using greater use of performance fees in your products on the retail and institutional side. Just any thoughts you could update us on there.","Kenneth Lewis","I think that's something we talked about last quarter as well. And I think with the pressure on fees, the pressure on any fiduciary's, whether endowments and people doing searches you know, the - I think the probability for us of doing more around performance fees is very high.","We have actually been doing some pricing on institutional mandates going in areas certain, I think more outside the US with some sovereign wealth fund and things, but that's something that we think can be I think a very useful answer to some of these high pressures around just these and rationalizing versus passive is only paying on the alpha and that's something you know, that we certainly are looking at.","I don't think we have the same kind of pressure on the retail side, nor do we think that it makes a lot of sense certainly on institutional side, that's you know, we think that could be very additive to our overall lineup.","Michael Cyprys","Okay, great. Just as a follow-up to the topic on sub-advisory, just curious how you're thinking about the opportunity there for gathering assets. If you could just update us a little bit on pricing levels within sub-advisory. Where is that today? And how are you thinking about pricing pressure in sub-advisory versus other parts of your business and retail versus institutional?","Kenneth Lewis","Yes, I mean, I think the sub-advisories model it\u2019s one that we've been very open to and you know, certainly look at places like Japan where that that really is the business model that we are pursuing. I think there's always some restrictions on how aggressive you can be, there is certain mandates that come in and clearly you could probably rationalize that on individual basis, which can't rationalize it against you know, your pricing of other products in that category.","So you are somewhat limited by your retail pricing on how aggressive you can be in sub-advisory model and that's where we look at, whether it makes sense of bringing in more institutionally oriented boutiques that can again be more flexible on pricing and not have the issue you know, of 40 act funds ag [ph] behind it. That\u2019s something that when we look at our M&A strategy is something that you know, I think we think can make a lot of sense.","Michael Cyprys","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell","Thanks for taking my follow-ups. Maybe just, Ken, to go back on the expense commentary. I just want to make sure I have that right. The expenses down 2%. Is that excluding the sales and distribution and marketing expense? So, instead of the $4.2 billion\u2026","Kenneth Lewis","Thanks for the follow-up. And regarding you know, I look at - when I look at sales and distribution, I look at the revenue, net of the expenses and you know, that number, we expect that number - that net number which is in the kind of an appendix to the presentation, give you some detail on that, we expect that to be more or less flat, but probably increasingly the latter part of the year and given current AUM levels and of course that\u2019s a function of sales and all that.","But the current AUM levels, we expect that line to be fairly consistent with maybe an upward trend later in the year.","Brian Bedell","This is the appendix on slide 25?","Kenneth Lewis","I am going to say that you are correct there. It\u2019s in the back there.","Brian Bedell","In sales and distribution summary, right? Okay.","Kenneth Lewis","I think it was about 100 this quarter.","Brian Bedell","Yes. And again you expect it to go up a little bit?","Kenneth Lewis","So what my comments were about the non-sales and distribution lines before.","Brian Bedell","Right, right. Okay. Actually, one other clarification on repatriation. I think you said this a couple quarters ago in terms of the amount of cash that you thought was available to repatriate. I thought it was around $6.5 billion. And then I think you just said that might increase. Do you have an updated number of that?","Kenneth Lewis","No, I think it\u2019s still pretty close to that number.","Brian Bedell","Okay. And then maybe just one last one on the fee rate compression commentary, your expectation for that. You mentioned that it's mix. Is it really your expectation that the mix will shift towards more institutional channels or are there other product mix by strategy baked into that assumption?","Kenneth Lewis","Well, yes, it\u2019s a combination of both, so if you go back in time when global equity in this firm was a big part of AUM, we had a higher effective fee rate because they are higher a fee earning products.","The other dynamic is - and this is more accounting numbers t than economics, but if we have increased AUM internationally, that will that will put up the pressure on the effective fee rate, because that effective fee rate covers distribution expenses where in the states all that's bifurcated in different revenue streams and then the last thing is the channel mix, whether it's retail or institutional.","It\u2019s hard to say, but just projecting out where we are today, we do see maybe a basis point year, or something like that, not very much.","Brian Bedell","Right. And then baked into those assumptions, you are - this is to a prior question about considering reducing some fees and replacing those with performance fees on the institutional side-- is that also baked into this assumption or would that be over and above?","Kenneth Lewis","Not really because you know its early days for that. And I don't know if that would move the needle it. We were just making the commentary that you might see some additional performance fee income that you haven't seen in the past for us, right, for early days.","Brian Bedell","Great, great. Thanks for taking my follow up.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Ari Ghosh","Hi, good morning, guys. This is Ari Ghosh filling in for Craig. Just a quick one on fees. Have you lowered pricing on any of your retail funds over the last few quarters, either with expense caps, fee waivers or straight fee cuts? Thanks.","Kenneth Lewis","I think there is been a few reductions, I think there is been some in emerging markets, as well as we lowered some of our UK retail funds, but nothing in the larger. And I think meal most of our bigger funds are still below average in terms of fees relative to the group. So it's just really the ones that we're positioned above the market that we you know, we've taken down.","Ari Ghosh","Got it. And just in terms of magnitude, like percentage of AUM, can you provide a number?","Kenneth Lewis","Yes, was not a bit maybe, the UK ones were relatively small and still the emerging markets were a huge number. So very - that mean 1% or less\u2026.","Ari Ghosh","Got it\u2026","Kenneth Lewis","That it would have affected of assets.","Ari Ghosh","Got it. Thanks.","Kenneth Lewis","Okay.","Operator","There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back over to management for closing comments.","Gregory Johnson","Well, thank you everyone for attending the call today. And again, we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

My name is John, and I'll be are conference operator today.","Statements made in this conference call regarding Franklin Resources Inc. which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking time to join us today. We know it's a busy day for all of you. With me today is Ken Lewis, our CFO; as well as Chris Molumphy, the Chief Investment Officer at Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group. I asked Chris to join us this morning in case there are any follow-up questions from his comments in the recorded commentary, which we made available this morning.","To quickly recap the highlights this quarter, it was another strong quarter, highlighted by strong relative performance, significant improvement, net new flows and new highs for operating income, net income and earnings per share.","I'd now like to open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Mark Deluzio - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Mark Deluzio here for Craig. You mentioned that K2 had positive inflows of $500 million in the quarter. Has this momentum continued in April and is there any visibility on the pipeline of won but not yet funded business there?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think we're careful about talking about the next quarter, but there's plenty of things that they've been working on the pipeline, so it looks healthy. So we continue to be optimistic about that area.","Mark Deluzio - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. A quick follow-up there. Has there been any traction with the 1940 Act, fund-to-funds product or any possible retail products from your alternatives business?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, yes, like many -- that's something we are looking at right now. It's an natural extension of what K2 does and there are funds available to put in a fund-to-funds that have liquidity and transparency for 40 Act Funds, so that's something that is in the planning stages for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Kelley from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was just hoping to touch base with you on your Global Equity platform and just -- you had modestly positive inflows for the quarter, pretty strong performance, so I was just curious if you can kind of tease that out for us where are you seeing the strongest inflows and maybe a little bit by channel, too. Who's buying more and who's -- where the stronger redemptions are as well for the first quarter?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I think it's -- if you look at the quarter-over-quarter flows, the big switch was Asian Growth Fund and that's been a big driver. Much of that is raised in Europe through our SICAV funds and that had a very strong quarter. Another is the Frontier equity, which is, again, just an extension of the emerging markets side, which has done very well. Also, Asia small cap has done very well. The Templeton's improved but continues to be in net redemptions despite strong performance. And Mutual Discovery at Mutual rebounded the positive flows, which has -- that's been a major driver for us over the last 5 years or so. So it was good to see that one coming back. So I think just the retail tends to take the longest. We also had some decent institutional wins that funded in Global Equity as well. But really, the U.S. retail, despite good performance, it's just -- it's a longer turnaround.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just to follow up on that point, what are you seeing from institutional clients in terms of use of the barbell with alternatives and passives? Is that something you're seeing increase or kind of steady-state or what are you seeing there?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I don't -- I'm not sure we'd seen a big shift. I mean, I think there's plenty of talk about increasing alternatives and looking for potentially more alpha and higher returns. For us, it's still relatively limited in the amount of searches that we're going to participate there, so it's not really core. We're not seeing a big switch on the passive side from international equity, from Global Equity, like we are in more of the U.S. equity business. So I think they're -- it's still a challenge with passive on Global Equity side, but not -- we're not nearly as much as on your typical, like large-cap growth in the U.S.","Operator","Our next question comes from Luke Montgomery from Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","How much of your industry-leading margin do you attribute to the Global scale, the Templeton Global Bond product? And how should we think about the incremental margin and the strategy at that point? And if we were really trying to dimension the  [indiscernible] -- the concentration risks, what would be the impact on the margin if you lost a significant chunk of those assets?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","A couple of things. I don't -- I wouldn't necessarily attribute the overall profitability to any one product, but the scale, you're definitely right on about the scale. So we see that scale, the benefits of the scale with our international business to the extent that we're distributing the products using our SICAV umbrella and the same thing in the U.S. So I don't think that -- if you look back in our history, you can look at the margins. We've put a new slide in there this quarter. You could see, if you tracked -- and we have 2 slides in there that's new, which shows the top-selling funds over a period of time and then it shows the margins over a period of time, and you can kind of track that to see that it's not necessarily dependent on any one given product.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then if this so-called Great Rotation thesis were to play out and the Global Bond Fund were kind of to get thrown out with the bathwater, what are the key equity or other products you'd point you that you think have strong -- would have a strong interest and good performance that would allow you to internalize a fair amount of those outflows? And in other words, what is the wholesaler strategy going to be in that environment?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think it's very important to note that one, I'm not sure what we mean by Great Rotation, because as you've seen in the first quarter, you've had a rotation into equities and fixed income, and most of that has been at the expense of money funds. And I think it's really -- it's very important to distinguish Global Bonds between typical interest rate duration-type fixed income products. And I think people position Global Bonds more like they would an alternative because they're not really correlated, it's more currency-driven. So if you have a spike up in rates, you have shorter duration on these types of funds. And they really are not as sensitive as typical fixed income. But we have Chris here to talk just to that. I think it's a question we get quite a bit for the firm in how Global Bonds are positioned versus typical fixed income. So Chris, do you want to...","Christopher James Molumphy","Yes, and I would agree, Greg, and it's something we touched on a bit in the recorded remarks with respect to Global Bond. In our particular case, our Global Bond strategy, the core strategy has, in fact, no U.S. Treasury exposure and virtually negligible U.S. duration exposure. Overall, duration of the fund is 1.5 years, which is some duration, but significantly less than the broader market. And to Greg's point, it is a bit of a different asset class. It's certainly not domestic fixed income by any means, and it does sit somewhere between a traditional fixed income and perhaps alternatives as Greg alludes to. So it is a bit of a different asset class, one that's probably got some significant secular upside over the years to come.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. I mean, I think we can agree that maybe it shouldn't be thrown out with the bathwater. But the question is more what is your strategy? What is your sales strategy if it does?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think our strategy -- and that's what we talked about, I mean, if you look -- we'd be sitting here talking about the Franklin Income Fund right now if -- with the same kind of issue if it wasn't the Global Bond Fund that had such significant net inflows. And for us, our goal is to always have something in the market that can drive organic growth and -- but also have a breadth of products behind it. And if you look at the category -- the quarter where we had positive flows in just about every asset class, we have plenty of funds that we think can do very well. And look at our rising dividend fund, which has done very well in this market, just crossed $10 billion, Frontier markets. There's a lot of new funds that we have introduced and a lot of equity funds like the Franklin Growth Fund that continues to get shelf space. And if that's where the world goes, we have long-term funds with strong track records in position. Our strategy hasn't changed. We've been driving home the equity message -- now Franklin has had a long history in managing equities, and that's something that we've done against -- somewhat against the market, but gotten the message out there. And I think we're well-positioned as far as shelf space with 401(k) plans when and if it does really turn back.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess, Ken, just on the expense commentary from the pre-recorded call, you talked about regulatory expense and just curious as to what's different than -- if anything changed or as we think about kind of the build, is there a step function that's coming as a result of some of these changes or just kind of gradual from current levels?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes, I would go with the gradual. I think this was -- we did have some margin expansion this quarter. It's kind of, for us, a hard quarter to have a margin expansion just because of the seasonality of some of the expense items. So I think that was a positive. I think you could see a little bit more expansion going forward. But on the other hand, you do have some of the smaller line item expenses like G&A and occupancy and technology that were just -- we're forecasting to be a little higher. Maybe they won't be a little higher, but that was the essence of my commentary this quarter. But again, those are the smaller line items. So I think generally, margins should be in line and maybe even a little improved if the markets continue to go up.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. But if I just even think about your fee rate and the improvement we saw this quarter, even a modest continuation of positive inflows, it still seems like incremental margins should be higher and you should still see decent leverage in -- going forward?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes, but I think a lot of the expenses are also variable with the market and you see that in the G&A line, too, so...","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","But even if this market flat?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes, it's -- like I said, I think a couple of expense line items will increase, so I wouldn't -- I think it's more of the same, slightly improved, just potential slightly improved on the margin front.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Katz from Citi.","Steve Fullerton","This is Steve Fullerton filling in for Bill. I have just one quick question. You talked on the pre-recorded call about the strong growth in Italy. Can you just go into what's striving that and how you could translate that to other regions?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I mean, I think the -- Italy, it's been really on the back of the Global Bond Fund. And we've -- we are actually kicking off a big equity Roadshow throughout Italy right now. I mean, our goal, you tend to start with one popular fund, and then once you get the shelf space, you can try to diversify that mix and we try to put incentives in place for that. We also have kind of a tactical asset allocation fund that was introduced over a year ago that's done very well in Italy. But it's really through the traditional banks that we've established long-term relationships with and a way for them to diversify away from home currency risk, and that's been a big reason why the Global Bond Fund has done so well there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Kim from Sandler O'Neill.","James Howley","This is actually James Howley filling in for Michael. I appreciate the color that you guys gave earlier about the underground capabilities in Europe and the U.S. version of the Emerging Bond Fund coming online, but what are some of the other more interesting strategies or vehicles that you're contemplating these days as it relates to product development?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think one of the areas that we touched on earlier in the call was around K2 and introducing some retail-type products there in the fund-to-fund space. We've spent a lot of time building out our solutions or tactical asset allocation, real asset return funds, funds that are positioned to have commodity exposure should rates go up. And that was probably -- I should've answered part of that to the question earlier about if you do have a rotation. We want to have funds in there that have commodity exposure and can protect capital in a rising rate environment. I think the breadth -- and that's really the area of the solutions and building out our asset allocation capabilities with -- because we really have just about every category covered from a mandate or fund perspective, so I don't think it's anything that we need to develop that's new, but really try to take what we have and package that in a different way that can be more solution-oriented.","James Howley","Great. And then just turning to capital management, some peers have seemingly gotten even more focused on returning some excess capital. And I appreciate that you guys have been very consistent on the dividend and the  share repurchase front over time. And I appreciate the 12 months is within the range, but how are you guys thinking about maybe getting more aggressive on returning capital, particularly if the balance sheet continues to strengthen over time?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, it clearly has been a focus. It will continue to be a focus. As we've talked about, our goal is absolutely to return a high percentage of the U.S. cash flow to investors every year. And yes, the focus has been on dividends in the past. Share repurchases have been lower. The stock price has risen materially this quarter. And the other factor is that viable trading volume has declined materially. So those are factors have driven this quarter's results. It hasn't changed our strategy of being very conscious of returning earnings to shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Hopson from Stifel.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Can you give us the amount of institutional global fixed flows in the quarter? And then we've talked about this before, but just want an update, Vanguard has increased or actually established a global fixed ratio or percentage within their target date funds, which would seem to be, in my opinion, kind of an industry indicator perhaps. So just curious about any update on how you're doing in penetrating 401(k) with that asset class? And typically, obviously, it takes a while to build traction with a new fund, but with the emerging market in the U.S., given the track record globally and his reputation, can we assume that you will get traction in that category or that product sooner?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I don't have the first part of your question on the institutional. I'm looking at the -- some of the larger fundings over the quarter, and they're really -- the largest international fixed was $121 million. So there -- that would -- I think as far as the -- looking at flows, the majority was retail. There wasn't any big, big chunks, big separate accounts in Global fixed. And your other -- I'll take the other one, I think on just target dates in general. I think that -- I put that in the challenge category for us because the captive platforms for 401(k), they are really the ones that are in the position to benefit more from target date funds, and that makes it harder to sell individual funds as buyers move into the target date and that's how they get their exposure into equities. I mean, the good news is, they get their exposure in equities at a young age and I think that's been -- we've seen that statistic. But for the more of the independent asset manager that's not on the platform, it makes it a little bit more challenging to get flows into your traditional equity funds that are even doing well if the world moves to target date. Now we have target date, but it's hard to differentiate it enough to really get the lion's share of any one given platform that's going to go more to their own target date than they are an outside one. And in emerging markets, I hope -- we have had a long history. We've obviously been the early mover, have a strong portfolio management team. And Frontier has done extremely well for us, which is kind of the emerging story, and we hope we can continue to get flows in the core emerging markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to just dig into the appetite for Global Equity. So, I'm going to try this in a couple of different pieces. So on the retail side, I'd love to hear about the momentum of interest in Global Equity products. And on the institutional side, can you talk about the pipeline of activity, how RFPs are trending and if you're seeing kind of more money moving around within the Global -- for Global mandates?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I would say it's very steady. I mean, you look at Global Equity's overall, have had positive inflows over the last year on a retail basis. I mean, clearly, more people are allocating to global equities. We have a campaign Global is the New Core. And taking the typical investor in the U.S. instead of having 50%, 60% in U.S. equities, try to think about 30%, 40% in Global equity. So that -- just the percentage of the pie has changed. That's put pressure on U.S. equity flows as well, and we continue to see that. I think for us, if I put any area that's been a little disappointing is that we haven't participated in that -- the way we should have. And part of that was the -- some of the challenges around the Templeton's value style, which, the good news that performance has turned around, but it takes time to get back into those -- the mindset of advisors and the retail investor. And that's something that has been a big priority for us to do. So I think the story is just very strong because people are much more comfortable with globalization and in investing cross-borders. The home country bias is not as strong, so that's very much in place. We have -- we participate in a lot of areas. Mutual Discovery has been a big driver within on the Mutual Series side for us and then traditionally, with Templeton as well. It's interesting, our largest mandate we won last quarter was a global growth fund, which you don't of Franklin Templeton for global growth, but we have an excellent performance in global growth, New York-based head there and that was a $0.5 billion win. So that's a category that's institutional quality for us that drives outside of the traditional Templeton value, and again, so that we can participate in just about every type of mandate on the Global Equity side. So I think institutional, it's still very strong. I mean, the pipeline, when we look at our wins every quarter, there continues to be and, whether it's Asia-specific or Global-based, we're getting in a lot of searches there. So I don't think it's been an increase, but I think it's pretty much steady straight -- steady state and still the best opportunity for us along with Global Fixed on the institutional side.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Like I guess my issue is, you've got a very big franchise. The performance seems to be very good. When you flow, you flow really tiny and when you outflow, I guess maybe you're outflowing tiny as well. But if you're seeing growth, it just seems to be very modest. And you talk about gaining kind of mind share. Are there leading indicators that would show that, that momentum is improving? Or do you think this kind of blah growth run rate kind of persists for the year? Or like what kind of gets it out of this kind of range-bound, kind of really tepid growth or maybe tepid shrinkage range? It seems like you should be doing much better.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I think it's Templeton retail that is the key because we are doing very well. If you were looking at the organic growth rates in Europe or, as I mentioned earlier, Asian growth, Asian Growth Small Cap, Frontier funds, tremendous growth rates there. All of that gets somewhat lost in the net negative numbers coming out of the retail U.S., so it just takes time to turn around the mindset. The advisor moves on. You get the benefit sometimes of them still selling after you underperform for awhile. But once they -- once you are removed from -- it takes a while to get back and that has been 100% focus of our distribution groups to make sure that, that story and performance is heard. And we feel like we are making good progress there. But again, to me, it's very simple. It's getting that back on-track and then you'll see the right levels of organic growth in global equities.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Lee from KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Let's see, I guess, first one maybe, Greg, for you. I'd just be interested in getting an update. I know you've spoken about it in the past with the acquisition of K2 and kind of looking around the globe, you actually have a pretty fair number of alternative-type strategies, but the distribution of them maybe has been somewhat haphazard or not particularly well organized. And I know you've been making efforts to kind of streamline that and centralize it. Can you maybe first just update us on where that stands, and if that's something you think will start taking effect more this year? And maybe as we get to the end of this year, next year could start to see -- move the needle a little bit?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think it's gradual like most things we do and the -- we have dedicated senior resources to the alternative side. People that have been here with the firm a long time and really 100% of their job now is to try to make sure that we're leveraging the stories wherever we can across relationships in the firm. And so I think that's been a big step forward. I think we still debate at the actual sales client interaction level, what the right mix is. And in some cases, I think we're concluding we need more dedicated people out there. So I think that's something that we'll continue to add. And we've got the infrastructure and senior management team in place to build that out now where we didn't before. So I don't think there'll be a big change, but it's just gradually we will keep adding people on there.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then I apologize if you had addressed this in the remarks at the start because I got on the call late. But with the capital management, the ever-present questions, I guess, but can you maybe update us if we look this quarter and out for this year, what your current expectations are for kind of the mix of cash that will be generated or you expect to be generated and available in the U.S. versus outside the U.S.? And also, if there's anything you're seeing or hearing in the recent budget negotiations and proposals that give you some, although it's always hard to hope for good outcomes, but hope to give you some optimism about maybe seeing some changes that could free up some of that non-U.S. cash to be brought back home?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","All right. So I think the U.S., non-U.S. cash generations in the maybe -- it's not 50-50, it might be -- maybe 60% international. And going forward -- and I did mention as one of the questions earlier that it has been slow, some of that's been due to the viable trading volumes, as well as the run the stock has been on this quarter. We're going to stay focused on it. We're going to be pretty opportunistic going forward, and so there's no real change strategically into our policy there. But we are definitely aware that the volume was lower this quarter. Yes, and I don't -- we haven't heard anything new coming out of government. We still remain somewhat moderately optimistic that something that might happen, but it won't happen for a while. I don't know if anyone else has heard anything on that front, but -- so we're just to waiting to see on that.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And I guess, maybe as a follow-up to that, if you look outside the U.S., there are some jurisdictions, where -- which do have modest capital needs or regulatory needs. Do you see anything outside the U.S. that regardless of what happens here tax-wise, it means you'll just have to keep more capital or cash in certain jurisdictions than you currently do? Anything like that on the horizon?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, nothing material. The trend is -- with a lot of the regulatory -- as we expand globally, we get into different markets, there's different -- so there is demand to increase capital requirements in certain jurisdictions, but relative to the size of our balance sheet, it doesn't really move the needle.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe one last capital question on seed capital. I mean, I know you guys dedicate a large chunk of capital to seeding new strategies and products and clearly recycle it. But is there any, as you continue to expand your capabilities with K2 and looking at products there, some of which can be, I guess, capital-intensive in the sense that they require higher levels of seed capital. But anything that makes you think that the amount you dedicate to that could actually start to creep upwards going forward?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I think that is the trend. I think you're right on in spotting that. As the products get more complex, we do things like introduce products with different sleeves that portfolio managers have to manage the requirements go up. Fortunately, for the capital management discussion, those needs tend to be outside the U.S., so they're not impacting the U.S. cash to an extent. We're keeping that pretty tight. And most of our product development is not in U.S. product, it's mostly in international products that we're developing products. So it's true, it's requiring more capital, but it tends to be outside the U.S.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier from Bank of America.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, first question just on margins and scale. So if I look at year-over-year for the first 6 months, it looks like your average assets are up 13% and you have some operating leverage. But I'm just trying to understand, obviously, there's distribution costs that are going to up with markets and assets and some comp. But if the market levels continue or they drift higher, should we assume that you can still be generating like 100 to 200 basis points on an annual basis in leverage just given the strength of the markets that you benefited from?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, those are pretty big numbers and, of course, hypothetical. I think that one thing not to lose sight of in this quarter is that kind of strange anomaly with the distribution expense where we're kind of accruing the asset base component of that on a monthly basis, but the revenue was short because it's based on the number of days. So if that normalizes, just something like that, you could see some margin expansion in the short term. But over the long term, I think the variable costs will go up if the revenue goes up. And our variable compensation will, of course, go up. Performance is good, so there's pressure there. So I think all of these things lead me to believe that it's more kind of offsetting slightly better margin, but not in the range you were talking about.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I mean, those nuances are helpful. And then just when I think about products versus geographies, obviously, from a scale standpoint, there are certain products you have a lot of scale in. Greg, you mentioned Italy in terms of gaining scale in that market. Are there any other -- like when you look at the international markets, are there others where you're sort of getting to, I don't know, it's probably different for each market, but whether it's $5 billion or $10 billion or whatever that level is where you feel like the operating leverage or the scale in the business starts to improve versus when you're running at a level where it's still -- relative to the overall margin it's under because you're still building up or building out?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think I would say today that most markets we're in are at scale where we're profitable, I can't even -- there's very few today that would be net negative and then still on that phase. I mean, Italy is our -- now our largest country outside of the U.S. as of this quarter, so it's certainly at scale at $36 billion. It's just a matter of the risk and diversifying and making sure you're -- while the sun's out, you're doing everything to get the message on the other funds just to help your business to be more diversified. But today, we probably have -- I think we have 19 countries or regions that we define that have assets over $3 billion in each of them, so you can see it's very broad diversification. Every one of those would be profitable, different levels of margins, but certainly profitable.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just last one on the equity flows, you mentioned just in terms of seeing that improvement, the focus on Templeton retail and predominantly in the U.S., when you look at your -- like the history of Franklin, and you go through periods where there is a product, whether it was Templeton or Income Series, that did lag the industry and you saw some outflows or weak relative to the industry. Do you have any sense like how long, once -- because the performance is back, so once the performance is back, how long that traction tends to take in order to have those flows shift? Obviously, it's going to depend on the environment for overall equity flows, but just trying to gauge based on like the experience in the past, how long that tends to take?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, I mean, I don't have -- I can just tell you that equity takes longer than Fixed Income. Fixed Income tends to move back a lot faster because of the attraction of that current dividend rate there, and equity is a little fuzzier so it just takes a little bit longer to get back. And the other piece that I should've mentioned, when we're talking about international flows. I'm just looking at some of the numbers too, and there tends to be some headwind just from reallocation. You get into a strong market and pension plans will rebalance based on the -- so I'm looking -- I see a lot of topping off in some large accounts that can happen over -- when you have the kind of moves that you've had and that adds up, too, and then a couple of redemptions too this quarter in Global Equity, the largest redemption was in Global Equity. So those are going to, again, mask a lot of the good that is occurring on the retail side and improvements on the retail side, and those are more one-off than the underlying flow trend. And I am looking at some numbers that the majority of the larger accounts that went out this quarter were in Global Equity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greggory Warren from Morningstar.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just trying to figure out, I know we touched on this a little bit and I don't want to really beat a dead horse here, but I'm trying to figure out what the issue really is on the Global International Equity side. Because if you look at the industry AUM flows through the first quarter, actively managed pulled in well over $35 billion. And as we roll into sort of April here, international seems to be about the only area where there's still interest. And you guys touched on there being sort of an issue on the U.S. retail side and that outside of the U.S., your flows were better. But I'm trying to get sort of a feel for, is this a matter of, on the retail side, advisors are putting the investors more into, say taxable bond and those sort of portfolios because they are a little bit more equity-like and less so on these funds because there's been some performance issues? Or I mean, what's your take on what's going on here?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes, I just think that we're not -- for the advisor in the U.S., they're selling other Global Equity funds than our -- selling some of ours, but not -- the only area that I think of in any significant way where we lost some share was on the retail side in Global Equities over, say the last 5 years. So that's the part that's lagging for us, that performance lagged and now it's strong, it just doesn't turn that fast. And then again, the -- if you have some significant outflows, for Global Equity accounts, some topping off, then there was one that, a large Canadian one in the quarter that went out, that's going to -- you're going to draw a lot of conclusions by looking at a big number that's a one-off number versus retail flows. So retail flows did improve for us, like most for that quarter. It's just that we had probably a little bit more in one-off kind of top -- whether it's reallocations or terminations in that category. So it's simple. I mean, we do well with just about everything else and Templeton has lagged here in the U.S. and that's also a big asset base that when it lags in gross sales, even a normal redemption rate creates fairly heavy net quarterly redemption. So we've got to get the gross sales number back up, and that's what we're trying to do.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, yes, that makes sense somewhat. Basically, I'm sort of looking at the January flows as being kind of a one-off, too. You got the normal reallocation that goes on there. You had a lot of money flowing out of stocks, stock fund sales and special dividends in the fourth quarter that got reallocated in the first part. But when I'm looking at your taxable bond flows here, they seem to be a lot stronger than we've seen in a long time, and I'm just wondering, do you feel that what we saw during the March quarter is going to continue at this level or sort of a tapering down as we get through the rest of the year because this is more on par with kind of the run rate we were seeing prior to the performance hiccups?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I think I don't see any reason why that shouldn't continue. I think we're still, like most of the industry, fixed income continues to be strong, so that -- we think that trend should continue. I don't -- I couldn't call anything out unusual there.","Kenneth Allan Lewis","And also, Greg, you alluded to the fact, this Great Rotation. But with money funds and short rates at 0, which you believe they may well be for some time that seems as though that continues to provide a base for taxable fixed income. And then we're working fairly broad in terms of our product line both in terms of some low-duration products, some multi-sector product and then the continued search for yield. I mean, there's still a necessity for yield out there. So I don't -- I'm not a sales professional, but it seems as though a lot of those trends are here at least for the foreseeable future, one would guess.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","And I think when we talk about the Great Rotation, and again, I mean, in Fixed Income and what does it mean, I think you also have to consider just the demographic shift in risk tolerance of your average investor, certainly in the states, that's getting older, closer to retirement and that baby boomer bubble there that's working its way through has less of an appetite for equities, and that has an effect as well when they're looking and getting closer to retirement.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Yes, I'm right with you on there. I mean, this whole notion there will be a huge bubble popping in fixed income, I don't think it's going to be as big as people think. I mean, there will be some out draft, but we'll have to see. I still think we're caught in this kind of risk aversion cycle here, and 2013 is looking an awful lot like 2011. And all we really need is sort of a hiccup here and people start running from the doors on the equities side. Let's hope not, though.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Freeman from Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just want to come back to Global Bond Fund. As you talk about it, it kind of doesn't fit neatly into one category, and I wonder if you could just kind of talk about the sort of segmentation of the investor base, both on the institutional and retail side. Are there sort of buckets you feel like, based on whatever feedback you can get through the channels, that you can put investors in, in terms of what their invested in and for?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Yes. Again, I don't have that information, and it's just kind of guessing as far as -- I think it's generally going to be a little bit more sophisticated, a little bit maybe a little larger average ticket size just because it is something a little bit different. You're coming from 0 penetration in a traditional retail buyer. Today, we're still very small. And even for the institutional buyer, the category is still under 5%. So you've got a huge way to go. And I think -- if you think about the investor, they're kind of concerned about rates going up. They're concerned that \"Gee, equity markets, I can't -- we had a tough decade and we've got all these macro headwinds that are still out there,\" and they're just concerned about risk. So this is not a risk-free investment by any means, but it's not correlated to a lot of the macro. You could make a lot of money with many of these macro changes that can happen with countries. So it's a different story, and it lowers the risk of a portfolio. So I think you'd still have a ways to go as far as market penetration, and it's probably starting with the more sophisticated one moving down. And I think it's the same story with pensions. It's just going to take a while to position it properly and get different fiduciaries and boards comfortable with the concept. But I do think it's an alternative that's liquid, it's transparent. It's easy to value, and it lowers the risk of a portfolio. So those -- that's a lot of checks.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Absolutely, okay. And then the second question, just in terms of your equity marketing strategy, the global equities, new core, does -- with that being sort of your push, does that come at all, do you think, at the expense of domestically focused equity funds? Or is it the opportunity to kind of push the improved performance story in Templeton just that much better?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I think it's both. I mean, it -- really, we've started and continued to push the equity story out there. The global one is newer this year. Again, I mean, I think we always talk about our wholesalers, sales team can probably give 3 good ideas in any one meeting and that's about the max, so we're careful about what those 3 are. And it's really talking about equities and whether it's Global or U.S., that story is going to fit for both. So I hope it doesn't diminish the importance of getting our domestic equity story. But we're really talking just about equities in general. That's really the start.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marc Irizarry from Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Greg, can you talk little bit about the -- your business outside the U.S.? Are you seeing some competitors in some places maybe where there's subscale, maybe some global competitors retrenching, and is that helping you guys? And then also maybe could comment on -- I know it matters really by region, but as the local competition, are you starting to see the architecture open up a little bit and help you guys?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","I think it's hard to generalize because I think every market's a little bit different with respect to some openings, some getting more difficult. I think the open architecture, generally speaking, is there in most places. And I think once the bank -- the banks control so much of what's distributed, especially as you get into the smaller countries, that's where the money is. And once the big banks went to open architecture and you have global relationships and local servicing, you can do very well there. So I don't think that's changed much one way or another, but it's there. As far as competition, you've got some disruption with the bank's own funds, so I think that's probably good for the independent and help open architecture trend. But we're not -- I don't think we're seeing a big shift on -- we see a lot of managers talking about moving into different areas and building local businesses. But I think once they look at some of the challenges and numbers and investment it takes, it's not quite that simple. And then we see the typical names that we compete with in places like Asia and Europe, but I don't think the landscape has shifted a lot.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned that Italy has grown significantly, second biggest market now, I think you mentioned. Any update or view on the financial transaction tax and what that might mean to some of your European countries in your retail business out there?","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, I don't have an update. I mean, I hope that it doesn't happen for obvious reasons. I think those things, once people get educated on who really pays for those, that hopefully that shifts the thinking. But unfortunately, it does have momentum. And again, I don't think it's something that we can control except from somewhat of a lobbying we can try to get our message in there. But the transaction taxes have come up a lot of times before. And I think, hopefully, level heads will push back on it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Harris from Wells Fargo.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Another follow-up here on Templeton. So performance is really strong, we've talked about it. And at this point, it's a sales issue. We're not quite certain when the timing is going to turn around. But I guess what I'm curious about is presumably, you guys are paying your people pretty well for the improved performance in that product class. And so if there is a situation where we do start to see a really big pickup in sales, all of a sudden advisors start selling the product more, is there a high degree of kind of operating leverage that would kind of really help you guys out there? Or would you kind of use that opportunity to pay your people a bit more given the better flows? So just if you can help us frame up the dynamic with how flows could potentially impact your operating leverage?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","I'll take that. It's Ken. So yes, clearly, on a -- if it's a material shift to that Global Equity class, you're going to see the effective fee rate pick up. In that case, you should experience a fair amount of operating leverage. And yes, I have to agree, we do pay our people well. We will continue to do that. We talked about this a little bit in the past. It's kind of more of an art than a science. 2 things drive it, the overall company profitability, it's also the individual group's performance. And so we kind balance those 2 things and we'll continue to do that. Having said all of that, you go back and you look at our compensation ratio and investment advisory fees, it does vary. But over the long term, it's been within a pretty tight range, I would say.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, I mean, I would agree. I was just trying to make the point that if you guys are compensating folks for the performance that's been really good as you highlighted, it just seems like there would be a really good opportunity for the margin if we all of a sudden start getting significant amount of sales into that product, but...","Kenneth Allan Lewis","I would agree. And the other dynamic is, if it is the Templeton Global Equity products and the Emerging Markets products, just keep in mind that, that also gets managed in low tax jurisdictions.","Christopher Harris - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, perfect. It makes sense. And then real quick follow-up, I know there's been a lot of questions about the balance sheet, just curious to get your thoughts on how you guys are thinking about M&A opportunities here? And whether you think that might be a good use of the cash that's held overseas? I know a lot of it's going to be a function of really what  becomes available, but I'd love your updates there.","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Yes. Proactive in some markets, reactive in others. As things come up and we evaluate the product set. I think we'll continue looking at some of the smaller markets. We did that small acquisition in Mexico because we thought that's a good opportunity. But we're clearly open. I mean, we're very disciplined in the approach, which I think some of the better deals are the ones we didn't do. And so we'll continue that approach. But we feel that, that is a competitive strength -- our balance sheet that we can be able to take advantage of any opportunity when it arises.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Hopson from Stifel.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So just a couple of final questions, I guess. The distribution margin, to what extent is that affected by higher sales in non-U.S. markets? And then is there any overall or net FX affect to the bottom line? I know you guys have a lot of product in U.S. dollars, but you also have some not, so I'm curious about that. And then you might have commented on this, the tax rate lower, what was that reason and what -- any projection for tax rate going forward?","Kenneth Allan Lewis","This is Ken. I'm just writing down your 3-part question here so I don't forget it. So the underwriting distribution margin. The first place I would suggest to look at is in the MD&A and 10-Q. We break out the revenue component into a sales base and asset base, and we break out the expense component into a sales base and asset base. And so you can see, if you match those 2 up, you can see relationships. But you're exactly right that a high degree of international sales will have a tendency to depress that margin in the short term. And the other dynamic to consider is, in the U.S., the revenue streams are kind of split between investment management, distribution, shareholder servicing. That's not necessarily the case outside the U.S. where the investment management fee is -- tends to be higher, but it also tends to -- the reason it's higher is it covers the distribution expense. So we have that little revenue expense mismatch, but we try to help you understand that more with our disclosures in the Q. On the FX side, there's a couple of areas that FX affects the business. So I think -- I'm glad you asked the question, it's probably a good opportunity to talk about that. The first is assets under management. The majority of our assets under management are in funds and accounts that are priced in U.S. dollars. The other is in cash and cash equivalents. So about 10% of the cash and cash equivalents are held by U.S. dollars -- held in U.S. dollars by entities with a different functional currency. Now those changes go to unrealized foreign -- they go to the other income line. I don't want to get like too technical, but it's just for simplicity. The translation of the U.S. dollar cash and investments into the foreign entities' functional currency is done at the month end at the spot rate, and that goes to other income and then the translation of those holdings back to U.S. dollars at the corporate level, essentially, is an offsetting transaction that goes through OCI. And then overall, because we're so global, the operations, they do tend to act as a natural hedge. And we've been tracking it for years, and it's never been material. And then the last part was for taxes. So the tax rate went down, but we did have a fair amount of discrete items in the quarter that drove the tax rate down and I think that was in the neighborhood of $12 million.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Well, thank you, everyone, for participating on today's call. We look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"10056":["Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN) Q1 2014 Pre Recorded Earnings Call January 30, 2014 ET","Executives","Gregory Eugene Johnson - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and Member of Special Equity Awards Committee","Kenneth Allan Lewis - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting officer and Executive Vice President","Operator","Welcome to Franklin Resources earnings commentary for the quarter ended December 31, 2013. Statements made in this commentary regarding Franklin Resources Inc., which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin's recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and MD&A sections of Franklin's most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings.","This commentary was prerecorded.","Gregory Eugene Johnson","Hello, and thank you for taking the time to join us today. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO, and I'm joined by Ken Lewis, our CFO. Fiscal year started on a positive note for us as assets under management grew to almost $880 billion by quarter end and translated into a very strong quarter of operating results. We reached new highs for revenue, operating income and earnings per share.","Importantly, long-term investment performance remained strong across equity and fixed-income strategies, with the majority of our U.S. registered and cross-border mutual funds ranked in the top half of their respected peer groups. We continue to believe that our broad and diversified global investment capabilities position us well for the current environment, and that is evident in our flows this quarter. Equity and hybrid products had their strongest quarter of net new flows since '07, attracting $6.7 billion. This quarter also marked an important milestone for the integration of K2, as we launched our first liquid alternatives mutual fund for U.S. retail investors.","Turning to Slide 6, on investment performance. You will notice that we enhanced the disclosure to now include our cross-border mutual funds, which are sold internationally in addition to our U.S. registered mutual funds. Combined, they represent over 2\/3 of assets under management and the bulk of our retail business. As you can see from this slide, long-term investment performance remained strong, and I would note that our key global equity hybrid and global fixed-income strategies continue to have outstanding performance.","Franklin Income Fund represents 14% of the total and 28% of the equity hybrid assets for the 1-year period. The fund ranked in the 51st percentile at 12\/31 for the 1-year period, down from the 45th percentile at 9\/30. The fund's traditional weighting in utilities, which have underperformed as of late, was a drag on relative performance.","Ending assets under management continues to increase with assets ending the quarter at an all-time high of $879 billion, an increase of 4% for the quarter and 12% for the year. Average assets under management was up 5% for the quarter at $866 billion. Our mix of AUM by investment objective continues to be well-balanced with a roughly 50-50 split between equity and fixed income, if you split hybrid assets. This diversification provides our clients with a number of attractive investment options for all market cycles. The mix of AUM by sales region was essentially unchanged over the prior quarter as AUM increased about equally across all regions with the exception of Latin America.","Moving onto flows on Slide 10. Long-term net new flows improved modestly this quarter, reflecting both slowing redemptions and increased sales over the prior year quarter. This was an improvement from the last quarter. This quarter, we saw equity and hybrid inflows offset lower fixed-income outflows. Across the industry, investor concerns over higher interest rates have been driving assets out of more traditional core fixed-income products and into income-oriented equity strategies and a variety of nontraditional and unconstrained bond funds. Our flows have generally mimicked these trends with clients rotating into less interest-rate sensitive high-yield and nontraditional fixed-income products, as well as equity and hybrid funds. In fact, much of the exchange activity we saw this quarter was consistent with that trend.","Market appreciation was $36 billion, positive across all investment objectives.","This quarter, we continued to see a shift in retail demand from traditional fixed income to equity hybrid and nontraditional fixed-income products. However, our retail business remained in outflows.","In the U.S., this was largely a result of continued outflows in the tax-free, fixed-income market. Internationally, outflows were driven by global fixed-income funds in the European sales region, where investors there are reallocating their global fixed-income holdings in favor of our European and U.S. equity strategies.","Our institutional business, on the other hand, has fared well in both the U.S. and internationally, and offset the net outflows we saw in our retail funds this quarter. Led by $1 billion local equity mandate in Australia, we saw approximately $3 billion of net sales into our institutional business this quarter. These flows were primarily in global equity and global fixed-income strategies, and the pipeline for both mandates remains strong.","We continue to expand our product range and capabilities to meet investor demand and industry trends in both retail and institutional markets. Our global reach continues to expand with a number of new regional opportunities developing. In the Philippines, we received regulatory approval to launch 2 new funds, and we continue to see demand for Islamic finance and Shariah-compliant funds. Regulatory changes in China have opened new doors for foreign asset managers who are now allowed to manage money for insurance companies.","Additionally, Hong Kong is in the final stretch of talks China on a mutual recognition initiative, which will enable cross-border sales in these countries. In response to this, we have begun the development of the Templeton Asian Income and the Templeton Global Funds, which will be domiciled in Hong Kong and sold in both countries.","Developments in Latin America this quarter include the launch of a local feeder of Franklin Mutual Global Discovery Fund in Brazil and a Mexican bank selected Franklin Templeton Mexico to manage part of their European equity strategy. This is a great example of the success of our local asset management business this quarter, which garnered $2.6 billion in net new flows led by our teams in Europe, Australia and Canada.","Although overall net new flows are essentially flat this quarter, we have begun to see significant traction on equity flows in both the U.S. and internationally. Global Equity net new flows increased to $3.1 billion due mostly to a 21% increase in sales. This was driven by increased demand internationally for European equities, and we have seen strong net inflows into our cross-border SICAV versions of the Franklin European Growth Fund and Franklin Mutual European Funds, in particular.","Given the macro environment in emerging markets, it's not surprising that we've seen outflows from key emerging markets' products. The Templeton Asian Growth Fund, for example, has suffered from a period of underperformance. We've taken action to keep clients informed about our positioning and delivered an external prospectus piece supporting portfolio management's conviction to the countries and sectors where these funds are more heavily weighted.","The global fixed-income category, as a whole, is in outflows this quarter, but the U.S. versions of the Templeton Global Bond Fund and Total Return Funds had positive flows. Although these funds are labeled as traditional global funds, they are unconstrained from a sector, geography, interest rate and currency perspective.","We tend to see international sales be more reactive to global events, like the Fed tapering, and are not surprised by the outflows of the cross-border versions of these products. On the flip side, these flows are typically quick to return when things stabilize.","We also continue to see strong flows into hybrid funds with the Franklin Income Fund remaining the top-selling fund overall this quarter. Additionally, the Templeton Global Balanced Fund, which combines global fixed income and global equity, remains popular and is proven to be an effective vehicle for global fixed income investors to reenter the global equity markets.","Moving on to U.S. equity. Long-term sales were up 11% this quarter, following strong returns in the U.S. equity markets over the past year. In the U.S., the Franklin Rising Dividends Fund remains a top-selling fund in this category as investors continue to search for income. We also saw growth in funds popular among 401(k) sponsors in the U.S., like the Franklin Growth Fund. Internationally, U.S. equity also sold well with strong flows coming into a variety of cross-border products.","Tax-free fixed income still experienced outflows. However, we are starting to see signs of this market stabilizing. Redemptions are slowing and net outflows have been on the decline. But generally, higher leaves available on municipal bonds at year end may entice more investors who've been sitting on the sidelines waiting for higher yield potential. Additionally, higher taxes can make the tax exemption of municipal bonds more appealing.","U.S. taxable fixed-income flows declined this quarter in line with the industry flow trends out of traditional fixed income that I mentioned earlier. However, nontraditional products within this category have been garnering increased net new flows.","And now ken will discuss operating results.","Kenneth Allan Lewis","Thanks, Greg. I'm happy to report a strong quarter of operating results. To begin, the fiscal year with revenue, operating income and earnings per share once again reaching new highs as a result of the growth of assets under management and our cost-conscious culture.","Operating income for the quarter was $813 million, which is up 11% over the prior quarter and 19% from the prior year, outpacing the growth in assets under management over those periods.","Net income was $604 million, a 19% increase from the prior year quarter and 17% from the prior year. And earnings per share was $0.96, up 20% since the fourth quarter and 19% from the prior year, outpacing the increase in net income due to our stock repurchase program that has steadily decreased shares outstanding over time.","Total revenue for the quarter exceeded $2.1 billion for the first time, an increase of 6% from the prior quarter. The increase in average assets under management was the primary driver of the increase in revenue. However, I would like to quickly remind everybody that last quarter's accounting adjustment obviously impacted the quarter-to-quarter comparisons as well.","Investment management fees increased 7%, due mainly to increased average assets under management as well as above-average performance fees of $26 million, with the majority of that coming from K2 products.","Sales and distribution fees were about $637 million this quarter, reflecting an increase in the asset base component, which makes up about 2\/3 of this line; and increased fees from commissionable sales, which were roughly 12% of long-term sales this quarter.","Total operating expenses increased 4% this quarter, with all but the sales, distribution and marketing expense line flat, were down from the fourth quarter. Sales distribution and marketing expense increased 8%, mostly due to last quarter's accounting adjustment, but also from the increase in the related revenues.","Compensation and benefits expense was flat from last quarter, as increased salaries and wages were offset by lower variable compensation. We do expect the typical seasonal increase in this expense line next quarter as payroll taxes resume and we get the full impact of merit increases that took effect in December. In fact, last year's seasonal increase is probably a reasonable indicator of what to expect this year.","Information systems and technology decreased by a seasonal 14%, but we expect this expense to exhibit a similar pattern to last year.","Occupancy and general administration and other expenses both decreased slightly. G&A tends to be more difficult to predict due to the variability of several components, but the current level looks like a pretty good run rate going forward.","Now that implies a larger annual increase than I guided to last quarter, however, it is primarily the result of a recent pricing structure change in Canada. This change includes the bundling of investment management, servicing and administration fees together, which we believe will make our products more competitive in that market, and importantly, is not expected to have a material impact in operating income.","It will, however, change how we record the related revenues and expenses. Essentially, investment management fees will increase by about 120 basis points next quarter with shareholder servicing fees decreasing by about 2\/3 of that increase in dollar terms.","General and administrative expense will increase as well to offset the remainder of the net increase in revenue.","So a few moving parts, and I know I went through that quickly, so please review the additional information contained in our quarterly filing and contact Investor Relations if you need further clarification.","Other income, net of noncontrolling interest, was $48 million this quarter. As illustrated on Slide 19, equity method investments and realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale investments contributed the most to this quarter's other income gains. Equity method investments typically follow the direction of equity markets due to the nature of the assets.","Realized gains from available-for-sale investments will result to pruning or liquidating over 30 seed investments during the quarter, as we've reallocated that capital to other products such as the K2 alternative fund launched in November.","The tax rate for the fiscal year-to-date period was 29.8%, a bit higher than we projected at the end of the fiscal year, and that was due to a mix shift in earnings toward higher tax jurisdictions and the impact of losses from noncontrolling interest on the calculated rate.","The GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 38.5%, as we benefited from some seasonally lower expenses and the growth of assets under management this quarter.","As a reminder, the March quarter tends to be a tougher quarter for margins as we have 2 fewer days to earn revenue and, generally, seasonally higher expenses.","And moving onto Capital Management on Slide 23 (sic) [Slide 22], during the quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares, which more than offset issuance related to long-term compensation awards, and the board increased the regular quarterly dividend by 20%.","The payout ratio for the trailing 12 months was 36% of net income, or roughly $800 million. The decrease from September was primarily due to last year's special dividend rolling off. This is below our recent historical average payout ratio, but it does not reflect a change in our approach to capital management.","We remain committed to returning available U.S. cash flow to shareholders via a combination of cash dividends and share repurchases. And I think our track record speaks for itself, as we have returned over $6 billion to shareholders over the last 5 years. Our cash dividend has continued to grow at a rapid pace for several decades now, and we have continued to systematically reduce our share count over time with regular repurchases supplemented by opportunistic accelerations of our program activity.","That concludes our commentary on first quarter results. Please see our Form 10-Q that was also filed today for additional information or contact Investor Relations if you need any clarification of our comments. Thank you."],"10444":["Franklin Resources, Inc.

My name is Kevin, and I'll be your call operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Franklin Resources Chairman and CEO, Mr. Greg Johnson. Mr. Johnson, you may begin.","Greg Johnson","Hello and thank you for joining us today to discuss first quarter results. With me is President and Chief Operating Officer, Jenny Johnson who will be assuming the role of CEO next month; and Matthew Nicholls, our CFO.","Financial results improved this quarter reflecting strong financial markets and our ongoing commitment to effective expense management, which drove improved profitability. We continue to experience outflows this quarter for reasons discussed in the commentary we released earlier this morning. But we are encouraged to see traction in several important initiatives, including our efforts to expand our multi-asset solutions and ETF businesses.","We also believe that our balance sheet is one of our most under-appreciated assets as we evaluate opportunities to accelerate growth. Earlier this month, we announced plans to acquire two companies that will expand Fiduciary Trust assets under management by 50% and expand our physical presence in two important markets. We also returned approximately $260 million to shareholders through share repurchases in our regular dividend this quarter, which the Board increased to $0.27 per share in December.","After more than 15 years, my role as CEO of the firm will come to an end after our annual meeting next month. I'm very confident in Jenny's leadership and vision for the future of Franklin Templeton and together we are genuinely excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. While this will be my last call with you as CEO, I will remain Executive Chairman of the Board and will continue to participate on our earnings calls going forward.","I'd now like to open the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question today is coming from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.","Ken Worthington","So you've done a couple of bolt-on acquisitions in Wealth Management. So couple questions around that. So first, why are you thinking wealth management is a good place to invest here maybe you can flush out, are there synergies between wealth management and the rest of Franklin and maybe any synergies as well. And then may be cleaning up, I think when you guys bought Fiduciary, I think it's like 20 years ago.","I remember it had about maybe $15 billion or so of AUM. I could be wrong, but that's my recollection and I don't think it's all that much bigger today maybe 15 billion to 20 billion these days before - for these deals. So it hasn't really grown that much, if at all, over the last 20 years. So, given you're doing a bunch of bolt-ons. How do you expect to do a better job growing these wealth management assets today, than at least my perception of what you've done over the last 20 years?","Jenny Johnson","Well I'll go ahead and take that today post-acquisition I think Fiduciary is about $29 billion and there's no question wealth is hard to grow, but it's incredibly sticky, once you have it. And we think that it's both important for us as a firm from a distribution, but also as you're seeing fee based advisors trying to add more services, you justify basically the fee that their client pay every month.","They're trying to add on more than just investment management. And so, some of the capabilities that Fiduciary has we think can be packaged to be able to provide additional services to advisors. For example in this most recent acquisitions we not only expanded into two geographies that are excellent geographies to be in for wealth management, but we added services. So Athena Capital is incredibly well known for their impact investing in OCIO.","We think that Dr. Lisette Cooper can be helpful to us in more of the issue work that we're very focused on doing as well as Pennsylvania Trust has special need trust capabilities, which is essentially helping families who have a child with special needs and not worried about how to care for them beyond the say the parents surviving, and that's an opportunity of growth.","But that also can be something that we can work with our financial advisors as they have clients with those needs. We can bifurcate both the trust administration as well as the investment [bifurcate] capability on it.","Matthew Nicholls","I think I'll just add something to that it's Matthew. The multiple that we pay for these businesses is reasonable. We think and it helps us capitalize on some of the broader expenses that we have embedded within Fiduciary Trust. So essentially by having more assets and clients, it makes our overall wealth business more efficient. This is probably the beginning of our strategy to grow Fiduciary Trust in the second leg if you will.","You're right, Ken it's been a number of years since we've had a growth strategy around it inorganically. But it wouldn't surprise us if we doubled the size of Fiduciary Trust over the next year or two, by using this strategy.","Greg Johnson","And I would just add, I think we've always had that as you know, being on these calls for years, it's always been a goal of ours to - within our M&A to increase the size, but I think there's just a few more opportunities today with some of the pressure on smaller firms keeping up keeping pace with technology, spending and services that are required for their investors. So, we're just seeing a few more opportunities for roll ups.","Ken Worthington","And then just really broadly Jenny you're now officially or tend to be officially in the role as CEO. Maybe just highlight your priorities for the next two or three years. What are you hoping to accomplish? Any directional changes that is worth highlighting to us? Thank you.","Jenny Johnson","I think we - it's continuing on a path that we've been focused on for the last couple of years, which is we bucket the business and growth opportunities, kind of, in three places, so one is just protecting the core and that's making sure that the products and capabilities that we have are best in breed. And if you think about on the investment management side, there has been a lot of focus and efforts around leveraging data science to enhance what we're doing on our core products.","And I think our fixed income team has done some really exciting new things combining active and quant. So again, it's just making sure that you have best-in-breed in your existing core and then from the second category is what we call growth accelerators things like growing our high net worth business, things like expanding in geographies that maybe we're not as deepened as we'd like to be adding product capability that maybe we're not as strong in, or don't have as much coverage and then also distribution capabilities.","So for example, we've always been really underrepresented in U.S. institutional that would be an area of interest for us to continue to grow. And then finally, I think we would all be foolish not to believe that the technology industrial revolution existing today is going to have disruption on our businesses. So making sure that we're investing in things that may be won't be meaningful or material in even the next five years.","But that we think could be very disruptive to business over the long run. And so that's - you see some of the investments that we're doing in things like a token vault, and also our innovation lab, which really just enables us to keep an eye on where the industry is evolving.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.","Brian Bedell","Maybe just to start off with the - obviously the global fixed income franchise and the increase in outflows, maybe just if you can talk about what you're saying to the financial advisors, we've seen sales obviously come down there pretty sharply in the last three quarters, and even also weighing a little bit on the global equity side so maybe the conversations with advisors, how that's going.","Maybe the sort of the tempo into January, and would that Morningstar request, I guess, would you say there is a certain level of AUM that might be at risk, just based on that reclass in the performance or maybe just a little extra color around that?","Greg Johnson","Yes, I think first and foremost, I mean the messaging is really that one this - it doesn't fit neatly into any category. So I think the people that are familiar and have sold the fund do it for defensive purposes. They do it, because it lowers the risk clearly against the big drivers of the interest rates and market beta and it really complements portfolios well. So that's the messaging that we continue to drive through the retail side.","And I think some of the heightened redemptions that you saw towards the end of the quarter or at the end of the year. I think some of that is always tax driven in selling when you have a sector in a very strong bull market that had a tough period. That will be something that you'll just see heightened levels of redemptions and we've seen that come off a bit. It's hard to kind of gauge what the reclassification can do.","I can just say from experience with this asset class is how quickly it moves around. And just with geopolitical events and movements within global macro, we can see quick rebounds and performance really within a week or two. So and I think the most of our advisors and shareholders are - understand that and that's just the messaging that we want to continue to drive.","But this is a defensive way, that's not co-related to many of the drivers in your market and continue to reinforce that message and how it's done in past down cycles, but it's clearly defensively positioned and that's the messaging that we continue to drive.","Jenny Johnson","And I think they did a very good piece on the Coronavirus and just reminding whether or not this one is going to be a very serious epidemic or not that you always have tail risk in portfolios and it's good to have that diverse portfolio. And this is an insurance policy positioned very defensively. And that has been well received by clients.","Brian Bedell","So are you seeing improvement in the flow momentum in January versus what we saw late in the fourth quarter in this area?","Greg Johnson","Yes, I would say still pressure but definitely better than what we saw in the prior quarter. Yeah redemption side a lot better, lot better.","Brian Bedell","And then maybe just back to the M&A strategy, maybe as you think about through diversifying into different areas, or expanding that Fiduciary high net worth strategy, is it and also in the commentary about the undervalued balance sheet and the $3.5 billion of excess cash - if you [guys] just maybe becoming more of a rollup of other private wealth managers over the long-term?","And if so, is that more of a sort of a bolt-on strategy or would you actually try to be more toward have a strategy of more like integrating those firms into Fiduciary and having it be a large integrated platform?","Matthew Nicholls","Yes, I think it's a combination of those two things and wealth. It's both integration of certain aspects of the business Brian, but it's also a potential roll-ups, I think we should make clear, this is more of a - we don't expect to expand broadly across wealth management.","This is a specialized ultra-high-net-worth franchise where we see significant opportunities in different states with different client bases that, as I mentioned a second ago, capitalize on the foundation that we have with Fiduciary Trust. So that's what this is all about. So we shouldn't confuse that important aspect of our strategy with what we're doing overall as a Company.","We do have many other aspects of the growth that we're focused on this, Jenny just pointed out, including across the traditional asset management business, distribution various products alternatives institutional, for example, and some of those ideas are much larger ideas that are in our pipeline and as we move quarter-to-quarter where our list is getting shorter and shorter in terms of where we would actually take action, we hope in the next year.","Brian Bedell","So we should expect more utilization of the balance sheet for M&A over the next say, a couple of years or so.","Greg Johnson","Yes.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.","Craig Siegenthaler","Just looking at the decline in expenses and the guidance too, how are you able to invest in new technologies, distribution and also product, while also able to reduce total cost?","Jenny Johnson","So I'll take that. So I mean one of the things that you over time we've always had a global footprint, and so there has been opportunity for us to ship positions to lower cost regions as well as historically as a global provider there were often not service providers who could really accommodate our global platform.","And so, we always had to keep these things in-house and it's hard when you keep it in-house to scale it and so, most recently we announced an outsourcing of some portion of our fund administration. And then I would say, just getting better at looking at massive amount of data like a market data research and finding opportunities there where historically that was probably managed more by the investment teams needs as opposed to centrally and finding out where you have overlap. So it's just continuing to scour through and figuring out where those opportunities exist.","Matthew Nicholls","I think the other thing on that is we've candidly just become in fairly short order, I would say much more disciplined about investing in projects that we see really moving the needle and moving away from sort of hobby-type luxury-type investments that we were making in our business for good reasons candidly, but given the shift in the environment we've just gotten much more disciplined about that.","And frankly we found other areas within the cost structure that provide more flexibility in the event that the market continues to be challenged. So I think our guidance has moved a little bit as we've noted in our prepared remarks to the positive in terms of the costs that we can reduce and we're very confident about the flexibility of our cost structure.","Craig Siegenthaler","And just as my follow up I have one on U.S. distribution, what is your business strategy for targeting U.S. RIAs? And I'm talking outside of Fiduciary Trust and CNN and Penn Trust, it's the fastest growing segment of U.S. Wealth and within that, what sort of Franklin products are you finding the RIAs most interested in?","Jenny Johnson","RIAs want more or less kind of traditional and then to the extent its traditional ETFs are obviously very popular. So SMAs are popular there and as we talked about, we hired somebody to run our SMA business and that's starting to grow. Our ETFs had its best quarter ever, with $1.2 billion. As a matter of fact, the launch of our FLCO, which is our core bond was I think the third-fastest growing ETF in 2019.","So those are interesting for that channel, but how do you really get mindshare of the RIA, and that's what we're talking about those additional services as RIAs had to grow their business into more of a wealth management business finding ways that we can have tools and take some of the capabilities that Fiduciary Trust provides to its clients to provide its value-added services that aren't particularly more costly for us to add to it, but can be leveraged more broadly, there.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Your line is now.","Patrick Davitt","First one, on these kind of bolt-on deals of Fiduciary Trust how should we think about those running through the financials from a revenue and operating income standpoint and then maybe more broadly through the lens of the comment about doubling it, how should we think about future AUM or each deal adding to results over the - as they come through?","Greg Johnson","Yes, I think - Good morning, Patrick. I think the way to think about the two transactions that we've announced, bearing in mind that Athena closes in February and Pennsylvania Trust closes in April, is that they'll add collectively about $0.015 to $0.02 a share to earnings. The margin is roughly in line with our margin as a Company, but we see expansion opportunities there. And you should transactions that we may be looking at are very similar to that in proportion to the size of these transactions. So I think that's the level of detail we're willing to give at this point.","Patrick Davitt","And then on the commentary, should we take that you are not calling out any specific redemptions to mean that there aren't any as you have in the past couple of quarters?","Jenny Johnson","There are some that we are aware of. I think there is a $1.1 billion, we just don't know when it comes in. We don't have - we don't, we're not aware of any specific dates this quarter that any episodic redemption is coming in.","Matthew Nicholls","Yes, I think the way to say it is that we're early in the quarter with a better net flow picture so far, and we have very little known large episodic outflows, so that's why you don't see it written into the commentary.","Greg Johnson","And I would just add, I mean it - we just in the past, it's hard when you know one or two and you don't know the timing and sometimes it's better not to say anything when we release our asset levels on a regular basis. Of course, there's still going to be pressure from the VA business and just trying to get the timing sometimes is very difficult, but there is still going to be larger redemptions coming on that side, as we've talked about in the past.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is now live.","Dan Fannon","I guess just to follow up on that, I guess, could you give us the level of assets left in that VA business at this point?","Matthew Nicholls","I think it's like $35 billion, but again, we'll - that's way off - I'll get back to you, but I think that's about somewhere around that number. Not all of that obviously is at risk. It's just some of the - that business, as we've said before has been under a transition from using funds to using different lower volume models and index like products and lower cost products, and we've been transitioning our business in part of our solutions and we've actually been able to retain some of those accounts by switching them into the new model.","So I think that, that - we're hopeful that that can be a growth business instead of one that's been in constant decline as the traditional funds have been under pressure.","Jenny Johnson","And I will confirm Greg's number.","Greg Johnson","Jenny looked it up, so it's good support.","Dan Fannon","And then just as a follow-up in the commentary you talked about the Income Fund, and you mentioned yield being a bigger factor for kind of investment decisions in over necessarily potentially performance, but we've seen outflows increase in the last three quarters, redemption levels growing, performance there obviously has come in.","So can you talk about again just to that fund and that category and how we should think about it on a go-forward basis based on either platforms or kind of distribution partners and how they're thinking about that fund in the context of everything else?","Greg Johnson","Yes, I mean I will start and just say that first and foremost, I mean, the yield is 2.5 times its category yield. So it's a very different creature, than where it's measured against. And again, most advisors appreciate that fact. So you're going to have more duration risk if rates go up like they did in that in the quarter and generally a little more credit risk than maybe the category.","The other big factor, as we talked about it before is how this fund fits into the new landscape of fee-based versus the traditional brokerage model and it's less, less of an opportunity for sales in the fee-based world that's building models and we're building models as well and adapting our product lineup and solutions to meet that, but the traditional 40 Act fund of the Income Fund is under that secular pressure.","So it's hard to gauge how much of it, I don't think a lot of it's really performance related, I think you still are going to be under pressure as people transition to fee based, and we do our best, and as that settles it's still always going to be attractive in the brokerage world. But there is other markets like we're just introduced in Europe in our SICAV lineup and hopefully we could gain some of what we lose in those redemptions.","Jenny Johnson","And I'll just add. The category has got a decline of about 2% and we were up 4% and the Income Fund specifically gross sales were up 28%. So the strategy to Greg's point, the category is much lower yielding and so it often gets dinged in its measurement there but clients love the yield. And we think there is huge opportunity for the SMA business on that product. So it's been around 70 plus years for a reason.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Mike Carrier from Bank of America. Your line is now live.","Mike Carrier","We've hit on M&A a little bit and I guess just one question on that, and one follow up, just when you look at the backdrop, obviously you guys have been more active on the wealth side, but you've mentioned some product areas, distribution areas that you're more interested in.","I was just curious, when you look at the competitive backdrop, whether it's pricing, how you're thinking about returns on investments whether it's in Walter Asset Management, just kind of an update on how you're thinking about just given that you're spending more time on that area and how you see that kind of playing out.","Greg Johnson","So, no market cycle is perfect in terms of when you should execute inorganic transactions and this is obviously no exception, given the fact that we're at the height of the asset class prices across nearly every asset class that we're in. And that we're interested in growing. So that part is a tough one to answer.","Other than the fact that we think the areas that we're looking at in particular will make us as a firm more efficient and better utilize expensive resources that we have that are very important for the future of alpha in a standalone basis and we think we can make acquisition targets more efficient and more attractive for them, and even more so it's like a multiplier effect when you put the two things together. That's point one.","In terms of what we look at around metrics and hurdles and such, I would just say that we look at a number of quantitative and qualitative metrics, including how the transaction could increase the return of our current assets, which I just referred to, for example, distribution is a very important one appropriate risk rated - sorry risk adjusted discount rates precedents comps, the basic principle of achieving a return in excess of our own cost of capital.","The things that you're very familiar with, we're very focused on. Frankly in a very, very simple level, you can see the size of our cash resources and turning that cash into a positive catalyst in terms of increasing our earnings and making our firm more efficient capitalizing what we see to be a pretty exciting future in many areas, notwithstanding the pressure on the industry is what we're very focused on. So it's really a combination of all of those - all those things, Mike.","Greg Johnson","And I would just add that as we said before, I mean, looking at a benefit street type, when you say what, how do we look at the world and landscape, and that's a classic example of an emerging category that is passive proof and one that we think is going to grow very well and one that we think we can add value to distribution and I would say, all of those are being validated to date as we continue to bring new products out and are ready to benefit from some of those positionings in the next year or so and I think again we look at the landscape it would be more on lower cost institutional managers that we can then build into our retail relationships versus the older higher cost 40 Act type managers.","We'd be more focused on that and then technology, anything we can accelerate and look at platforms for distribution that could be helpful and build globally, those are the other areas that we think could be very important to us.","And then finally I'd say as we said before alternatives, real estate again passive proof of categories, private equity things like that that really build out our alternatives group and then have the specialization of distribution in those categories and have the kind of breadth that allows us to have the specialization would be where we're heading.","MikeCarrier","Right, that's helpful and then just a quick follow-up maybe on the organic newer areas like the SMAs, models, multi-assets, I guess on one hand, you guys have the distribution, and you have a long track records in a lot of the products, the other hand, some of the performance challenges in the near term, a bit of a hurdle. So just want to get an update on how much maybe be traction you're seeing on that front, and do you need to some of the shorter-term performance to shift in order to see that pick up.","Greg Johnson","Yes, I mean I'll let Jenny follow me, but I don't think the, you know the challenges of we have because of our asset mix and styles of the Templeton with the value discipline in a mutual with the value discipline doesn't mean that your solutions business and your SMA business can't be successful and they are not required to put those in the portfolios, if they think that that style is not appropriate in this cycle.","So I don't think it's held it back at all. We've been very successful getting our models into the larger distribution platforms and are seeing some growth there today. So I don't think the performance issues of just style of value versus growth and again if you look at our growth funds and how well they are doing across the board that they certainly are solutions benefits from that today as it does our retail flows.","Jenny Johnson","Yes, as Greg mentioned, you know, certain newer categories for us or where we put more resources SMAs are up as he mentioned the model portfolios, and I think we talked on the prior call about a couple of wins we've had there, assets up 45% from the same period a year ago, hitting $1 billion and good traction.","Once you get in the model, you still have to go sell it through all the individual financial advisors in the firm and provide that kind of support, but we've had good traction there and then having already mentioned ETFs, we were actually the fastest growing firm with as far as the U.S. ETF issuer with assets above $1 billion last year.","So these are all where we think the vehicles in which investment management is getting delivered in this new kind of fee-based model and we've got good traction in those areas.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is now live.","Brennan Hawken","One on the SMA, and you guys' approach there considering the expansion of that offering into the broker-sold channel. Just curious about when you think about it, what portion of your products do you think makes sense in that wrapper and whether or not you need to make further investments as those - as those assets ramp. Because obviously you've got the wholesalers into the sales effort which is clear. But it's my understanding that you need sort of trading pipes and other automated connectivity into each of those platforms, does that require any further investment, or are you guys already there.","Jenny Johnson","So I would say that that is what we've been working on, as I mentioned bringing in the new head of SMAs, I think we learned a bit more about what we needed to do and I think we're in a good place today.","Greg Johnson","But it's not something we've been in that business for over 20 years and so it hasn't been a big emphasis for us, but Templeton at a very focused group early on and we've been in the muni business for a long time as well than SMAs.","Brennan Hawken","And the part of the question about which portion of the lineup might make sense for that wrapper because it's not all that well since you need to own the underlying securities.","Jenny Johnson","Well, so the way the industries have uptick the Income Fund, right, there are securities in there that the individual client can't own on the statement and so you just do a completion mutual fund, and so we have launched a few of those. So for example, the underlying equities and bonds that are appropriate to be on the client statement would be there and then anything that the client can own individually, the advisor would allocate that to the completion fund.","Brennan Hawken","And a follow-up on the trends you guys have seen here in January, certainly encouraging that the flow trends have moderated but can you help us understand why that is necessarily indicative of the best way to think about the path forward because it is just one month and when we look at the last three quarters, the redemptions seem to have accelerated each quarter and that's coincided with the deterioration in performance.","So is there something specific about when the calendar flipped, that should translate into that trend proving sustainable or maybe a little more color on that would be great. Thank you.","Greg Johnson","Yes, I mean I think it's hard, I think January is generally a better month, number one, December you generally have higher redemptions and that quarter tax selling and year-end and slower sales because there's a lot going on in December and January, generally is just a better month in terms of flows.","You know, it's hard to gauge how much of that is tax selling and where obviously for us if you, again, it's hard to say take the global bond out of the equation, because that's been a big driver of flows both ways. But if you look at the last quarter, we had three major categories and inflows, which would have been a very positive story, if we didn't have the acceleration of $6 billion of outflows within Global Bond.","So I think you're right in asking that question, where does it go. I think there was more pressure for the quarter, and as I said before things moved quickly in terms of relative short-term performance and we're already have seen some recapture and performance in the quarter to date with global bonds. So that can move quickly and we've seen it in past cycles, how quickly it went from outflows to moving back to inflows.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.","Alex Blostein","I just wanted to follow up on the - the one of the things you guys mentioned earlier regarding acquisitions to build out Fiduciary Trust and I think you said you expect to double that asset base over the next year or two. So maybe could you just spend a couple of minutes on the EBITDA multiples you're seeing the space that you're comfortable paying the competitive dynamics in the corner of the market, because I think there's a lot of businesses you would like to add scale and presence in that corner of the wealth management industry and what are the key selling points at the end of the day, is it a one-off discussions, or are there more competitor, kind of why do people decide to sell to Franklin?","Jenny Johnson","Yes, I'll take that part and then let you talk about the multiples in EBITDA. You know, you're absolutely right, when you talk of these financial advisors, they're usually at a point where, as Greg mentioned are feeling that they can't continue to invest in technology when the regulation and the requirements around really adding all these wealth capabilities it because they realize they are subscale and there are a lot of buyers.","The two acquisitions that we did chose us and they chose us because Fiduciary Trust has been around since the 1930s, it was set up by five high net worth families. It is really marquee ultra-high net worth business that understands multigenerational asset management and the issues that go much beyond just figuring out investment returns and so it will always be a competitive space, and it will be a space where they're looking at their clients who they know well and saying, who is going to be the best stored of these assets. And so that's what we think is our big selling point.","Greg Johnson","Yes. And I think in terms of the multiple in the price in the competition for these assets, I think, Alex, what you may be referring to is the broader wealth management business, of course, we know that private equity and other wealth managers in the mass affluent wealth space are very, very active and some of the EBITDA multiples being discussed here in '15-'16 times plus area even in businesses that don't actually have the acquisitions closed yet, for example. So it is a very highly competitive space from a rollout perspective because the economics just make so much sense.","In this area that we're focused on with the multiples, a little bit lower. I'd say so, say in the low double-digits to ten times to low-double digits area and that becomes more efficient for us upon the connection collaboration and to a certain degree integration with Fiduciary Trust that becomes very economically compelling to us and as Jenny mentioned the reason for us versus others is there are really a very small handful of very focused pure ultra-high net worth wealth managers, the services that you need to provide are very expensive to invest in and to retain and to have the right team to provide it. And I'd say they're very specialized across the whole slew of different advisory solutions, if you will for sophisticated ultra-high net worth folks.","So that's why we think we're a good home, just as Jenny mentioned we've become a sort of coming together of both sides. Not as necessarily going out and scouring the ground. We're also finding that upon the announcement in these transactions and news getting out of our interest through Fiduciary Trust, that there are more than we actually thought in the marketplace and there are several very important dates in the U.S. that contain other sorts of firms in the $3 billion to $6 billion, $7 billion AUM area that will also be a very good fit for Fiduciary Trust in our strategy.","Alex Blostein","My follow-up question was just a quick one around expenses. I apologize, you mentioned it earlier, but if you look at the guidance, I think you're guiding to a down 2.5% expense growth for fiscal 2020 versus '19. I just want to confirm that's for the total expense base of about $2.4 billion last year and that's inclusive obviously of the deals that you announced. So there is going to be a little bit of revenue that's going to come through with that as well. So maybe just kind of confirm the expense number for this year and help us think about the revenue contribution for this year from the deals that you are planning to close. Thanks.","Greg Johnson","I'd confirm that on the expense side. And I would also confirm that, that guidance is inclusive of the transactions that we've just announced. We're not going to separate out the revenue yet until that becomes a larger line item, but our guidance generally speaking on the expenses consistent where we expect revenue to be also.","So we - as we have done this quarter and the same with last quarter. Our objective is to do our very best to have positive operating leverage in the business and I would say that would be our guidance for 2020. So our guidance of 2% to 2.5% perhaps even a little bit more expense reduction based off 2019 that you referred to, Alex, so I would say that on the revenue side, we'd hope to be better than that.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is now live.","Robert Lee","This may be more of a philosophical question. But if I think of the growing the high - ultra high net worth business, I think some of the investments you're making in various platforms. Is there a desire or need here to try to get closer to the end asset owner? I mean one of the challenges for the industry broadly has always been there is someone between you and the ultimate owner of the asset.","So you think that that's an important part of kind of your strategy, you're trying to get closer to who actually owns the asset and pulls a trigger?","Jenny Johnson","Yes. So I mean we are still big believers in end financial advisor providing advice. We are not believers that the robo advisor is going to, and the machine is going to, in the end intermediate that Financial Advisor. You know these things like robo advisors, we think is more akin to a TurboTax which was going to put all CPAs out of business and now the CPAs are the big users of TurboTax.","So the key for us is what kind of as the advisor adds more wealth management capabilities what platforms can we invest in to get closer to that end advisor to be able to influence and help them be better at their business and so as we think about our investments on the technology side, it can be things like financial planning or other kind of tools that the advisor is expanding beyond just investment capabilities.","Robert Lee","And maybe just a quick follow-up, I mean there's clearly a lot of discussion on M&A on the call, but maybe this is a question, just to confirm what you're not interested. And I assume you're continuing to not be interested in any kind of scale driven merger.","Greg Johnson","I don't think that's accurate to be frank. We don't want you seem like we are looking at every single thing on the planet there, as I've said in - or as we said on previous calls, we're out there, very few transactions that contain an element of scale in it, that would make sense for us, but there's certainly other those that contain that. And that is on our shortlist.","Matthew Nicholls","Yes, I think the point is that we would never be first on the list of combining something for the sake of cost cutting and scale. We may get that secondarily as a benefit out of it, but it's really about bringing in areas that complement the firm in areas that we believe are going to be strong areas of growth in the future, but that certainly doesn't eliminate the benefit of certainly distribution and scale and things you can get out of that.","Greg Johnson","Yes, I mean we could, for example, consolidate an operation in the U.S., but remembering that what that business may contain would be applicable to many countries overseas that we're in that perhaps that party is not in.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.","Michael Cyprys","Maybe just following on the Fiduciary Trust build out, hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on the strategy there and talk about what you're looking for in firms that you might acquire and maybe you could talk a little about your process there. How you sift through and identify and prioritize and what your ultimate vision here is.","Jenny Johnson","I'll let Matt handle the - how do we sift through. Again there are financial advisors that are - that are almost family offices or really wealth managers that have done very, very well up until now. And the regulatory environment and the demands on services have increased. And, you know they're looking at their business and they're thinking, I want to add more things, but it's just difficult to scale this.","And so, they're looking for home with a firm that understands the wealth business, and the ultra-high net worth business is about investment returns, it's about trust and the state planning, it's about tax efficiency and it's about education in the next generation of wealth. And the wealthier and the older you get, the next generation education becomes the most important part of that.","And so if they're looking at their clients, they want to make sure that they're connecting with the firm that can provide longevity and also has that same core culture of understanding what it takes to really manage for a high net worth family, and not all the roll-ups that are happening out there meshing both the ultra-high net worth with mass affluent and that becomes a danger of diluting kind of a capability that you provide for the ultra-high net worth. Matt, I don't know if you want to talk about?","Matthew Nicholls","Yes, I mean, and look, we have, as I mentioned a moment ago to Alex's question, we have financial discipline around these things. So obviously we want to make sure that it's going to work financially for us upfront in terms of the multiple, and then there's various earn-out structures and performance targets that we have against the business.","I think that the - where that base location is very important in terms of limiting disruption obviously as always, very important, the point Jenny made around diluting the last thing we want to do is dilute the specialized nature of what Fiduciary Trust does and frankly the targets that we - or the partners of future companies that we could own that's exactly how they feel as well.","They don't want to - what they do to be diluted in any way by what we do. So when we're having these discussions, it's really a coming to a mutual understanding very rapidly that what we're trying to achieve is the same goal ultimately.","So, the summary is, we're financially disciplined, obviously, it needs to make sense for us a very good use of our cash and it's a very good use of an asset sort of pretty frankly being a little bit under-appreciated in the overall scheme of things, Fiduciary Trust, so.","Michael Cyprys","And just as a follow-up maybe on the ETF side, I was hoping you could elaborate on the ETF strategy I think about $7 billion in AUM is where you are today. But just curious as well around that what the interest or appetite there is to scale that may be in a more quickly more material way through inorganic means and what scenario could that makes sense for maybe you add some other geographic regions and more strategies around that?","Jenny Johnson","So we're - we launched in U.S., Canada and Europe and looking at Asia, we are quite happy with our growth. We were one of the first multi-factor smart beta issuers and actually that's the biggest group of assets. The second is our active ETFs and the third is our passive which are the cheapest actually passive in the category that they're in. And the challenge with ETFs is, you always have to get scale to be able to attract the institutions.","And so, we're starting to see more and more flows there every day and I think that it probably if the right opportunity came up, we'd certainly entertain it, but at this point the - we're focused on just, we have a great team, and the growth there.","Greg Johnson","And I would just add, I mean it as you know, I mean like anytime you get in a new business, it takes a few years, the big distributors wait and I think we're at that critical point where we've been out good performance in many of the ETFs and getting on all of pretty much all of the platforms now. So I think that's the big change of where we are in the cycle. So we're optimistic that that can that will really accelerate growth.","Jenny Johnson","And from a scale, for example, we are, I think it's launching this month, three somatic ETFs that are the Franklin genomic, the disruptive commerce and intelligent machines and we're basically leveraging the team that runs our Dynetek fund to be able to provide those because there was feedback from clients in that they wanted some specialized type products that - somatic products, so you're able to scale existing teams that are historically have been doing traditional mutual funds.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Your line is now live.","Glenn Schorr","Just one follow-up to your comments earlier on Benefit Street and one micro one macro. At the micro level, I'm just curious if you could update us on anything related to performance, new products and distribution penetration that you've seen, now that they're part of the family, and then at the higher level, curious how you're thinking about addressing other private asset classes across PE real estate infrastructure and things like that. Thanks.","Greg Johnson","Yes, I mean, I'll just start with the BSP and I think as we said before, it's not something you just plug and expect to see flows on the retail side, it's a complex, more complex product set up and we set up interval funds for the retail, for retail distribution in both the U.S. and in Europe. And we've also this year are planning on having a BDC offering with one of the major distributors here in the summer and all of these are going to be meaningful in terms of flows this year.","So I think we're very pleased with performance, with the pace and how we've gotten our distribution kind of lined up behind it. And it's - it is a more complex sale that we've learned, but we've done a lot of training and continue to be very optimistic there.","I think the difficulty when you say the tactics around the other asset classes, it's very hard to go out and just buy, as you know buy real estate or buy private equity and so it's performance, fee driven, its partnership driven and you've got to find the right combination of incentives to make that work. So it's not always easy to do that. And I'll let Matt if you want to add.","Matthew Nicholls","Yes, just got a couple of other points on Benefit Street. First of all, in terms of their revenue contribution for the quarter was up 8% from last quarter to $53 million that was largely due to performance fees, but still its increased contribution.","I think the second thing is the team the Benefit Street is providing tremendous leverage for us at Franklin in terms of our overall strategy for alternative asset managers, they're all very experienced spending time with the other asset classes with the new alternative arena, including frankly spending time considering smaller specialized acquisition targets in that area both domestically in the U.S. and internationally. So we get - there's multiple other benefits to owning Benefit Street away from just the organic sort of activity we have going on which we are enthusiastic about the future.","Operator","Our final question today is coming from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.","Brian Bedell","Thanks for taking my follow-up. My question on the ETF in organic was already answered, but maybe if I could just add a couple of things. Maybe your view on the active semitransparent ETFs, is that something that you think you would like to develop and leverage some of your better performing track records? And then also I think you mentioned geographies, you'd like to expand in terms of the M&A strategy. Is that more distribution-oriented or is it more product-oriented?","A \u2013 Greg Johnson","On the latter one, I'll start and Jenny would go the ETF one. On the latter one, it's a combination of both, depends on what market if it's more of the emerging markets, it's really distribution driven. In certain other local markets as you know, we have a local asset management business in several markets sometimes can be beyond distribution.","And in certain cases it's just, we have a very good operational group, if you will, based in certain of these countries and we can be much more scaled with the same amount of head count. So we're very focused on certain key countries and growing those countries, that's what we mean by that.","Jenny Johnson","And the non-transparent ETF vehicles that have been approved they're really U.S. equity. So you are limited. And we certainly talked about it, and at the point where we feel that a particular product requires non-transparent, we will absolutely entertain it, as I mentioned in rolling out these three Dynetek funds we felt comfortable that we didn't need non-transparent on those. And in the fixed income ones that we've rolled out. So far, we haven't felt the need for it, but it is not something that we are averse to if it makes sense for particular product.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments.","Greg Johnson","Well, thank you everyone for attending our call and we look forward to speaking next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today."],"10198":["Franklin Resources, Inc. (NYSE:BEN) F3Q 2014 Pre Recorded Earnings Conference Call July 30, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Greg Johnson - Chief Executive Officer","Ken Lewis - Chief Financial Officer","Operator","Welcome to Franklin Resources Earnings Commentary for the quarter ended June 30, 2014. Statements made in this commentary regarding Franklin Resources, Inc., which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These and other risks, uncertainties, and other important factors are described in more detail in Franklin\u2019s recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors and MD&A sections of Franklin\u2019s most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q filings. This commentary was pre-recorded.","Greg Johnson - Chief Executive Officer","Hello and thank you for listening to our third quarter earnings commentary. I am Greg Johnson, CEO and I am joined by Ken Lewis, our CFO. There are number of positive developments during the quarter, but most importantly, long-term relative investment performance of U.S. and cross-border funds remains strong across equity, hybrid and fixed income strategies.","Assets under management ended the quarter at over $920 billion, a new high for the company and a 13% increase from the prior year. Long-term net new flows rebounded to $2.5 billion highlighted by strong flows into hybrid strategies and a return to positive flows into fixed income. Profitability remains strong with year-to-date operating margin near 38%. Cumulative share repurchases and dividends for the trailing 12 months period was $1 billion, roughly approximating after-tax net cash flow to the U.S. parent company.","As illustrated on Slide 6, relative investment performance of our U.S. retail and cross-border funds is strong with the majority of assets in the top two Lipper or Morningstar quartiles across all standard time periods. It\u2019s worth noting that our various hybrid funds that have been attracting strong flows continue to have exceptional long-term performance. In fact, Franklin Income Fund has top decile performance over all of these time periods and was recently awarded a five-star rating by Morningstar. The cross-border version of the fund has performed just as well. Ending and average assets under management rose again this quarter, increasing about 4% and 3% respectively. Assets under management remain well-diversified by investment objectives, sales region and client type, with the mix of assets essentially unchanged from last quarter, but we are gradually seeing a shift toward equity and hybrid products, as well as to the U.S. sales region.","Not shown in this slide is the breakdown by client type, which remains approximately three quarters retail. Our diversified asset base allows our clients to build diversified portfolios within our fund family and has historically enabled us to weather tough macro environments that caused certain strategies to temporarily fall out of paper. This quarter was no exception, as flows benefited from the diversification of our asset base, gaining further traction with various targeted, global and regional sales and marketing campaigns. Industry wide, retail and institutional sales slowed from the March quarter. Equity was the hardest hit. However, fixed income flows had a strong rebound as sales picked up and redemptions eased.","Our flows generally mirrored these trends as long-term sales decreased slightly to $47.5 billion, within the average range we have seen for the past several years. But importantly, redemptions slowed significantly to $45 billion, their lowest level in over a year. This quarter we saw traditional fixed income flows remain neutral and some relative flow weakness in equities, but the appetite for hybrid remains strong and global fixed income strategies return to positive flows. The latter two are areas of emphasis for newer campaigns that were rolled out earlier in the year. Those campaigns are intended to support financial advisors with client discussions and highlight relevant Franklin Templeton Funds. An example of this is our income for What\u2019s Next campaign, which is a retirement focused campaign to prepare investors for income generation during retirement. Products highlighted included the Franklin Income Fund, Rising Dividends Fund, Global Bond Fund, and Federal Tax-Free Income Fund.","Moving to Slide 11, we enhanced the regional flow disclosure to provide more transparency on flow trends by retail and institutional channels within each region. Retail flows returned to positive territory this quarter following three consecutive quarters of outflows. However, international retail remained in net redemptions predominantly fueled by Europe. With that said, Europe\u2019s retail redemptions declined by 40% and were a big contributor to our improved net new flows this quarter. In the U.S., retail flows improved resulting in its best flow quarter since March 2013. Even with muni bonds continuing to be a drag on flows.","Institutional flows improved this quarter, led by global fixed income, where we saw the most interest in our global multi-sector plus strategies. However, global equities continue to experience outflows, due primarily to a few lumpy redemptions totaling $1.5 billion. This quarter we also saw interest in our emerging market capabilities where we had notable fundings in Malaysian equity and Thai equity accounts. The pipeline of unfunded committed wins look strong for the fourth quarter, as we are seeing demand for emerging market debt and global bond plus strategies and we anticipate three larger than average $1 billion plus mandates to fund during this quarter or next.","Moving to flows by investment objective, global fixed income improved significantly over the prior quarter with $1.4 billion in net new flows. Strength in the quarter came from emerging market bond institutional demand for global multi-sector plus and strategies, managed by our local asset management teams in India, Korea and the MENA region. The cross border, Templeton Global Bond and total return funds remained in outflows, but both experienced increased sales and lower redemptions. The U.S. registered versions were essentially breakeven again, with net new flows of less than $100 million. In fact, all told, the global bond team realized essentially breakeven flows for the quarter.","Our sales and marketing teams continue to focus and educating clients on the funds, and why they are well-suited for today\u2019s fixed income landscape. On the global equity side flows were still slightly negative, but it\u2019s worth mentioning that we are seeing a significant recovery in our emerging markets equity products, which drove the outflows last quarter and came to close to breaking even this quarter. U.S. and cross-border versions of the Templeton Asian Growth Fund, in particular are recovering with significant declines in redemptions over the prior two quarters.","Global Equity Strategies, managed by our local asset management teams continue to be a bright spot and two of the best flowing products this quarter were cross-border funds managed by our European and Indian equity teams. In some instances we have been able to successfully export local management expertise for our cross-border funds, which is a nice way for us to build scale in those teams. As investors re-risk towards equity, we have primarily seen flows into our various hybrid strategies as we are actively promoting our balance funds as a way to diversify investors from fixed income into equity, without fully committing to an equity fund.","It\u2019s no coincidence that Franklin Income Fund, which drew net new flows are approximately $1.4 billion was our best selling product this quarter. Over the past year, we have also seen a steady increase in demand for the cross-border version of the fund, which recorded organic growth over 90% this quarter and had over $3.6 billion of assets at June 30. It took this fund roughly 12 years to reach $1 billion, and only about three more to add an additional $2.5 billion.","We are also seeing strong traction with our Templeton Global Balance Fund for U.S. investors and the cross-border equivalent, Templeton Global Income Fund, which were both launched in 2005, and combine the expertise of our Templeton Global Equity and Global Bond Teams. These funds are top quartile performance over almost all time periods, and have combined for better than 70% pre-market organic growth year-to-date. These funds have appealed to investors looking to diversify away from global fixed income. As we have seen exchanges as well as new money coming into the funds, which have nearly tripled in AUM in the last two years to a combined $4.8 billion as of June. U.S. equity, on the other hand, had modest outflows, along with the rest of the industry. Our Franklin Small Cap Growth and Franklin Rising Dividend Funds with the top flow gainers, but a pullback for our cross-border biotech discovery and U.S. opportunities funds contributed to the variance from last quarter.","Moving on to domestic fixed income on Slide 14, flows into our municipal bonds are trending towards breakeven, with just $400 million in outflows this quarter. Despite the industry continuing to see positive net new flows since January, our focus on the longer duration investor has slowed our turnaround because investors generally remain more interested in short and intermediate term funds. While longer term we expect this recovery to fully play out ongoing headline risk around Puerto Rico may continue to affect these flows over the shorter term. With that being said several key funds within this category have turned positive, primarily those with short to intermediate duration.","U.S. taxable fixed income net new flows remained slightly positive at $200 million with inflows into high yield and floating rate products more than offsetting the outflows for more traditional fixed income strategies. We continue to execute on strategic initiatives such as international growth, and positioning ourselves to capture retirement assets. This past quarter, we held a retirement plan adviser symposium for defined contribution investment only advisers and well attended client conferences in the U.S. and Asia, which gave us the opportunity to showcase our capabilities. For example, the forum we hosted in New York was attended by a 170 institutional clients, consultants, research professionals and plan sponsors representing approximately 30% of our AUM. That event also allowed us to efficiently leverage the time of many of our senior portfolio managers and business leaders while hosting our first Investor Day, which we hope enhanced your understanding of the Franklin Templeton story.","I will now turn it over to Ken for financial results.","Ken Lewis - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Greg. Operating income for the quarter was $787 million, which was a slight increase from last quarter due to a number of factors, which I will go into shortly. Net income increased to $579 million, a 3% increase from last quarter due primarily to increased other income and earnings per share was $0.92 also a 3% increase. Total revenue of $2.13 billion is an all-time high and a 2% increase from last quarter. Investment management fees and the asset-based component of sales and distribution fees benefited from higher average assets under management and the additional day in the quarter.","The increase in investment management fees from last quarter was below the pace of average assets under management growth due to a slight shift in the mix towards lower fee products. The mix of assets under management has been trending towards hybrid, institutional and U.S. registered global fixed income funds and away from emerging markets, which has yielded a slightly lower effective fee rate of around 62 basis points excluding performance fees. Sales and distribution fees increased 1% as the increase in the asset-based component was partially offset by lower cross-border sales.","Shareholder servicing fees increased 2%, consistent with the increase in billable shareholder accounts. As you may recall from previous years, Canada typically purged closed billable accounts in the third quarter, but the switch to a bundled fee this year means that they are no longer charging shareholder servicing fees. The purge of closed U.S. accounts occurred in July and 1.2 million accounts were removed, which will be reflected in the financial results next quarter.","Operating expenses increased 3% with most of the increase coming from the asset-based component of sales, distribution and marketing expense, which included non-recurring items of about $12.2 million, which if excluded, would have resulted in a 1% increase, in line with the revenue increase. Compensation and benefits expense was $380.7 million, primarily reflecting increased variable compensation due to increased operating income. Also included in variable compensation is the mark-to-market of long-term mutual fund awards for investment professionals.","Information systems and technology expense was $54.3 million, an increase of 6%, as some of the typical fourth quarter seasonality was realized this quarter. Occupancy and general and administrative expenses were little changed from the previous quarter. So, looking ahead to the first quarter, we anticipate meeting the 4% to 5% of year-over-year expense growth I guided to last fall though expectations for some specific line items have changed. Our current expectations are for compensation and benefits to more or less be flat next quarter. Technology, occupancy and general and administrative expenses combined should increase somewhat.","Turning to Slide 19, on operating leverage, fiscal year-to-date operating income was almost $2.4 billion and the operating margin was 37.7%. As I stated in my comments at our Investor Day in May, we do not run the business to meet a margin goal, partly because the accounting for sales and distribution expenses can have a significant effect on GAAP margins. Our focus is on delivering operating income growth, which is tended to lead to margin expansion over time. Other income net was $96.7 million this quarter, but as you can see on Slide 19, it included substantial gains from consolidated sponsored investment products, which were offset by non-controlling interests. So therefore, better way to look at other income is net of non-controlling interests, which was $52.4 million.","The primary contributor to other income was equity method investment gains of $34 million, which was reflective of a strong global equity market this quarter. The tax rate came in lower than expectations at 28.5% for the quarter and 29.4% for the fiscal year period, but that is partly a function of pre-tax income being inflated by non-controlling interest and consolidated sponsored investment products. If not for that noise, the rate would have been in the 29.5% to 30% range we expect.","Moving on to capital management, we updated the slides this quarter to augment our discussion of capital management. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.4 million shares, continuing our track record as a net buyer of our stock, which has steadily decreased shares outstanding and added roughly 2% average accretion per year. The new chart on the bottom of Slide 22 illustrates our five year historical share repurchase activity and although the pace of repurchases did slow during last fiscal year, this was largely due to the large special dividend of $640 million we paid at the beginning of that period. We have remained consistent buyers of our stock and have accelerated the pace of repurchases when market pullbacks offer better opportunities, such as in 2011 and the September 2013 quarter.","The good news and bad news here is that there have been few if any material debts to buy over the past year or two. In fact, the S&P 500 hasn\u2019t suffered an official correction in over 1,000 trading days and counting. The last correction occurred roughly 34 months ago, which is a long time when you consider that corrections have occurred on average about every 18 months. Slide 23, is an updated view on capital return, but rather than focus on payout ratio of net income, it focuses on actual cash distributed through dividends and share repurchases. We believe this is a better way to look at it, because the payout ratio is based on net income which is not adjusted for foreign earnings, particularly when compared to peers that have not scaled their foreign operations like we have.","That said we did include the payout ratios for dividends and repurchases on the chart for reference. Over the trailing 12 months, we distributed $1 billion, primarily through share repurchases. While feedback expressed by our fellow shareholders is pointing to a variety of preferences one common thread has been a request to distribute as much available cash flow as possible, without unnecessarily triggering tax on undistributed foreign sourced earnings. And that has actually been our practice for many years. Though the pace of distributions has been below that of a year ago, we remain committed to returning U.S. free cash flow to shareholders over the near to intermediate term.","Turning to Slide 24, we have updated the net cash and investments chart to include a breakdown of U.S. and non-U.S. net cash and investments for the prior fiscal year end periods. While we do believe in the benefits of having a strong balance sheet, the growth in net cash and investments has primarily been offshore. Total net cash and investments was $8.8 billion at the end of the quarter.","To illustrate the fact, that we have historically distributed essentially all of U.S. generated cash flow, this slide shows that net cash investments in the U.S. has averaged about $1 billion over the period shown in this chart. And the reason that we have not shown the breakdown at quarter end, even though it\u2019s included in our filing, is that we did not want to complicate the message by discussing the seasonal adjustments required to account for intra-fiscal year cash flow timing differences. That being said, we would expect our U.S. cash investment balance to be a little higher at the end of this fiscal year, due to some large seed capital investments that we made in 2014 like in the new Franklin K2 Alternative Strategies Fund. Our goal is not to grow the balance sheet, though we are optimistic that fundamental corporate tax reform will eventually occur.","That concludes our prepared remarks and we look forward to the live call later this morning.","Question-and-Answer Session","[No Q&A session for this event]"],"10203":["Franklin Resources, Inc.

Mr. Johnson, you may begin.","Greg Johnson","Hello. Thank you for joining Ken Lewis, our CFO, and me today to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year earnings. As we detailed in the recorded commentary earlier today, results were impacted by a number of converging market factors that created headwinds for performance and flows, particularly in our flagship funds.","While it\u2019s still early, we are encouraged by the rebound in performance of the Franklin Income Fund and Templeton Global Bond Fund over the past month. Importantly, financial results were solid and we demonstrated strong capital management by accelerating share repurchases during the quarter. ","We would now like to open it up for your questions.","Question-And-Answer Session ","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.","Q - Luke Montgomery","Good morning. Thank you. So last quarter you offered some commentary on gross sales trends being down. This quarter they weakened further and I think they\u2019re the lowest they\u2019ve been since the financial crisis. I guess a skeptic might wonder whether you stumbled into a sustained dry period for products that are going to get traction with the intermediaries.","At the same time I think you are still very well diversified across product offerings. You got good salespeople and I think on the whole performance looks decent. So perhaps you could disabuse me of that skeptical view and tell me where you feel optimistic about products or categories that could pick up the baton and drive sales from here?","Greg Johnson ","Well, I think, first of all, I mean you have to look at the quarter and you had extreme volatility and you had headlines almost on a regular basis with one crisis after another. And for us some of those headlines directly affected our flagship fund. So you had the Ukraine with the global bond fund, you had Puerto Rico with Muni. So, I think it\u2019s hard to separate how much that combined with a very weak quarter for certainly emerging markets versus the developed markets and global markets in general, a lot of volatility. You\u2019d expect to see people kind of wait and see what happens. I think the area that we still see strength as far as a new product would be the K2 fund where we are close -- are now about $2 billion. We have raised about $600 million in net new flows for the quarter, so that would certainly be one.","But I think the majority looking at the lineup and I would put mutual series in that category where it\u2019s focused on Europe and the U.S. and those were two of the best performing markets, put the mutual discovery fund in very good position in the global equity category, and we are seeing a lot of interest there. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any systemic kind of, or other than your two main funds have underperformed near term. They drive a lot of the flows and they tend to mask everything else. And then just the fear of the Fed raising rates that was there for the quarter and any fixed income fund was under pressure as well. So I think it\u2019s hard to get advisors to jump in when you have the uncertainty of these major events like the Fed raising or not to go into fixed income.","Luke Montgomery","Okay. That\u2019s fair enough. And then on the comp line, maybe I thought you could put some context around how you\u2019re driving that down, particularly as you think about year-to-date and projected fiscal first quarter profitability, how that\u2019s affecting bonus accruals for example. And then more generally, if you could comment on how you can manage comp with respect to market levels. Do you like to smooth it, or is it more pay to the environment?","Ken Lewis ","Sure. Yes. So comp this year was down 1% year-over-year. And a large part of that was based on the financial results of the Company and the revenue decline. That philosophy and our methodology for calculating the overall bonus pool, which is dependent on operating income, among other things, it will continue. So I would expect that to be in line with what we\u2019ve done historically. So as I mentioned, expenses for the year, we are looking to decrease expenses. We are also looking to make some investments. Last quarter I thought it would be flat. I think it will be a little bit better than that compensation is the largest expense that we have, so I would expect that to be down as well.","Having said that, there is seasonality in many of these lines. The one thing I\u2019ll mention in comp is we do have merit, the increase is coming. We\u2019ll have about one month of that next quarter. So it should be a little bit higher on a quarter versus quarter basis should be a little bit higher than this quarter.","Luke Montgomery","Thank you.","Ken Lewis","Overall, I would expect it to be lower.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Kim with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Kim","Good morning. First, maybe just at a high level can you talk about potential exposure to assets managed for sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East? Just trying to get a sense of maybe risk of some attrition, assuming commodities pricing remains under pressure. And then related to that any sense of the relative fee rates versus the overall weighted average revenue yield for the firm?","Ken Lewis","I\u2019ll take the first one. I think that you\u2019re exactly right. I think the attrition and reduction in some of the big sovereign wealth funds and we actually saw the effect of that this quarter where we had $1.4 billion out of one of the sovereign wealth funds and it was really just due to reallocation based on their exposure to Asia, having now a smaller pool of assets and it wasn\u2019t performance related. So there is some pressure there. I don\u2019t think there is anything I would call out beyond that. I think that was the one area where we had significant assets and it was a partial redemption of that account. But I don\u2019t have a number, nor do we publish a number, of our overall exposure there. But we haven\u2019t seen any other pressure that I\u2019m aware of for redemptions from the downsizing of those funds.","Greg Johnson","Yes. And we have seen some a little bit of pressure in the effected fee rate. But I think that we don\u2019t expect that to continue in a material way, but we\u2019re still seeing some of that and that should bleed into next year as well. We would see the effective fee rate decrease a little bit next year, I would expect.","Michael Kim","Okay. Fair enough. That\u2019s helpful. And then just given sort of the elevated fund outflows more recently, just any plans to maybe step up or adjust your marketing or sort of educational initiatives as it relates specifically to the global bond fund, just given the negative duration and relative returns of that portfolio, just to differentiate it, assuming rates, do start to trend higher at some point?","Ken Lewis","Yes. I mean I think we have been very active in just that, getting the message out that this fund is positioned for higher rates. And it\u2019s difficult to get to every shareholder, but especially when you have large gatekeepers in places in Europe that control the big percentage of those accounts. So we have been very active in just that. The messaging that this is a very different category. But at the end of the day you probably do have a lot of people that bought it at a time when you had very high returns and in a lower return environment and also the competition from just equities doing better in Europe. As I said before, you will see monies move over. But you\u2019re still right. There is a perception of any fixed income fund that it will not do well in a rising rate environment, and our marketing message has been very clear about trying to differentiate that. And part of the reason we took that global macro group out of our fixed income group was better to differentiate what that group is doing versus a traditional fixed income fund.","Michael Kim","Okay. And then just final question. Just trying to think about capital management. Clearly, you stepped up the share repurchases activity this quarter and you\u2019re now, I think, paying out more than 100% of the U.S. cash flow. But just trying to think about those dynamics within the context of a potential special dividend like you have done in the past?","Greg Johnson","Right. You know, when we had the special dividend last year, I talked a little bit about it after the fact. And I mentioned that there is usually a very robust discussion of capital management by the Board during the Board December meeting. So I really can\u2019t say what they will decide in December. But I guess I remind you of last year. One of the factors they considered was the percentage of current year\u2019s or the previous year\u2019s net income that they return to shareholders. That number at the time was below 50% and this year it\u2019s almost 90%. So I think that would be a significant factor in the decision. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll decide, but I\u2019ll let you make your own assumptions about that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Carrier","Thanks. Ken, just on the capital management, one follow-up there. When you look at -- obviously the pace was very active this quarter. But even when you look going forward, the valuation is still -- you had this level when the Board kind of considers what those options are.","Is that one of the driving factors? Are there a lot of other factors that go into that decision-making?","Ken Lewis","Yes. I think I would -- I think that the factors that they consider are the regular dividend and the special dividend and the volume, the historical volume of share repurchases and the anticipated volume going forward based on stock price.","So as we\u2019ve shown, we are opportunistic and we do tend to purchase more shares when the stock price is lower. But it is also systematic. And it is one of the things they would consider.","Michael Carrier","Okay. And, Greg, just on the -- some of the flow dynamics. And not really focused on this quarter, because there is some crazy things going on, but when you think about maybe on like the structural side and you hinted at in like the VA space some shifts that are going on there. And then when I look at -- on the flip side some of the new products that you launch, whether it\u2019s K2 or some of the allocations in the international fixed income, maybe not this year but over the longer term, it seems like there is some structural drivers that are going in your direction despite some of these headwinds.","So just wanted to get an update on where you see that demand? Maybe it\u2019s longer term that\u2019s driving some of the interests in these products versus -- you highlighted on that, like page 11 on the slides where from a cyclical standpoint you can see some pressure in shorter periods of time. So just basically how you\u2019re positioned for maybe the longer-term growth trends that you\u2019ve seen in the industry?","Greg Johnson","I think our history has always been to try to be innovative, whether it\u2019s with pricing or new funds and do things that stand the test of time. So I think you\u2019re right. The VA, there is some lumpy activity that\u2019s hard to get a handle on what more of your operating flows -- to try to forecast and see where things are going because the VA business has been an important part of our U.S. retail.","In the last quarter you had $3 billion of redemptions in -- for inactive firms that no longer support that business and it\u2019s in a runoff mode. And that\u2019s probably about a quarter of the firms that are in that business. So you\u2019ll still have some headwinds in that category continuing. They will probably be more one year event, but certainly challenging.","I think as far as where the world is going and things that hopefully we\u2019re thinking long term about, as we\u2019ve said in probably the last two years\u2019 worth of calls, how we have continued to build and develop our solutions capabilities and building tactical asset allocation funds and multi-asset funds that are starting to get good records and good traction. And to us that capability enabled us to do something creative with Citi and our global footprint put us into a different position versus competitors to come out with a suite of funds for a new market for them, where they will go after it in more of a digital way for relatively smaller accounts.","But I think having that product capability of doing more of the tactical and more funds that are more oriented towards a specific group that bring in all of the asset classes, I think that\u2019s very different than your traditional fund of just one class. And that\u2019s still going to be very important as advisors, to continue to build their own. But I think having the capability to do more tactical allocation will be increasingly important. I think that\u2019s the area that for us I think offers a lot of growth.","I think the expansion in the alternatives, we\u2019ve seen the success and I think the early traction of our long\/short of our -- the fund that\u2019s out there right now and then having a credit capability in there is another sleeve and we\u2019ll continue to build on that. So that\u2019s another area of growth. And then we have a new offering with a Flexible Alpha Bond Fund, which is another area of having more of a pure unconstrained bond fund like some of our competitors have that hopefully in a rising rate environment could do well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Fannon","Thanks. I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the insurance dynamic you mentioned on the prerecorded call. It seemed like some of it was associated with some de-risking from previous periods, but you also mentioned ongoing.","So just trying to get a sense of what is your exposure to that channel and thinking about also more looking forward, is the DOL and some of the changes around disclosures and that, is that having any factor in some of these changes now, or is it more, as you highlight, de-risking?","Greg Johnson","I think it\u2019s de-risking and just the guaranteed benefits and the liability and how they have thought about that as a business and some just have -- the insurance companies have gotten out of that and the companies like Hartford and Sun Life and Jackson National, big major firms are no longer doing that. So when they go inactive, some of them will lock in the liability. Some of them will go indexing or just do different things. So I think for us the total is about -- and I probably shouldn\u2019t even quote this off the top of my head but 17 billion remaining in that category. What percentage is at risk is probably -- I am not sure either there, but probably a third of that still, I would imagine, just based on looking at the numbers.","Daniel Fannon ","Great. And then the puts and takes around that institutional dynamic. You highlighted the win of 5 billion or so I guess.","Greg Johnson ","Right.","Daniel Fannon ","And then these ongoing redemptions. As you think about where else on the positive or negative side, you kind of see the kind of short to intermediate term kind of shaping up?","Greg Johnson ","Well, I think the win -- and that was in Japan with the pension client that funded in the first week of October at close to $5 billion and probably good news that it was relatively good timing to date on that category. And it\u2019s a very influential account that we think could -- we could see real momentum in that marketplace and even in the last year, some of the successes for the Company, and Japan would certainly be right up there with 3 billion in net inflows for the year and India with over 2 billion in net inflows for the year. So it really is a story around how these \u2013 the hybrid category with the income fund and the global bond category has been overshadowing a lot of activity underneath. And I think that\u2019s the key to flows getting the relative performance turned in those and the big drivers there are going to be energy, oil, and the emerging markets\u2019 currencies, are going to be the real game changers in near-term flows.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Worthington","Hi. Thank you. In terms of the kind of expense outlook for next year on the prepared remarks you talked about kind of 3% to 4% expense reduction. AUM has fallen much, much more from the peak. It\u2019s still kind of a challenging market and there is definitely performance issues. I guess why is 3% to 4% the right amount? What\u2019s kind of the pathway to get there? And I believe also in the prepared remarks you talked about that being offset by investment. I guess talk about the priorities from the investment front? Thanks.","Ken Lewis","Sure. Well, we know that in this industry there is typically a lag in the revenue from the -- when maybe three, six, eight months from after asset general management declined. So the time we were doing our budgets, that was -- that seemed like 3% to 4% seemed like a reasonable target. And that, just to be clear, excludes selling and distribution expenses. So the reduction including selling and distribution expenses would be much higher than that. But a lot of that are things that we don\u2019t control. So I just wanted to exclude sales and distribution from the number when I gave it to you.","Having said that, we are constantly looking at expenses, and we have -- we just have ongoing discussions about actions that we could take, actions that we might take, should revenues decline further. So it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s not 3% and forget it. So we\u2019re constantly looking. And then there are things that we could do in the next fiscal year to reduce expenses further should we need to. But we want to be mindful and very thoughtful about where we cut expenses so that we don\u2019t \u2013 so that we don\u2019t hurt the business and impact our strategies in ways that we don\u2019t want. So that\u2019s the thinking there.","Greg Johnson","And the \u2026","Ken Worthington","And what are -- are there any specifics you can share like how do you get to 3% to 4%, is it are you cutting comp or is there certain projects that can be delayed? Can you flesh out a little more how you get the 3 to 4?","Greg Johnson","I think a lot of is it comp. I think it\u2019s a combination of everything that you said. And then -- and I think the 3% to 4% represented things that we could do and be confident that we could do in the short-term.","We are looking at old initiatives, old business lines, and rationalizing them. Are the things still working? Do we still need the level of investment that we had? Can we repurpose those investments? But those are longer term and it would be premature for me to estimate what they might be in the future. So that\u2019s why I really didn\u2019t talk about them. But those are the things that we are looking at.","And then, Ken, the second part of your question was initiatives. Things like smart beta we might want to invest in. There might be a systems improvement that we might want to do. And the caveat that I gave in my prepared remarks was they are there and we built in cushion to do that. But things get worse, we probably -- we might not do that. We will do smart beta for sure.","Ken Lewis","And I think about the challenge is always the timing. I think the fact that you lost $100 billion in assets in one month, the budgeting process started long before that and it\u2019s hard to adjust real time to managing these groups.","I think the point is that we recognize that there are headwinds out there. The market has been challenging. And we\u2019ve set our first goals out there quickly and we are going to review all aspects of the business to see if we can make more meaningful cuts than that percentage. But even 3% to 4% is meaningful when you take it in the context of you have merit increases, you have occupancy, all these things going up. It\u2019s actually more than 3% or 4% to really get your controllable down by that number.","Ken Worthington","Okay. Thank you. For the follow-up, Greg, you mentioned a number of times some of the more recent investors and the Michael Hasenstab fund complex may be more susceptible to redeeming given the performance issues that the fund is working through, is it possible to kind of frame what the dollars you think are more susceptible? Like again, even if it\u2019s really vague, like that would be helpful. Is it $25 billion from here? Is it $50 billion, is it $100 billion? Like how much is, in your opinion, in that susceptible or at-risk bucket?","Greg Johnson","Yes. I mean, I have no idea. I mean, you could take a wild guess there. But again it\u2019s going to be -- it\u2019s all relative to what\u2019s happening in the marketplace and the fact is that that category, even on the three-year returns and five-year is much lower than where it was. So that makes just -- the point is you need absolute and relative performance to get momentum. And right now, it\u2019s competing with equity markets that have been much stronger over those longer periods and that\u2019s put pressure on them, and then also competing with the fear of rates going up. So my opinion, the markets change quickly; you can get a tailwind pretty quickly by what\u2019s happening in other sectors in the market and even a rise in interest rates. These funds will stand out clearly against a huge pool of capital that we could capture back in quickly. So, it\u2019s hard to guesstimate based on the current numbers. You had a very disruptive quarter there where the risk on trade -- risk off trade and movement back into treasuries and the euro versus emerging market currencies was exactly counter to how that fund was positioned for that period. You are going to have periods like that. And I wouldn\u2019t extrapolate that for the year going out, as far as what it to expect on redemptions. But I think it\u2019s something we try to factor in.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Plead proceed with your question.","Bill Katz","Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the questions. So Greg, using some of your slides from your presentation at page 11, you talk about the dynamic of growth versus value and being able to overcome that after a good crises. Strategically, how are you thinking about capital deployment? I appreciate the repurchase and when you were trading on enterprise value with the VA in particular, but just big picture? It sounds like there are pros and cons around the tactical flow dynamic. You\u2019re doing a nice job on expenses. But is there strategic urgency to broaden out the platform so we don\u2019t have to worry about whether the Dow is going up or not and put that in contrast? When it comes to BlackRock, trades at a substantial premium, I think the market says they can earn through and grow through almost any cycle, right? And for you it seems like you need a good value market to really drive flows looking at your own chart. So how do you think about maybe diversifying the franchise through acquisition to balance out some of that perception?","Greg Johnson","I mean I think, Bill, you\u2019re right. Anything that we can do that creates a stronger platform for our distribution group, an all weather type platform for what\u2019s happening in the markets would be attractive. We are certainly open it to that. I think you\u2019re right. Any time you are facing headwinds in a lot of areas, that probability becomes greater. I would put that all in the category of us continuing like we always do, looking at every available company and meeting with as many as possible and trying to strengthen the line-up when it makes sense. So, yes, I would agree with that.","Bill Katz","Okay. And then, Ken, you gave some nice color here on the expenses. Could you range it a little bit? If we were to be in a more bullish backdrop relative to expectations do the expenses come back quickly, or is there sort of appreciate the lag and the averaging AUM? How much flex do you have here to protect the margins if actually markets start to go up the other way? Is there sort of release some of the savings here and overspend if you will? I am trying to get a sense of the sensitivity.","Ken Lewis","Yes. I think over the past maybe six or seven years we have gotten a way of increasing expenses wildly when the markets go up and then decreasing them. We have gotten a little more stable. Having said that, there is flex, and we do flex. I guess one way to think of it is in terms of new initiatives, there are things that we feel, okay, we must have that so we\u2019ll invest in that in any market. And then there are things that are nice to have, and those things, when times are a little tougher, we put them to the side and then when times get better we invest in them.","But I think we\u2019ve been pretty good with keeping it somewhat range bound, the expense growth rate from year to year regardless of the market conditions. And then cutting them when we need to, obviously.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Brennan Hawken","My first question is on quarter to date. You provided some color in beta helping out, which was helpful and gave us some color on some of the mandates you have won. Is there any way you can give us a look quarter to date at where you are as an organization as a whole as far as flows go?","Greg Johnson","No. I mean, we really stay away from that. I think we have tried to just highlight any -- if we know something that\u2019s large and unusual, sometimes we will bring that up just so when the monthly numbers come out you have a better guesstimate on what\u2019s happening. But we really stay out of trying to forecast anything.","Brennan Hawken","I recognize that. I was hoping given some of the remarkable unusual levels of volatility in the results maybe we could make an exception. Worth a shot.","Next question is on performance stats that you give. And with the equity in hybrid numbers, if we stripped out the Franklin income fund from those figures where would the one-year, three-year, and five-year percentages stand on that slide 6 for you?","Greg Johnson","Yes. It would look, obviously, very different. It would be -- if you take it out, it would -- it would look about 50\/50 between those in the first, second, and third and fourth, but much stronger on the three-year, five-year, and ten-year.","Actually, when you look at the large Franklin -- the Franklin growth fund, the Franklin U.S. opportunities, our core focus are all doing extremely well for all time periods and actually had positive flows. Those again get a little lost in the shuffle, but very good performance with the Franklin equity funds. I would call that as one of the few highlights for this quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Harris","Thanks. I appreciate the outlook on slide 11 giving us a little bit of history as to what may happen going forward. And I guess that leads into my question. In your experience in the business, inflows and performance are trending this negatively, how long does it usually take for things to kind of normalize or come back?","If we look at slide 11, the history would seem to suggest a couple of years. And I know it\u2019s driven by a variety of factors. Obviously performance and so on. But is that generally, you think, a reasonable base case? Are there other factors that could swing it wildly one way or the other?","Greg Johnson","I think I mentioned the two that would swing it much faster. And I don\u2019t think there is a norm for when things turn. It\u2019s all what\u2019s happening in the marketplace and how are you positioned against where people think the market is going.","And I think the two big drivers that roll up for us, if you look across our groups, would be energy. You know, where a lot of the value players did -- they didn\u2019t have heavy weightings going in, but they may be putting heavier weightings ins at the price is falling. And Templeton is one of those that has bought more energy. The high yield market with 20% of the index and the income fund having a heavier exposure.","Anything that happens in the near term to oil is going to have a dramatic affect on that short-term performance, which then could, in turn, switch flows around fairly quickly. And it just -- it depends on what\u2019s happening in the rest of the markets, too. How quickly you\u2019ll accelerate that versus what the domestic market is doing, what the global markets are doing.","Those are all factors. And it\u2019s just been -- for anybody in the global space, anybody in the value space, it\u2019s been a very tough run here for the last eight or nine years.","Chris Harris","And then my follow-up question on smart beta. Sounds like you are, obviously, very interested in doing something there. Curious to get your thoughts whether this could be something that you would be building organically?","Would you potentially acquire something? And then how would you distinguish a Franklin offering in what is a pretty crowded space already?","Greg Johnson","We recognize all of that. I think I can\u2019t give many details on the -- what we intend to do there because we filed an exemptive order and haven\u2019t filed a registration statement. As we said before, we are looking at our own rules-based type ETFs but we can\u2019t go anything else.","For us, it is a crowded marketplace, but having some low-cost beta with a little bit of -- hopefully a little alpha on top of that fits nicely into our own -- I talked about earlier the suite of solutions and having -- whether it\u2019s through our high net worth channel or through our own target date funds and things having our suite, it has a place just there today in existing products, and then how we expand into areas that we haven\u2019t had exposure to complement our traditional area where we see people, that would be attractive too. ","And then again, as we\u2019ve said earlier, we look at everybody out there and if something gets us there faster or is complementary, we are open to doing an acquisition as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kenneth Hill with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Kenneth Hill","You\u2019ve seen some nice traction on the K2 products. I was wondering how you think about the investment there. Do you think that\u2019s mostly done on the platform and what the pipeline might look like going forward? And I also -- would you consider any other sort of small acquisitions potentially like an alternative manager to help that out?","Greg Johnson","Yes so I mean I think the -- most of it is platform driven. It took a while. It took a few years to get a long enough record to get as we said, I think we mentioned that on prior calls that we\u2019re getting into the major broker dealers and on their platforms and getting approved. And that took three years and that\u2019s really why this year we\u2019ve really seen acceleration there along with the strong performance even in the protection of the downturn. It\u2019s done exactly what it should be doing. So it\u2019s been very attractive there. ","I think the other side is we have had much better kind of line of sight on what\u2019s happening in that space with K2 having relationships with so many different types of managers, and that may be something that we expand or take different stakes and different types of managers over time. And we\u2019ve had many introductions and discussions along there as well. So I think there is always a challenge to translate things to a pure liquid alts fund and that doesn\u2019t suit every type of alternative manager. And even these funds, it\u2019s a little bit different to meet that daily liquidity requirement. ","So I think there are some constraints versus everything that\u2019s out there.","Kenneth Hill","Okay. And then as a follow-up. The 60 million of unrealized losses you guys called out on investment on the prerecorded call; can you remind us again what types of investments you may hold there and then how we should think about that line here this quarter given some of the rebound on the market?","Ken Lewis","Yes. I think the oversimplified easiest explanation is that the majority of the lines that -- the majority of the investments that are causing the volatility track pretty closely to the MSCI world index. If you kind of use that as a basis going forward, you would get closer than if you didn\u2019t do that I suppose would be a way to say that.","Greg Johnson","It\u2019s where most of the volatility will be just in the seed capital in funds that have global equity exposure and emerging markets exposure. And then we have some investments in hedge funds that specialize in that as well.","Kenneth Hill","Okay. Fair to assume some rebound based on what we have seen quarter-to-date thus far?","Greg Johnson","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. ","Brian Bedell","Thanks. Good morning folks. Greg, maybe if you could just -- I know it\u2019s tough to look at October in the near term here. But I guess over the next say one to two quarters as you think about the macro backdrop versus some of the performance track records and how to contrast that in terms of conversations that your sales force is having with financial advisors and also some of the conversations you are having with your institutional clients about -- and what\u2019s more important for flows near term? Is it -- do you feel it\u2019s closer tied to macro backdrop, whether we have rebound, of course, in emerging market and energy or do you think it\u2019s a little bit more about the relative performance in the funds versus peers?","Greg Johnson","Well, I mean, again I don\u2019t know how I would answer that in any -- I think that it\u2019s a function of absolute both that the sales force has to paint a macro picture on why it makes sense. And that also helps retention. They need to do that.","So I am not -- I think the story to me that\u2019s compelling on what turns it around is you have had such a run of the developed markets versus the emerging markets and the valuations are still -- are much more attractive, I think, in a lot of these other markets. And I think the currency kicker there -- to me, when I again take a step back and look at headwinds and look at what will turn things and the consensus that China will have a hard landing and that, that will affect the region at a time when you have already had currencies selling off at a level like the Asian financial crisis to me, that\u2019s the story for a global equities that the currencies are already at such a level that you should get appreciation there. The low level of currency should help those countries as far as their economies and while certain ones do have more of a direct hit from whatever happens in China, all of them don\u2019t and all of them have been affected. ","And to me, that\u2019s the story that our sales force, I think, is out there talking about, that you can buy stocks at a cheaper value with better growth rates than what\u2019s available and developed, and also have I think the good potential for a currency. This has been pretty much an unprecedented run of the two against each other.","Brian Bedell","Okay. That\u2019s good color. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on Greg, you talked a little bit about potential acquisitions down the road or just to fill out the product line. I guess does that require repatriation legislation, or do you think that\u2019s something you can still do without that?","Greg Johnson","No. I think it\u2019s clearly something we can do without it. I think assuming you have no repatriation, or do you, it becomes more attractive to do something outside of the United States than inside for obvious reasons. We have a very strong balance sheet in the U.S. and have the capability, obviously, to do debt if we needed to do that. So it wouldn\u2019t keep us from doing anything anywhere I think at this stage. ","Brian Bedell","Okay Great. And then just a clarification on the 3% to 4% decline on expenses, Ken, is that net of investments or would investments dilute that? In other words, you get less --","Ken Lewis","Yes, net -- the investments would reduce that number. So the reduction would be less than 3% to 4%.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Warren with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Gregory Warren","Yes, good morning, guys. Actually, I was a little pleased to see sort of the sales numbers on the equity side. They weren\u2019t as bad as what I had been projecting. So that looked pretty good from that perspective. I just want to touch base on something we\u2019ve talked about in the past and it\u2019s a positioning of your global international equity funds and the trouble you have had generating consistently positive flows for that business, but when you look at the performance relative to the index, the MSCI index, it\u2019s the not bad. I mean, over all time frames you are actually doing better than the index. It\u2019s just that when you are running up against the world stock category, Morningstar\u2019s category, you are actually trailing a bit. I am wondering, if you have taken a look at what\u2019s really differentiating you guys? Why is it that there is a spread between where you\u2019re performing and where the rest of the group is performing and whether or not that\u2019s something that can be addressed?","Greg Johnson","Yes. I think that that is partly due to the history of not hedging with Templeton. And that\u2019s going to have some impact on how we do. And if you look at the risk you manage in a fund, some would say currency is close to half of that risk and we have chosen not to manage that risk. So that would be something I think we have spent a lot of time evaluating and plan to do some of that on some of our smaller funds to at least be able to compete, I think, more effectively and not have the dollar dictate what you\u2019re going to do relative to your peer group in the short run.","Gregory Warren","Okay. And that\u2019s something you are working more closely with Michael Hasenstab platform on, correct?","Greg Johnson","Correct.","Gregory Warren","And then just a separate side note here. I mean, I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s brought it up this period. We are getting closer and closer to that DOL ruling from the SEC. Do you do a lot of business in the advisory channel? I mean, I know from a commission based perspective a lot more money -- new money is flowing into no load funds, lower sort of fee structures, no commission based funds. But I am just curious on 12b-1 fees. What is your sense? What are you hearing as far as whether or not this is going to put a dagger in 12b-1 fees going forward?","Greg Johnson","I think -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to put a dagger 12b-1. I think the question of how within the DOL proposal, how will any fees in the future for servicing and also the question of which products are approved. I think the point, we have less exposure than most in that sector. There has been heavy push back, I think, from some of the portions of the proposal and I think most of our comment letters around trying to create a class of approved shares, which would indicate, obviously, more indexing versus active. And hopefully that has been taken off the table. But like everyone in the industry, we\u2019re still very concerned with what the net effect of this will be. And if you take out any ability to pay for advice in the equation, the net effect is you are going to have less people getting help and that\u2019s certainly been the case in the U.K. and I think that\u2019s the case we raise with regulators here. But they are pretty determined and they have gotten a lot of good feedback from the industry and a lot of good feedback, hopefully, from the Hill. We will see where it ends up.","Ken Lewis","But I haven\u2019t heard outside of that, on 12b-1 that would indicate that there is any future question of 12b-1 surviving or not.","Gregory Warren","Yes. It just feels like there is a lot more unanswered questions right now than there are positive things we can latch onto. Thanks for your color. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee","Thanks and good morning, I appreciate the patience. I apologize. You may have talked about this earlier in the call that I got on a little bit late. But, I\u2019m curious. You mentioned in the prerecorded comments and I think earlier in some of the Q&A, you talked about this new product rolling out globally with Citi.","Can you maybe -- because you called it out, it seems you probably have pretty big expectations for it. Can you maybe explain a little bit -- in a little bit more detail what that is and why it\u2019s somewhat unique for you in strategy or structure?","Greg Johnson","Well, I think it is unique. I think it speaks to the strength of our global footprint and working with some of the large financial institutions. This really is a new category. It\u2019s not an existing relationship with an advisor.","It\u2019s really how does the bank address the smaller balances that are out there, but still significant, that wouldn\u2019t make sense for maybe a one-on-one advisor to service, but a way they can effectively offer products to help those people. To me -- and I wouldn\u2019t say the expectation is going to hugely move the needle for us in the next three years with what\u2019s raised here, but I think it\u2019s a point of the changing distribution landscape and how that the digital world is not just the traditional direct channel doing it or robo advisors or whatever you want to call it.","It\u2019s also firms like Franklin Templeton that can go out and use the depth of our resources in building solutions and then going out and leveraging the relationships throughout the world. We\u2019re going to do this in Asia and Europe and the U.S. and in a cost efficient way, in a low-cost way, hit a new market. And I think this is, to me, an exciting first step in opening up the distribution landscape to do more of these types of things with -- whether it\u2019s with brokered dealers, partnerships, or who knows in the future where you do things direct to small accounts.","It\u2019s just a first step. And I think an exciting one where we developed a new type of product that really has alternatives in it and has all the different categories within it, including we have lower passive cost funds in it, as well. It\u2019s not all Franklin Templeton in it. That, I think, gives it more credibility and hopefully can lead to a new market and significant sales over the long term.","Robert Lee","Great. That was helpful. And maybe thinking more broadly about the distribution force, how should we -- or how are you thinking about -- I mean, you have a lot of strategies around the world. Some selling well. Some not so well.","I mean, how are you trying to focus the sales force versus, there is defending franchises, such as equity income and global bond and maybe some of the others. And there is the new initiatives, whether it\u2019s K2 and the Citi initiative. But there is only a limited -- the pipe is only so big to put all this stuff through.","So how are you trying to orient your sales force to -- what are they most focused on right now? Is it defending the franchise or this new stuff? How do you play one off against the other?","Greg Johnson","I think you have to be consistent. We try to not -- I think it\u2019s a huge mistake to just go to where least resistance is in a sale. And we try to go out there and be consistent about our story and talk about where the obviously, if the client has X amount of assets in a given category, we better spend our time talking about that.","If we didn\u2019t do that, and I think our sales force has been around long enough to know that you are going to lose that relationship and credibility pretty quick if you are not talking about the areas where you are having underperformance. So, yes, I mean, a big part of it is focusing on retention and really also painting a picture of why these things should turn around. And I think that\u2019s what you have to spend your time on.","But also always have something that is in the channel that\u2019s exciting that they can talk about. That\u2019s also adding value and always having something new, whether it\u2019s K2, whether it\u2019s a Flexible Alpha Bond Fund, or a Franklin Growth Fund.","Those are things you want to talk about. So I think it\u2019s always a balance of the two, and we\u2019re very careful about -- and watch very closely on all presentations that are made in the field to make sure that they are focusing on where the assets are first.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Berg","Thanks very much. As you think about -- well, first, let me say I appreciate the heads up at the beginning of your comments encouraging us to take a look at the videos on your Investor Relations site. I will do that because it will help me understand further the answer I am looking for.","Here is my question. As you think about the nuances of the investment style and approach of the folks running the Franklin income fund and Michael Hasenstab\u2019s group, other than currency, which you just mentioned a moment ago, are there other dimensions to their investment, let\u2019s call it personality, that has caused their underperformance? Because after all everyone -- they have got a lot, large group of peers. Everyone is looking at the same oil price, the same collapse in commodity prices, broadly the same depreciation in emerging market currencies. So what is it about his style or her style that is causing them to be where they are right now?","Greg Johnson","Yes, I mean I think, first of all, you take each category and go back a year or six months ago, you\u2019d have top decile for every period. If you have top decile for every period, you are taking more risk generally than many that would manage closer to the index. And we\u2019ve always said this is a very unconstrained approach. And any time an act -- a real active manager will underperform and grossly underperform in certain markets. You don\u2019t -- you\u2019re never top one, three, and five every period if you are a true active manager and really don\u2019t worry about being that different from the benchmark.","Take the Franklin Income Fund for example. It\u2019s the highest yielding fund in its category. We know it underperformed generally when rates go up because we will always have more duration in that fund and everything held equal in the short run, that will happen. He can do some tweaking around that but people buy it for the stability of that higher income and it truly is a hybrid, not a pure equity fund. So the peer group even gets a little bit confusing.","I don\u2019t think the energy -- and it\u2019s not the first person to buy a fixed income in that category and one that we feel like there hasn\u2019t been a lot of differentiation within the group and that there are still are many companies at the prices today are going to do fine. You\u2019re paying debt first that\u2019s the main thing and many of these can service a debt. Now, there has been some that have obviously not done as well through this period. But it\u2019s an active bet and active bets in the short run can make you look kind of silly. And that\u2019s the nature of being a true active manager.","So I don\u2019t think anything has changed. I think you just have two that have headwinds at the same time. And again, the long-term performance still looks good. Clearly in the global bond case, I mean this can turn around in a couple of weeks as far as the short-term numbers.","Eric Berg","Thank you. And my second and final question relates to variable annuities. It\u2019s sort of a similar question to my first one. Is there any reason why Franklin Templeton should be affected more than others by this pull back from variable annuities by some life insurance companies?","Greg Johnson","I don\u2019t think we are being, I think there\u2019s other ones that are private companies and others that have significant assets and that probably the two, three biggest firms in this category, two out of the three are private. So you are not -- you don\u2019t hear about them. But everybody is equally being affected by them getting out of that business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Blostein","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Last one I guess on capital measurement again. Can you talk a little bit more on I guess your ability to continue paying out over 100% of free cash flows generated in the U.S., and I guess more importantly the willingness to lever up to buy back more stock to maintain the total payout at current levels? Thanks.","Greg Johnson","Yes. Sure. I think that -- yes, that\u2019s a great observation obviously that can\u2019t go on forever. But we do have flexibility. So we have short-term flexibility where we have inter-company borrowings that we can do. We have the ability for debt. And if we feel the need to do it, as we\u2019ve shown in the past, we will increase the leverage of the Company.","But I think what drives it is us being opportunistic when we feel like there\u2019s opportunities to buy the stock at a good price. And then from there, all the other decisions flow. So I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s restricted really.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Cyprys","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on some of your earlier commentary on M&A. Just curious in terms of how you are thinking about prioritizing what products could make the most sense to add in terms of rounding out the products there? And then just more broadly, what are some of the criteria you have when it comes to M&A?","Greg Johnson","Well, I would say that -- I mean, we\u2019ve talked about some of the areas would be in the alternative space of something made sense there in the high net worth space if something made sense there. We talked about that in the past. I think whether there was a large scale manager outside of the U.S. that was complementary and could get some synergies out of that would be interesting for us as well. And I think something on the institutional lower cost side that we could leverage through the retirement channel here would be interesting as well. So those would be a few. But I think we, as always, we try to look at pretty much everything, try to get a better sense of value and what\u2019s out there. So I wouldn\u2019t preclude anything. But as far as a wish list, those would be the ones that we would -- you could have an international manager without a U.S. distribution, which could be complementary. Those are the kind of things we would look for.","I think -- and obviously, like anybody looking at this space, you want something that has a strong repeatable process with consistent results over time and the right kind of culture that can fit in and the right kind of incentives by doing it. And that\u2019s where I think, as we\u2019ve said in the past, just going out and buying hedge funds or alternative managers can be somewhat challenging as it\u2019s hard to align the right incentives after somebody who is solely responsible for the results is selling most of their upside in that deal. So that\u2019s why we haven\u2019t really done many of these types of acquisitions.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question for today comes from the line of Bruce Bohannon with IBM. Please proceed with your question.","Bruce Bohannon","Thank you, gentlemen. I pushed the button too early. But thanks for letting me in. You announced earlier that there were some management transitions that recently occurred. I just wanted level set and understand Mr. Johnson, Greg, are you short-term, intermediate term, are you still on fire for this Company? I think it\u2019s an incredible Company. I saw a rumor that you may have been retired on October 1st, which is obviously not true because you\u2019re here. Please and thank you.","Greg Johnson","I hope not. You know, I am absolutely long term and I think that this -- the fire burns probably too much every day for me. But this was in no way I think this was recognition of two people that have been here for a long time and we think make -- we really think makes us a stronger organization. Just the demands on travel time and this helps me, I think, organize in a way where we can better use our strengths in the Company and Vijay and Jenny bring a fresh energy and perspective. I think also the realignment of our executive committee, now having three of our senior investment people, is something that I think is very important for the Firm going forward and really bridges the gap between the management guys and the investment guys and puts us all together as one team. So in no way should it indicate and I hope that\u2019s good news, me having any change. But we are excited about these changes, and I really do think it\u2019s going to put us in a much stronger position to address the areas that need to be addressed.","Operator","Thank you. Gentlemen, we do have one final question coming from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Siegenthaler, your line is live. I am sorry, that seems to be our final question. I will turn the call back to Mr. Johnson for any final remarks.","Greg Johnson","Thank you again for everyone participating on our call and we hope we have some better news next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect line at this time thank you for your participation."]}}
