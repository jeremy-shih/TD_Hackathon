My name is Lauren and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Ward, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Tom Ward","Thank you, Lauren. Good morning everyone. Presenting on today's call is David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also on the call are Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; Andy Juster, Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Broadwater, our Chief Accounting Officer.","Before we begin, a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors. We refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com. For our prepared remarks, I am pleased to introduce David Simon.","David Simon","Good morning. We had strong results to wrap up a great year. We opened, started, and completed several new development and redevelopment projects. We successfully executed several capital market transactions, extending our average term and reducing our weighted interest cost. We continued to achieve strong operating and financial results.","Our full-year 2015 FFO per share was $9.86 which peaked our initial guidance range of $9.60 to $9.70 a share, even with a net $0.11 loss reported during the year which was derived from $0.33 loss on extinguishment of debt, partially offset by $0.22 gain on the sale of marketable securities that occurred in the year, as well as $0.12 negative impact from foreign currency devaluations. On a comparable basis, excluding the impact from WPG spin-off in the prior year, and the net loss mentioned above, full-year FFO increased 11.4% to $9.97 per diluted share. We posted record FFO results once again and have achieved a compound annual FFO growth rate of more than 14% over the last five years. For the fourth quarter, FFO of $2.40 per share included a $0.33 loss on extinguishment of debt and exceeded the consensus estimate by $0.02. On a comparable basis, excluding the loss on the extinguishment of debt in the quarter, FFO per diluted share increased 10.5% year-over-year.","Now, let me turn to operating metrics and cash flow. Our Malls and Premium Outlets occupancy ended the year at 96.1%. This was 100 basis points lower than year-end 2014, due to the timing of lease up of more 2 million square feet of new space we brought online this year from expansions and new developments, as well as replacing the 1.3 million square feet of space lost due to tenant bankruptcies during the year. Importantly, we are more than 90% leased on the new space we brought online this year. The timing of the lease up on the remaining space to be leased impacted our year-end occupancy by approximately 50 basis points.","By the end of the year we replaced more than 70% of the space loss to tenant bankruptcies and the remaining space to be leased impacted occupancy by 50 basis points as well. Put the two together, and that's a 100 basis point differential. Leasing activity remained healthy as evidenced by the Mall and Premium Outlets reported leasing spread of $10.62 per foot, an increase of 18%, and the base minimum rent was $48.96 which was up more than 4% compared to last year reflecting strong retailer demand for our locations.","As I mentioned retailer demand per space remained strong. Retailers who want to grow their business were adding brand extensions, and creating new brands, and pure-play retailers want physical locations to increase their revenues. Retailers who opened bricks-and-mortar stores experienced increased consumer awareness and subsequently greater organic site traffic and lower customer acquisition cost. We have repeatedly heard from retailers that online sales is directly influenced by the presence of a physical store in that market. When the retailer opens a physical store in a market they see their online sales increase, and likewise, if they close the store they see their online sales in that market decline.","Successful omnichannel retailers are increasing their buy online and pickup in store. This functionality not only increases convenience for shoppers, but also facilitates incremental purchases and upsell opportunities when the shopper enters our retail environment.","For 2015, sales per square foot for our Mall and Premium Outlets were $620 a foot compared to $619 a foot. Comparable sales per square foot for the Malls increased 5.7%. We were up a greater amount at the Mills and we were down slightly at our tourist oriented premium outlets, and up slightly at our non-tourist outlet centers. We have great centers in key tourist locations that generate incredible sales volume and is the envy of the industry. The strong dollar, however, impacted tenant sales as these unique centers which negatively affected our overage rent for the quarter.","I know you've all heard about mall traffic decreases. But let me give you some facts based on our internal data across the largest retail portfolio in the U.S. and not just estimates derived from arbitrary algorithms. Traffic at our Malls was flat for the year including the Holiday season, traffic at our Premium Outlets increased 1.5% for the year and more than 2% for the holidays, and traffic at the Mills increased slightly for the year as well.","Comp NOI increased 3.7% for the full-year 2015 and increased 3.4% for the fourth quarter of 2015. For the fourth quarter, overage rent declined $13 million year-over-year due to the lower sales volumes that I mentioned already at our tourist oriented centers. The lower overage rent impacted our comp NOI for the quarter of approximately 100 basis points.","I will strongly remind you we do not include lease settlement income, new acquisitions, or the impact of recently redeveloped or expanded centers in our comp NOIs -- in our comp NOI number. Total NOI from our consolidated and unconsolidated properties increased more than 7% to $5.8 billion in 2015. That was on top of 6.7% growth in 2014 and this includes any NOI contribution from Kle'pierre.","Now let me quickly talk as we could spend hours on our redevelopment and expansion. At the end of the fourth quarter, but I'll give you some highlights, at the end of the fourth quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing at 29 properties across all three of our platforms, with a total committed spend of $1.5 billion.","During the quarter, we opened two significant expansions and completed number of other strategic redevelopments, including the new Fashion Wing at Del Amo which includes the new Nordstrom and more than 100 exceptional brands, expansion of The Colonnade Sawgrass where we added 20 small shops, very high-end small shops and two restaurants, and the redevelopment at Phipps, Woodfield Mall, and Menlo Park. We also started construction on several new projects during the quarter, including The Shops at Riverside and Copley Place. Construction continues on other major redevelopment and expansion projects at some of our most productive properties including Roosevelt Field, Stanford, King of Prussia, Woodbury Commons, The Galleria in Houston. Most of these projects will be completed in '16 and Houston Galleria will go into '17 as well.","Now not to be ignored we continue to be active on new development. We opened two new outlets during the quarter in Tucson and Tampa both off to very strong sales start. Construction continues on two new domestic outlets in Columbus and Clarksburg both scheduled to open later this year, as well as a designer outlet in Provence, France, which is scheduled to open in the spring of 2017. We also started construction in upscale outlet center in Seoul, Southwest Seoul, Korea, scheduled to open in the spring of 2017, this will be fourth there. And we also recently announced a new partnership with Ivanhoe Cambridge developed a premium outlet collection at Edmonton International Airport which will be our fourth outlet in Canada. This is expected to open in the fall of 2017. Two new full price developments are ongoing as you know one in Miami, a Brickell Centre opening this fall, and Fort Worth at The Shops at Clearfork scheduled to open in early 2017.","Leasing demand at both are great. Brickell will be anchored by Saks; Clearfork will be open air and anchored by Neiman Marcus.","Portfolio changes. We sold The Shops at Sunset Place and we recently completed the sale of Columbia George outlet. And we also recently acquired with our partner McArthurGlen the majority interest in a leading outlet center in Ochtrup, Germany, Northwest Germany. This successful center is well-positioned within the market and has significant value added expansion opportunities.","Let me run through the balance sheet, two senior offerings and totaling $1.9 billion was done last year with an average weighted coupon of 2.34%, term of 7.5. We redeemed four series of senior notes totaling 1.7 with an weighted average coupon of 6. We closed 23 new mortgages with an average interest rate of 3.2% and 8.5 years. Our liquidity was $5.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, our fixed charge coverage is up to 4.5%, or I'm sorry 4.5 times, and recently we completed a very successful senior notes offering earlier this month raising $1.35 billion at an average interest rate and term of 2.9% at 8.2 years in a very volatile capital market scenario.","Dividends. We paid a record dividend in 2015 of $6.05 per share. This has achieved a compound annual growth rate of more than 18% over the last five years. We announced our dividend today to be paid this quarter of $1.60 which is an increase of 14% year-over-year. Okay, that's pretty busy.","Now, let me talk about our guidance, for '16, it's $10.70 to $10.80. This range represents 9% to 10% growth compared to the FFO per share of $9.86 for 2015 and again will be industry leading. Our range is based on the following assumptions: comp NOI for our portfolio malls, outlets, and mills, of at least 3.5%; and total NOI growth of more than 6% for the portfolio; no additional planned acquisition or retail disposition activity than what we recently completed; continued unfavorable impacts related to foreign currency devaluations which should affect us by approximately $0.05 compared to 2015; and importantly, we are not assuming any additional share count decrease, so an average diluted share count of $362 million.","We are now looking forward to your questions. Operator, are you with us?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","David Simon","Hello, operator?","Operator","Yes. Can you hear me?","David Simon","We don't have any question ma'am. Let's go to the next.","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum, UBS. Please proceed.","Ross Nussbaum","David, you touched on the link between retailers having stores at your Malls and Internet sales in that local market. One of the questions I get recently from investors is the concept of occupancy cost being measured as a percentage of sales just at that Mall store. When you're talking to retailers now about the rent they should be paying, how is the conversation going such that you can capture some of those Internet sales in the rents that you're charging them at the physical Mall? Because to me that seems like an important shift in the business going on.","David Simon","Well I don't -- again I -- let's separate media narrative to reality. But we're including anything, any sale that comes from their store and it could be driven by the Internet is in our sales that come from that store. So we're getting the benefit of that. And so I still think occupancy cost is still going to be very important to the overall negotiation of what the rent they're able to proceed.","However, it is important to note that stores for these retailers are part of their distribution network. And when they look at whether or not they're going to keep a store open, they're also going to affect evaluate what their decrease in overall Internet sales might be in that market and that is a benefit to us -- not that we have a lot of stores that are risk for closures other than through bankruptcy.","So at a 12.3% given our productivity and given where our rents are and what you've seen from the history, I mean we've got, we still have a very good run rate to continue increase our rents.","Ross Nussbaum","Okay. And then a second question. Can you touch on your interest in Macy's real estate now that they are clear that they want to do something there? In particular, I guess in theory, it would be with your Hudson's Bay joint venture. But may be just touch on your interest level there. Thanks.","David Simon","Well look they've been a very important partner of ours and obviously they have very good real estate. So I can say nothing really is happening that's material or meaningful other than our normal ongoing business and that's been very productive and we have a excellent relationship with Macy's both from a real estate and a corporate point of view. They've been very supportive in our efforts to enhance the quality of our real estate through our expansion and redevelopment activity and if they've got ideas on how they want to look at the real estate, we're happy to do it either as part of the HPC JV or on our own. But nothing really is happening other than day-to-day business.","Rick Sokolov","And the only thing I would add in the course of that day-to-day business we acquired a Bloomingdale's store at Stanford demolished it creating small shop, they build a new Bloomingdale's store. We combined three Macy's stores into two at Del Amo to facilitate our expansion. So that day-to-day business does involve activities with respective of their existing stores.","Ross Nussbaum","Thanks guys.","David Simon","And, look, I think it's very interesting that the market needs to understand on these retailers Macy's and the Penney and down the list. I mean does that vast, vast, vast majority of their stores have four-wall profits. And Rick and I just did a tour in Texas this week and I'll let you guys figure out who the retailers are, a major note in Texas are, and we hear that repeatedly. So, Macy's, I'm sure that vast, vast, vast, vast majority of those stores that they have four-wall profits. So I don't anticipate there to be significant changes but we will see and I think it will give us the opportunity. I think Rick made a great point in that. We can pickoff a Bloomingdale's at the Stanford in the middle of the Mall and release it to high-end shops and they can build a new store that's a win-win for everybody involved. So I think there will be a few of those as well.","Ross Nussbaum","Thanks.","David Simon","Sure. Operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy, Citi. Please proceed.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, David. It's Michael Bilerman with Christy. Just a question about the balance sheet and as you think about your very conservative balance sheet with exceptional cost of capital and access to capital. And I'm curious as you think about maintaining that really strong balance sheet, how much of it is thinking about opportunities down the road -- and I don't know how quickly those opportunities will come into view -- and how much of it is that your concern perhaps about the macro environment? And I recognize that use of capital you can buy back stock, which you haven't really done in the back half of the year, and you have a very large development and redevelopment pipeline which is funded by free cash flow. But your overall leverage metrics and access to capital are -- never been better in the Company's history. And I'm just trying to think about what's driving that in your mind as you run the Company?","David Simon","Well I think it's a great point and it's ignored a lot in terms of how people look at our company. But I love the fact that our interest coverage is 4.5 times given the size of our, I should say fixed charge coverage, not just interest coverage. And I love the fact that we can fund our development and new development from our free cash flow, and yet at the same time have a compound annual growth rate, dividend increase of 18%. I mean you can't put those kind of metrics against anybody and they can't issue in a day paper at under 3% when the CMBS market is cracking and the life company market is cracking and the high yield market is cracking, and yet we're able to go whether it's in the Euro market or the U.S. fixed income market but to place that kind of paper in that kind of speed and it's undervalued by the equity markets.","So me that is sacrosanct. And I have been very reluctant enter the big deal business, I continue to be. And where we are so busy, I mean, I -- as you know, I have a hard time speaking generally and I -- when they get -- when we write our script, I can barely get the words out because I didn't take elocution classes in high school. But the fact of the matter is we are extremely busy building and adding value to the portfolio using our external free cash flow that remains the focus. I think we'll be very conservative on buying our stock back in today's market and my view on the big deal business really hasn't changed.","Christy McElroy","Hi David, it's Christy here. Just following up on some of the stats that you mentioned earlier, with traffic in the malls flat, but sales up 5.7% which is encouraging. I'm wondering if you have a sense for what's driving that differential, are people staying in the Mall longer, visiting fewer stores, are conversions higher, just several retailers out there commenting that Mall traffic is down and the impact that that perception is any share prices, just any information that we can get from your data, would be helpful.","David Simon","Yes, I think it's a very important point to make the following distinction. So remember we get the overall traffic number and yet most of the folks that quote -- most of the folks that quote numbers are based on algorithms, so it's not real necessarily data like we have, and number two, is it is derived from certain stores. So it doesn't, it necessarily equate the mall traffic and it gives you store data but not mall traffic data and that's the distinction that I really important to make. And I will tell you the trend though with mobile technology is that the consumer today clearly is going to the physical environment more educated, they're doing less browsing and they're going to less stores.","So we think that the store data that you get is in fact maybe it's a little bit not that far off but it doesn\u2019t represent mall traffic and I just think the consumers go and do a few less stores because they\u2019re doing less browsing because they\u2019re more informed prior to their visits.","But overall the mall traffic is what we say it is, our comp sales are what they are, and its so operator driven, you could be in a category where one retailer is selling and another one is not and it's not tied with all boats but it's really retail and operator driven. And the good news is overall given the size of our portfolio, we have a pretty good handle on this -- overall we're having pretty good comp sales increases.","Christy McElroy","So the bottom-line is the same number of people are coming to the mall, but sales are up 5.7% there are just spending more while they are there?","David Simon","That's the bottom-line and they may be going to few less stores. I think, yes, you're probably right, I probably could have shortened the explanation but that's the bottom-line.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt, Bank of America. Please proceed.","Craig Schmidt","Thank you. It's Craig Schmidt.","David Simon","I hope that's Craig. I hope that's Craig.","Craig Schmidt","Yes it is Craig.","David Simon","Right.","Craig Schmidt","No transformation. My question is really on the future role of anchors at regional malls. How is your view changing of the anchors? I mean, there seems to be a lot of repurposing going on, such as the JVs and Seritage. And I'm also thinking about what you've done at Florida Mall and what you're going to be doing at Shops at Riverside: it seems like you're taking a somewhat different view of what the anchor's role is.","David Simon","Well, look I think it's such as and I'll let Rick weigh in here. I mean it's such as real estate specific equation but in a lot of cases you know the vendors that go into a department store in certain cases would rather have mall stores. And when we feel as that's the case while we'd rather just have the mall, we just rather have the vendor as a retailer and we don't necessarily want to rely on the department store to bring those vendors.","So again it's specific and it's all about creating the right environment and experience and in some cases having this department store as part of that is vital, I take Del Amo with Nordstrom. They built a fantastic store it is so complementary to what we've done. We couldn't be prouder of that redevelopment and that Nordstrom store and the environment is helping us create.","In other cases, the vendor, we had a Saks store at Riverside. They don't do well in New Jersey all at all. And we feel like those vendors that were in that store actually would have a better experience in our redone environment than they would in the Saks box. So it's and Florida Mall is a great example of just taking underperforming Saks that was not attracting the consumer, we went from, I think at $10 million Saks to $50 million of revenue generated after repurposing that that box, and that's what it's all about. Rick?","Rick Sokolov","Yes, the only thing I would add is that every mall has its own story. So for frankly at Roosevelt Field the addition of Neiman Marcus is going to be a fundamental expansion of the market area that's traditional fashion anchor. At Florida Mall, we added the Crayola Experience that in that market is just doing great business and expands the trade area of that property. What we're all about is trying to put in the appropriate retailers to maximize the importance of our properties in the markets that they serve.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. And how is some of the progress on your JVs with Seritage?","David Simon","Pretty good I just had breakfast with Dan. I think, hopefully we\u2019ll get four or five started this year Rick, right? That's the plan.","Rick Sokolov","Yes, we literally we've got performance, plans done. That frankly the most interesting timeline is working with Sears is to how their store is going to be reconfigured and that just takes some time. But we've identified the replacement tenants, we've identified the performance, and as David said we anticipate having developments underway in at least half the properties we have in our joint venture this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Caitlin Burrows","Hi, good morning. Just on the topic of occupancy cost, it has been steadily increasing over the past few years, as you've done a good job of really being able to push the rents despite slower sales growth. But I was just wondering: Is this something we should be concerned about? To what extent are retailers pushing back, or are the higher occupancy costs just a part of doing business in a strong mall now?","David Simon","Well look I mean at 12.3%, I would not worry at all. And I think we have to put into perspective how much our growth is ahead of GDP growth. I mean we are in a, I mean, if you look at our results this year and what we did above and beyond our expectations to pick up the extraordinary gain and losses that I mentioned. But if you just look at our numbers and the fact that we overcame relatively softer retail environment, a lot of things going into that move towards durable goods and increase in healthcare cost and taxes and general economic malaise, we overcame our foreign currency translation from outside of the U.S. here and then obviously the strong dollar.","If you look at our outlet business I mean traffic was up across the portfolio yet sales were down there because the international tourist spent less, it's not -- it's pretty good execution with some of the headwinds that we've done. The 12.3% the way I look at it is an insurance policy against a slow growth U.S. economy that we continue to well outperform GDP growth, and, if it were up 15%, 16% maybe that's when we would raise the alarm. But at 12.3%, we've got rate insurance to continue grow their cash flow.","And if you look at our comp NOI which is a real number, okay, which is a real number of at least 3.5% and what's the Goldman -- tell me what the Goldman -- today's Goldman get the conservative economist to Goldman. Not the bullish one get the one that you've got in the closet. What's their GDP growth? What are they saying, 2%, 1.5%?","Caitlin Burrows","Okay.","David Simon","Well tell me what do they say, Caitlin. I want to say 1.5%; I mean we're 2.5% --","Caitlin Burrows","Sure.","David Simon","We're 200 basis points above that and part of that is because we do have leases that are under market and we will be able to continue to push that. At the same time our business is all about repeat business. We've got to find a win-win with our retailers. We try to do the best we can meeting the expectations of our growth for us, for investors at the same time we want our retailers as strong as possible it's a very -- it's challenging to find that equilibrium. We do a pretty good job of it and I\u2019m confident we can continue to do it not completely, sometimes we screw up, on -- it's all the various ends there.","But at the end of the day we try to find that equilibrium that will satisfy our retailer partner, satisfy our own internal expectations, satisfy our investors that's why I've been able to -- we've been able to grow our earnings 14% per annum, increase the dividend 18% per annum over a long period of time industry leading. We try to find that equilibrium we have an insurance policy.","Caitlin Burrows","Got it, okay. So it sounds like we shouldn't be concerned yet there. And then just --","David Simon","I will let you know okay.","Caitlin Burrows","Okay. And then just regarding your current share price, the market appears to be supporting other mall REITs that might have some take-out potential while perhaps punishing you as a potential buyer. So the stock's down today. Can you comment on basically turning this argument over and by buying yourself and repurchasing shares -- I know you mentioned before that you'd be very conservative with doing that in the future?","David Simon","Well, look, I think what Bilerman said earlier, asked earlier, I mean we are out of the big deal business. So people can speculate all they want. And I do think the market should understand and as our plan that we will be conservative on buybacks. As some of the higher -- I understand Tom that some of the higher estimates out there on first call were due to the buyback number. So that's part of the issue there.","We're going to be conservative there. I love having a great balance sheet. This is not a short-term game here. This is long-term. But I'm out of the big deal business, somebody wants to call me up and talk to me and show me how to make money, I'm all happy to have that conversation.","But my opinion hasn't changed since really last Spring. So I don't really know what else I can tell you on that front. And we won't be afraid to buy back stock, it's just we're not planning right now. We have the authorization to do it. People are betting against that for whatever reason that's the markets but we have a growing dividend and growing earnings and that's usually a bad thing to bet against.","Caitlin Burrows","I agree. Thank you.","David Simon","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb, Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning, David.","David Simon","How are you doing, Alex?","Alexander Goldfarb","Doing well, doing well. So just quickly, I'll go to the second question first and then I'll go to my first question second, because you mentioned dividends. Last year you guys to raised the dividend quarterly. Obviously it was up almost 20% for the year. This year should the expectation -- you didn't raise it from fourth quarter. So should we think about just more normalized sort of annual increase? Or do you think that we'll see a steady state of increases throughout the year? And part of that is just trying to read into cash flow use. May be with what's going on you guys are trying to husband more cash; or maybe it was just how you raised it a lot last year and now you want to go back to an annual increase.","David Simon","Yes, I think what we were, we've always -- we've been chasing our taxable income, as you know, and there is a lot that goes into that equation. If we kept it at $1.60 that would be 6% growth year-over-year, I would think that that would be at the bare minimum of what happens but I would start to like to get into a normalized once a year raise. So we don't do it sequentially, sequentially like we've been doing at quarter after quarter and I think that should be your expectation going forward.","And we'll probably assess that at near the end of each year now as we had in the past. But that's subject to change obviously with the input of our taxable income calculation as well as obviously our boards input, but at the very, very least 6% growth, over 6% growth. I would like for it to be annualized and -- I'm sorry once a year when we evaluate it, which would probably most likely be in the back half, so we can position it for the proceeding or the subsequent year. But as you know with our NOI growth of least over 6-plus-percent, our taxable income is going to be increasing. And so that will be driving our dividend increase up as well.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second question is, on -- I think it was in your response to Christy's question, if shoppers are getting more selective and visiting fewer stores: one, it sounds like a merchandising issue from retailers; and then, two, does that mean that we should expect higher retailer turnover? Like we should see more stores closing if they can't get their merchandising right? Or your view was the retailers that had trouble attracting shoppers last year are quickly addressing their merchandising issues?","David Simon","Well, look, I think the retailers clearly are in that boat, and they're not as, what there is, we did experience in '15 a number of bankruptcies of kind of the really poor performing retailers. There was clearly a slowdown in retail sales in the back half of the year. And then when you couple that with the tourism issue, you couple that with the normal weather, I mean it was so to speak a perfect storm, and it took a lot of retailers out. I mean we've seen this movie and I don't know if it's Rocky 7 -- I'm ready for Creed. Okay. So we don't have to keep seeing this movie over again.","I think our retailers are pretty sophisticated adapting very aggressive. And I think part of the responsibility of driving traffic for more stores is -- the onus is on us. I mean, we've got a great environment which does and is able to communicate to the consumer what's going on in the mall so that they can visit kind of more stores than they have and that they at least did in '15 and take advantage of them when they're in our store. And I think clearly as our retailers sneak up their information, drive traffic to the stores, fill out of the stores, return out of the stores, I mean all of that is going to be incremental as their systems get more sophisticated that I think hopefully will extend stays and allow people to visit more stores.","So it's all the work-in-progress, we've got to do some of that ourselves. And as you know we're doing a lot of that, we're at the forefront of lot of that activity to try and figure out how the best way to communicate to the consumer, so they go see eight or 10 stores as opposed to four, five, or six.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then just for your -- I know how much you love your Crooked Stick suggestion box, but as you guys do a lot of the development and redevelopment, it would just be helpful from our end to have a table in the supp that just sort of quantifies the amount and quarter that developments and redevelopments will come online, just for a modeling perspective.","David Simon","Yes, we're happy, well, I think I'm happy to do that, it doesn't -- now I will say this. I know there was a comment or two that said about our returns going down absolutely not, our mix changes every quarter which we probably, Tom, could do a better job of pointing that out. And I assure you that if we are doing to deliver; I mean we do have to have a materiality threshold for the size of our company. But I assure you and the market that if we have a major development or a major redevelopment where we're going to lay an egg, we'll let you know.","That's not what happened in today's supplement. We had some things come off and we had some things come on, just like we do every quarter and Tom is happy to walk you through what went in and what went out. But I assure the market if we're going to lay an egg on anything that's new or whether it's new or redevelopment we'll let you know with some materiality threshold obviously. But that's not the case with the changes in our development pipeline and redevelopment pipeline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa, Evercore. Please proceed.","Steve Sakwa","Just I guess two quick questions. You mentioned that, I guess, comp sales were up. I think you 5.7%. When I look in the supplemental and just looked at total sales it's basically flat December to December. And I realize that comp sales are only a piece of the overall sales. But as you replace weaker tenants with new ones I would think there's an uplift. I guess I'm just trying to reconcile the strong comp sales.","David Simon","Remember our comp you got to be in place for 24 months. So that's not the case, that's number one. And number two, I mean we did have our -- that the -- we did have slippage in our tourist oriented centers not just the outlets but in a number of the malls that were I mean that we had to deal with. And again it wasn't a traffic issue and it's not anything other than and I know we've seen it from the retailers, but the tourism that is important to the economic growth of the United States of America may have come if they spent less and we have unbelievable great properties that in the long run are fantastic.","And the sales have come out. I mean we have small shops and medium size shops that do $30 million, $40 million of volumes in some of these places. But the tourism affected that. And as you know we've got a lot going on in some of our major properties moving tenants in and out. So we put it all together and total sales were relatively flat. We don't view that as a big deal.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. Any sense as to what -- of the overall sales, comp sales make up what percentage of that total sales number? Is that two-thirds of the bucket, three-quarters, a half?","David Simon","70%.","Steve Sakwa","70%? Okay. And then I guess as it comes to -- or in terms of bankruptcies this year, I realize you guys got hit pretty hard last year. You're working through. What is your expectation for bankruptcies this year? And how is that impacting that sort of 3.5% NOI number that you're giving us?","David Simon","Well, look at, it is. I mean, we still have lease-up from last year, and we're -- we've budgeted in some of the weaker tenants whether they go bankrupt or we do, we renegotiate short-term deals while we replace them with strong tenants I mean that\u2019s all factored in there. So we have been conservative on overage rent. I mean these -- we're not a perfect science model I mean, nor is the U.S. economy. So we do the best that we can, budgeting the best that we can, being as conservative as we can.","We clearly thought in '15, we would hit 4%; we didn't because of the overage rent thing that we did mention. And that was, as you know, overage rent you hit breakpoints or if you're over the breakpoints there is a lot of volatility the fourth quarter is important in total sales. And I mean that's hard to necessarily model. But we took a very conservative approach in how we look to the books at year-end. And we're taking a reasonably conservative approach; we still have work to do. But conservative sales, conservative lease-up, conservative restructuring at certain tenants whether in or out of bankruptcy is all factored into that number. But importantly Steve and this is the true distinction. I mean our number is -- our 3.5% is different than most people, okay. So you have to put that into perspective.","Steve Sakwa","No, I do. I appreciate that. I'm just trying to get a sense. Do you think the 1.3 million will go up or down in '16? Is that -- do you think you have similar amounts?","David Simon","I think it will go down, I think it will go down, '15 was a big year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan, Canaccord. Please proceed.","Paul Morgan","Just in terms of the impact you mentioned, if I understand correctly, in terms of occupancy from the space that was added but wasn't -- and is leased but wasn't occupied at year-end. Was that, I mean was that sort of part of the budget that may be we just didn't fully understand going into the quarter? Or was there any openings that may be kind of slipped into the first quarter that were expected for the fourth quarter?","David Simon","I think when you open a new project and you get the 90%, what was it 90.7% or whatever it was? I mean when you open a new project and you're at 90.7%, year one that's pretty good it\u2019s not just as 96% or 97% and that creates a little bit drag on the overall occupancy. So that's just real estate development. I mean I don\u2019t know of any project that opens a 100% occupied I mean may be a few do.","And as I think we mentioned in the third quarter, we did put a lot in the system last year. So our resources were maxed out between all the redevelopments and all the new stuff, I again it's not like we're delivering these things at 60% occupied or 50%. I mean 90% after, 90.7% after at the end of year one is pretty good. So I think that's pretty good execution.","Paul Morgan","Yes, okay. And then you've got a lot of your kind of A+ assets that are under construction right now with expansions and redevelopments. I mean is there any dislocation that takes place either in the numbers or just in terms of traffic? I mean if some of the malls are kind of getting torn up in pretty major ways as you're doing the expansions. I mean does that trickle through to sales in your expectation or CAM or anything that's material?","David Simon","Well, I -- look, I mean I -- we don't want excuses, but, yes, I mean we ripped up Roosevelt Field, we ripped up King of Prussia, and we -- those were in -- we didn't take them out of our sales numbers and those things. You move tenants around. We had a number of that -- of those scenarios this year, which is investing in the future and it's not an immediate return.","So I would tell you that all of those we had a setback in Copley, because we're ripping Copley to shreds, moving tenants around, making room for the potential of the apartments\/condo tower. So that's clearly affecting us. But at the end of the day I mean that's just -- we're just not going to -- we're not going to use that as a basis to say, here is a little bit of a slippage, but yes it clearly is affecting -- it clearly affected '15 both from a NOI point of view and a sales point of view. And -- because a lot of these were moving traffic around, were closing entrances, and there is absolutely dislocation going on.","Paul Morgan","Thanks. Then just lastly, I mean any update on your kind of current thoughts about mixed-use? You've got obviously some of it in your redevelopment pipeline. But is it -- as you think about your shadow pipeline, both with your own properties and then specifically with some of the Seritage opportunities, I mean, how big a piece of your portfolio is residential or other mixed-use? Sort of something we could see over the next decade?","David Simon","I still think it's going to grow, but selectively. I mean, I kind of view this as the good news in that it's almost like our international investments. We've had such great results from our international investments. I mean, if you looked at what's on our books and what the value of this real estate is it's a homerun, a homerun. If you look at the yield on cash flow returns, a homerun. That gives us -- the only wrinkle on that is we lost $10 million in China.","But if you look at Kle'pierre, McArthurGlen our own development in Japan, Korea, Canada, homerun. We've also had great experience. And I can't think of a problem we've had, Rick, in your mixed used development. So I -- as we gain more confidence in that business I think we'll continue to do it. But as you know that's so driven by supply and demand and it's so specific to the real estate. But we like it, we have had good success in it, we'll continue with it assuming we can continue to produce the results that we produced in that area.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Adornato, BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Paul Adornato","Hi, good morning. Was wondering if you could compare the performance of your top-tier properties, minus the noise of any redevelopments, versus the bottom tier. The market seems to dislike Class B properties. I was wondering if your lower tier is subject to some of those same risks.","David Simon","Well, look, I think our portfolio is the -- our results and our averages kind of the indicate -- indicative of kind of what results were. So I don't think there is any unusual trend. I think market sometimes may be overreacts to the only game in town mall. We think that business is good and very viable. If that's the only game in town market, have too much retail, it's going to be heard, but that could be in an A market too. I don't think we had any real unpleasant surprises and the not exciting markets that we still own.","The only thing that was a little out of the ordinary from our results this year was the tour of spend that we've mentioned. And obviously that happened at some of our most unique landmark properties. I mean, we can't hide from that fact, not a long-term issue I hope. And -- but the tourist reined in a little bit, they rein in New York City, Madison Avenue, Fifth Avenue, down in Miami, North and South of the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso. We have Mexican Nationals to shop at our -- some of our premier properties. We've got the Canadian snowbirds I mean, that's -- that happens. That's the only trend that I would say is a little bit different than what we've experienced, not the only game in town which is -- we are in some of those markets but they continue to perform very well.","Paul Adornato","Thanks. And as a follow-up, could you talk about rent growth at the luxury side of the retail business? Which we expect, given the dollar.","David Simon","I think it's good, because as you know a lot of that even with the growth, even with that the tourism spending down most of those leases are well below market and -- number one. And number two is, they are still unique enough properties that when the opportunity presents itself that the demand is still there for that real estate. So very few people -- I'd say very few retailers don't -- that are of that nature that we want in those properties don't look at the long-term opportunity. But if it -- if there is a difference it's on the margin. But we still -- we're still pretty insulated from that, demand is good and our leases are under market there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim, SunTrust. Please proceed.","Ki Bin Kim","Thank you. So, David, hypothetical question. Given that we know a little bit more about the market and what the equity markets are doing versus last spring, all else equal -- and I know Macerich has sold some assets -- but in your mindset today and what you know about the world, would you still be a buyer of Macerich, all else equal, if it was back in the market today?","David Simon","I'm not going to comment on that.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay.","David Simon","All I can -- all I'm going to comment on is where we are today. And I've explained that a couple different places, okay.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. Okay, and then the second question on your Outlet business, you've already talked about the traffic or tourists being down a little bit. But does that eventually translate into lease spreads? Where it's not just the overage rents that are taking a little bit of a hit, but if this continues are your lease spreads that the tenants are willing to pay eventually become more at risk?","David Simon","Well, the reality is I wish they were at market, because then the volatility -- so just say, when we roll over a lease we try to get effective rent, which is base rent plus overage rent and the reason we have a little more volatility is because the lease hasn't expired. So the good news is as these leases expire we're going to be able to get them at market rent. I mean that's why we had a little exposure in the fourth quarter, because we're not at market rent, we're not at market rent.","So even with today's decrease in tours and spend, the important point though also is that the traffic was up and so that's an important point. I mean the traffic was up, it was really just the spend was down. And I think that's just going to be an adjustment until we get where the currencies are a little more stable and anniversary these sales. But the -- it's our intention to make that overage volatility go away and that's marking the leases to market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Vincent Chao","Yes, good morning or good afternoon. Just curious, going back to the 1.3 million square feet of bankruptcy space that was taken back, I thought I heard earlier that 70% had been re-let as of the end of the year. And apologize if I'd missed this, but I guess how did that stack up relative to your expectations? I mean, would you have expected to have more of that re-leased by now? And just I'll leave it at that.","Rick Sokolov","Hi. This is Rick. In fact, we were doing very well with that releasing. What we are going to do is we are not going to put our space on sale, we are holding margins. In fact, the rents for foot of the space that has to lease are above the rents of the tenants that left because of bankruptcy and we're making sure that we are getting in the right tenants at the right price, at the right space. So we're on track with that, and there you'll continue to see the benefit of that coming into this year as more of those leases open.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thanks. And on a slightly different topic, just going back to the -- sort of the changing profile of the mall and may be the decreasing importance of the anchors, particularly as a traffic driver, just curious if this -- or if you think about shortening lease terms from the traditional leased deals, five years or so, just so you have more control over how to control and create that experience, given that tastes change pretty quickly and things like that.","Rick Sokolov","When we do our leasing every space and every tenant has their own situation and we are strategic about our terms. If we feel that it's a tenant that is underperforming the mall, may be we'll do a shorter-term, if it's a tenant that were higher desires of having in the mall, we want them to remodel, we may give them a longer-term. So there is no overarching strategy on term, it's really a lease specific strategic decision.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Hoglund, Jefferies. Please proceed.","George Hoglund","I was wondering if you could give some additional color on the trends in asking rents. Because what we've been hearing is that asking rents are down year-over-year in the A malls as it's getting a little bit tougher to back-fill space, and the balance of power may be shifting a little bit towards the tenants. Just wondering if you could just give some color on that.","David Simon","May I ask where do you hear that?","George Hoglund","Hearing it from brokers out there.","David Simon","And what cities are these brokers from? Are they talking about like city street space? Or they -- I mean is it mall space?","George Hoglund","It's mall space.","David Simon","Well, I think you could -- I would put more faith in what we would tell you and the answer is that we don't see that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Muller, JP Morgan. Please proceed.","Mike Mueller","Yes. Hi. Just a couple quick ones here. I guess first, where do you see occupancy ending at year-end '16?","David Simon","We are projecting an increase from where we are this year.","Mike Mueller","Okay. Any shot at narrowing that down a little bit?","David Simon","No, no, because look the end of the day -- we're -- listen, we made our FFO this year, was $3.6 billion, right?","Andy Juster","Yes.","David Simon","So we -- which happen to be more than certain technology companies, I won't name names, okay. And -- I mean I know everybody wants all these metrics, but you've got to look at what we're all about, which is growing earnings, growing dividends, investing for the future. And I do think there is this move on metrics that I just want to put it in overall perspective, that it's not how we -- we don't stress over metrics the way others might. We're just focused on increasing our cash flow, investing for the future, making our properties the best they can be in a particular market for the benefit of shareholders, communities, retailers. And we will just tell you that we -- as we model all this we are expecting an increase in occupancy, it takes a lot of work. How many leases did we sign this year my friend?","Rick Sokolov","Over 10 million square feet.","David Simon","10 million square feet, right? So you know it's hard to model. But we've had a pretty good track record. But certain things were out of our control bankruptcies, tourism spend and so on. So again, it's a slight uptick and we hope to be able to achieve that.","Mike Muller","Okay. And then may be a quick Andy question. It looks like interest income tripled in the fourth quarter relative to the third, just wondering what's driving that?","Andy Juster","Now --","Mike Muller","I know it's not a huge number in the grand scheme of things, but still.","Andy Juster","Yes. We can get back to you on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Floris van Dijkum, Boenning. Please proceed.","Floris van Dijkum","David, Floris. Quick question on your NOI growth. You posted 7% this year. If you do that for 10 years you've basically almost doubled your NOI. Is it reasonable to expect that kind of growth going forward, sort of the 3% on top of your same-store numbers that you're expecting to post?","David Simon","Well, it's a good question. I can't -- 10 years is a hard time for me to project. But look, I think the redevelopment and development pipeline that we've got I mean I think we've got a pretty decent shot of continuing that as we go forward. I mean, I think fact is of course, as you know a lot of people who have doubted our ability to grow our earnings because of the size of the company and obviously math does make it a little bit harder, but the fact is nobody in our industry -- and when I say industry, I -- I'm talking about retail real estate, nobody in our subsector of our industry, retail real estate has been able to do that over a, sure a quarter here or quarter there, a year there, or year there. But over the life of our company nobody has been able to do this. I mean we started out with I think, if I can remember the math $200 million of earnings, we're at $3.6 billion, okay. That's not too shabby.","As I said in my annual report quoting Adam Sandler, but nobody liked but I kind of thought it was funny. But point is I don't know, I -- but we got a good runway for the next few years, Floris.","Floris van Dijkum","One follow-up question may be, David, on Aventura. I noticed there it's not in your supplements, but there are potential plans for, I guess an expansion that Seritage is suing Turnberry over. Can you make any comments on that?","David Simon","No, we're not named in that lawsuit, so we have no -- and we haven't seen the complaints, so we've got nothing more to add.","And the one question on the other income was the cash flow that we got from our investment in Value Retail, which tends to happen year-after-year, but it -- we -- since we only -- we cost account for it. For those of you old like me, you know what that means? We don't equity account for it. So we only book the income upon receipt of cash and it happened to be in that quarter, but it tends to happen year-after-year.","Operator?","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference over to David Simon.","David Simon","Okay. Thank you. Very, very good questions. Appreciate staying with us and we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Tom Ward, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.","Tom Ward","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Presenting on today's call is David Simon, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President; also on the call are Rick Sokolov, Vice-Chairman; Brian McDade, Chief Financial Officer; and Adam Reuille, Chief Accounting Officer.","Before we begin, a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR Web site at investors.simon.com.","For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.","David Simon","Okay. Good morning. We had a very productive quarter, and are pleased with our financial results. Results in the quarter were highlighted by funds from operation of $1.06 billion or $2.99 per share. Adjusting for the prior year for a non-cash investment gain [indiscernible] IPCO [ph], ABG Exchange and the impact of external leasing cost, our FFO growth rate was 4.9% per share. We continue to grow our cash flow and report solid key operating metrics.","Our comp NOI increased 2% for the second quarter, and total portfolio NOI increased 1.6% for the quarter. Retail bankruptcies in the second quarter impacted our comp NOI by over a hundred basis points. Year-to-date comp NOI has increased 1.8%. And to put this in perspective, our comp NOI grew 3.6% in '16, 3.2% in '17, last year 2.3%, and we continue to comp it on a NOI base of more than $5 billion.","Leasing activity remained solid. Average base rent was $55.52. And or leasing spread was $16.53 per square foot, an increase of 32.3%. And we're pleased that our sales momentum from our retailers continued in the second quarter. Reported retail sales per square foot for our malls and outlets was $669 per foot, compared to $646 in the prior year period, an increase of 3.5%, and just to give you a fun fact, we have over 77 properties; that's right 77 properties that if you average their total sales will be over $900 a foot. So 77 over $900 a foot, and you can see that clearly as our report retail sales on an NOI weighted basis of $852 compared to the $669 per foot occupancy would be 95.5% compared to 94.4%, and our average base minimum rent would be $73 -- a little over $73 per foot.","New development, we broke ground on a luxury outlet in Normandy, which is our first designer outlet in Western Paris, Catchment Area and our third outlet in France. This center is projected to open in the second quarter of 2021. Construction continues on the three international outlets in Malaga, Spain; Bangkok, Thailand; West Midlands, England, all open in 2020. Queretaro, in Mexico, opened and its full grand opening will be in the fall of this year. We continue to expand our international outlet presence in growing markets adding to our overall franchise value with high rates of return. And as I mentioned to you in the press release today, we have 42 international outlets after we finish the four that are currently under construction.","Redevelopment, just the highlights, a lot going on, as you know, so we have 30 properties across all of our platforms in the U.S. and internationally with our share of net cost of approximately $1.7 billion. Our extensive identified pipeline is over $5 billion in new development or redevelopment across all our platforms. These significant redevelopments and transformations will continue to fuel our profitability. Importantly, we will fund these accretive projects through our internally generated cash flow. And they'll continue to serve our communities. As you know, our properties generate significant property taxes and significant sales taxes for their jurisdictions that fund the police, fire, schools, et cetera. So we continue to play a very, very important role in the livelihood of our communities that we operate in.","Now, going to liquidity, you'll be pleased to know that we have $6.8 billion of liquidity, and that is net of our outstanding CP balance. During the quarter, we purchased 1.05 million shares of common stock. We continued, in July, to purchase another 630,000. So we have combined, over the last essentially four months, 1.68 million shares of repurchase. And this further is represented by our strong balance sheet, which continues to be a far significant advantage in our area. We announced a dividend increase. We're now paying $2.10. That's an increase of 5% on a trailing 12-month basis ending June 30. Over the last three years our dividends have grow at more than 8%.","Another fun fact which I'm here to supply to put our dividends as a public company, we have paid more than $30 billion, three-zero billion to our shareholders in cash in dividends, pretty good number. As reminder, our annualized current dividend yield of more than 5% is 300 basis points higher than the 10-year treasury, and our dividend is more than one-and-a-half times covered by our annual FFO. We continue to reinforce our guidance at 12.30 to 12.40 despite some headwinds, which include lower lease settlement income, lower distribution income from our international investments, stronger dollar, obviously all the redevelopment that's going on with our anchors, accelerated redevelopment including, say, Northgate, some of the unanticipated bankruptcies, and some of our SPO costs which we're now accelerating.","So to conclude, we produced another good quarter of results and operating metrics. There's no company in our industry that has the reach and impact on the communities that we have. And we continue to focus on the long-term, we'll continue to invest in our product and generate the kind of returns that will grow our earnings, cash flow, and dividends.","And we're now ready for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeremy Metz","Hey, good morning.","David Simon","Good morning.","Jeremy Metz","David, I was wondering if you could break it down for us to then talk about what you're seeing on the mall front in terms of trends in traffic versus what you're seeing in the outlets, anything that's going better than you expected so far this year, even lagging a bit, and maybe just as a follow-on, what your expectations are that you have built in for Dressbarn here.","David Simon","Well, I would say, and recon way in the mall business, sales are up, traffic is reasonably good. I say it's -- there's ups and downs, but overall it's up slightly. In the outlets business we're skewed a little bit more toward the tourism. And because of the strong dollar and some of the implications of what's going on in the global environment, traffic there is flattish, but sales are more flattish. And that's really a function of the big tourist centers in the outlet business that are essentially flat where we would expect them to be up. Overage rent is up in the mall business. It's a little under plan in the outlet business.","So I'd say, generally, it's, absent the strong dollar and absent what the decrease in overall tourism in the U.S., we would be performing well ahead of our plan. Obviously the unanticipated bankruptcies is something we're dealing with. Yet, even with that, we've produced the 2% comp NOI growth. And I missed your last -- what was your -- well, Dressbarn is, it is what it is. We'll see what happens, insignificant to us in the scheme of our operation. Rick?","Rick Sokolov","The only thing that I would add is that the trends that David talked about are manifesting themselves in the interest that we're seeing from our retailers. There's still a steady stream of retailers that are seeking to find space in our property. And the properties continue to get better through the addition of retailers that are making a difference in our trade area presence.","Jeremy Metz","Appreciate that. And David, can you just talk about the investment in Black Ridge and Allied eSports, just what drove this and what sort of larger opportunity you possibly see here with that?","David Simon","Well, look, I think we do think obviously there's a huge momentum going on about the eSports and venues. And we have, just like the exhibition theater business, I mean the mall is a great place to host those kind of events, and in a setting like that drives sponsorship income, drive traffic, reinforce our real estate as kind of the place to be for the community. So we've got lots of options beyond just Allied about brining those kind of venues to our real estate. And in fact the explosion on the location-based entertainment area is incredible from kind of where it was a decade ago to where it is today. So we have essentially a dedicated team that's looking at all sorts of operations and venues that we're going to be brining to our real estate that will broaden the mix, invest in the community, increase traffic, bring sponsorship opportunities, food and beverage.","And given the department store -- getting those department stores back in a lot of cases or buying them back in some cases gives us the real estate that we've never had before to bring them into the mall. So that's what's really exciting that, yes, it's a lot of work, yes we have to be focused. But we now have the ability, where we didn't have it before, to bring all sorts of those venues into our real estate. So brought a team on essentially just to deal with the, for no better word the location-based entertainment concepts, just to go through that so that we could bring them to the centers. And again, we now have in some cases the real estate to put them in where we didn't have it otherwise. And we can do it at accretive returns.","Rick, would you like to add anything?","Rick Sokolov","Only thing I would add is that we've been doing this for over a decade, because we have a very large relationship with Merlin through our Mills portfolio, and we've got a great set of experiences there that demonstrate the viability of our properties for these types of uses. So we're building off of strength to implement the initiatives David just talked about.","Jeremy Metz","All right. And last from me, and just sticking somewhat along those lines is, and looking back at the investment you made in Aero alongside ABG and your experience you've had since that time, how do you think about making similar investments? Would you do it? Would you -- what would you look for just given some of the distress that I wonder if this is something we could see you guys do again here at some point in the near-term?","David Simon","Well, look, I think it's very possible we're going to be very smart about it, Jeremy. Now, it's interesting because, as you know, we authentic plans grew just to the private placement where we decided to keep our stock, but certain shareholders sold and new shareholders came in, and we decided not to keep our entire interest. So we didn't sell down because we believe in the company. But that stake, based on its current raise in terms of new shareholders coming in, is worth $153 million, and we basically put no money in it. We still have the Aero OpCo, which is -- we own 44%, and it's going to do $65 million EBITDA thereabouts. So I think we're not too bad at this investment. We're certainly as good as the private equity guys when it comes to retail investment.","And so I wouldn't rule it out, but I mean we've made a ton of money in Aero, and we love being partners with authentic brands group. And we will work together on other distress situations. And let's face it, there are some out there. So -- but we will get a pie into companies that we think have brand and that have the volume that is worth going to sell. They just bought Sports Illustrated. I think they have got a great the intellectual property there. I think it's got a great future with company like ABG to focus on. We may invest Mad as an example. There could be Sports Illustrated eSports, gaming, food & beverage. And we will be at the forefront to try and to be as creative as we can. Now with our real estate that you cannot duplicate, and again, while we serve the community, we pay significant real estate taxes, significant -- our retailers and us pay significant sales tax. And we are investing in our properties to obviously for our shareholders but also for the benefit of these communities.","Jeremy Metz","Thanks for the time.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy from with Citi.","Christy McElroy","Hi, good morning everyone.","David Simon","Good morning.","Christy McElroy","Just off of Jeremy's last question but maybe from a little bit of a different angle. Given that past experience with Aero and Nautica and the insights that you have gain from these investments, and you have also talked about being on many creditor committees in the past. How are you approaching retailer restructurings and bankruptcies differently than in the past, or maybe differently than what some of the other mall REITs have the capability to do that maybe gives you a competitive advantage with tenant fallout and bankruptcy activity having picked up again this year?","David Simon","Well, that's a good question. I would say we have another -- what is it called, quiver in my -- what is it -- arrow in my quiver?","Rick Sokolov","Arrow in your quiver.","David Simon","Arrow in my quiver, I always like reverse when I am supposed to say it.","Rick Sokolov","Robin is looking out.","David Simon","But now I would say we certainly have the ability to help beyond what you might do on the leases become an investor in a distress situation. So we have the ability. I am not sure we would do it alone, but with somebody like ABG we have obviously worked well with historically General Growth and now Brookfield. So we have kind of the ability together or even individual or some combination thereof to look at becoming more than just a real estate player, but a buyer of these brands. So that's the difference -- that's the majority difference.","We also have the ability to underwrite the business pay lot better than we could have. So, we are left in the dark about what the right rent should be in a workout scenario, and we have resources, I mean the folks at the Aero, OpCO -- the folks at ABG are friends with Brookfield, and our team can basically rapidly run through any kind of investment or retail scenario and find out -- get to the bottom of what the right fix is. And I would say to you we were decent at it a few years ago, but now we are pretty good at it.","Christy McElroy","Okay. And then just with the straight line rent adjustment elevated in Q2 and somewhat volatile over the last couple of quarters. Wondering if you could provide some insight into what's driving that perhaps impacted by some of the lease accounting stuff? And how we should think about the impact to GAAP non-cash rent adjustments for the full year?","David Simon","Yes. With the new capacity pronouncements, we --historically we have never straight lined our camp even though as you know a lot of our camp is not -- most of it, 95% of it is fixed with a growth in it. And I believe a lot of our peer groups historically have straight lined that. So, we have to straight line that because of the new pronouncement, and that's really the change in that. Again, our content OI Christy as, you know, takes out any straight-line impact. So it's basically cash. And but that's basically all there is to it. When you look at kind of the increase in straight line less the -- now that we can't capitalize our leasing costs, I mean, it's basically less than 1% differential, in terms of our FFO per shares, it's one way to look at it, but the reality is, if you look at the comp NOI, we strip it out in any event, but it's simply we never straight-line comp expense. And that we have.","Christy McElroy","Okay. So we should expect it to remain elevated going forward, because of the straight line?","David Simon","Well, certainly this year. Then I think you'll see it more normalized. Now, we also write-off strictly, we have to rise -- when you have a bankruptcy, we've had straight-line write-offs this year, because if you have a tenant that goes into bankruptcy, and yet you certainly any straight-line rent or straight-line candidate, you may have for that tenant. It's going to be written off. So we've had certainly some of that as well.","Christy McElroy","Got it. Okay, thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Good morning, I guess just a couple of questions first, maybe to just start on kind of the leasing environment. I mean, you and Rick touched on it a little bit that there's good demand. I mean, can you just elaborate a little bit more, you said you've been impacted about 100 basis points from bankruptcies this year. And I'm just wondering, David, you just sort of look at the tenant watch list and the, potential tenants, you're still kind of working with the restructure? Where do you sort of feel like we are in that kind of pendulum or timeframe of kind of getting to the end of that and, just 2020 kind of begin to show a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel?","David Simon","Well, I still think there are a couple up there, without naming names, Steve that we're monitoring. And, we'll have to see kind of where that goes. So it's hard for me to give you an exact, response specifically to the question, other than there are still a couple out there that we're monitoring we'll see how it ultimately reside? I will tell you, not that this is of interest, but it's not a reflection of our business. Okay. And I know that's hard to say, that's hard to. I know that's a statement that many don't believe but if you look at the bankruptcies, each one of these folks, there were things and decisions that they did that led them to that point. As opposed to it, this it's our business, okay. And I won't go through names, but lack of investment, too much leverage, opening two biggest stores going international, when they should have stayed domestic, picking the wrong mark, it's not endemic of our business, and that's the important point, because the reality is, even with these bankruptcies that we've had to deal with, we are comping up, yes, it's not where I'd like to see it, but it's still comping up a couple of percent. And we would have really outperform had we not had the unanticipated bankruptcies. We are outperforming an overdraft in the mall business underperforming and the outlet business because of the tourism that I showed you. So there's pros in that in what we're seeing in sales there, the higher end continue to do well, as I mentioned to you, we have 77 properties, in total, would get you over if you just took the top seven, and we'd be over 900 bucks a square foot, so it's not endemic of our business or our industry.","It's each one of these, each one of these has a story and I could spend three hours going through pros and cons as to what decisions they made that led them to that problem. And that's the most important message I can deliver to you. today. It's not quote and again, we're much more diversified than the mall business. But let's talk. It's not the mall business. It's certain folks that ran their business, not in the best way. And yes, we suffer while we re-characterize or reach lease the space to better operators. So I'll turn it over to Rick to add any implication to your question.","Rick Sokolov","And part of that is demonstrated by the fact that our occupancy trends have held up very nicely in spite of all that bankruptcy. And as we detailed in the past, there is still a broad array of tenants that are seeking to come to our properties, whether they're new concepts, whether they are digitally native retailers, whether they are international retailers, we still have retailers that are traditional retailers, like [indiscernible] that are still growing significantly. And we are adding a lot of food to our property. And all of that is contributing to the fact that you're seeing our sales growth, and you are seeing our NOI growth.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks. David, just a small point, on the total portfolio, NOI was up less than comp, which is not normally the case. And your share of NOI from investments was down. Is there anything kind of just for us to focus in on as we think about or\u2026","David Simon","Well, remember, we sold our interest internationally in HPS. That's the biggest reduction. And in addition, we've got a lot of redevelopment going on, you could see that number, we have a number of properties that are basically taking a step back, because of our redevelopment efforts. But those are the biggest ones that jumped out at me, right. So -- and Tom just mentioned to me FX as well. So when you put the -- I'd say those are the three things. So HBS has gone internationally, FX, currency, and then the redevelopment, as you can see, where we have a number of properties that are kind of going down a little bit this year as we redevelop it -- Burlington mall, Ross Park Mall, and a handful of these that we're taking a step back to take several steps forward. So that's basically the map.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, thanks. And then lastly, I just noticed, the average base rent per foot, which, takes into a lot of things, including lease restructurings and others was up a more modest I guess, 1.2% to 1.3%. Anything, we should just be thinking about that number, versus say the least spreads you're getting and obviously the change in occupancy that I was curious on that trend?","David Simon","No, I'd say it's basically a function of, some of the workouts that we're having to deal with.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, thanks a lot.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line up Craig Schmidt from Bank of America.","Craig Schmidt","Thank you. I wondered if you could categorize the store closing and then outlet space versus the mall space. Is it, are they experiencing store closing through a comparable degree or the more meaning to the malice?","David Simon","I would say they're the last few bankruptcies have also had outlet exposure. So, they are more comparable where a couple years ago it was more the mall than the outlets and now, they're similar there's not -- there's not a trend that outlets or better or worse than, than the than the malls and when it comes to store closings due to bankruptcies, I'd say they're. They're more similar in terms of that pattern. ","Craig Schmidt","Great. And then obviously very active in redevelopment. I wondered if it is possible to categorize what do you mean you think you're in, in terms of the major anchoring position. I recognize you're always going to need to do it but in terms of this major push for anchor repositioning, maybe what do you need more then?","David Simon","Well, I never been much of a baseball player but I would say what and I would say the third -- maybe three so he and I hit the number at the same time. I'd say the third inning.","Craig Schmidt","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","David Simon","Thank you, Craig.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, Good morning. Good morning out there. Out there it's not that, it's not like we're in -- it's not like we're in outer space. We are not on the moon. We're [indiscernible] here.","David Simon","Yes, well\u2026","Alexander Goldfarb","I think it's kind of like Neil Armstrong. Okay, he is very thoughtful.","David Simon","Right.","Alexander Goldfarb","Straightforward guy. Go ahead, Simon.","David Simon","Okay, perfect steady hand at the landing.","Alexander Goldfarb","Just two questions here first, David, sort of following up to Christie's question, the jump in; so two-part question on the leasing spreads from straight line rent. So one, how much of the increase of straight-line rent is any of that due to increase leasing activity, because looking at the leasing spreads, they've really jumped over the past year. So I don't know if that's purely mix, or maybe this is the benefit of backfill, but if I look at your TIs over the past year, they've gone up a little bit, but nowhere near as much as the rent spreads have jumped. So just trying to understand how much of the jump in rent spreads is purely just mix, versus its actually you guys getting better tenants, and maybe some of that is leaking into the higher straight-line rent?","David Simon","Well, we certainly continue to straight-line our rental income, beyond comp. I don't have the breakdown for you, but it does add into that amount we continue. I mean, there's rent spreads, continue to be healthy, obviously, a lot of that will be significantly enhanced, as we're getting back, very, cheap space that we can rent it, I mean, that's going to be the future growth of the company is taking back the some of the bigger spaces and generating much greater rental income from them. And, that's why we're spending the capital. So it all kind of feeds into each other in terms of generating our cash flow future NOI growth, leasing spreads. And obviously, that'll be part of the straight-line, rent income as well.","Rick Sokolov","And I would just confirm your observation that our tenant allowances have been very stable over the years, and there has not been a noticeable increase at all. It's business as usual at the testing.","Alexander Goldfarb","Should they -- Rick, the rising -- releasing spreads, it just is purely mix, or we should expect these, I mean, just wondering next few quarters, it is going to go down to more in the mid-teens or these going to stay elevated?","Rick Sokolov","That's why you have a job. Okay, you'll, see when it happens, okay, but the bottom-line is that's why we have a job -- the bottom-line is, we are certainly one of the greatest opportunities we've had, as a company and I can't underestimate yet some people could look at, the demise of certain anchors as a sign of, impending doom, we look at -- we'd look at it in the complete reverse, as a significant opportunity, because we are now getting the ability to take that space, and redevelop it with a creative returns on investment and higher rents. And so, I do think that trend will continue. Whether it'll be up five bucks down, that's just -- that's a quarter-to-quarter change. But that is -- that's why we're spending -- that's why we have a $5 billion pipe. I mean, that is our business going forward. And it's important for the market to understand, I mean, that's where we see great opportunity.","Alexander Goldfarb","Right. Rick, I just want to make sure the budget like this wasn't like a definitional change, or something accounting change. I'm just trying to get to, because obviously, it's impressive. So just want to understand if this is definitional change or accounting change or\u2026","Rick Sokolov","Not at all. Not at all.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second question is just quantifying obviously got Forever21 pretty small, but overall, your comments about what your guidance has endured as far as headwind stronger U.S. dollar, tourism, all this stuff, where are you guys trending as far as your bad debt budget. So presumably your budget whatever it is 100 basis points or something like that for the year, where are you trending on whatever your budget is, where you are trending on that year-to-date?","David Simon","I would say we are higher. I mean I don't have exact number, but it's higher than what we -- certainly higher than what we budgeted because we had some anticipated bankruptcies. Unfortunately when we do our model, it's the end of last basically November -- October - November. We are now in July. And we've had a lot of stuff that we had to deal with. So, it's definitely higher than what we budgeted.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs.","Caitlin Burrows","Hi, good morning. Maybe on the leverage side, net debt NOI has been coming down to 5.1 times now. And I think investors do like to see this. So, I was just wondering what's driving this decision from the Simon side versus spending more on say development buybacks or something else.","David Simon","Well, look, we try to manage the balance sheet with great care. And so, we do have a -- the pipe we can -- we have not capital constraints on the pipe, but really human resource and permitting constraints. And obviously, we are very focused on supply and demand in those particular markets because as you know a lot the redevelopment efforts are going to be kind of mixed use element. So -- but we can only go as fast as the permits and our human resources can do it. And it does take certain markets specially California where we have a pretty big pipe and in Seattle with Northgate a huge development there -- development that based on phasing, but -- and over a period of time and the approval process there is going very well, but that's a spend that could approach a billion dollars given the opportunities we see with that site.","So unfortunately, we got to tear them all down first each time, which were -- I think we will start in eight days, right? So I think that -- to get back to your question, I think the biggest constraint is really just human resources and permitting. So, it's not -- listen we don't want to be carried away with the balance sheet. And as Rick mentioned, I mean we are very -- every once in awhile, we will take on a flyer on development or redevelopment, but we certainly when it comes to -- allowance comes to capital, as you can see over the history of the company we are very, very, very thoughtful on that. I mean we don't bat a 1000 you see I am using the baseball analogy but we -- so we are very thoughtful on that. And then, I think the buyback -- look, we are going to be opportunistic. REITs will always be and I think I read, not to quote Steve Walk [ph] because we don't want to give him a big hit, but I do think REITs are always going to be somewhat limited on buybacks compared to industrial America because of our need to pay out our taxable income obviously to maintain the REIT status. And that's why if you leave with anything in this call is we had paid out $30 billion, that's with the D, dividend in the history of this company, which is pretty damn remarkable I think.","Tom, you agree?","Tom Ward","Agree.","David Simon","Okay, so -- and so it will always be something nice to do, but we are always going to be somewhat constrained just because we are paying out so much capital and dividend. Now the reality is we would buy -- we didn't have to pay out on our taxable income and we would be a cash flow machine, we would buy a tremendous amount of product check. So it will always be there for us to be opportunistic but we can't overwhelm given our pay out on the dividend front.","Caitlin Burrows","Got it, okay. And then maybe just you do have a history of raising FFO guidance the vast majority of quarters in the past. So, just wondering if you could give some detail on how maybe results played out during the quarter. How that related to your own budget and what prevented you from raising the full-year guidance. I know that in previous set of questions you did mention potentially that bad debt was trending a little higher than you had originally predicted.","David Simon","Yes, I probably bored you. But the reason we haven't raised guidance this year is a few things. And I will just restate what I said. We have lower lease settlement income than we had budgeted. We have lower distribution income from our interest -- essentially in value retail. We don't equity cap for that. As you know we cash account -- cost accounting. Not to bore you I don't know what you background is, but cost accounting -- cost accounting still exist, correct?","Brian McDade","Yes\u2026","David Simon","If you know how old I am, but cost account -- basically we only book with what cash we get. So anticipate a little bit higher distribution income from our investments and value retail. We haven't gotten -- we have the stronger dollar. Obviously we had unanticipated bankruptcies. We didn't budget SOP though we kind of knew that we might do it, we just -- it's kind of out there and we decided well, it's out there and then obviously the anticipated bankruptcies.","On average rent, we are trending above in the mall business, but below in the outlet. And I have explained that basically it's not a function of the business, it's a function of tourism and a strong dollar being basically reduced in the country, and we are not the only company in America that's telling you that. You can see that and from a number of different lives.","Caitlin Burrows","Got it, okay.","David Simon","So that's basically -- so that's what's been going on and why we haven't raised guidance this year.","Caitlin Burrows","Okay, thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley.","Rich Hill","Hi, David. Good morning. First of all, thanks for reporting prior to the open. It's nice and refreshing to have it mixed up from deluge of companies reporting after the close. I appreciate the color on FFO guidance. And I wanted to also maybe talk about retail overall and maybe how you are thinking about some of your investments. So maybe first, could you maybe give us an update on your [indiscernible] stake and if you would think about increase that? It looks like that's been a pretty good investment, and then maybe also an update on the test [Ph] consumer facing platform as well.","David Simon","Okay, so having just been in a board meeting last week, I think that they are doing an excellent job. They are very well positioned. Their balance sheet which continues to be much better than their peer group, and their cash flow their like for like I can't remember exactly what the number was, but I thought it was pretty good given what's going on and continue to sell asset sure of the business. And what we have seen is a company that continues to operate better and better over the years that we have invested.","I would say you -- it's unlikely we would ever -- I mean if we go over 30, I don't know if you know the rules, we have to offer the whole company. I would say it's not in our plans to ever to do that right now. But, I mean it's certainly in our option that we would have down the road, but it's not in our plans at all. So, with that said -- and then our SOP, we have -- we are still invaded. We have got 12 retailers, 3000-ish brands on online, we're going through kind of the kink, so you can have access to it. If you are one of our loyalty members, we got another 15 or so that's in the process of coming on board. And our plan is to make it public sometime in the third quarter. And I'd say to you, we've got a lot of interesting things going on with that platform. Beyond just that, but I can't really share much beyond that other than stay tuned. I do think we can have a -- I do you think we can create a real business opportunity for us in this area.","Rich Hill","Got it. That's it for me. Thanks for the transparency and thoughts David.","David Simon","Sure, no problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.","Nick Yulico","Thanks, David. I just want to go back to the topic of redevelopment and also tied into questions about total portfolio NOI growth. And I think we can appreciate how redevelopment and disruptive NOI process with some attractive payoff down the road. But we get a sense of timing of, when this will start to benefit overall portfolio growth because it's not showing up in the numbers this year. And if you mentioned your guess, is that we're in a third inning of this process. I mean, does this mean that it's going to be an ongoing drag on total portfolio NOI growth, or does this change at some point in the next year or so\u2026","David Simon","Again, just to be clear I -- there are three major elements on that. One is the -- that's where the currency, stronger dollars hurt us. Number two is we sold an asset for when you sell an asset, you don't have the income. Okay. So, and then the third element is our redevelopment. So, the reason that the properties there are relatively flat, and normally, we would see growth there. So I just want you to put that in perspective. So with that said, I'll address your question. Look, I think you'll start to see benefits in 2020 later, but you know, it takes time, I mean, that's -- the reality from a new development point of view. You know, we don't have a lot. So a lot of the driving as a new development was through that line, we did decide to more or less buy the land and also to build also premium outlets yesterday, and the outlet there. So that's a go project. We still have some hurdles to do. But that's pretty much so. So I, and that's open in 2021. And we've got a lot of the International outlets are really open in late 20 and early 21. So it's going to take time.","Now, Nick, here's the important thing. You will never hear from this company. We will have a throwaway year. Okay, so even with kind of like yes, it's not that exciting. We're not going to tell you wait for next year. Wait, we don't wait for good deal. Okay, not here. So, yes, we're, it's going to accelerate, but we're worried about '19 and '20 and '21. So we don't have throwaway years.","Nick Yulico","All right. I appreciate it. That's helpful. Thanks, David.","David Simon","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai from Barclays.","Linda Tsai","Hi, your weighted average interest cost is pretty attractive at 3.49%. And then in 2020, you have some higher rate debt maturing for both consolidated and JV debt. You know, with the 10 year having trended lower, do you think you'll achieve some interest rate savings on these upcoming maturities?","Brian McDade","Hi, Linda. It's Brian. Yes, look, as we look out into the future and looking it through the perspective of today's current interest rate environment, certainly there would be some pickup if we stay in this environment for a longer period of time.","Linda Tsai","Thanks, and then hopefully heard this correctly, the bankruptcy impact on SS NOI year-to-date was 100 bips, but then given some subsequent comments about fallout being hired, does that mean that the full-year impact on SS NOI would be greater than 200 bips?","Brian McDade","Now, I think what we said to you so far, the -- Let me re-state what you just said. So there's no ambiguity. We had kept that live growth to 2%. We, generally, based on our budget would have been a little over three, had it not been from the unanticipated bankruptcies. We're still -- our goal for this year is still 2%.","Linda Tsai","What's the overall impact of bankruptcies on same store for '19?","Brian McDade","We just told the year-to-date, it's around 100 basis points.","Linda Tsai","Okay. Thanks.","Brian McDade","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank.","Derek Johnston","Good morning, everyone. Thank you. You've covered a lot. So just one for me if you don't mind, David, look, I like malls, okay. But acknowledging that sentiment on malls have been pretty poor, so far in 2019. Frankly, worse than the fundamentals, and clearly, nobody knows your business better than you guys. So when you look past '19, with 2020 and beyond fast approaching, what is the management team most excited about opportunity wise or strategically speaking?","David Simon","Well, thank you, very great question. So I would say, the most exciting, the most difficult thing that we -- I mean, in terms of exciting but difficult in terms of work, and execution is the ability to redevelop our centers. And while we're doing with the fifths of the world, the North gates of the world, [indiscernible] down the line is to me, really, really exciting. I mean, yes, it's a lot of work. I'd rather have my feet up on the desk. But that's the most exciting. So, it's -- we have been constrained Derek on how to redevelop a lot of these centers, because we had to run through all these hoops with the department stores.","Well, if we've got the space back, and we have their acreage, then we then the only thing constraining us is our imagination, and our ability to get permits, and obviously you got to be grounded by supply and demand. So that to me is the most exciting opportunity ahead of us is to really re-imagine the center now, you're right about the mall business sentiment.","Now, Rick and I rolled it up. Rick is a little bit older to know that people have been trying got kill off the malls for clearly to be 60 years, right? So was -- with the current centers, it was the power centers, it was, Walmart, it was Amazon. It was this guy or that guy, look we're resilient. Rick and I are all like cockroaches. Okay, we're going to still hang around. So -- but I do think that doesn't mean that we've got a -- we can't keep re-imagine or places. And I would say that the most exciting. The other thing I would say to you, Derek, that is as exciting to us is because of our high-quality portfolio or high-quality balance sheet, the stability of our cash flow, even with all the turmoil going on in our, the retail world. You know, we have lots of opportunities beyond what we do today. And we evaluate those with keen interest.","Derek Johnston","Thanks, David.","David Simon","Sure","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller from JP Morgan.","Michael Mueller","Yes. Hi. David. You mentioned you have 77 assets that generate more than $900 to put the sale. Can you give us a sense as to what portion of your pro rata NOI those assets represent?","David Simon","No, but well, I'll -- just let me think about whether I should give that word. What you might say, was that Michael, you may tell somebody a joke?","Michael Mueller","No, no, I got it\u2026","David Simon","It's well over. You know, it's well over 50%, it's probably 70ish. Give or take.","Michael Mueller","Got it? Okay. And then maybe push it a little further at the opposite end of the spectrum. How small is the contribution from the assets doing, say, less than 500 a foot?","David Simon","I don't have those numbers at top of my head, but -- ","Michael Mueller","Okay.","David Simon","But no worries.","Michael Mueller","70% is helpful. Okay, thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","Hey, good morning everyone. I'm looking at the international properties in the total NOI bucket. And I'm seeing that that's been growing about 4% year-to-date. First question is that largely comparable? And what is driving that strength?","Rick Sokolov","Well, it's largely comparable, other than there may be an expansion here or there. But remember, that's also been impacted by FX. So it's actually probably would be higher than that. You know, had we compared the last year? Most of that, most yes, the dollar has been obviously, significantly stronger, and we had budgeted to be not as strong, and it certainly year-over-year comparison stronger than where it was last year, because the vast majority of that is comfortable. So that guys have -- ","Wes Golladay","Would you ever consider putting that in the total bucket and maybe adjusting on the constant currency basis?","Rick Sokolov","You know, I thought about it, and we should do it? Because it would demonstrate the -- I mean, the fact is, I think a lot of people forget about this diversity and the high-quality portfolio we have. By the way, the 77 assets that would average over, over 900 is not has nothing to do with our international assets. They all I'd say by and large, well over 1000 foot. So, we thought about it, but then I don't know it's just, I don't know, we decided not to but I we thought about it, we certainly generate higher comp NOI growth. And I know, others do, do that. They'd lock it in there. So maybe one day, but then you would ask what the domestic business is and we'd be back to where we are today, right?","Wes Golladay","Can you keep them in the separate lines? But yes. That's why. Thank you.","Rick Sokolov","Yes, no worries.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Christy McElroy with Citi.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it's Michael Bilerman, here with Christy. David, I wonder if you can sit back and think about the mall or the retail competitive landscape from a landlord perspective. And you talked about the turmoil and the retail industry is clearly affecting different of your peers in different ways, especially those that don't have the cost of capital or balance sheet. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about perhaps your market share of retail leasing. And whether you believe you're getting a disproportionate share of retailer store openings or a lower share of retailer store closings, given that relationship and where you stand relative to all the other mall peers?","David Simon","Well, I actually don't think, Michael, that I actually, referenced to any of our peers in this call, other than to say, we do have the -- we do have some expertise that maybe others don't, when it comes to, it comes to, looking at opportunities or restructurings of retailer. So, look, I would say to you, I don't really think I referenced the peers all that much.","Michael Bilerman","No, you didn't. I'm asking the question about whether you are running the company are feeling and so you're getting a disproportionate share of leasing or a lower share of closings, given retailers' desire to be in your portfolio given a lot of the others things that go along with Simon, including the balance sheet and all the other variability, are retailers more --?","David Simon","Yes, no, I got the question. And I would answer it this way, and Rick can add or embellish on, I would say simply we've always -- we've kind of always had that position frankly, because of the quality of our real estate. And the fact that the quality of our real estate, the organizational strengths, and so on. So maybe on the margin it's even more important today. But I think that the stability of the organization and the quality of the real estate and the fact that people know we're going to invest in our real estate certainly helps, and certainly shouldn't' be overlooked. And I will say anecdotally, without numbers, and whatever that's worth. I mean landlords do matter. Historically maybe in a go-go time period maybe they matter less.","And I'm hopeful that as retailers look at whether it's in downsizing or restructuring or growing whatever the scenario is they do take into account who their partner is. But I think we've always been in that spot, maybe it's slightly enhanced. And I do think the landlord -- the ability to invest, I mean Rick and I run around, we talk to people, they say, \"Yeah, we know you're going to take care of your properties.\" Maybe there's a few retailers that want to put in what I call \"The clause\" where that if we don't own it they can do whatever the hell they want. At least we try not to do that, but I mean we hear stuff like that. But I'd say that's kind of on the margin.","Rick, please embellish.","Rick Sokolov","The only other thing that I would add is that our portfolio creates a lot of profit for these retailers. They are not charitable institutions. I think they do hold us in high regards, witness our result. But the reason we have an ability to interact with our retailers in a productive way is because they make a lot of money in our properties. And when they think about their business it's in their best interest to do business with us. And that's a function of all the things that David's been talking about the entire call about reinvesting in the property, having a stable balance sheet, having all these inventive and innovative plans. It all comes down to having more productive properties. And that's what gives us, I think, an edge.","Michael Bilerman","David, can you talk a little bit about sort of all the 5th platform initiatives. You've obviously had the outlet online business you've done at eSports, the CBD shops, there's a lot of other little bets you're placing in a lot of different ways. I guess how should we think about how you're spending your time on all of those initiatives? And how should we think about the capital that you may put forth to additional programs to drive [indiscernible] assets?","David Simon","Well, I think you'll see more and more of it, Michael, and can't really quantify it because it is opportunistic. But look, all of this is kind of return based. I mean it's not money that we're willy-nilly just throwing there hoping it sticks, it's not spaghetti up against the wall. But I do think we're going to be as creative and as innovative as we possibly can be with the guardrails that we have historically used, which is making sure that's a good return on investment, making sure that it's synergistic to what we do, making sure that we're betting on the right people and the right product and the right vision. But you will absolutely see more from us in this area. And I'm hoping from that what -- we've been fighting the fight for years that we're more than a mall company.","We've always defined ourselves as a retail real estate company from the get-go. Even when we went public we were more than a mall company. We have morphed into retail real estate, we've morphed into outlets, we've morphed into the Mills, we've morphed into international. So we are densifying our business in terms of -- so I am hopeful that with time, even though we are categorized as a mall company. Again, I'm not running from the mall business here. As someone asked earlier, what one of our most exciting things we have is redeveloping all this anchor space. But we are much different than that. And that process and evolution will continue. And we're hopeful that we will be profitable in it like we have in our other ventures out of our traditional business. Not our core business, our traditional business.","Michael Bilerman","This one, sort of strategically, as part of when you spun off WPG, which in hindsight I think those assets clearly would have been a little bit more of an anchor to your growth. You did spin off the open-air shopping center business. I guess as being a retail landlord does that business and the potential to maybe re-aggregate in that space or that's not on the table at all?","David Simon","I don't think it's on the table. If I understood the question I don't think it's on the table. I think there's a lot of opportunities ahead of us, I just wouldn't rank that as high up there.","Michael Bilerman","And then how does the U.K. which is obviously going through -- the stocks there are obviously having a lot of difficulties given their leverage position. You had Queretaro try to do something. Does that rank high on your list?","David Simon","I'm more worried about my -- the season is about to start for my team Crystal Palace. I'm more worried about it. And I have another -- I want a solid year this year. I'm tired of watching the relegation fight. So I'm more worried about that right now.","Michael Bilerman","All right, thanks for the time, David.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. David Simon.","David Simon","Okay, thank you and have a great rest of your summer. And we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Liz Zale, Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs. Please proceed, Ma'am.","Elizabeth A. Zale","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Simon Property Group's fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Presenting on today's call is David Simon, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. We refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements. Please also note that this call includes information that may only be accurate as of today's date. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the press release and the supplemental information in today's Form 8-K filing. Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our Investor Relations website, investor.simon.com.","With that, we will start the call. And I would like to introduce David Simon.","David E. Simon","Okay. Thanks, Liz. Good morning. We had strong results to wrap up 2013, which also was our 20th year as a public company. First, let me talk about the quarter's strong performance. Given the growth in our core business, we continue to see a positive impact on our growth strategy, which basically is comprised of investing in our existing assets to expand and to meet the retailer demand, enhance productivity, continue to develop new outlets and make smart, thoughtful, accretive acquisitions.","FFO was $2.47 per share, up 7.9% for the fourth quarter compared to 2012. Our FFO exceeded the first call consensus again by $0.05 per share. For our mall and Premium Outlets, comparable property NOI growth was 5.5% for the quarter, driven by basement rent increase; occupancy, up 80 basis points to 96.1%; and the continuation of positive sales from 2012. Our releasing spread continues to grow. It was a positive 16.8% or $8.94 per square foot, with much of the improvement driven by better leasing execution in the malls, while Premium Outlets spread continues to be robust. Mills comparable NOI was up 11% for the quarter, 10.8% for the year, driven by all the other factors I just went through.","For the year, our FFO in total was $3.2 billion, an increase of $321 million from 2012. This resulted in a per share FFO growth of 10.9% to $8.85 per share. This was $0.46 above where the consensus started in early 2013 at $8.39. Our performance was driven by thoughtful capital allocation, and I'm proud of the execution of the team. We opened 5 new Premium Outlets this year, 3 in North America and 2 in Asia. We invested, in total, $942 million in new and redevelopment projects in response to retailer demand and customer needs. These projects are all off to very good starts, and we'll increase the productivity of our assets. We completed $1.05 billion of acquisitions, including the expansion of our European presence, with the investment in McArthurGlen's Designer Outlet assets and the management development company. We also, in January, acquired our joint venture partner's remaining interest in Kravco Simon, which is -- owns 10 assets. We now own 100% of King of Prussia mall, which is an iconic asset with a major expansion in the works. We strengthened and we also disposed the 49 core retail assets, as well as announced our spinoff transaction, which we'll talk about in a moment.","We see strength across our portfolio and platforms. Occupancy continues to rise, which is a sign of retailer demand. The majority of our existing leases are under market. Ongoing NOI growth is supported by our ability to replace underperforming retailers. And as a final note on the operations, our operating profit margin grew by 60 basis points to 71.7% in 2013.","In the quarter, the fourth quarter that is, we broke ground on Premium Outlets in Montr\u00e9al in early October and construction is underway. It's cold up there, but it's still -- we're still working. Construction also continues on new developments in Vancouver, Minneapolis and Charlotte. Less cold and our pipeline includes 6 additional new outlets expected to start construction in 2014, 2015.","Redevelopment expansions are ongoing at 25 properties in the U.S., Asia and Mexico. We opened 2 in the fourth quarter, the shops at Nanuet, Walt Whitman in Long Island. Please go visit. Well executed, thank you for the team -- thank you to the team. Also, open expansion and number of other properties in the fourth quarter, including Orlando Premium Outlets at Vineland and Johor Premium Outlets in Malaysia.","Construction is ongoing to expand-enhance some of our most productive properties, which please do not lose sight of Roosevelt Field, Woodbury Common, Houston Galleria, Lenox Square, Del Amo and Desert Hills just to name a few. Overall, our multi-year pipeline of new development and redevelopment expansion projects will continue to drive growth NOI and in the future. And our pipeline continues to -- we expect to invest approximately $1 billion annually through 2016.","To give you a quick international update, Kl\u00e9pierre will report next week. But I'm proud of the fact that the company, with our help, has implemented a very thoughtful strategy. We've strengthened the balance sheet. We've improved operations and focused on cash flow growth. We have now signed and we were instrumental in the deal with Carrefour to sell smaller assets in order to focus on larger and more productive centers. We are exiting the office business. That will be completed shortly, including selling the headquarter building. We've strengthened the management with the hiring of Jean-Marc Jestin as COO. And we're focused on capital allocation among their different markets and continue to work on leasing and marketing opportunities.","Together, the European retail recovery is stable and continuing. And then just to finally mention that we did close McArthurGlen. I was actually there at both places this week, a day with McArthurGlen, 2 days with Kl\u00e9pierre. The opportunities -- McArthurGlen are there. We've got development and expansion projects to consider and continue to be impressed with where Kl\u00e9pierre is headed.","Now just to talk briefly about SpinCo. We have -- as you know, we won't go into much detail today about it, but we plan to spin off our strip center business in 44 smaller enclosed malls. We believe this will create additional value for Simon Property Group shareholders and be a good investment vehicle for SpinCo. We have yet to name the names. SpinCo is not the name, okay? SpinCo is not the name. And we're open to any ideas out there for any names. Please send them to us. We expect the transaction to be effective in the second quarter of 2014. We'll provide further updates as it's available, but everything is moving absolutely according to plan there.","Fourth quarter capital market activity, we were busy. We closed or locked rates on 10 new secured loans, totaling approximately $2.2 billion. Our share of that is roughly $1 billion. Including in the fourth quarter activity is the $1.2 billion refinance at Aventura Mall at a rate of 2.75.","In January, as you know, we announced and closed a bid offering of $1.2 billion of senior notes with a combined weighted average duration of 7.5 years and an average coupon rate of just under 3%. Demand was very robust for these bonds. We're using the proceeds for general corporate purposes and to repay debt, including the unencumbering of $820 million mortgage on Sawgrass Mills.","Dividend, we increased the dividend again in the first quarter, $1 to $1.25. That's a year-over-year increase of 8.7%. SPG, which not including SpinCo, will now pay, as you know, at least $5 in 2014. Now I would just take a moment to talk about something and I'll turn to '14. I'd like to make an announcement regarding our management team. Steve Sterrett, our long-term CFO, will be retiring in March of 2015. So he will be staying on board through another full fiscal year in our process. It's hard to overstate the contributions that Steve has made to our company. And I know I speak for everyone when I say we will be sorry to see him go. As many of you know, Steve has been with the company for 20 years during the period of extraordinary growth. Throughout it all, Steve's contributions have been immeasurable. We will conduct a search during the next few months for Steve's replacement. Expect to consider both internal and external candidates. And having Steve available for the rest of 2014 in the audit cycle will helpful and ensure a smooth transition. And he will still not be able to beat me on a consistent basis in golf.","Now let me just talk about 2014. I'm sure he'll have a response to that, by the way, but let's talk about 2014. Guidance is in a range of $9.50 to $9.60. This represents at the midpoint growth rate of 8%. This is based on comparable NOI growth of at least 4% for a combined mall and outlet portfolio. This FFO guidance is on a comparable basis for 2013 and ignores any potential impact of SpinCo. When SpinCo is effective, we'll provide updated and adjust the range for SPG, as well as provide a range for SpinCo.","And now let me conclude. We had a great year, a great fourth quarter. We continue to prioritize the creation of the value for our properties, our retailers and our shareholders. We believe we have very great prospects for 2014. And we're now ready for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum of UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm here with Jeremy Metz. Can you break out the terms for the Kravco purchase, as well as for Oyster Bay and Arizona Mills, how you broke out the consideration for those?","David E. Simon","Well the Kravco purchase was a -- basically, we had to put in a call at a combined cap rate of...","Stephen E. Sterrett","A little bit over 8%.","David E. Simon","A little over 8%.","Stephen E. Sterrett","And as well as 113%.","David E. Simon","113%. And we -- what was your next question?","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On Oyster Bay and Arizona Mills, how did the consideration break out between those assets?","David E. Simon","Well that was a private negotiation, and we will not be going through that.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, when can we expect an update on SpinCo management? Can you talk a little bit about that?","David E. Simon","We got initial comments from the SEC, so we're in that process. We are -- have identified both an internal and external candidate that we're having serious discussions with. And now we would hope to conclude that over the next few weeks. And as soon as we do, I'm sure it will be part of our filing. The board's pretty much set, and it's going according to plan.","Operator","And the next question comes from Nathan Isbee of Stifel.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","The portfolio continues to perform very well, but there's clearly a lot of questions swirling around shopper traffic, shopper habits, et cetera. Could you maybe comment on what you're seeing? Are we seeing a sea change in retail as characterized by Starbucks last week? And what do you think this impact could have on your business over the next few years?","David E. Simon","Well, look, we've been doing this for quite some time. And I think we have to put the fourth quarter sales into perspective. First of all, and these are just some thoughts off the top of my head, we are absolutely believers that our business will continue to grow. But let me just talk about the fourth quarter because I do think we were at the point of a little bit of overreaction. Clearly, in '13, there was a move toward global goods, which happens in certain cycles. And as the second half of the year came about, I do think the consumer was relatively cautious. We had a short season. There was, obviously, lots of weather issues for certain parts of the country. And I don't think what's put in perspective, which I listened to the pundits on TV and elsewhere, not just on TV but elsewhere, but between the confusion of ObamaCare and taxes did raise pretty materially for the consumer, you have what I'll call a -- I don't know if it was a perfect storm, but you have a lot of this stuff all come together or that basically resulted in the consumer being very cautious. The pundits, I've heard this stuff about malls in the Internet, obviously, having the right retailers, the right customer service, the right look and feel of the properties will continue to hold our own in that space without question.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you're not seeing anything at the ground level that indicates shopper traffic is roughly 50% over the last 3 years or anything like that?","David E. Simon","50%?","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Well, that's what ShopperTrak says.","David E. Simon","Well, let me talk about -- I'm not going to name names. But we don't use them, and we don't know how reliable a lot of those traffic numbers are. And we'll leave it at that. The answer is, all I can tell you, Nate, is look at our results. That's all I can tell you is look at our results. I think you know at this point, doing this for 20 years and continuing to beat everybody's expectations about the profitability of what this company can't produce, I would suggest to you that things are not what others say they are. And I'll leave it at that.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. I mean, in the -- over the last few years, you have discussed various initiatives of helping and embracing online and developing something at the Simon level. Any update on that?","David E. Simon","Well it would take 30 minutes on this call, but we're happy to go through that in great detail. We have a significant amount of initiatives that we're embarking upon to improve the consumer experience, whether pre-mall or during mall visit. And we are absolutely embracing technology and how it can -- how it could be used effectively to make the consumer more satisfied during their visit or as they come to the mall. The retailers feel the absolute same way. And there's probably 20-plus things that are ongoing in this company, individually, collectively with the mall industry, as well as in conjunction with the retailers that we're working on. But it's -- there are so many that I can't do it at this call, but we're happy to share those as they get rolled out.","Operator","And your next question comes from Josh Patinkin of BMO Capital Markets.","Josh Patinkin","I'm trying to get a better sense of what the opportunity to consolidate McArthurGlen managed funds look like. So it's obviously not programmatic, but can you give us a general sense for the total size of the enterprise and what could come up in the next few years?","David E. Simon","Yes, they're a leader in that industry. I think we'll have opportunities to grow that business through new development and extensions of existing assets, as well as acquisitions of assets that either they manage and own a small piece of and\/or others that do. But it's really -- I'm not in the position to give you a specific number. But as you know, we've taken our platforms over the years and run them significantly. It reminds me of the outlet business when we entered into it in 2004. We have roughly grown. We have -- if I could put the numbers correctly, we have increased the cash flow of that business roughly 4x. And needless to say, you take the 4x plus the reduction in cap rate, and you'd see the value created there. I think it's harder to develop in Asia, but a great team, good people and we'll just take it a step at a time.","Josh Patinkin","Okay. And then more globally on outlets, you built a lot of centers last decade. And so is there a big sea change in the leasing conversation as you approach tenure rollovers? And do you think higher occupancy cost will become more acceptable to merchants in that business?","David E. Simon","I'll turn it to Rick to [indiscernible].","Richard S. Sokolov","Absolutely, we are seeing an ability to increase our rents. We have significant demand in the outlet sector. If you listen to the retailers, there are many retailers that are entering the sector for the first time as an additional prong and bare growth strategy. And where you have a lot of demand you're able to drive rates, our properties are very productive. We're making them better. And that does give us pricing power.","Operator","And your next question comes from Christy McElroy of Citi.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I wanted to go back to Nate's question and ask it a little in a different way, more from a leasing perspective. As we sort of hear more from retailers about the integration of their bricks-and-mortar business with their e-commerce business, so I'm thinking about the longer-term omni-channel initiatives. I'm wondering if you could give us some perspective on how the changes are impacting sort of the leasing cost and how you would expect it to evolve over time? So first, how the retailers are thinking about occupancy costs. You addressed it a little bit in terms of the outlet, but I'm thinking about the [indiscernible] either -- just thinking about the sales within the 4 walls of the store versus sort of the value of that locations, the overall.","David E. Simon","I think the good news for us, as mall owners, is I expect them to drive traffic and distribute through their store. So what it means, I believe, over time is that, that store location will become more valuable because instead of building a bunch of distribution centers or trying to figure out how to get various online purchases to the consumer, the most effective and perhaps cost-effective way for them to do it is by using their existing store. Now that means that they're going to have to have a better handle on store and create algorithms in terms of what can be distributed out to the store or not. But I think what it's going to ultimately mean is that they're going to drive purchase -- drive sales through those stores, which, as far as we're concerned and what's in our leases and we'll continue to be, is those sales will be generated from that store. So I don't -- now if they have the store that's losing money, they're not going to keep it open, but that's been that way for 30 years, 40 years. So -- but that's what I anticipate.","Stephen E. Sterrett","The only other thing I would add and I think it's a very significant advantage to our retailers and in David and my discussions with them, they are very focused on it. It's the ability to fulfill their orders online out of their stores and reorient it to whatever store has the appropriate inventory, that's going to have, in their opinion, significant margin enhancement possibility because they won't be able to have less markdowns by selling at full price goods that might otherwise have to be discounted in various locations. And they're all spending a great deal of time getting that backbone in place to effectuate that.","David E. Simon","The one thing that people have questioned is whether they're going turn these stores into showrooms. And the fact of the matter is, I talked to a very prominent retailer CEO about this issue. They lose sales when they do that, okay? So -- especially when it becomes apparel. So I don't believe that if they want -- if this retailer continues to have an enviable bricks-and-mortar strategy that they are going to get in a point where it's a showroom because people want to -- continue to want to make sure that the size looks right on all that other stuff, okay?","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So as it becomes more of a supply-demand of that location issue versus an occupancy cost when negotiating the rent, and how do you attribute as they further integrate their business with e-commerce, how do you attribute the specific sales of that store when reporting up to you?","David E. Simon","It's easy. They'd have to keep track of it. That's simple, if it goes through their POS, and it's going to have to if the stores \u2013- that the inventories in the store. That's a simple exercise. We have audit -- yes, we have audit rights, okay?","Unknown Analyst","David, I have one quick question just in terms of -- and I recognize the deal with the problems[ph] are it's a private transaction. So there certainly was a time where they didn't want to take your stock pretty forcefully. So I'm just curious how that transaction came about and what your plans are now that you're on those parcels of land in terms of the timing of potentially doing something on that site?","David E. Simon","Look, we -- even though we obviously have had issues over the years with Taubman, we've always had what I call a good professional relationship, certainly, as the dust is settled from several years ago. So again, I can't really comment on that other than -- let me talk about the property. We're very excited about it. We are very interested in working with the town of Oyster Bay and our partner, Castagna Realty. We're going to work with the residents, come up with a development plan. Also, at the property that we own with Castagna Realty, together, we think there is an absolute way to create a win-win for the community and for us and our partner. And it's great real estate. So how we got there is really not important. I'm convinced that's in the best interest of our shareholders, and I'm convinced that Taubman feels the same way. So that actually can happen where you can have a win-win for both companies.","Operator","And your next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just two questions here. The first is the other big story, apart from the Internet this past season, was the Penney closure. And if you look at the 33 stores they closed, you could say, okay, they went through the whole thing and they could only find 33 stores. And Sears, for the all the years they've talking of rationalizing, the Sears are still open. So should we read this as the various department stores have done these big reviews and these are all the stores that they've closed or your sense is this the start of a wave and over the next several years we're going to see a lot more of these big-type announcements?","David E. Simon","Well, I mean, I think it's a function of what the retailer ultimately is able to do. But the store closures for us is a kind of a normal standard operating procedure that we deal with. We've had retailers clearly -- not necessarily the scale of a couple of that you mentioned -- but we've had retailers coming out of business for years. And so, again, yes, it does add to the workload but we find a way to get the job done. And I think you're right though, Alex, is that they went through the portfolio, generally. And what we understand, which I'm not sure is for us to say, but we understand that, that was the list that was actually generating negative cash flow. So I think you're right in the sense of that a number of these retailers continue to have profitability and even in stores that are not as overly productive because for whatever reason. So, as an example, and I don't know maybe we'll have this, but people talked about small malls, B-malls, the Internet. But our comp, in the fourth quarter of our comp, NOI increased for the SpinCo malls was 4%. So that speaks to the ability to continue to move the needle forward despite all the noise. Now, look, the fourth quarter sales, I gave you that. I do think a lot happen all on the fourth quarter. But the consumer, between the uncertainty of ObamaCare, the increase in taxes, wage growth continues to be anemic, they spend on durable goods, they slowed down in the third and fourth quarter across-the-board. I mean, whether it was the high-end, the middle-end or the lower-end consumer. And that happens. Don't panic. We'll deal with that. So, at the end of today, I can't speak for the future of those two that you mentioned, in terms of store closing, but what we understand is that that's the analysis that led to the 33. But I'm not 100% certain on that, okay?","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then the second question is regarding SpinCo. I mean Simon is going to be the platform for the initial, I believe, 2 years. Is Simon Brand Ventures, the income that's generated from that, is that something that SpinCo will have access to beyond that or is the understanding that SpinCo is going to sort of have to try and replicate that NOI stream after the -- if, in fact, it ends the relationship with Simon as the supporting mall platform?","David E. Simon","Well, all of those revenues are at the property level. So they'll continue. Now, ultimately, if they -- remember, just to give you SpinCo, the strip center business will be in SpinCo. SPG will do some back office activity for the strip center business. SPG will act as third-party property manager for SpinCo malls. And all of that revenue that, that group generates goes to the property. So, ultimately, will be the decision for that team to decide whether or not they want to continue after the 2-year period, to continue to use SPG as a property manager. But there's no reason in my mind that they couldn't, if they chose not to do that -- that will be up to the team and the Board there -- that they could replicate the vast majority of that income.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","David, maybe I think you should name SpinCo SteRRETT in honor of Steve's service to you.","Stephen E. Sterrett","That rolls right off the tongue.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","It does, it does. Actually, did I hear you...","David E. Simon","Honestly, I probably shouldn't say this publicly. But I'll go ahead, sometimes I get into that box. But the hardest thing about SpinCo is coming up with the appropriate name.","Stephen E. Sterrett","Right. Yes, so if you have any suggestions please send them our way.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I don't have any good ones. But, actually, did I hear you correctly? That you said NOI growth at SpinCo was 4% in Q4? And maybe are you be able to share other operating metrics of leasing spreads and occupancy as well?","David E. Simon","Yes, that'll be in the final filing. But the fourth quarter -- we thought you might ask that so we had that number for the fourth quarter. But that kind of stuff will all be in the filing.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And I guess maybe doubling on Alex's question about the Penney's and Sears closures risk. When you look at those two situations, I mean, I think people had kind of ultimately handicapped or call it ultimate exposure. Do you guys have the sense of what percentage of those stores that you have, might not be cost-effectively retenantive?","David E. Simon","I didn't catch the last part.","Richard S. Sokolov","What percentage of the stores we think may not be cost-effectively retenantive if they close. I would tell you that we're spending a considerable amount of time. And as we've said before on these calls, we have our plans in place, we have identified replacement tenants. For example, we have one tenant already lined up to occupy one of the Penney closures, yet this year, at a positive economic impact on that property and a positive sales impact. So we are as prepared as one can be to take advantage of any opportunities that present themselves through the activities of the department stores when they decide they don't want to do it. Over the years we've dealt with over 80 of these things. So, as David said, this is not new to us. We'll just keep doing what we've been doing at historically.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And maybe I can stick with you Rick, on -- sort of following up on Christie's earlier question. Just, historically, retailers kind of wanted the landlord to stay out of their way, as it relates to retail sales. Are you seeing retailers become more receptive to working with their landlord around their e-commerce and retail sales platform? I mean is that part of the leasing discussion or even specifically addressed in the lease or that's sort of a separate conversation, sort of an add-on, if you will?","Richard S. Sokolov","Well, two parts to that. In our lease negotiations, we're incredibly mindful of the role that our stores play in the distribution of their goods, whether online or store-based. And, frankly, if that store is any part of the distribution channel for that sale, it's going to count in our sales. The retailers understand that, and the retailers are emphasizing the convenience and location of their stores as a significant advantage in their ability to maximize their contacts with the customers and their sales. So they very much view their stores as an integral part of their business going forward and they are working with us in a cooperative way to try and maximize.","David E. Simon","Well, I will just say, Jeff, simply, that we have both mobile and desktop, et cetera. We have a system called Retailer Showcase that basically presents offers from the retailers to our consumers. They can get it in mall, they can go on our website or whatever. We do that. I think the last number that I saw, probably 50,000 offers over the year that we present to our consumers. We get those offer -- we don't make them up, we get them from that retailers. So, absolutely, there is a significant amount of coordination, as you would expect, between us and the retailer, to improve and enhance their business. I believe we're just at the scratching of that surface. That is part of our job, to facilitate more productivity for the retailers of stores, and at the same time, trying to do that and increase rent. I mean, it's not the easiest thing. But they know that we want them to be very productive. We work hand-in-hand with them. And I think technology, generally, will be a wonderful opportunity to make that relationship easier to execute.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just one last question. I'm curious, internally, when you guys are handicapping -- I'll call it exposure to anchor closures -- what are the metrics that you guys look at internally? Is it four-wall profit, is it sort of store format or market size or approximated to their distribution centers? I mean is there, I guess, a better methodology than maybe just sort of overall sales productivity that you find in forecasting?","David E. Simon","Well, sure, because you don't know how many -- how they cover -- historically, the department stores advertised in a market. They allocate that advertising a certain way. So you've got to have a handle on that. But again, on a specific store, we're going to have a sense as to where that is, based upon lots of discussions over the last few years. Corporately, and where they're headed, we have some insights but it's no different than people that has follow them and covered them. I mean, we're not necessarily privy to all that's going on in what they're doing. I mean we have, obviously, good relationships with our major anchors. But we're not privy to anything that's probably not common knowledge. But we have the several years and years of dealing with them, how they feel about certain stores.","Operator","And your next question will comes from Steve Sakwa of ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions, David and Rick. As you kind of look at the rent spreads, those dramatically improved over the course of 2013. And as you look at the rollover for the next, really 3 years, your ending base rents are just a shade under $40. And when you add in the CAM, you're probably close to that $53. So, it would seem that you're releasing spreads ought to continue to accelerate. Is there anything that would, outside of a sales decline, which it doesn't seem to be happening, is there anything that suggest that leasing spreads wouldn't continue to tick higher from here?","Richard S. Sokolov","We certainly anticipate that we'll be able to continue to grow our rents as we have historically. The other thing I would tell you is that we're spending a lot of money making these properties better. And so, when you look at a very gross sales number, that's made up of a whole lot of individual stores. And as we renovate our properties, bring in better tenant, our tenants, we believe, are more productive in our properties, and that gives us some incremental ability to drive rent. So we don't envision that slowing down.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and maybe sticking with you, Rick. Just kind of on the tenants and how you're thinking about repositioning the properties. I don't know if you have a specific number. But as you look at the mix of tenants in the mall today, what percentage is apparel and what percentage do you think that'll be 3 years from now?","Richard S. Sokolov","At this point, I think our apparel percentage is going to remain fairly stable. Now, the tenants that make up that apparel percentage could change dramatically. We have some tenants that are reducing the size of their stores, and we have entrants coming in like Czar, H&M, UNIQLO, that are in slightly bigger formats. But there's not going to be a sense of a significant decline in the amount of space allocated to apparel. We are allocating space differently. Look, last year, we opened 36 restaurants across the portfolio. That's a major focus, to be able to extend their stay in our property, give the consumers a wider range of dining alternatives and just make the properties more experiential, which is obviously a focus of our retailers and us. So, the mix may change, but I think apparel is going to stay fairly stable, while the components may change.","David E. Simon","I probably shouldn't say this, but it's interesting, as I travel the world and understand -- probably not as much as I should do -- but the occupancy cost that we have in the U.S. is relatively benign compared to when you see it elsewhere in the world. So it's an interesting thing for us, to pause to think about what the opportunities to continue to grow that rent are. But we've got to be absolutely sensitive to the retailer and making sure they profit in their environment as well. So, our occupancy cost, generally, in comparison to kind of where the other shopping centers, owners have in the world, they're relatively below at least what those would indicate the rents are. So we'll see how that evolves over time.","Richard S. Sokolov","And they have been relatively stable for the last 3 years even though we've been able to drive our rents.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Well, let me ask, I guess, one last question for maybe the newest member of the senior stores, Steve. Hopefully, you'll get your qualifying card here and get something new going. I went to the balance sheet and kind of debt refinancing. So, obviously it's been very favorable. Just how are you thinking about kind of the balance of debt maturing this year and into '15, and kind of what's your thought in terms of kind laddering and kind of where you want to be on the debt curve?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Well, it's Steve, it's pretty well laddered already. As you know, as part of the SpinCo announcement, we did state that we expect to raise $1 billion of debt through SpinCo, with those proceeds coming to Simon before the effective date. So if you couple that with our bond yield in January, that's the majority of our capital raise, in terms of dealing with bond expirations. We also unencumbered Sawgrass Mills as part of the use of those proceeds. So, we're in really good shape for '14. We've accomplished most of the capital plan. And in '15, we're ordinary course of business, we have bonds coming due every year. You should expect us to be a regular issuer in that market. But obviously the secured debt market is also important to us as well, so you'll see us in both.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Steve, thanks for all your help over the years. Given just some of the clouds around fourth quarter consumer activity in the malls. I know you guys don't typically do this, but would you be able to provide a pure fourth quarter 2013 over fourth quarter 2012 tenant sales trend?","David E. Simon","Yes. It was flat.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And just a follow-up. I know you've mentioned the SpinCo same-store NOI, but from a tenant sales perspective, how does that look like when you split out the outlets, A malls and B malls? It doesn't have to be the fourth quarter, but maybe the year-over-year, the total trailing 12 months.","David E. Simon","I'm sorry, I didn't really understand the question, Ki Bin.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the trend in your tenant sales of 2.5% year-over-year, trailing 12 months, how does that look like, like if you had to stratify it between outlets, A malls and B malls?","David E. Simon","Well, I mean, we shared some of that with you when we announced SpinCo. That gives you a general direction for that answer. And as you'll see, once SpinCo is done and effective, you'll have the SpinCo data and you'll have the SPG data. So that'll all be there. That gives you a sense of direction where it is.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and just last point. Should we expect negative sales at all for SpinCo in the fourth quarter?","David E. Simon","Yes. I mean, we gave you that at -- whenever it was. December, we showed you that.","Stephen E. Sterrett","Several years of history.","David E. Simon","Yes. I can't can remember the exact number. But it's right there, it's public document. I assume it's on our Investor website. It's all there.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just want to go back to the retail side here for a second. A lot of talk about the sales trends, but obviously profitability is very important. And just given the number of pre-announcements that we've heard this season, I'm just curious if you think we should be expecting a higher level of seasonal occupancy decline in the first quarter here than we've seen over maybe the last few years, where perhaps the plans were a little bit more conservative.","David E. Simon","We don't see that at this moment. Things change over the year. But we don't see that necessarily. Obviously we have a good handle on that. The only thing we don't have a handle that could change that is bankruptcies. But based upon our existing status of where we are with our discussion with retailers, we don't see that. Obviously, a bankruptcy here or there may be able to impact that on a faster basis.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And going back to the discussion around e-commerce. We hear a lot about Macy's and Nordstrom and companies like that, that are very forward thinking about their strategies. I'm just wondering how you think the smaller retailers that maybe don't have the same scale or infrastructure can evolve in a new environment, to be able to kind of compete with the e-commerce.","David E. Simon","Well, the fact of the matter, and you can see it in technology companies' results, is that it is relatively a lot less expensive to create because of the cloud and the way apps work and so on. It's relatively less expensive to create the combination, become more technology-oriented than it has in the past. Lots of ability to share services in the cloud that you wouldn't otherwise have to invest in. So I think maybe the mom and pop has a harder time. But generally, any retailer that has a kind of a reasonable store base can compete very affectively because the cost of technology is -- you don't need routers, you don't need servers, you don't need a bunch of software guys cranking this stuff out like you used to. The fact is, if we had done MerchantWired today, with different technology, we'd probably be successful. But we overpaid for the hardware. So, I think, as long as they have a reasonable store base, we're going to be able to create the appropriate coordination between their bricks and mortar stores and how they want to deal with online shopping.","Richard S. Sokolov","And frankly there is no retailer that we meet with that is not very focused on doing precisely that. Some of them are further along in their implementation of those strategies, but every one of them is focused on more affectively integrating their online with their stores.","Operator","Your next question comes from Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Just another set of questions. Have you seen retailers expand their footprint in order to better distribute goods than they would be selling online. I'm thinking about, of course, the footprint in the malls.","David E. Simon","It's a good point. What I have seen them do is think about their stores as a point of distribution along as a store. So whether they're now looking at stores just for the sake of having the store and a distribution, I wouldn't' say that thinking is there yet. But clearly, existing stores are being thought as a way to distribute and kind of the e-commerce platform. So I do think that thinking -- and that's a different level for many different retailers, but I actually do think they're thinking about it very seriously.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","So how many such distribution centers, if you will, would a retailer need in a large metro-area?","David E. Simon","Okay, I'm not in a position to say that. But it depends on the retailer.","Richard S. Sokolov","And the funny thing is they're not talking about using drones to ship their goods.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","I'm sure that's going to be an interesting transition. Just getting back on the disposition of 14 non-core assets. Can you give us a little bit more detail in terms of which property tied and cap rates?","David E. Simon","I don't have it in front of me. But a few smaller shopping centers, a couple of outlets. So we'll continue to do that as well.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Were any of those considered to be spun out into SpinCo?","David E. Simon","The answer is none of those were in the SpinCo because we already had contracts. There is a couple of strip centers that may or may not be sold before SpinCo is done. So, if that's the case, we're going to -- ultimately, the portfolio, as we said to you in December, when we announced it, will change a little bit. Part of that will be because of a couple of fails here and there, and a couple of them will be because we may or may not get a consent. But that could still happen.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a final question on the relationship with anchors. So, a couple of weeks ago I think Sears announced that they would be leasing space to Dick sporting goods, King of Prussia. It's obviously, by far, the best mall in the Philly area. When you think about your ability to recapture stores from Sears, and Penney in particular, versus the decision that they may ultimately make to lease to what is effectively a power center tenant into what is, by far the best mall, and particularly in the metro. How are thinking about what is the right price for you to pay to recapture that box? And what can you do to influence their decision on the retailer that will come into their center or into their box?","David E. Simon","Well, I mean, the simple answer is it depends. Each case is different, to be honest with you. So in that case, we cooperated with Sears. Given the location of that store and what our plans were on the future redevelopment, we thought it was a win-win for us. We're happy to have Dick's in there, and it was a good transaction for Sears. In some cases, because of location of stores, we may want to do the development on ourselves -- by ourselves. In some cases, we'll let them do it. And if -- in fact, we may -- in most cases, we have approval rights, so each case is very different. Believe me, we have understanding of each one to a great level. But in that case, we just saw it as a way to be cooperative with Sears, way to help them all, great for the consumer, and as you know, we think Dick's is great. We do a lot of business with them. So in that case, we said, \"Perfect, let's go. We'll help you, we'll cooperate.\"","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","So you didn't try to acquire the box back from Sears?","David E. Simon","No, we did not, and Sears will continue to operate there as well. So it's -- Dick's is taking the upper level, and Sears is going to actually, we understand, kind of create the store, the future, so to speak, in the lower level, so that's great. And we'll continue to work with anchors like that as well. There's lots of little tactical things that are going on with all of our anchors about getting rights to put restaurants in. On some of the frontage of the -- just to bring up an example, in Briarwood, we're putting a couple of restaurants, and we do that all the time, like in front of Macy's. And so all of that stuff is out there to do. In some cases, we facilitate them if they want to do a lease. So the simple goal is, \"Let's make the property better for the consumer,\" and it will take all sorts of different forms. We wouldn't rule out partnering with somebody on a redevelopment of their box if that circumstance made sense for both parties.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I guess, going to the Mills for a second, I was wondering, can you give us a little more color on the 11% comp NOI growth? And was it a handful of assets? Was it broad-based? I mean, what was really driving those numbers?","David E. Simon","Look, they have a -- they're major markets at 16 assets. As you know, the focus on value for them, value-oriented retailers, has been tremendously successful. You've got the outlets at Orange, that conversion from more of an entertainment center to an outlet center has been terrific. Ontario is on fire. Sawgrass, needless to say, is -- continues to be behemoth. Potomac Mills, we brought a couple of restaurants in Opry that's not in the comps.","Stephen E. Sterrett","It's not in the comp, yes.","David E. Simon","Opry has been fantastic.","Stephen E. Sterrett","You know the run hole.","David E. Simon","You can see it on the run hole. So lots of things go there, just a lot of things happening here to make the portfolio -- by the way, we added Macy's at Gurnee Mills as an example, so...","Stephen E. Sterrett","But Mike, this is Steve. It is rent. It's really saying it's higher occupancy, it's growing rents.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm sorry. So it sounds like if we're thinking about '14, '15, you're probably still getting above average growth out of that part of the portfolio?","David E. Simon","I think it will be good. I'm not going to do 10% -- where not going to do is 10.8% for the year. So don't put that in your numbers.","Operator","And your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Steve, also let me add my congratulations. It looks like really you have one year left sort of to finally go shoe shopping before you lose your steady paycheck.","Stephen E. Sterrett","Tayo, if I'm going to go shoe shopping, I'm going to go with you. That's for sure.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Sounds good. Two quick questions. First of all, just to get around commentary, a lot of retailers are saying Christmas was weak. I know David made a couple of comments about what could change your initial outlook for 2014, would be on a potential for more bankruptcies or things of that nature. But I just -- and then for everything you're seen right now, are you seeing kind of on the fringe tenants talking like that about potentially closing shops or things like that just based off the tough holiday season?","David E. Simon","Not really. This is always the general time where you may see a few of these pop-up. But no one -- in fact, there's a few that have been in the edge for a number of years and actually turn their business around even last year. Look, I think the consumer -- I read something yesterday on the plane back from Europe that consumer is still under a pretty decent amount of pressure. Higher taxes, more regulation, uncertainty of ObamaCare, spending on durable goods a little bit in the first half the year, higher rates potentially, I would think, and they took it easy in the third and fourth quarter, as you've seen across the board. So we are still in a tepid recovery. The fascinating thing I read, last year, forget the federal government, in the state and local governments, there were 40,000 new rules and regulations in the state -- in the United States of the America. So that is going to slow the growth of America, 40,000 new regulations throughout this country at a state and local level. That's going to slow us down. So we have a tepid recovery, even though some of the broad-based numbers look better. The fact is it's still a very cautious environment. But we're producing terrific results in that environment. And that's the facts. We produced great results in the Great Recession. We had cash flow that was flat. So despite all of that, that noise out there, we can only do what we're capable of doing. We can't control the outcome of an anchor business plan or not. We can just be ready to go to work if, in fact, these things are thrown in our way.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then the second thing is we also heard about Matt Lentz had also kind of left the company. Just wondering if that role was -- there's going to be a replacement for him or if there's going to be any changes around the CIO position.","David E. Simon","The answer is we brought someone in to -- help the internationally. We're -- Matt was helping Stanley Shashoua who has been terrific. Stanley is great, speaks 5 languages, maybe 6, unlike the team here who can actually speak English, but he's great and he's helping me. And in the sense, he really took Matt's role on our International business.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got it. Could you talk -- a little bit more about just Stanley's overall background and what he's kind of done in the past?","David E. Simon","He worked for both real estate and investment banking companies. So he's been -- he's a young guy compared to me probably, but he's been -- he's got great experience. And he was instrumental with the McArthurGlen deal. I had to put him on that deal because of the complexity, and he really helped us get there with another kind of great guy here who actually came from the Mills, but moved to Minneapolis when did that deal. Brian McDade -- the 2 of them, grabbed that -- along with our General Counsel, grabbed that deal and took it to the finish line. And so the good thing about the -- we have kind of the what I call younger folks that are really taking a lot more responsibility in the organization and doing a great job.","Operator","And your next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions on SpinCo. So several of the SpinCo properties are encumbered with CMBS debt that has near-term maturities, West Ridge Mall in Topeka, Chesapeake Square in Chesapeake, Virginia, and...","David E. Simon","Yes. Those are all being refinanced.","Stephen E. Sterrett","As we speak.","David E. Simon","As we speak.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay.","David E. Simon","So that is your question?","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Well, I was getting to it, right? So there's 4 or 5 of that list with near-term debt maturities. So should we assume that all 5 are in that list of being refinanced or the candidates for dispositions?","David E. Simon","No, they're all going to be refinanced absent -- one may not be -- one is further out there. I don't know, I don't -- yes, but they'll be refinanced.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And you've quietly gone about proving your U.S. portfolio in recent years. I'm just trying to get a sense how to process slows down post SpinCo. How do you think about your U.S. portfolio or disposition strategy after the spinoff of SpinCo?","David E. Simon","Well, for SPG, we'll continue to call properties like we have for year-after-year. SpinCo, I think, again, I'm not going to be in charge there. But I think I would expect SpinCo to sell a couple assets here and there. And I think it's -- that's business as usual. I mean, we'll always continue to sell assets at both companies. I can't necessarily -- as a Director, I'll have certainly my point of view on capital allocation and reallocation. But I would expect both companies to continue to sell assets like we have in the past.","Operator","And your next question comes from Dan Oppenheim with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering -- I guess, there's been enough questions about some seasonal trends here, with normally season closings in the first quarter. I guess, in the other side of that, at over 96% occupancy here, you're likely to have some sort of backlog in terms of retailers wanting to get in. I just wonder if you can comment a bit in terms of conversations with retailers looking ahead in terms of Del Amo as that opens up next year and just others, just how you think about that in terms of demand, just in terms of -- just if there are to be any vacancies in terms of sort of backfilling or -- adding there.","Richard S. Sokolov","We still have very strong demand. And in fact, the response to Del Amo has been terrific. We are going to be able to move that up significantly in price point and with the quality retailers. And retailers still want to expand. Retailers still want to have great real estate that will help their brand and we're seeing no real slowdown in that conversation. And in fact, and we've said this in other calls, a great amount of the time that David and I spend are basically dealing with retailers that we cannot accommodate in the size they want or in the space they want at our property. So demand remains high.","Stephen E. Sterrett","Dan, this is Steve. I'll just add one point. We tend not to get into the 27 different variables that go into our forecast for the year, but I will say that our plan in 2014 is that occupancy year-over-year will be up at the end of '14.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Yang of Evercore.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","David, you've talked in the past about the disconnect between sales and NOI that for one, you can replace the underperforming tenants. So I was just hoping -- I mean, Steve made the comment about occupancy being up in '14. Would you guys consider at all just disclosing what the same-store NOI growth is as implied in your '14 guidance because it just seems like that could help alleviate some of the concerns surrounding core growth in light of volume sales, pressured customer?","David E. Simon","Yes. Let me interrupt you there. We did, actually.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Oh, did you?","David E. Simon","I must have bored you by the time I got to that. Our -- that's quite all right. I understand that our opening comments may, in fact, bore some. We are projecting, for '14, to have comp NOI up 4% or above. So I -- if that answers your question -- 4%.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. Sorry I missed that, and...","David E. Simon","That's all right. I am not offended in any stretch of imagination.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Maybe I missed this one also. Did you disclose the cap rate for the Arizona Mills transaction?","David E. Simon","We -- in fact, we said we would not, and we did do -- we did say that earlier. That's okay.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And maybe a final question, maybe going back to Cedrik's comments on Sears. Do you think that the anchor subleasing dynamic will accelerate in the coming year? Is that also -- is this a model that only works at the A malls, or do you think we could see this type of activity ramp up at the B malls?","Richard S. Sokolov","I think that there is going to be a concerted effort by Sears. They've done it historically over the last few years, and they're continuing to be focused on it to try and get their stores to where they are most efficient. That doesn't -- and I think that is frankly not specifically limited to any particular quality spectrum of their stores. And as David said, where we think it's in our best interest, we'll cooperate. If we think it is not in our best interest or the malls' best interest or the consumers' best interest, we'll try and influence a different direction on Sears' part. But I don't think their efforts are being focused on any particular quality type.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And are you in current negotiations to do this in any other of your malls with Sears or maybe even at Penney's currently?","Richard S. Sokolov","We're having a constant dialogue with both companies about all the real estate. And frankly, as David said earlier, we hopefully -- that provides a lot of insights into what they're thinking strategically with respect to the stores, and we're trying to work with them to come up with positive outcomes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just given Steve's retirement date, I'm wondering if that's a good indicator -- when do you think the debt markets are going to get tougher?","Stephen E. Sterrett","I don't know. I see the tenure coming back down. So Craig, I will say that the debt markets are in really good shape right now for us. Now I always caution that by -- I think about the little commercials. Your results may not be the same, but for us, the bond market is wide open, the mortgage market is very good, the bank market is wide open. So -- and having already put away now quite a bit of our 2014 maturities, we can start to tackle the '15 stuff and feel good about the opportunity to continue to roll down our weighted average borrowing cost while increasing our duration. I think it is interesting in a debt portfolio that's $28 billion, $29 billion. We've lowered our borrowing costs 23 basis points in each of the last 2 years, and that's a pretty meaningful contribution to profitability.","David E. Simon","With no reliance on closures, yes.","Stephen E. Sterrett","Yes, it was almost no floating rate [ph] here to date.","David E. Simon","I mean, that's the important part. I mean, we -- if we want to reduce our earnings growth, we would have 20%, 30% of floating rate debt. We basically have virtually 0.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I guess, one other thought on the cost of occupancy, I know that's been touched on. But 11.5% still seems low, even when it -- considering it's Premium Outlets combined with malls. Where do you think -- and I realize it's a moving target, but where do you think that could normalize out your cost of occupancy? Or do you think it's going to remain sort of in the mid-11s?","David E. Simon","Well, this is the $64,000 question. Like I said earlier, I mean, it is interesting to me that occupancy costs outside of the U.S. are much, much higher and -- so answer is I don't know other than it does give us some very good feeling that we still have a way to continue to grow our NOI, because essentially, the biggest opportunity we have is to -- marketing our leases to market and being able to replace underperforming retailers with better ones. Besides the -- obviously, and I know, Craig, you've been out seeing a bunch of properties, and I appreciate that, that you have because you get a good sense of what's going on here, which I do think, because of the size of the company, sometimes people lose focus. But all that's going on -- but that's going to drive our business. That -- but I can't put a number on it and -- but -- and we're here to create the right partnership with our retailers because we believe in repeat business with them. But this is confidence that we still have the ability to execute even with a tepid consumer comp NOI growth.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. I would just say, in the properties I visited, I've been very impressed, and you sort of forget sometimes that there really is a skill to managing these assets. And some of the things I've seen in the last couple of weeks have been very impressive.","David E. Simon","Yes. Look, I mean, you -- I know you went to Del Amo, right? And I'm sure you didn't really believe we were redoing Del Amo. I know you've been asking about this for -- I'm sure you asked the Mills pre-acquisition for years. And then I know, once we bought the Mills, it took us a few years and one Great Recession to overcome, but it's going to be a great, great mall.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","No, I think what you're doing and just bringing in Nordstrom's could be a real game changer because there's clearly an unserved audience there.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jeff Spector of Bank of America.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a follow-up to Craig's question. I guess, when you're sitting down with tenants and negotiating new leases, I mean, is there a target occupancy cost?","Richard S. Sokolov","The answer is that we're very focused on the maximizing of rents and it's less about a target occupancy cost because it takes into account the size of the space, the use of the tenant, the quality of the mall, where is the space located in the mall, what's the sales projection for that tenant. And all of that goes into setting the rate that we think is appropriate. And believe me, the process is granular and we spend a great deal of time on the nickels, making sure that we try and get it right. But we don't go into any given spacing, we want 12.5% of sales from this space and 18% from this space. All those factors go into how we set the rent.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That helps. And then, Rick, I guess I know there's been a lot of discussion on JCPenney and Sears. But just one thing I was thinking about when I was going through this up on anchor big box openings, it is interesting when you look at the list compared to what, say, years ago when we saw a number of department stores closings. I mean, do you feel better today there's more options? I mean, I really haven't heard yet great evidence if somebody's anchors are definitely a benefit to the mall, but I would imagine, it just seems like a pretty good list, including -- like I noticed Wegmans at Montgomery Mall.","Richard S. Sokolov","Yes. Well, look, we have a whole dedicated team and frankly, David and I have been pushing all of our people to go out and kept as broad a net as possible, so we have as many options identified as possible to make things work. And frankly, Wegmans at Montgomery Mall has been terrific, Fairway Market at Nanuet has been great, Fresh Market at The Falls, but that's just one category. David mentioned Dick's earlier, Arhaus Furniture. We just have a lot of different users that, as we've said earlier, we've gone through our portfolio and have these users identified, so that if an opportunity presents itself with an anchor box, we can move efficiently and quickly and effectively to get it filled.","David E. Simon","Yes. And the difference, Jeff, also is that when we have a significant turmoil in the department store business, say in the late 80s, early 90s, I mean, there's been episodes of -- a lot of turnover. There was also a lot of new stuff that was being brought to the market. In today's market, you essentially have no new -- I mean, of a significant quantity, no new development, whether it's strip centers and malls, they have a little bit in the Outlet business as we all know, but you have no new product coming on the market. And it's -- yes, I know there are a few, but in the real sense of stuff. So -- and you also have obsolescence occurring, which is -- by the way, we -- they've been telling folks for several years that we expect an obsolescence. When you put together the inventories tight and sure, there'll be some headaches associated with that, but that's in a -- that's a better spot to be in if, in fact, there is significant anchor turmoil than say, in the early 90s and a couple other, the episodes that Rick and I have had to deal with.","Richard S. Sokolov","Then the last thing I'll say on that is that frankly, success breeds success. So once we're able to get one of these new anchors in our properties, they open the store, what invariably we have found is they've been more successful than they thought they'd be, and that makes the next conversation for the next opportunity much more easy to have and finalize.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Thanks. And then I just want to clarify, I know, at the beginning of the call, David you're talking about traffic counts, I think it's important to clarify -- I think you used the word -- you don't participate with the company mentioned. When you say that, are you saying, just to confirm, Simon does not provide data to these companies? Is that correct?","David E. Simon","They are -- they -- yes, they -- first of all, we don't use them. We rely primarily on parking counts. We do not use them. I think their -- I'm not sure about their sample base. You'll have to ask them. I think it's narrow. And I don't -- the retailers that use them, I think, it's a small subset. But I mean, look, there are lots of people that make pronouncements and tell you this, tell you that. All we can do is just report quarter-after-quarter what the results of our business produce.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then my last question, I know you may not be able to answer it, but into these things with [ph] Calbman, I guess, did anything -- was there any discussions on the 2 different St. Louis Outlet Centers?","David E. Simon","I think, Jeff, everything I've told you about our deal has been disclosed.","Operator","And your next question comes from Nathan Isbee of Stifel.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, just a quick follow-up, a technical question. You mentioned that the online sales fulfilled at your malls will count towards sales. On the flip side, if somebody buys 6 pairs of shoes online and returns 5 of them at your malls, is that a net deduction to sales?","David E. Simon","The answer is no because it didn't occur at the POS.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So even if they returned it in your mall, it would not?","David E. Simon","Correct.","Richard S. Sokolov","Correct.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to now turn the call back over to Mr. Simon for closing remarks.","David E. Simon","Okay. Thank you. Sorry, the call dragged on that long. Steve has been a great part of the group. We've got another year to torment him. So I'm sure you'll see him around, and we'll make sure that we'll want to go the extra torment for the next year. So anyway, thank you. Have a good one.","Operator","Thank you.

Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.

This package is available on the Simon website in the Investors section.","Participating in today's call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.","David E. Simon","Good morning. Our results for the quarter were very strong. FFO was $2.29 per share, up 19.9% from the fourth quarter of 2011. Our FFO exceeded the first call consensus once again, this time by $0.12 per share.","For our Malls and Premium Outlets, tenant sales were up 6.6% to $568 per square foot, occupancy was up 70 basis points to 95.3%, base minimum rent per square foot increased by 3.4%, and our releasing spread was a positive 10.8% or $5.21 per square foot.","For the year, our 2012 FFO was $2,885,000,000, an increase of $446 million from 2011. Growth in FFO per share was an exceptional 15.8% to $7.98 per share, and we did achieve such growth through a number of ways: First of all, our comp property NOI growth in our Mall and Premium Outlet platform was 4.8% per year. We completed several acquisitions in 2012 which were done throughout the year, so we'll see more of their accretion into 2013 and beyond, but those include Mills, Kl\u00e9pierre, our investments, Silver Sands, Grand Prairie, Livermore.","We also successfully reopened Opry Mills in Nashville, Tennessee. And we opened a new upscale premium outlet center in Merrimack, New Hampshire, and our Texas City, Texas, deal with our partner in -- with Steve's Hangar.","Now our significant redevelopment pipeline is also bearing fruit. Again, not much benefit in '12 for these things, but we expect to see additional earnings accretion for '13, '14. But they include King of Prussia, Fashion Mall at Keystone, Pheasant Lane, Ontario Mills, Sawgrass Mills and Southridge Mall, again investments made throughout '12 and opening at the end of '12.","We continue to demonstrate our balance sheet leadership. In December, we did a bond offering of $500 million of 10-year notes at 2.75% interest rate and $750 million of 5-year notes at 1.5%, the lowest coupons ever printed by a REIT. 2012, we issued a total of $3 billion in senior unsecured notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.81% and a weighted average term of 11.6 years.","Now we also were very active in the secured debt markets. We closed or locked rates on 30 new mortgages totaling $3.7 billion, of which our share is $2.3 billion. The average interest rate on those loans is 3.88% with a weighted average term of 8 years.","Let me turn to the dividend. Common stock dividend increased 17.1% in 2002 -- 2012 to a total of $4.10 per share for the year as compared to $3.50 paid in 2011. This morning, we announced the 6th consecutive quarterly increase in our dividend from $1.10 to $1.15 per share.","Our stockholder -- total stockholder return in '12 was 26%. We've outperformed the RMS and the S&P for the 11th time in the past 12 years. Our compound annual return for the last decade was 21.4%, and since our IPO in December of 1993 was 17.2%.","Transactions in December in the fourth quarter, we created a venture with CalPERS and Miller Capital Advisory to jointly own the shops in Mission Viejo and the Woodfield Mall, 2 of the best 100 malls in the U.S. Part of the transaction, as you know, we owned 100% of Mission and CalPERS own 100% of Woodfield. We now own 51% of Mission and 50% of Woodfield, and we lease and manage both assets. We have a very strong relationship with CalPERS and Miller, and we're excited to partner with them in Woodfield, where we think we'll have a good ability to increase that cash flow.","Now let me talk about the Paragon deal. We completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in these 2 newly developed centers. These centers have been re-branded as Livermore Premium Outlets and Grand Prairie Premium Outlets. They serve the Greater San Francisco and Dallas-Fort Worth areas, respectively. Both are 100% leased. Traffic and sales continue to meet or exceed expectations and with each center creating an excellent reputation in their respective trade areas.","Now our new development -- redevelopment pipeline continues to move forward aggressively. We invested nearly $900 million in projects during 2012 and expect our share of capital spend in 2013 to be over $1 billion. We have 5 Premium Outlets under construction, all scheduled to open in 2012: 2 are  in the U.S., Chandler, Arizona, a suburb of Phoenix, and Chesterfield, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis; one in Japan; one in Canada, which is a suburb of Toronto; and our fifth is in Busan, Korea, which will be our third outlet center in Korea.","We plan to start construction in the second quarter of the new upscale outlet center in Montr\u00e9al. This will be our second Premium Outlet Center in Canada. It will comprise approximately 390,000 square feet and is expected to open third quarter of '14. And construction is also under way at 24 redevelopment expansion projects throughout our U.S. portfolio and the 2 Premium Outlets in Asia. All will open in 2013 and '14. Several are very significant in size and scope, including expansions at Seattle Premium Outlets, Walt Whitman Shops, Sawgrass Mills and the redevelopment of an -- former enclosed mall into an open-air center at The Shops in Nanuet in Nyack, New York,","Kl\u00e9pierre reported last Thursday. Total rents for the year were up 4% on a current basis and 2.3% on a like-for-like basis. In 2012, they completed asset sales totaling EUR 700 million, reduced their LTV by 200 basis points, continue to perform ahead of our expert -- expectations as we continue to refine the strategy for the company.","In conclusion, I am and we are very pleased with our 2012 accomplishments and results. We reported record FFO per share of $7.98 per share. That is $0.71 higher than consensus at the beginning of 2012; $0.73 higher than the midpoint of our initial guidance range; $1.53, or 23.7%, than our high -- than our rate -- than our pre-Great Recession high FFO reported in 2008 of $6.45.","We paid a record dividends of $4.10 per share. And with our recent increase in dividend this quarter, we're on track to pay at least $4.60 per share in '13. And this is $1 higher or 27.8% higher than the dividends paid in 2008 at the -- at our great -- at the Great Recession high. We look forward to another strong year in '13. And based upon our core business, FFO guidance for 2013 is in a range of $8.40 to $8.50 per share. The midpoint of this range is $2 higher than our record FFO per share prior to the Great Recession, or roughly 31% increase.","With that, operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of UBS.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm on the line with Ross as well. I was wondering if you could comment on the changing importance of outlets for retailers and then the differences in retailers' profitability across different platforms, especially in light of Mickey Drexler's comments at a forum a few weeks ago that the increasing importance of outlet sales versus full price to the bottom line isn't very widely discussed.","David E. Simon","Well, I don't think it's -- I don't think anything has really changed all that significantly. Over the years, it's been a very profitable distribution channel for the retailers. I expect it to continue. There are more retailers coming into the sector because of the fact that it is profitable for a number of the retailers. I also think what we've done, that is Simon, has increased the scale, the design elements, the layout for the outlet industry in total. We brought it to the front door as opposed to the backdoor of retailers. We brought new tenants in. And I think we've had an absolute direct impact on bringing new retailers into that sector and helping it take it out of the or less out of the -- more in the mainstream.","Mickey, I love Mickey. Mickey makes lots of comments to those things, some of which had been directed at me in good fun. But the fact of the matter is it's a profitable business. We've had a lot to do with taking it out of kind of the backdoor and the front door. We've had a lot to do with the design and enhancing the look and feel of the product and also moving the product in better locations and bringing more tenants into it.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","David, it's Ross Nussbaum. I had an off-topic question, which pertains to your presence as the largest REIT in the industry and whether you had any thoughts on the increasing number of C corps that are converting to REITs and\/or restructuring into opco\/propcos and what kind of implications you think this trend has on the REIT industry overall.","David E. Simon","Well, that's a good question. I mean, I am starting to get a little bit concerned, maybe too strong a word, but I am getting a little bit concerned that the basic fundamentals of why companies are REITs is because they're in the real estate business and they're focused on growing their cash flow from their business as opposed to the opco\/propco. I think the opco\/propco has not worked its financing vehicle. I'm sure the investors are sophisticated to know which ones are primarily used for that vehicle. And so I'm getting a little bit concerned. I haven't had a chance. I've been too busy, frankly, to talk to NAREIT about what their whole view on this is. But the basic fundamentals of real estate investing with a seasoned management team, with quality real estate that can invest and grow their business is there. It's stronger than ever. And the returns, the cash flow, dividend increase for a number of companies has been remarkable in terms of the face of capital coming and going into the industry. The history of results for our industry has been phenomenal. I'm proud of our industry. I do think, though, if we get a little bit -- if it turns into a financing vehicle, I don't think it'll have a taint on the existing successful companies like ours, but I do think there should be a caution thrown to the wind with some of those.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","David, I know you tend not to provide same-store NOI growth figures, but I was just wondering if you could sort of talk about what you did in 2012 successfully and maybe what may not repeat. Or are there some items that may be headwinds this year that we should be thinking about, so that 4.8% may or may not repeat? And I'll start there.","David E. Simon","Well, look, 4.8% is an unbelievable execution. And let me just say this: I've read some of this commentary on our fourth quarter. I mean, I find it humorous because we look at it -- we look at our comp NOI on a year basis, not on a quarterly basis. And the important number is 4.8%. If you go -- also go back last quarter -- last quarter in 2011, we had a 4.5% increase. Yet, our quarterly or annual 2011 was 3.5%. So occasionally quarters are going to have a little extra performance, either overperformance or underperformance or right on performance. But, my goodness, focus on the year. The year was 4.8%. The other thing to focus on is that our comp NOI is -- what is it, Steve? 99%?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Yes, $4.05 billion.","David E. Simon","So it's $4.05 billion, if you didn't hear that. 99% of our portfolio. We don't play games with it. It's in our 8-K. It's right there. So I felt like I had to mention that because I've seen some analyst comments on that. But put that as a side, look, we are -- in our plan for next year is not to achieve the 4.8%. I mean, that was a -- for the Outlets and the Mall business, that was an extraordinary year. It's not doable, frankly. Maybe we can execute that, but we'd like to be conservative and thoughtful. That's in our guidance. We certainly want to hit our numbers that we produce. We have an unbelievable track record of producing that, rivals any public company in the country. And so we'll see. There's always headwinds in our business. Tenants coming, tenants going, bankruptcies. What the guys are doing in Washington, are not executing the way we want. It's never perfect. It's never as good as we want it to be and never as bad as you think it's going to be. But in the meantime, we're $2 over our 2008 number per share. Our dividend is $1 higher and growing. We're doing lots of redevelopment and new development. So you know what? I think we'll just do fine.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess we're coming up kind on the -- year anniversary of the Kl\u00e9pierre investment, and I know you've been a bit reticent to talk about at least some of the operational changes or impact that you might be having on the company. Is it still too early to talk about those? Or can you share some of your thoughts with us on that?","David E. Simon","Well, that the -- Steve, operations take time to manifest itself. And -- but we -- in conjunction with the management and the board -- we don't run the company, first of all. But in conjunction with the management and the board, and as Chairman, I mean, we give a lot of strategic advice. So what have we done? We've done asset sales to increase the financial performance or the -- to decrease the LTV and increase the financial firepower. We had EUR 2 billion of liquidity. We've re-branded the company from 2 brands to 1 brand and Segese [ph] to Kl\u00e9pierre, we're -- we've decided to get out of the office business to focus entirely on retail real estate. They did a great job of executing 3 terrific new developments and -- in Sweden and France that if you had a chance to visit, you'd be very proud of. We brought in a new COO that used to work for us at Simon Ivanhoe and worked at Unibuy. The company is rejuvenated in terms of marketing and operations. So I think we've done a lot. And the good news is, it's been a good investment. It will be, I think, a better investment. It has an element of risk. But the fact that they produce comp NOI growth with all the negative said about Europe is pretty damn good work. And we're proud of our association. We're proud of our investment. We're making big and good progress there that will again take time operationally. But we're also -- we brought -- are buying in Claymeres [ph], their other publicly traded vehicle, and we'll end up monetizing those assets over time. So I think there's been a tremendous amount of work. I'm surprised you don't see that.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","No, I was just trying to figure out if you thought that there were real sort of synergies on the leasing side or things that would maybe accelerate some of that growth. But let me just last question. Can you just talk sort of about Brazil and China? I know you've kind of been dipping your toe into those 2 markets. And you didn't really mention them, so I'm curious kind of what your thoughts are as we sit here today.","David E. Simon","Yes, turning to China, we continue to underwrite a couple of Premium Outlet deals. I continue to be very cautious about China, to build anything and including outlets. So there's really nothing new to say there other than it's taking longer to find the right deal to do, which is fine with me. We have plenty to do. I think the returns, the -- trying to get to the numbers, understanding tenant demand, understanding what's a great site, the ability to build expeditiously is very complicated in China. And we have on-ground experience, as you know, that wasn't a great experience for us. But nevertheless, we continue to see whether or not there's an outlet opportunity there. But it's slow going. And the fact of the matter is that's fine with us. In Brazil, we continue to work with BR Malls on one project. It's going through the permitting process there. It's taking some time. Assuming we get the permits, we would still have an interest in doing that. There's no certainty that, that will be accomplished, but a site's been identified. And we think we feel good about it if, in fact, we get the right to build stuff, satisfy it, and there's also a couple of others that we're looking at. But both of these markets are complicated. Both of these markets warrant a high level of due diligence, a high level of thoughtfulness. And we're exhibiting that by not just willy-nilly plowing capital in there but really waiting for the right opportunity that can justify the risk. And make sure the returns are there, which, Steve, frankly, is questionable on some of the ones that we've looked at and turned down.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","David, maybe we'll give you a rest and ask Steve a question to start off. Steve, you guys obviously just did some recent debt financing. One of those was a 5-year issuance. And just looking at how the 10-year has backed up, in 2019, it's a little bit light. But given how the 10-year has backed up, if you guys were going to go on the market again, would you just issue 10 and maybe another 30 year? Or would you still look to sort of fill in some of the near term?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Alex, it's a good question. It's really a couple of things: We've been really focused in this period of historically low interest rates in extending duration wherever we can. And in fact, if you look at the 8-K, for a portfolio that's $28 billion of debt, we moved the needle and extended duration by almost half a year and lowered our average borrowing cost for -- by 23 basis points. So our primary focus is locking in rates and extending duration wherever we can. The December offering happened to be a specific interest or situation, where we have a hole in our maturity schedule that was shorter term, and this -- the 5-year demand was so good that we issued shorter paper. But the focus is going to be primarily on longer-duration stuff.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then the second question is, just going to the Paragon. I mean, obviously, you guys have your own outlet program, but you've already done a few deals now with the Paragon guys. Is there sort of a relationship there where as they source deals, they know they sort of have an exit? If a deal fits a certain criteria, they know they can sell it to you? Or they -- were those 2 just sort of one-offs?","David E. Simon","Well, first of all, those deals, we were originally in as a partner in the deal during the development phase. So -- or construction phase. So I don't know if you know that, but that's the first point. But yes, we have a very good relationship with Paragon. I mean, there's no exclusivity on their behalf, on our behalf. We're talking to them on a couple of other deals. David Lichtenstein is a shareholder in the company, we've -- as part of the Prime transaction. So there's a good relationship. We continue to talk about new stuff. And -- but there's no requirement or exclusivity on either side.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","But as they're talking to tenants about pre-leasing, can they talk about -- I mean, obviously, they do talk about the relationship and the fact that Simon the Premium Outlet brand, may be the one ending up managing these? I would imagine that, that would be helpful as they're trying to pre-lease. Can they say that or not the case?","David E. Simon","It's really -- it's a deal-by-deal basis, and it's really not the case necessarily. If we do something at the outset, that's a 50-50 partnership, and we're both leasing it. That's certainly the case. But Livermore and Grand Prairie, we did -- we were not involved in leasing or managing. We had nothing to do with it. They did an unbelievable job on their own. And when we got involved, it was essentially pre-let. If there's a couple of ground-up things that we come in at the beginning, we may lease jointly. But in Grand Prairie and Livermore, they did all the work themselves.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan of Morgan Stanley.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On the -- just on the core a little bit. Your occupancy at 95.3%, I mean, at what point are you getting -- I mean, it's a little bit different than what you reported prerecession because of the outlets that -- I mean, what point are you getting to where you think you're at a frictional minimum in terms of vacancy, and kind of what does that mean then for -- if so, what does that mean for your ability to push rents a little bit harder?","David E. Simon","Well, I'll just say this, in our plan for '13, we do have an increase in occupancy for the portfolio. It obviously is getting more challenging than it has as we've increased the occupancy. But we're also focused on improving the mix, and we have some deals that are shorter term, and we're trying to clean those out and go longer term. So there's a hell of a lot to do. And we'll -- and we're bound to get certain stores back because of either bankruptcy and\/or the tenant is shrinking its store fleet because of their own issues. But we do have -- we do have a plan to increase our occupancy this year. But as important and more importantly is improving the mix and lengthening some of the shorter term leases into full 7-, 8-year leases as opposed to 1-, 2- or 3-year deals.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So -- I mean, if any -- if I think about it in terms of lease spread, your numbers have been around 10% for a while. Is there any reason to think they might change this year?","David E. Simon","Yes. Yes. In terms of our spread, no. We should be able to -- I mean, look, we're subject to -- as unfortunate as it might be, we're subject to the U.S. economy. I wish we could figure out the model where we weren't, but we are. So I mean, based on what we know today, I would think that we'd be able to achieve those kind of rental spreads.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just on the dividend. I mean, is there any -- first, '13, the dividend policy, you're going to keep doing what you've been doing over the past in terms of the quarterly adjustment?","David E. Simon","Well, we're getting -- it's safe to say we're getting closer to our taxable income. So I think the growth rate will -- at 4.60, we're getting much closer to our taxable income, and we'll have to see how that manages itself this year. But we'll be paying, as I said, at least 4.60, but we'll have to assess it every quarter. But we are getting closer to our taxable income.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a last question on Woodfield. I mean, any -- as you look at it now, anything that you think could be done there interesting in the near term, or is it just more of a longer term?","Richard S. Sokolov","Paul, this is Rick. We are all over Woodfield, and frankly, we think there are a number of things we could do in both the operating expense category, the marketing category. It is a massive property. It's over 2.2 million square feet, almost 890,000 feet of center section. So we've got a lot of flexibility in how we can deal with that space to maximize the NOI and bring in different users and create incremental uses and drive the NOI there by making more efficient use of the existing space. David Contis and his team's been up there a number of times, and they're very focused on what we can do. And I think you'll be seeing a number of things implemented over the next few months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cedrik Lachance of Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Just on the topic of Woodfield, what led you to JV Mission Viejo with CalPERS? Was it in terms of accessing the deal for Woodfield or did you want to reduce your exposure to Southern California somewhat?","David E. Simon","No, Cedrik, actually they have had Miller and CalPERS as partners. And they're  -- our partners have had a tremendous business in investing in top-quality regional malls. So they're -- they didn't want to reduce their overall exposure, and so it was one of those things where we talked about one other mall that was not in California. We really said, here are 2 malls that would meet their criteria. We obviously have a lot more but we just narrowed it down to 2. And we did that. In addition -- and Steve was intimately involved -- in addition, they actually wanted California exposure.","Stephen E. Sterrett","That's correct.","David E. Simon","So that's why they -- between the 2 that we discussed, they chose Mission because they did want to increase to their California exposure.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And are you able to share the cap rates that were used to value each property?","David E. Simon","They were exactly the same. So in other words, $1 of cash flow from Woodfield was valued at the same value, it was $1 of cash flow from Mission.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just going back to the short-term deals or short-term tenants question from earlier, as you transitioned some of those short-term tenants, or that space as currently leased to short-term tenants, to something longer, do you need to find new tenants? And if so, what kind of retailers are primarily growing in those spaces?","Richard S. Sokolov","Well, one, if you keep track, we made substantial progress in the last quarter in reducing the amount of the specialty leasing agreements we have in excess of the 12 months. The -- what we're doing is we're bringing in a number of new tenants and for the most part, we're taking that space and incorporating it into existing spaces to create appropriate rooms. And I'm not going to give you the usual litany of new tenants that are coming to the mall spaces David always joked to me about, but we do have a number of tenants that are looking for larger footprints. And 3 that are particularly relevant, H&M, ZARA and UNIQLO, are looking to have footprints that are in the 20,000- to 25,000-foot range, and that requires significant reconfigurations of existing space, some pretty unique property solutions to satisfy those needs, and we want to do so because they're great retailers. And that's one of the real sources of incremental demand.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then final question, perhaps, going back to the outlet business a little bit. What's the appetite on the part of potential institutional joint venture partners to take positions in some of the outlet properties?","David E. Simon","Well, we like owning generally 100% of an asset. So we've never really pursued it. But it would be -- the Woodfield mission is a great example of how we think about joint venturing. If it's a new opportunity that we couldn't otherwise access, it's great to partner with a highly respected group like Miller and CalPERS. But for us to bring in a JV partner in any of our outlet business, we -- first of all, we just don't see -- there's a lot of growth in that business, and we don't -- it's not like we can't access capital if we need it. We've got, obviously, a significant amount of retained earnings and cash flow that we plowed back into the business to accelerate our growth, as evidenced by our growth over the last 2 or 3 years. But there's no doubt in my mind that if, in fact, we desire that the institutional investors would certainly have a high degree of interest. We get solicited all the time and we kind of just poo-poo it. And Mills is a great example where we decided to go ahead and buy that deal as opposed to bring in another highly thought of institutional investors because we thought there were still significant growth there, and we wanted to own 100% of the assets that we ended up buying.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Harris of Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Could I just expand that question on CalPERS JV. We've talked about this in the past, about Simon's ability to generate higher returns out of assets than perhaps properties that come from other ownerships. Is this going to be an example you might be able to look to, David?","David E. Simon","I think so. I will say this, there is a significant demand, David, from institutional -- highly capitalized, highly thoughtful, highly experienced, big-time institutional investors, including sovereign wealth funds, to invest in retail real estate. And I just had a recent meeting that -- and that's worldwide. It's not just U.S. There's a high demand to invest in Europe. There's a high demand to find opportunities in Asia, where we can certainly parlay that interest in our corporate success into creating new opportunities for the company.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Can I stay abroad for a minute. And Japan seems to have adopted a leaf out of the Bernanke book on currency debasement. It looks like we're looking at substantial reduction in the yen-dollar rate?","David E. Simon","Yes. Yes.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","You have fairly substantial high net asset exposure with minimal Japanese yen. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that whether it might reverse then an opportunity for a dollar buyer? And also whether you might be thinking of putting some more hedge in place on your existing assets?","David E. Simon","Well, were currently underhedged in terms of our -- the value that we have. And we do have a hedge of roughly $200 million and --","Stephen E. Sterrett","$250 million.","David E. Simon","$250 million, roughly. So we do have a hedge. But our asset value is much greater than that. And we also hedge -- we get cash flow repatriated through our management and development fees, advisory fees that we do hedge, and we've hedged those over a long period of time. But what we don't hedge, though, is the cash flow that's generated from the business because it's harder to hedge given a lot of that capital goes back into the business to grow, either to build something new or expand. It's something we're seriously thinking about. We are underhedged. We do -- we will suffer a little bit this year, a couple of cents if the yen stays higher than where it is, given our plan. But I think it's -- we -- I'd say we'll develop a plan here over the next month or so. But it is something we're very focused on.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Obviously, as the company gets bigger and expose -- gets higher exposure to international, I mean, you're going to have to lead the way in the sector in terms of your sophistication around this?","David E. Simon","Yes.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","I mean, there are some other leading companies that fall a long way short on what's needed here. Can I just -- another point of detail, on page 14 of the 8-K, your international NOI is listed at 6.3%, that's inclusive of the Klepierre, I'm assuming?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Yes, David. This is Steve. It does include our share of the Klepierre NOI from the date of the investment on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley of Citigroup.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe just a first question for Rick. Just in terms of leasing in 2013 and some of the, I guess, opportunities, what's sort of the incremental leasing opportunities to push occupancy up above 95% this year that you're looking at?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Well David touched on, I think, the most important one, which is what we're doing is spending a great deal of time making more efficient use of the space that we have by trying to downsize underproductive tenants. And that is a way to generate a lot more NOI out of the existing space. But the other opportunities, as I mentioned, the 3 significant international users are all fairly aggressively looking for space now. And that is a major source of demand in the properties. And we've got a number of other tenants that are having brand extensions and new international tenants that are seeking space. So it's a matter, really, of coming up with ways to create space that will be appropriate for their needs. And for the most part, at this occupancy level, it involves downsizing existing underproductive tenants or trying to create incremental space. And a great example of that is Walt Whitman, where we are literally adding significant square footage across the entire front of the property by expanding it, and that's enabling us to bring in a significant number of new impact retailers.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And I guess that feeds into the second question I had. Just in terms of the development pipeline in the U.S., which is about $1 billion, if you include all of the re-anchoring that you're doing. Could you maybe just talk about what the shadow pipeline is, if you would, to look forward over the next sort of 3 or 4 years? What's the kind of volume of capital you're looking at putting back into the U.S? And how are you thinking about returns and construction costs and some of the trends in that development pipeline?","Richard S. Sokolov","Well, we have said previously, and we think this is going to be the case, that we can foresee spending at pretty much that same $1 billion rate over the next couple of years. And that's the combination of the announced projects that are already underway. We're working on some new premium outlet deals. We're working on several significant redevelopment opportunities in the mall portfolio that David has talked about in the past. We've announced Nordstrom at Del Amo, Bloomingdale's at Stamford. And we still have a significant pipeline of opportunities in this portfolio that's going to enable us to deploy that level of capital at our historic returns.","David E. Simon","If you were to use the -- and the euros actually do a pretty good job in terms of how they look at the -- their pipeline. But we -- I'd say our controlled pipeline is at least $5 billion, as Rick mentioned, between the redevelopments, the field -- Roosevelt Fields, included in that field [ph], and the Copleys, and the Alamos of the world, and including the new development. So I'd say our controlled pipe is around $5 billion, and that's over a 3-, 4-year period of time. And that will give you a sense -- I mean, projects come in and projects go out, but that's kind of the order of magnitude that we see.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","David, it's Michael Bilerman speaking. Just had a question on Klepierre. Given that -- in fact, that this is the 10-year anniversary of the tax, there certainly is an element that, at some point, perhaps you can take this thing private over the course of this year or next. I guess, where do you sort of stand in terms of the desire to sort of increase your ownership? What is your relationship with BNP Paribas and their desire to sell stake and sort of how are your thoughts evolving on that?","David E. Simon","Well, these also are very simple, straightforward questions that I'm really not going to answer other than -- I will say this, we have an excellent relationship with BNP. They've been very supportive from the get-go, once we got the deal negotiated. And they make valuable contributions at the Supervisory Board level. But the rest, Michael, I'm really not going to comment on. We are pleased with our investment. It's going to take time, but I still think there's a unique opportunity here to turn Klepierre into a really premier retail real estate company in Continental Europe. It's going to take time. I'm very patient on this. \"Reasonably,\" I should say. I hope the market here is reasonably patient. But the fact of the matter is for the last -- shoot, the deal closed in late March, early April, I mean, we've done a lot of good stuff in a very short period of time, getting the company rejuvenated toward what we think is the -- allows them -- again, subject to a lot more improvement, but at least gives them the path toward preeminence in Continental European retail real estate.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then you had mentioned Copley, which I don't think yet is in the 8-K in terms of schedule. I guess when are you thinking about breaking ground, and are you thinking rental or condo? And I guess both would have a difference in terms of capital deployment or net capital invested at the end of the day.","David E. Simon","Yes, the vast -- we're still designing the building. And we may need -- because of that design, we may need to go back through some administrative approvals that we don't think will be a big deal. But the idea that we're circling right now is to do mostly rentals, though there will be some condo element to it. And so you'd have essentially a hybrid building.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just last question, just Sears and JCPenney. Obviously, you had some changes at Sears at the helm this quarter, I'm just curious how you sort of think about how that evolves. And then in terms of the JCPenney sort of rebranded stores, and any within your portfolio about, I guess, how you're sort of viewing those performing relative to the others within the portfolio.","David E. Simon","Well, Sears, I -- it's -- I really can't comment all that much on the management changes. I don't sense it's a huge deal there. So I'm not -- I don't think that's any major, major move on their front. And Penney, I like the new stores. Rick and I visited the new complete prototype, but we've also seen some of the new shops within the shops at some of our malls. We don't have all the data yet. It's -- I'm really not in the position to comment on how successful it is. They are -- I like what I see, and they're making progress. But the financial implications of that change is really best left for them to describe. And I assume they're coming out with their earnings here shortly, I would imagine. So we'll look forward to hearing more in terms of the progress. But just from a mall owner's point of view, rejuvenating that brand, Penney, that is, is welcome. And we're working with them to be supportive of their efforts in rejuvenating the brand.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I think this one is for Rick on leasing spreads. I'm curious about market rents, in particular, because if I look at your -- I guess, it's the closing rate on leases, it's been moving lower over the last year, but the opening rate has been relatively flattish. Can you speak to the trends in market rents here in the U.S.? Because I'm wondering if the growth has been obscured a little bit, maybe by a mix issue in the leases that you're signing.","Richard S. Sokolov","Well, frankly, we continue to see our average base rent go up quarter-over-quarter, and it has been consistently. So I would tell you that we still have pricing power. If you look at our occupancy cost percentage, it's still relatively low. We have significant demand and we're able to continue to grow, I think, to grow those rents.","David E. Simon","I think you really got to look at the spread, and that's the more driving -- I mean, mix always is moving around, what's expiring, what's coming up. But if look at kind of what the expiration schedule is and the incoming rents, I mean, you'll see the spread is there to be had if we execute.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess in that regard, right now, and thinking about the spreads down the road. I mean, specific to anchor expirations, I think in 2014, the expiring anchor rent just sort of north of $5. In most of recent years, that's been sort of between $2 and $4. Is that something that leads you to think that leasing spreads could decelerate a little bit in 2014, or is that just something unique there?","David E. Simon","The anchors invariably have options, so I wouldn't -- that really has very little drive in our income.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then a question, David, I guess for you, in the -- on asset pricing because a few of your competitors have put out portfolios in malls, in the market, that are generally kind of in the $300 square foot range for sales productivity. What's your sense in where assets like those are pricing today in this capital market, given your experience with recent mall sales?","David E. Simon","Well, I mean, I -- it's really better left for them to explain what their pricing expectations are. The latest data that we have seen is what Westfield sold to Starwood. There's not much new beyond that. But I will tell you that some of the assets that are being sold, I find very aggressive pricing. I mean, there was this auction in Kansas City, kind of -- really not sure what it is. It used to be a lifestyle center, turned outlet, turned -- just a place where -- line [ph] center, but just a place where -- it's big, so you'd lease it to whomever you can lease it to. That pricing was pretty aggressive. So I mean, I -- I'm really -- it's really -- they're really better in a position to tell you what they want to see from pricing than we are.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just one last question, I guess, on outlet development because -- I guess, Christy touched on it earlier, but you are seeing outlet development activity kick up, or at least certainly interest in it, has it gotten to a point where you guys are seeing maybe pressure on development yields because retailers feel that they have more options for who they can align with?","David E. Simon","Well, I think that there's certainly going to be pressure on development yields for risky or ill-conceived projects. But they always are, right? I mean, that's the case in malls, outlet centers, power centers, lifestyle centers. The minute you have to beg a tenant to go into is the minute your yield goes down to unacceptable levels. I don't think it's going to change all that much for what we're trying to accomplish. I don't -- we're not going to get every deal. We're not going to win every deal. But I think the stuff that we're looking to build, I feel very good that we'll continue to generate the returns that you've grown accustomed to. By the way, it takes a lot of work to generate those yields, but -- so I'm sure there's going to be some yields that are going to, really, be way too low because, I mean, the nature of the business is people push projects and retailers sometimes don't pass up deals that are too good to be true. So as long as it's not our own mistake, it doesn't matter to us. It doesn't impact our business. And that's what you have to understand. I mean, too many people extrapolate, well, there's going to be 4 or 5 bad outlets. It's going to have some impact on you. It's going to have no impact on us, none. And there were 100 bad lifestyle deals, it didn't really have an impact on us. We're $2 higher this year than we were in the Great Recession. That says a lot about the company's ability to withstand the -- whatever the trend is out there. So it's -- the yield compression is not an issue for SPG. It might be for others. And so there'll be some bad deals done and we'll say, \"We knew it. We told you.\" But what can we say? What can we do? We just have to do what we do.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Actually, just a follow-up, you mentioned before that you prefer to own, particularly, your JV outlet developments, 100%. But I'm curious because return interest is very strong, or interest is very strong from institutional investors out there. If there was an opportunity for you to raise capital from there, what sort of terms or return split or valuation would lead you to maybe rethink that and take on a partner?","David E. Simon","If somebody wanted to come at a 2% yield on Woodberry -- I think Woodberry has got better risk-free credit than United States of America, and with growth potential. So 1 800 [ph], David, 2% yield at Woodberry, maybe I'd do it. I don't even know if I would do that, frankly. Rick, would you sell it in 2%? I don't know.","Richard S. Sokolov","There's a lot of growth left in Woodberry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller of JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A quick question. If we're thinking about -- let me see, you've got a comparable outlet in a comparable mall, let's say they're doing -- good centers doing $600, $700 a foot, do you think there's a cap rate differential there, number one? And then if you lower it to, say, a $350 or $400 foot center, the same question, is there a cap rate differential there?","David E. Simon","Cap rates are so real estate-specific that we'd have to know where the leases are, what the competitive marketplace is, where is this mall or outlet center? There's so many other variables than one just simple number. The most important point that I'd like to make is -- with respect to your question, is that, go back to our involvement in the outlet business, we -- David Bloom and I did a joint venture in 1998 in the outlet business. We built Orlando and Las Vegas together. Now I was so stupid because I invested in some technology business that I had to show the market that I was maybe not great in technology, but pretty good in real estate that I -- we had $4 million in Orlando and I sold it out to him, 1 year after, it was built for $40 million, which is 10x on a real estate deal in a year, which, by the way, is -- rivals as any private equity deal done or any venture capital deal. So I thought maybe at least the market would say, \"All right, so he screwed up in technology, but at least he knows what he's doing in real estate.\"","We've been at it a long time. We've had a dramatic impact on this industry. We've brought it out of the back room into the front room. We've brought new retailers into the business. We've redesigned it. We've brought it closer to marketplaces, like what we did in Orlando and Vegas, et cetera. So -- and because of all those efforts, at the end of the day, a great outlet is no different, I think, in the mind of the investor than a great mall. And I think you could say that a good outlet is probably not that much different than a good mall. And you could take that thinking all the way from high to the end. At the end of the day, a bad outlet and a bad mall, who the hell knows? I can't comment on that. But -- so I just think it's -- they're pretty much comparable at the end of the day. And then it gets to the specific real estate questions, like what's rent roll doing? What's sales doing? How can you expand it and all that kind of stuff that go into specific real estate questions. Now, in addition, look, we've been at it since '98, and then I think people said, \"You know what, it's not a bad business. Let's get in it.\" So I don't know. I don't know. But that's the only way I can answer your question.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Do you think you're going to see the pace of asset sales pick up this year for some of the secondary market stuff you're looking at?","David E. Simon","My instinct is to say yes, but it's still hard work. But my instinct is to say yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carol","[Audio Gap]","Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","We saw you and Simon put together a great project in Houston. And then in October, you all both announced plans for Charlotte. And then in November, you all decided to work together. Is it safe to assume if you and Tanger are competing in the same market, there's a high likelihood that you all would work together in the future? Or would you both try to build your own centers? Or how is that decision made?","David E. Simon","Well, look, I -- we have a very good relationship with Tanger, where we have our 1 joint venture. We've got our 2 that are in predevelopment, development phase, Columbus, Charlotte. I would find it unlikely that at the end of the day, we would both be building in the same markets at the same time. You can never say never. But I'd find it unlikely given our good track record that we have with the Tanger guys. Now, look, we -- he just built in West Phoenix, and we're building in South Phoenix. There are some overlap in the trade area, but they're really 2 separate distinct outlets. I know his was well-leased at opening. Ours is going great. We open, don't forget, April 4. And -- but I would find it unlikely that we'd have a situation where we were both actually in 2 -- in 1 trade area where we're both building at the same time. And we may be competing and finding out who's going to win, but I would find it unusual we would both build at the same time.","Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","In the process of competition, do you think it's highly likely you all would join together or one would just","[Audio Gap]","on the vacant Nordstorm space at Circle Centre Mall in Indianapolis, have you all had any luck re-tenanting that space? Or how are the discussions going there?","David E. Simon","Well, we have a very nominal -- just, first of all, just so you know, we have a very nominal financial interest in it. But we're working -- I mean, the mall is doing reasonably well. We're working hard to re-tenant it, but we don't have any tenant to announce right now.","Richard S. Sokolov","I would just make the comment that we've got 635 department stores and there are 6 vacant. So less than 1%. So...","David E. Simon","And that happens to be one of them.","Richard S. Sokolov","Yes, that's one of them. So thanks for asking.","Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","So you sound like you're in good shape. That's just one close to me, so I notice it when I shop.","David E. Simon","It's closer to us.","Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","Yes, it's about 2 hours for me.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","When I look at sales trends in January, especially the second half of January, it seems like they've been slowing, at least the research we do here. And I'm curious, have you seen January sales yet or have any indication what sales trends at your properties might look like for January?","David E. Simon","We don't -- Rich, we don't get our January sales until November -- oh, I'm sorry, the month later. So we won't get them until the end of February. But anecdotally, I've heard actually very good stuff. And, in fact, what was going on in Washington clearly had a reasonably down impact on the whole holiday season. Some of that picked up in January. So I've actually heard the exact opposite of that. But I haven't talked to every retailer, and I'm sure there will be some winners and losers. But generally, Rick and I were at NRF a couple of weeks ago, and we were hearing January was okay. So I don't know where you're getting that. But actually, we heard the reverse. But I'm not going to opine on that just because it's anecdotal.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, mine as well, David, same thing. Okay, good. And then, Steve, looking at the credit loss provision, it was unusually high, at least certainly higher than it's been the last couple of years this quarter, and I realize it's been pretty low. But anything special going on with credit losses or your thoughts on that?","Stephen E. Sterrett","No, Rich. And, in fact, I'd look at it more on an annual basis and not worry so much about an individual quarter, no different than the comment David made earlier about NOI. And if you look at it on an annual basis, it's still relatively below kind of historical norms for us as a percentage of revenue.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So no reason to think that goes higher substantially in '13?","Stephen E. Sterrett","No, sir. In fact, I would tell you that the '12 actual is probably a pretty decent run rate for the entire year '13.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then last thing, guys, on -- back to Paragon for just a second. It seems, David, that you get in to projects like this maybe a bit later in the process. And hence, if you did get in to another one, it might be well along the way. So it would deliver much quicker, I guess, is one way to think about it. And I noticed they had one in the Twin Cities, I think, they were working on and probably have others. Are there any of the other ones that you're kind of looking at with them at this point?","David E. Simon","We're talking to them about 1 and perhaps 2 others. But look, they're -- as I said to you, they're competent developers. Each deal is going to be a little bit different. But the good news is we can't -- given our own resources, we can't tackle every opportunity out there. We never have thought about our business that way. And it's good to have a good relationship with Paragon, just like it is with Tanger, because at the end of the day, partnering on some of these, delivering good product to our retailers, making money for our shareholders is all in the same equation. So it's a good, healthy relationship, and I would be disappointed if there weren't a couple more to do with both of them as we move forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just going back to 2013 guidance. I mean, you have provided a bit of a road map in regards to some of your underlying assumptions about where it seems your NOI is going, where you expect occupancy to go and maintaining leasing spreads. Any other kind of tidbits you could give us in regards to what's underlying your 2013 guidance?","David E. Simon","Well, look, we go through -- we are a large company. We got $80 billion of assets. We're in Europe. We're in Japan, Korea. We're in the mall business, the outlet business. We -- we've got development yields that we're trying to achieve, redevelopment. So, so much goes into how we do it. The most important is that we're dedicated to producing the results that we tell the market. We've done it for 9, 10 years. I don't even know. I lost track. We used to put that in, but since no one cares, we decided to take it out. And you know what, that's the number. We just don't think it's all that critical. Maybe we're wrong. We're happy to be -- we're happy to have our arm twisted to give you all the specific detail as to what we're trying to accomplish given our track record. You know we're trying to grow our comp NOI. You know we're trying to lower the cost of our debt. You know were trying to do our development deals according to our plan that we've -- we outlined in the 8-K. You know we're trying to increase our operating margins. You know we're trying to keep our overhead reasonably sane as the company gets bigger and bigger. You know all that, and we're not going to change. We just don't think, given our track record, we need to give you each and every little detail. We're happy to get our arm twisted, yelled at. Complain to Steve, if we do. But since we're such a big, big company, but it does include comp NOI growth. That's our #1 priority. It will always be managing the overhead is critical. There's some things out of our control, interest rates, currency, execution by others that we've empowered. But you put it all in and we think it's reasonable guidance given our past history of performance.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's fair. I guess the only reason why I asked is it sounds like a lot of things are still going to be going well in 2013. You have a fair amount of acquisitions that hit late in 2012. You have all these redevelopment and development efforts coming online in 2013. I was just kind of curious, is there any kind of number in there that weighs on 2013 earnings that we should be aware of?","David E. Simon","As a negative?","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","David E. Simon","Well, look, we sold -- I mean, we have some things that are negative. For instance, I'll give you 2 or 3 that come -- pop in my mind. We sold our interest in Capital Shopping Centres. We no longer get that dividend. That was dilutive because we essentially paid down debt. We sold -- we no longer -- we have some mortgages that we owned on the hope that maybe the owners were going to default. Those got paid off. So we -- our investment income is way down. We had a couple land sales. That's a lumpy business. So there's always those kind of things that are a little bit negative that we have to earn our way back. And Steve can shed more light. I mean, those are 2 or 3 that jump to mind. We have higher -- now we don't have much floating rate debt, but we do put in higher interest rate on the short term. So we have some exposure on that. So I mentioned the currency. We're already behind our budget in currency, but that didn't change our guidance. We'll figure out hopefully how to make that up in some way, shape or fashion. But that's hurting us with the yen. Those are some of the items that jump out.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick question on Grand Prairie and Livermore. With those assets being 100% occupied when you acquired them, how should we kind of think about growth within that portfolio and where you expect to get that from?","David E. Simon","Well, they were 100% leased prior to our 100% acquisition. And we like the real estate, so the growth will be there over time but nothing imminent. I mean, there could be based upon overage rental, I should say. So sales is still a little bit unknown because there's still some overage or percent rent deals with some of the anchors. So there may be growth because those projections may be less than what they produce. And then Livermore does have an expansion opportunity, so that's a couple of years away.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just 1 last specific question for Steve. Just ad expense during the quarter went up quite a bit. Just wondering why that was so.","Stephen E. Sterrett","I'm sorry, Tayo, the advertising expense?","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, expense.","Stephen E. Sterrett","That would just be seasonal, but it nets out because most of that is reimbursed by the tenant. So that's the bottom line.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Yang of Evercore.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Maybe, David, going back to the outlets. Do you have any thoughts maybe longer term on existing outlets that get cut off by new development? Because when I look at my area in San Francisco, I think the new Livermore outlet will probably siphon off some sales from Gilroy. You look at what's happening in Ohio, it looks like Jeffersonville might get fewer until shoppers from Columbus once the new outlet center opens up in that market. Are you worried about this at all? And maybe did this back in to your decision to sell Jeffersonville 2 years ago?","David E. Simon","Well, Jeffersonville was a requirement. So I think it's a fine asset, and I think it's a different trade area than what Columbus deals are. But yes, look, some of these may have some impact on some existing centers. I don't think there's enough to create an alarming concern. And Liver -- Gilroy is -- that's not an easy drive to go from there to Gilroy either way. As we get -- Livermore essentially gets the East and Gilroy gets the South. You may have some -- all this stuff that we have in the Napa area are pretty focused on that weekend consumer or whatever, visitor, tourist visitor. And -- so there could be some of that but nothing that I've seen that's been overly dramatic.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. So too early to worry about that issue?","David E. Simon","Too early. But, look, certain new deals were going to impact existing centers, whether they're outlets or malls or -- that's just the nature of the business.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sure, sure. And then you had talked about a Kansas City center earlier, and I was wondering if you could tell us what center that was and maybe what the cap rate was on that sale.","David E. Simon","Oh, I think it was -- our read of it was around a 6% cap rate.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","What was the asset exactly?","David E. Simon","It's -- go ahead, Rick.","Richard S. Sokolov","It's an open-air project that had some community center, power center components, had some full price components, had a lot of food. It was surrounded by a number of attractions in Kansas City that made it a decent location. But as David said, very big, we really analogized it to our Mills product because it could be all things to all people. But at that cap rate, it was a very significant valuation.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So unanchored, fixed cap, can you tell us what the name of that center was so that we can do more [indiscernible].","David E. Simon","It was called The Legends in Kansas City on the West side on the way to Topeka.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then final question. David, you made some positive comments on B malls in the past, and I wonder if you could just maybe provide your updated thoughts on this tier of your property portfolio?","David E. Simon","Well, the demand, I think, is picking up in it. So I think it's a lot of elbow grease. But generally, the demand is picking up in the B mall category. Sales are actually okay. And, I mean, one thing I love to look at is kind of sales year-over-year if we had any that had the decrease, and we really didn't. So I think business there is steady [indiscernible] she goes.","Richard S. Sokolov","And when you look at our anchor additions, they are being added throughout the portfolio. I'm not going to categorize the B, C, A. But throughout the portfolio, we're adding a lot of anchors, and that obviously only helps but increase market share.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sure. And then do you think there's any institutional interest in joint venturing some B malls currently, maybe something that does below $350 a foot, something in that range?","David E. Simon","Well, there's a lot of the private equity money doing it. So indirectly, that is institutional interest because all of their investors are institutional investors generally or some really rich people. So...","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","What about pension funds? Any pension funds that you think you might want to take an interest in, in some of these B malls?","David E. Simon","I think that is more going to be done through the private equity guys, and I think there's going to be roll-up strategies generated out of those guys. The yields are good. The business is more stable. There's more players coming into that. So that's where the interest is. And I think you'll see more transactions in that whole category.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Gorman of Cowen Group.","Michael Gorman - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of quick housekeeping questions for Steve. Steve, in the past couple of years, there's been sort of a ramp-up in the regional office costs from third quarter to fourth quarter that didn't really happen this year. I was just wondering why that was and if the fourth quarter is still a good run rate for 2013.","Stephen E. Sterrett","No, I -- Mike, for 2013, I'd look at the annual number and not necessarily the quarter number. So that kind of $125 million-ish number in total is a good number. And then how it breaks out quarter-to-quarter can depend upon a lot of seasonal things, like David mentioned, with respect to the NOI. But I'd really focus on the annual number.","Michael Gorman - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just 1 more clarification. When I was looking at the 8-K, there's a footnote that talks about land sale gains of just about $8 million, and that seems a little bit different from the breakout of $4.4 million on the income statement. Is that just unconsolidated land sale gains that's the difference there? Or...","David E. Simon","Yes, we had one that flow through our JV.","Stephen E. Sterrett","JV. That's correct. Bonus points.","David E. Simon","We love when people read our financial statements, especially when management does it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I'm here with Craig Schmidt. Just a few questions. I guess just thinking about -- 2012 clearly was just a great year for the company. David, how are you feeling, I guess, the start of this year versus last year? And what's the message to the team, I guess, for this year?","David E. Simon","Thank you for mentioning that. We did have a really, really good year, and I'm frankly proud of the organization that -- on all fronts, financing, operations, leasing. Basically, there were really no -- we really executed well, and I appreciate those comments. I appreciate you pointing those out because we worked our ass off in '12 to deliver that. And we had a lot of moving pieces, as we always do, and we did a lot of deals. People forget about all the deals that we did. So -- and hopefully, the fruits of those investments have -- did show, to some extent in '12, but they'll show more importantly in '13 and '14. So thank you for highlighting that. Look, our -- we're the old Green Bay Packers, 3 yards in a cloud of dust. If our -- if we said anything different to our people, they would -- they'd be shocked. So we're not -- we're pleased with what we did in '12. We got a lot going on in '13 already. And I think what we're doing at the property level in terms of our reinvestment is a huge focus, and delivering the redevelopment yields that we want is very, very important to -- for both the consumer and the retailer. And I just think it's more of the same of what we do. We -- and I would hope to be able to have another year like that in '13, but it takes a lot of work. There's always the unknown out there. We are spending a lot of capital so we got to produce the returns that we want in that capital invested. We have a good track record, but that doesn't necessarily mean you can produce it. The mall teams are in good shape. Outlets team is in good shape. We're still working through our international, how to beef that up. The Mills team is in good shape. So generally, I'm pleased, but as everybody knows around here, we don't rest. We fight and we continue to work to have another good year.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And I guess addressing maybe one of our concerns or question marks on the consumer. Any particular area you're more worried about, whether it's luxury or at the aspirational shopper or the middle-income shopper?","David E. Simon","Well, I think, over a long period of time, the middle-income person has been squeezed. And that always -- I don't want to get into this big macro discussion because people will either disagree or I'll bore them to death. But look, that's a big focus. It's always been a big concern. But we're in a good spot because we have that bifurcated product. We have the high-end, and that continues to do well. Look, it will ebb and flow, but at the end of the day, the people there have purchasing power. And there may be a bad quarter or 2 of sales, but they're going to -- those assets are only going to get better. And we're very well-represented in the value side. So we have that bifurcation like what the retailers are trying to accomplish. We have some stuff in the middle that gets squeezed. We have the ability to manage those reasonably well. That does retard our growth rate to some extent because some of those asset's cash flow does go down. But generally, the bifurcation that is out there between looking for value or looking for the higher-end product is no better represented than what we do. We're the best representative of what's out there is what I really should say.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then turning to the Internet, I don't believe you guys really discussed that. Just coming for the holidays and it seems like more of the discussion from the retailers coming out at some of the latest conferences has been recognizing the importance of using the Internet, along with bricks and mortar. I don't know if there's anything new you've been talking to retailers about, any new thoughts on how to leverage your properties, anything -- any new initiatives.","David E. Simon","Well, there's lots -- we could go through lots of what we're doing on the digital front, marketing and everything else. But I'd say that -- I don't -- I would just say this. The good news of all of this is that, in my opinion, the retailers clearly need stores, clearly want to invest in stores. And I think all the technology will enhance their ability to deliver better service to the stores that they have as we will also. I think we'll able to enhance our service levels through the use of technology, and I think that's critical in today's environment. I have yet to see, frankly, and it may come one day. But I've yet to see a retailer say they're not spending money, opening new stores because they're reallocating capital more toward the Internet. Now we may cross that fulcrum at some point, but I haven't seen it. And I think what it also means is they're going to be selective on where they go and what they want to do. But I'm a strong believer that good real state will get stronger and better. And I've said to you for a number of years, the retail real estate, some of it will become obsolete. We've seen it in some of our assets. It's unfortunate, but that's reality. But I think we'll more than make up for it as demand is more focused on the better real estate, which we own a vast preponderance of. And -- but I think technology is ultimately going to end up being useful to delivering a better product and service to our consumers and make it a more enjoyable experience.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, it's Craig here. I just -- my question focuses on The Mills. Could you talk a little bit about the redevelopment at Sawgrass? And then maybe, in general, the opportunities or direction given, as you mentioned, the significant reinvestment in The Mills in 2012?","Richard S. Sokolov","Well, there's a couple of things that are going on at Sawgrass, Craig. First, we took back the Wannado use that was a children's interactive retailer. It's about 110,000 feet. That's been completely redivided now into new tenants, and they're all open. And that's doing very well. It's added a new entrance into the mall. We added Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, and that's doing well. We're opening later, thinking early second quarter, an expansion of The Colonnade, which is our upscale outlet presentation at Sawgrass. And that's going to have almost exclusively high-end designers with their only location in Southeast Florida. And that -- that's 100% leased, and we'll be doing very well. We still have another 400,000 feet of FAR [ph] at Sawgrass, and we're actively working on programs to further expand the square footage there and reconfigure it. And we're also working on a renovation of the Oasis, which is the open-air section of the property. We just added a California Pizza Kitchen, Cheesecake Factory and bringing that up. So a very powerful property, doing very well and a major focus of redevelopment efforts and capital.","David E. Simon","And I would -- I just would add. This mall will do over $100 million of EBITDA. And in the next 2 to 3 years, it'll probably be over $120 million, without the expansion, the big expansion that Rick just mentioned. So it's a beast, but don't tell anybody, okay?","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just 1 last question for Steve. In Brazil, Steve, anything new on the financing front? Anything -- oh, the capital markets there, I'm not sure if there's any new opportunities for a U.S. real estate company there.","Stephen E. Sterrett","In Brazil?","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes.","Stephen E. Sterrett","You mean in terms of raising dollars in Brazil?","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","In terms of tapping line of credit there for you -- so you could have natural hedge in anything you invest in.","Stephen E. Sterrett","No, not really. No. We really haven't made any investments yet, so -- but no.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Rosivach of Goldman Sachs.","Andrew Leonard Rosivach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But really quick on Tayo's question. So when you guys give guidance, there's kind of 2 groups. There are companies that throw in spec acquisitions that they haven't made yet, and then you have guys like the Boston Properties that just give a no-acquisition guidance. And then to the extent you get stuff done later in the year, the numbers end up going up. And is that part of why you did so well in 2012 versus your initial guidance? And for 2013, is that how you've set it up as well?","David E. Simon","Well, let me -- certainly, we did have some growth because of our investments that we hadn't planned on. But yes, let me make it clear. In 2013, we have no spec acquisitions at all. So nothing -- no spec investments.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions in queue. And I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Simon for closing remarks.","David E. Simon","Okay. Well, thank you so much for your participation, and we look forward to chatting in the near future.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.","David E.

My name is Sarah, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Ward, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Thomas Ward","Thank you, Sarah. Good morning, and welcome to Simon Property Group's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Tom Ward, Vice President, Investor Relations. Presenting on today's call is David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also on the call are Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer; Andy Juster, current Treasurer and incoming Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Zale, Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs.","Before we begin, a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. We refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements.","Please note that this call includes information that maybe accurate only as of today's date. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the press release and the supplemental information in today's Form 8-K filing. Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com. Also due to the completion of the Washington Prime spin-off in the second quarter, we are providing operating statistics in our supplemental 8-K for the prior year period to show performance on a comparable basis excluding the Washington Prime properties. For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.","David E. Simon","Okay, thanks. Good morning. We had a productive quarter. We opened 2 new Premium Outlets in Charlotte and the Twin Cities, and in Minnesota nearly 100% leased. They're both off to a great start. We successfully tendered and redeemed approximately $1.6 billion of notes. And we currently issued $1.3 billion of new notes, which extended our average duration and reduced our weighted average interest cost. And we became the first U.S. REIT to establish a global commercial paper program. We agreed to buy 2 high quality assets from the recently announced WP Glimcher deal with great growth opportunities. And most important, we continue to produce strong and operating and financial performance, both industry-leading.","Now let me talk about the results. FFO reported was $1.90 per share. For those of you who updated your estimates to include the $0.35 per share charge related to our tender offers and redemption, the $1.90 exceeded the consensus by $0.05 per share. On a comparable basis, excluding the charge related to the debt distinguishment in the third quarter and the operating results from the WP properties in the prior year period, FFO diluted per share increased 14.2% year-over-year to $2.25, from $1.97 or $0.28 in total. And on the same basis, it's been increased 14.5% year-over-year to $6.48 from $5.66.","Overall business conditions remain favorable driving increases in our key operating metrics and cash flow. We continue to see strong demand for space across the portfolio. Occupancy increased across the portfolio. Leasing activity is healthy. The Mall and Premium Outlets recorded releasing spreads of $9.67, an increase of 17% comp. NOI increased 5.3% in the third quarter, 5.4% year-to-date, again industry-leading. And over 95% of our domestic NOI is included in our comp NOI calculation.","Total sales in our portfolio increased 2.8% in the third quarter compared to last year, and increased 2.6% for the trailing 12 months even with major redevelopment occurring at several of our Premier properties. These results are a testament to the strength of our assets and their locations and the ability to once again continue to execute new development.","As I mentioned, Charlotte and Twin Cities, both opened July 31 and August 14, respectively. Premium Outlets in Montr\u00e9al will open in October 30. We expect that to be another great deal, very similar to what we built in Toronto, which is doing well, doing great. Construction continues on new Premium Outlet developments in Vancouver, and in Southern New Jersey's Gloucester Township, where the center will serve the Greater Philly area, both high-quality major markets. In Canada, a year from now, we will have centers in 3 of the best markets Toronto, Montr\u00e9al and Vancouver. And we started construction just recently on 2 new Premium Outlets in 2 great markets, Tucson and Tampa, and both scheduled to open in October of '15. And we'll continue to focus our outlet projects in major and selective markets, where we know there's a clear demand from the retailers that matter and provide solid returns to our shareholders.","Redevelopment, just quickly. We opened a residential complex [indiscernible] We also opened Nordstrom and additional square footage at St. Johns Town Center and a new Bloomingdale's at Stanford Shopping Center. We also announced plans for the addition of luxury residence and an AC Hotel by Marriott to Phipps Plaza to open in -- both open early 2016 and construction for the residence will commence tomorrow.","Additions to these mixed use will make our great real estate even better, and continue to make our centers the places to be from shopping, to dining, to living. Redevelopment expansions. Projects are ongoing at 31 properties across all 3 of our platforms in the U.S., Asia and Mexico, which expand and has enhanced some of the most productive properties.","We started construction on 2 expansions, one at Livermore Premium Outlets in the Bay Area, that will add 185,000 square feet and is expected to open in August of 2015 and an expansion of The Colonnade at Sawgrass, expected to open December 2015 that will bring 56,000 of high-end luxury retailers to this productive mill center.","And as a reminder, construction continues on major redevelopment expansion projects at some of our most productive mall properties, including but not limited to, Roosevelt Fields, Houston Galleria, Stanford Shopping Center and our Premium Outlets, including Woodbury, Las Vegas North and Chicago. When you put it all together, we have a total committed spend of $2.2 billion over the next 3 years all committed to, and all under way.","Now turning to acquisitions. We signed a definitive agreement to acquire Jersey Gardens and University Park Village, concurrent with the closing of the Glimcher acquisition by WPG. We're excited to add these 2 great properties to our portfolio, when the deal closes in early 2015. We're also pleased with our investment in Kl\u00e9pierre. And as their largest shareholder, we're excited for them and their proposed transaction to acquire Corio. Both of these transactions will be accretive to SPG's earnings. And again, demonstrate our industry-leading creativity to find unique opportunities.","Capital Markets, again, very busy. I told you about the $1.3 billion notes. And we retired average duration of 1.7 that were at interest rates of 5.6%. We also redeemed another $250 million of notes at 7.875% coupon rate. Concurrently, we issued $1.3 billion of notes with an average duration of 16 years and an average coupon of 3.6.4%. This takes our senior notes from 6.3 duration to 7.6 duration and lowers our average interest rate from 4.64% to 4.4%.","In addition, as I mentioned, we are the first U.S. REIT to establish a global unsecured commercial paper program. We received an A1\/P1 rating from S&P and Moody's, respectively. The program has $500 million. We can issue CP in dollars and euros. And in fact, we already have. So we placed $100 million of U.S. CP, which we are borrowing at LIBOR plus 0 to 2 basis points. And our euro LIBOR, we also placed EUR 100 million at a Euro-LIBOR rate of 0 to 7 basis points. That compares to our revolving credit of 80 basis points above LIBOR.","We announced our dividend of $1.30 an increase of 8%, including the November dividend, we will pay to Simon shareholders $5.15 in '14, which is an increase of 10.8% compared to, what, 2013, and does not include the dividend that if you've maintained your WP investment which is, essentially, on a share adjusted basis of $0.50 per share. We expect to raise our dividend again, of course, subject to board approval in the first quarter of 2015.","Guidance. We raised our guidance to a range of $8.84 to $8.88 per share. The midpoint of this raised range is an increase of $0.15, from our prior guidance, after given effect of the charge related to the debt extinguishment.","Now, let me take a deep breath, because obviously there's a lot going on. I wanted to just give you a real brief update on management team. When we announced Steve Sterrett's retirement early this year, we also said that we would source both internal and external candidates for the CFO job and that Steve would remain the CFO through 2014. We then announced our current [ph] Treasurer, Andy, would become our new CFO. Since Andy's announcement, Andy, Steve and the rest of our financial service team who, by the way, have on average of 20 years of experience with SPG, have paved the way for a smooth transition. And since that transition is now complete, effective in December, Andy will become our CFO and Brian McDade, now our Assistant Treasurer will become our Treasurer. Steve, will be available to us as needed for specific tasks.","So summing it up, we had a great third quarter. We expect a strong year end. And of course we're very focused on continuing to enhance the value of our properties. And we're open for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christy McElroy from Citi.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Michael is on the line with me as well. David, just to follow up on your comments around opening outlets centers in major markets. In buying a center like Jersey Gardens, in what type of markets do you think indoor outlet type of concept could work? And can you also provide you, mostly thoughts around the growing number of outlet centers and stores opening [indiscernible] what that means for [indiscernible] the outlook versus the overall in terms of future obsolescence?","David E. Simon","Well, Jersey Gardens is, we consider it more of a Mills as opposed to an outlet center. It was essentially modeled after The Mills. So it appeals to broad consumer base, but it's got the entertainment, it's got the big boxes. It does have a smattering of pure outlet retailers. But I wouldn't -- Christie, I wouldn't consider that an outlet center, so to speak. You're -- unfortunately, we did have a not such a good connection on your question. But I think you mentioned about the potential about outlets coming closer to major metropolitan marketplaces, is that -- was that the question?","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. Yes, and what that means for obsolescence, future obsolescence of existing outlets?","David E. Simon","Well, look, outlet business is very competitive. We have a good portfolio. Our results speak for themselves and I think we'll continue to be able to grow our comp NOI and our portfolio. I think in all of retail real estate, you can never stand still. You've got to invest in the products. You've got to make it better. Whether its outlets, full-priced, lifestyle, et cetera, that's what we're all about. That's what we're grounded in. Our -- we focus on lease-by-lease, market-by-market, deal-by-deal and we'll -- we live in a very competitive market. We'll continue to hopefully do well.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","David, it's Michael Bilerman speaking. There's an echo I guess, when we're asking the question. I don't know if that's partially why you may have cranking.","David E. Simon","Sorry about that. We'll check in to see if we can change that by the time the call is done.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No worries. So I also have a question on global. Obviously -- you have Kl\u00e9pierre 2.5 years ago, you went into -- you're leveraging Kl\u00e9pierre now effectively to buy Corio and consolidate in Europe. You've McArthurGlen that you've made an investment in. You obviously have the outlet business that you're growing internationally. All the Australian journalists think that they've spotted your plane in Australia which you denied. We just had a doubt there. And then, just I'm curious, how much time are you spending U.S. versus non-U.S.? As you think about the growth of Simon, how important is that international aspect going to be?","David E. Simon","You mean me, personally?","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. From -- as strategic growth initiatives. How much time are you spending outside the U.S. versus inside U.S.?","David E. Simon","Well, look, generally, roughly our outlet business represents 10% of our -- from Asia to Europe to McArthurGlen. So let's say it's around 10%.","Ross L. Smotrich - Barclays Capital, Research Division","International.","David E. Simon","I'm sorry, our international business. And honestly, other than -- where you had the episodic nature of deals, I would tell you that I work very hard and don't feel sorry for me okay? But, so I would say to you that generally, other than episodes of deal making, I spend around the same amount of time. But we have a great team in our international. I have added a colleague that you probably haven't met that's done an unbelievable job to relieve the [indiscernible]. But I wouldn't say it's abnormally different than what the international business represents in terms of our investment. At the end of the day, we haven't made a huge -- the good news is we're in the money and everything that we've done. But when you put it in the scheme of our roughly $90 billion asset base, we haven't made this huge unbelievable bet internationally. And I spend roughly 10% of my time.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. And I was thinking more. So into the future whether that's changed at all and we see that percentage go up in well [ph] quarter of the company or 30% or 40% of the company.","David E. Simon","Well, I think the -- given that what we're doing in the U.S., it's not -- that's probably not likely in any short- or medium-term horizon.","Operator","Our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya from Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question on the development and redevelopments. This seems like -- with the supplements for this quarter that released, the yield on expected development and redevelopments came down slightly for the mall redevelopments [indiscernible]","David E. Simon","I'm glad you're very perceptive. And I'm glad you asked the question. So King of Prussia is now a go-deal, it's a big deal. And it did drop our redevelopment yield a little bit because it's -- I know you grow accustomed to Simon having 10% returns on every deal we do, sometimes a little lower. But it's still very accretive when you look at where that property is valued today. But we don't hand out or give out returns. So that -- but that, it is a major development, redevelopment, I should say, and that did lower the return. On the outlets side, I'd say 2 things: we've taken out Charlotte and Minneapolis; we've added Tucson and Tampa. Charlotte and Minneapolis were very high double digits. Tucson and Charlotte -- I'm sorry, Tucson and Tampa are on average 11. The others were higher than that. So when you bring that 2 together, it dropped it a touch. Now I will say to this, we're very conservative on our new development, both Tucson and Tampa are double digits. But the way they're coming in and the other 2 that are coming out, dropped it, oh, so small.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's really more of a mix...","David E. Simon","Let me be perfectly clear. We have no execution issue. We have no cost overrun. It's just the mix, changed by the addition of the plaza, the King of Plaza, and then the 2 outlets opened and the 2 new ones coming in.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Morgan from MLV.","Paul Morgan - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","The re-leasing spreads is also just fixed on a bid . I mean, I know there's some noise. But you've kind of been in an upward trend and it is a rolling 12. So I just wanted to maybe get any comments on spreads, your outlook for them, whether the changes and -- whether the sales volatility has had any impact? And that's the question.","David E. Simon","Well, look, it wasn't that long ago, say, less than a year ago where the spreads we're 14%, 15%. So I will just tell you, from our standpoint we are pleased with basically having 9, 9.5-plus-dollar spread. And 17% -- I mean, I wouldn't -- we have to look at this a little bit on a longer-term basis. So I would say, we're very pleased with 17. It's higher than it was a year ago. Yes, it this a little bit lower than the Q1 and Q2. I certainly wouldn't overreact on that on any basis. The re-leasing spreads are driving our industry-leading 5.4% year-to-date comp NOI growth. And we're -- we are executing this in a clearly, a cautious consumer oriented environment. And obviously last year, the consumer shut down a little bit because of weather, this, that and the other things. So I'm pleased, I'm happy. And I think we're executing very well. We're going through our -- in terms of how we look at that next year, very simple, as you know, we've been doing this 20 years. We had the pleasure of starting November 10, I believe, going through each and every mall, lease-by-lease, deal-by-deal, which rolls into our plan which we'll share with you in early next year. And so until that's done, I don't have a prediction about what our spreads will be other than we continue to believe we're -- our rollovers are under market [indiscernible] in the future growth of our business industry-leading opportunities, in my opinion has been reinforced by year-after-year-after-year of continual unabated outperformance.","Richard S. Sokolov","The only thing that I would also add is that our occupancy cost remains very moderate, which shows you that we still have plenty of room to grow those rents.","Stephen E. Sterrett","Yes. Paul, this is Steve. I'll just add one thing. If you look at our 8-K, over the last 8 quarters we've consistently signed new leases between $63 and $67 a foot, and if you look at our lease expiration schedule you can see that they're still in the mid-40s for the next several years. So we still feel very good about marketing the expiring leases to market.","Paul Morgan - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Yes, I know you haven't giving guidance, but that kind of high teens number is -- there's no reason to think that that's not sustainable it's not maybe potential upside.","David E. Simon","Well, look, we -- we're -- I know you're, Paul you're smart and you want us to talk about next year. We have tremendous confidence in our business and our platform and the thing that I would have you rely on is what we've done year-after-year. And as I said to you, we'll share our guidance early next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Spector from Bank of America.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm also here with Craig, who will have a question after me. My question was just focused on Sears' decision to lease space to Primark. Also, Amazon's announcement to open a store in New York City, we've been getting a lot of incoming calls, questions on those announcements, and what that could mean. If you could just provide some thoughts on those announcements and maybe where you think things continue with Sears in their leasing efforts?","David E. Simon","Well let me -- I'll have -- I'll give you 2 quick top of the head remarks and then I'll let Rick add whatever he wants. Look, on Amazon, leasing space, I'm not -- it's, all the details aren't out, but there's clearly a benefit for the overused word, omnichannel bricks and clicks, however you want to describe it, there's a real benefit. In fact, it's very interesting when I see Sears as a online retailer, depending on which study you look at. I mean, they're anywhere from -- they're clearly in the top 10. They may be as high as #5. And I would argue it's because of their physical presence that allows them to be so important in the online presence. And you've heard it from retailers that the synergy between having the physical and the online presence and now the move toward mobile, and how its all been integrated. So -- and clearly, we've seen a number of pure online retailers going to physical stores. So the -- it's got to be in the equation for a retailer to have a physical presence. I don't think there's any question in that. And as our retailers have gotten more sophisticated in the online world, I think that's going to play to our benefit. On the Sears leasing, we have one that we've consented to in King of Prussia. That was part of their agreement to consent to our ability to expand the 2 centers. We worked very collectively to do that. I think Sears would be the first to tell you that in certain markets and certain stores they don't underperform, or in fact they have too much space. And they will look to release some of that space or sell some of the real estate. We still think they have a physical presence that's going to be important to them. And we'll continue to work with them on a collaborative basis that meets our needs, and our shoppers' needs and theirs. And we expect to, at the end of the day, for both of us to benefit from that.","Richard S. Sokolov","And what I would add is that focusing on the Primark side, they're a highly productive iconic retailer in Europe and the U.K. We have been working with them for over 6 months. We have already visited them at their headquarters and toured their stores, where they operate. And we're very excited about their entry into the U.S. We anticipate that there will hopefully be several other opportunities, both within our portfolio or others Sears stores, which they have already alluded too. And I would also point out that we got involved with Primark early on as our Kl\u00e9pierre team already had a preexisting relationship with them.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Craig has one question.","David E. Simon","We've all concluded that we are all just [indiscernible] so we just want to go on record for that. Alright?","Richard S. Sokolov","Us too.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I was just going to ask what were some of the take aways from your shopping block events? And just maybe some general thoughts on the millennials in the malls.","David E. Simon","Well, look I think, they're an important customer base. I think they represent a unique opportunity for us. The millennials represent a bigger population than the baby boomers. So it's very important for us to connect with them, the way they want to be connected. I think they like mall shopping. And we're going to experiment and do lots of things oriented around them to continue to make them an important consumer base, in our properties. But we're not going to ignore the baby boomers either because they have a lot to spend. So I think as millennials get older and we can continue to offer them entertainment, restaurant and the right retailers in that -- in the properties, and connect with them the way they want to be connected, it's a great opportunity for us. Rick, do you want to add anything?","Richard S. Sokolov","The only thing I would say to echo David's point, the research that we've done has shown that the millennials are, in fact, very supportive of the mall channel and are very much focused on going on there. And so it's a natural thing for us to try and exploit and enhance.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was also noticing, you used 2 outlets to do the initial rollout, with Refinery29. How did those go?","David E. Simon","Very well. So that relationship is early, but I'd say generally we're very pleased. We're creating buzz in that whole marketplace. And are -- along those lines, Craig, we're making some initial investments in early-stage companies to really to enhance the environment. But, I think, all the good news is that there is a lot that we can do to enhance our environments and we are as committed as anyone to do that. We've got the balance sheet, the capital the -- hopefully, the creativity and the willingness to take risk to do that which all companies, I think, need to be in this position to do. It would be easy for us to rest on our industry-leading growth. But as you know us very well, that is not in our DNA. And so, we're going to do it from marketing, to leasing, to development and everywhere in between.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Rosivach from Goldman Sachs.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is actually Caitlin Burrows. Retailers have been open about the needs for a physical presence to showcase, even though much of their sales are generated online. Can you talk about how you capture the economic value of a store that doesn't necessarily run through that store's cash register?","David E. Simon","Well, look, there's -- it's -- that's -- in our leases, even if it's done in the store but fulfilled online that's part of our sales. That's not really too much of an issue. And I think for all physical retailers the important -- and even with their online business, they have a multiplier effect, that's very important, that they see when they have a physical presence with their online consumers. And they can describe it in great detail on it. And it's anywhere from 3x to 4x. So the convergence is there. It's happening. And the good news is our retailers are combating effectively the pure online retailer. And the online retailer understands for them to, beyond the first mover advantage that someone like Amazon had, in order for them to really grow their business, I think and many, many believe, they need to have a physical presence because of the way it's moved to mobile and the way it's -- the multiplier effect that the omnichannel world is presenting itself in. So that bears, I think, extremely well for us in creating the next wave of retailers. We don't -- we see that just beginning. So, the -- the interesting thing is, the online retailers have still got this unbelievable advantage and we see it ourselves in [indiscernible]Nexus. And giving that benefit, even though they should be collecting that used tax instead of sales tax, but taking advantage of that benefit that the consumer's not necessarily are entitled to. As that has begun to swing, because a lot of them have Nexus now with warehouses and the like. As that has balanced, that's going to level the playing field, obviously, it would be great. We can get Congress to level that playing field which they should be doing, that I think that's going to reinforce the advantages of bricks and mortar. Because at the end of the day, when you're looking to shop, the mobile device or even the desktop really can't present the goods and services that are available with that retailer that a physical environment can. Yes, they can save you the sales or use tax, yes, they may have an advantage in convenience, which is slowly being dealt with by our retailers through pickup-in-store, ship from store, but once that's sales tax, use tax advantage is eliminated, which I think it will be through Nexus for the government, we'll see that. I think our retailers can be really damn competitive.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just on the topic of equal playing field. So Amazon now charges sales tax in 23 states. And what else is remaining to be on topic of tax parity? Is there anything that you guys are doing?","David E. Simon","Well, we're trying. But there are roadblocks in Congress and we're not here to complain about the government, believe me. But we just want a level complaint -- level playing field and then the consumer is going to make that choice, but they shouldn't be -- they -- and we should let the states decide how they want to deal with it, but it should be level. And at the end of the day, the best retailer, the best mall operator will come out ahead. I think it's got to be level, it's just not right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So a couple of quick questions. First, about going back to the Sears topic. If Sears decides to lease their space -- sublease their space on their own, do you guys generally have veto power or do other anchors at the center have veto power and is there any chance that you can partake on the upside assuming they granted us prior money anything upside [indiscernible].","David E. Simon","Well, there's 2 questions there. We certainly have substantial ability to control what Sears can do with their stores based on existing leases or reciprocal easement agreements, so that is, yes. With respect to the upside, to the extent the transaction is being done by Sears within their store, with their capital, it's their transaction, but we certainly benefit in a position like where you're adding a Primark in or a Dick's in King of Prussia, that certainly will strengthen our overall offering for our shoppers, but not financially if it's being done inside the Sears store with Sears capital.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Do other anchors have a stake?","David E. Simon","It depends on the documents and depends on the scope of what Sears is contemplating with their building.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just last question for me. On Kl\u00e9pierre, if I understand the deal correctly, it's going to be a full stock deal, between Kl\u00e9pierre and Koreo [ph] which would in effect dilute your equity stake from the 29% roughly to sub-20%. And I'm sure you'll let me know if I got this wrong. Any thoughts on re-upping your equity stake in Kl\u00e9pierre?","David E. Simon","Well, you don't have it wrong, but I'm not going to answer that question. We like the investment. It's been a very good investment for us. We think as a reference shareholder and as -- and being on the board, we've added real value and we are in a -- obviously, we do believe in the merger or acquisition of Koreo [ph], and we support it and we believe that scale in our business is really important because it -- on all sorts of fronts, capital, retailer relationships, ability to invest in the consumer experience, et cetera. So we're optimistic that, that investment will continue to be good for us and grow in value. But I really can't tell you about whether or not, going forward, we'll increase our stake. But we're pleased and we think there is still opportunity going forward with our investment in Kl\u00e9pierre.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I mean, the reason I asked is it seems [indiscernible].","David E. Simon","I understand.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","[indiscernible]","David E. Simon","And I hope you understand why I couldn't answer it.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","No, I got that. It just seems like a nice area where we could put maybe $1.5 billion of additional capital at a very attractive -- well roughly a cost capital for a very attractive yield. So that's why I asked.","David E. Simon","Yes. It was in the yield on our investment in Europe in both at Kl\u00e9pierre and McArthurGlen and in Asia they have been fantastic. I mean, they've been yields so -- and that's what helped drive our industry-leading growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Steve, congrats on the even earlier retirement. So a question on Japan, I mean, I try to channel my inner David Harris. If we read the headlines correctly, retail sales in Japan have been impacted because of the increase in sales tax and yet your productivity over there is actually up year-over-year. So is it just a nuance of when the tax hit or is there a difference going on from what the newspapers are reporting versus what's going on at your outlets?","David E. Simon","Well, I think our outlets are just so uniquely positioned and with the increase in VAT -- there, clearly, you have some forward spending and then it did have an initial monthly impact, but then it's kind of leveled back. I just think the consumer there is going to look for even more value given the higher VAT rates. So we just have a unique portfolio that will continue to perform, but it's affected retail sales generally, but it's really good to be in the value space there with great product and a great retailer line up. But don't kid yourself. I mean, when you increase your VAT, you're going to affect consumption. We're just a little bit better positioned to deal with it than some other property types.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then as far as the Sears transaction goes, did the fact that Ed [ph] is going direct with retailers, does this sort of indicate that basically the gap is too wide versus what he thinks his boxes are worth and what the mall landlords think it's worth and therefore, he's just going direct or do you think that we will see some more trades? Because it would seem like the value of his boxes is maximized if you guys can get control of it and do what you want to do with it versus him doing something with it?","David E. Simon","Well, look, I keep -- look, there is a long -- we've had a, let's see, 50-some-odd year relationship with Sears through a lot of ups and downs and good times and so on. We expect to continue to have a excellent relationship. I don't think any thing is off the table, buying, selling, leasing, subleasing, working cooperatively, nothing's off the table there. Again, I think the market wants to take one scenario, extrapolate it, I appreciate that. Just like they want to take one Amazon space. It's in fact, they're doing it and extrapolate it. I don't think you're going to extrapolate anything like that. And we will -- they were -- on the Primark of King of Prussia given where they are situated in the mall and what they had already done with the one level which we cooperated, and we felt like Primark would be a very good replacement where they're situated plus we needed their cooperation. What we are trying to accomplish and it happened to be that we were absolutely aligned and that set of circumstances, and we think we created a win-win. Now I would expect given the 55-year history that we'll continue to find those kind of situations with Sears in most cases.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to just follow up on the Primark situation. We understand in Europe and London, there are kind of primarily 35,000-foot boxes. And I think the initial 7 they're taking much larger footprint. So I know you haven't announced direct deals with them, but do you anticipate or would you envision sort of more Sears sublease space? Or do you actually think you could do direct deals with them? And would you envision them kind of being an in-line tenant if [indiscernible]?","David E. Simon","No, and obviously I won't. It'll depend upon the set of circumstances. And just because the King of Prussia is one deal that we consented to doesn't necessarily mean that, that's going to be the model on all the others. So Steve, like I said, it's going to be a case-by-case scenario. I would be -- if their model is a success here, which certainly by every indication of the presence they have in Europe, you would potentially anticipate, but others have come here and have not done as well, but let's -- if it is, then I think it'll be a combination of all the above where there will be some consent with Sears on subleases, we'll lease directly. We'll redevelop pads and the like. It's all going to depend upon the set of circumstances that present itself from that property.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, part of your first answer got cut off. So I apologize if I didn't hear the whole thing. Just in terms of kind of the type of tenent they are, the price points, do you envision that they could sort of fit into a large part of the portfolio? Or do you see them in different kind of segments within the portfolio?","David E. Simon","Well, they're certainly not a luxury. So our higher-end properties probably not a great fit, but I'm going to wait and see and see how what their store looks like in the U.S., how they're -- what kind of consumer they're delivering and we'll go from there. In that King of Prussia was relatively a simple decision for us because of where that Sears box is and I think again, it's going to be dependent upon the circumstances. And I hope you can hear [ph]. I guess we're having serious problems with our communication, but I hope you can hear it, Steve.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","No, I did. And just last question. In terms of kind of the home delivery [ph] how was that sort of progressed with mall lease in general? Are there changes you're making for this upcoming holiday season and just kind of what's been early I guess maybe coming up on one year? How do you think that system and service were working?","David E. Simon","Well, the lift is one of -- just one of our efforts along those lines. I think, we're pleased as a group. They've signed up a couple of major, major retailers. And they're starting to do shipping this holiday season. And I do think, over time, there clearly is going to be the ability to deliver or pick up a lot of mall goods at the mall environment. And I think we're, as an industry and individually, we're just scratching the surface there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy [indiscernible] from EBS Security.","Unknown Analyst","Most of my questions have been answered. Just one quick one, it looks like you sold an asset this quarter and recorded a close to $80 million gain, just any color on that sale?","David E. Simon","No, just a couple of assets that didn't fit the portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","David, I wanted to get updated read from you on the upcoming holiday season. You like some of your peers noted last quarter that consumers are in a bit of a cautious state. How would you assess that mood today? And in conjunction with that, I'd love to hear your thoughts on how this year's back-to-school shopping season materialize your expectations. And what you read on the consumer pulse today and your expectation for the approaching holiday season.","David E. Simon","Simplistically, consumer, I believe, is -- continues to be somewhat cautious. The good news is, there's an environment, where I think, at some point in the near future, they will be less cautious, lower oil or lower gas prices, better job environment. Hopefully, wage growth, continuation of lower interest rates, just some of those out there. But they're still cautious. And that's how we're planning, so we're running our business. I don't like -- I am not equipped to make a forecast on the holiday season. Others might, I will not. There's lots of forecasters out there on the holiday season. The ones that I see are generally feel like it's going to be a [indiscernible] last year. Weather, hopefully, won't replicate itself the way it was, longer season, to name a couple, but I don't -- I'm not in that business.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Care to share any comments on this year's back-to-school shopping season?","David E. Simon","The -- I think it was generally spotty. I mean, I think, it was certainly wasn't robust, and I think it still represented the cautious consumer.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And just one or two things here. First, at the recent Jersey Gardens and UPV acquisitions will hit the same store in 1Q '16. And then any color on the lease termination fees? I was wondering if there are any other nonrecurring items in the quarter beyond because it looks like $0.02 of our lease termination fees and the debt prepayment charges.","David E. Simon","Typically, on Jersey Gardens, they wouldn't be in our comp NOI for '16, that's correct. And, look, listen. We've got -- given it's complicated, we are a big company. So we're always going to have other income that could be higher or lower quarter-to-quarter, same thing on the expense side. The -- but as far as I can -- having examined the financials, extremely closely, nothing jumps out at me. Lease income, lease settlement income, probably in the scheme of the total years. It's not all that different than some other previous years. It does ebb and flow. We've always got a little bit of extra income here and an extra expense, year in and year out given the nature of our business. But nothing to highlight frankly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I've question about, I guess, I call the value proposition of SPG Asset Management. If you were to benchmark the in-place rents to the 2 malls that you are buying from Glenshire [ph] to similar malls that you already own. What do you think the delta is at revenue or NOI per square foot that you could realize under your management? It there a way to estimate or quantify that for us?","David E. Simon","Well, a very good question, Jeff. I would say to you generally, we don't buy any asset if we don't feel like we can improve it. And there's -- so that's kind of a thing that we have regardless of what we do, whether it's new development, redevelopment or importantly, acquisitions. What can we do to beat the growth rate that may exist. If that asset is -- just sits there unowed [ph], but the fact of matter is, I'm not going to give you a number on that. I mean, I -- people are, again, not to put this in context, but Sawgrass is a unique animal, but when we took it over, I remember the numbers more or less correctly. It was around $55 million of NOI. And next year, we did add a little bit of space here and there and stuff but next year, generally, I think it's going to do around 130-ish. Now we haven't gone lease-by-lease. There we might skip lease-by-lease because it could take us 3 days. But I think the fact that we were able to do that, not only helps our investors, but also helps the consumers and the retailers because I think they did a lot more business with it in our hands. So we invested more in it, we drove the tourism. We've got better retailers. We've got more consumers. The retailers did more business and everybody was copacetic even though Mills have done a good job at $55 million or whatever the rough number was. So, we think, we can drive more traffic to Jersey Gardens though I firmly believe Glenshire [ph] has done a great job with that asset. So that we're experts in tourism. It's right by Newark Airport. I think we can figure out how to get a few more buses from Newark to go to Jersey before they go to -- Rick and I will flag them ourselves if we have to make the numbers work.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Maybe, Steve, that could be your next career move. Actually, a follow up also, David, as it relates to the products you're looking at Copley Place in Boston there's a lot residential product in the pipeline in Boston for sale, as well as for rent. Does that give you any pause with proceeding on that project? Or are you sort of passed the point of no return? Or are you not as concerned about it?","David E. Simon","Well, we're always focused on supply. We are not passed the point of no return. And we're still working on approval rights, both within the appropriate agencies in Boston, but also, we have to work through some of the retailer issues. So we are not at the point of no return and we studied the supply [indiscernible] similarly. And it's going to be a gut check decision here, I would say, Jeff, in the next 3 or 4 months. Generally, we still feel very, very confident about it, but that the -- this is a little bit different than what we've done historically, as you might imagine. We are really good experts on supply, understanding supply and retail, what's going to get done, what's going to have an impact in competitive world, very competitive world in retail. This one is a little bit different. We hired a couple of great experts to do comp lease. And we've got the in-house expertise. We also obviously hired the right people in Boston to help us go through that exercise, but it's a good question. It's going to be a gut check time, but we have not passed the point of no return. And, as you know, in real estate, whether it's office, retail, whatever, there's always announcements of some supply. The real question is what gets built and who gets there first and who's got staying power. I will tell you this, it's an iconic asset, it's only getting better. The design is fantastic. Boston is a great long-term city and that Lord I hope -- we have staying power. So we've got a lot of stuff on our side of the equation that gives us confidence that if we do pull the trigger, we will execute.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And maybe just a last question for Rick. I know you touched on spreads and on sympathetic to looking at it over long-term. But someone had asked earlier about the pullback in the dollar spread and that came back a little bit slightly this quarter. Is that just a function of mix maybe in the quarter? Or was there any kind of pushback from retailers in light of the softer retail sales?","Richard S. Sokolov","There really has been no pushback from the retailers in terms of their demand. And it's basically a function of mix. What yields come in, in a given period of time. So we're still seeing a very focused retailer, the one space. And candidly, you can look at that with our occupancy and with all that activity that we have going on in the portfolio.","David E. Simon","Yes. And let me -- because, again, this is a good question, it's a good focus, but let me -- let you -- I want you to understand how we think about the business. If we owned 1 property, we could absolutely maximize rent to the last penny because at the end of the day, that's all we would care about. Jeff, we believe in repeat business with our retailers. So we're always calibrating -- and we don't -- we're not perfect at this. Believe me, we make mistakes all the time. But we're always trying to calibrate the win-win, all right? How do you keep the retailer who is our -- is our customer in addition to the consumer happy? How do we reach our financial goals? But we are not getting the last dollar because we do multiple deals, multiple business with them, year-after-year, day-after-day. And so we're never going to maximize rents if we just owned 1 asset. And -- so I -- you just need to have that lens on. Yes, even with that lens on, we still out produce everybody else, but we're not trying to get to the point of no return. We're trying to find that balance. And I'll be the first to tell you, sometimes we don't do it, sometimes we make mistakes, but we're always trying to find that balance for future positive relations with our clients going forward. Just like any other business. So let's put that in that perspective, okay? But that's why we have the opportunity to find other opportunities that even though we may not maximize the spread being $9.67, is that the right number?","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","David E. Simon","It could've been $10. Maybe that $0.33 we picked up because they're going to do this and that and the other thing for us. So there's always that balance. And you've got to put it in that lens. And it's important to understand that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Sullivan from Cowen.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up to Jeff's question on Copley and I understand it's not at the point that it's finalized as you explained. But can you give us kind of a ballpark number that the project would entail in terms of total cost?","David E. Simon","Yes, sure. It's around -- the total cost, Jim, is around $5.50. And again, the vision that we have on the -- the top roughly 10 floors would be condo sales. We're also expanding Neimans as part of it and other retail. So we look at it gross, but then we have condo sales to net. And that differential, well it's an art, not necessarily a science, that differential and then we own the multi-family. That differential is roughly, don't hold me to these numbers, it's roughly a $300 million-ish differential. That puts it in this kind of financial consequence box. And that number, from a return, as we look at it, that return is acceptable given what we're doing there, okay? And I don't want it -- I'm not going to give you that number just yet, but when we go it'll be in our 8-K, but that's essentially how we're thinking about the deal.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a kind of follow-up question on the earlier discussion about Primark as well. I know you had mentioned Primark, ZARA, H&M on the second quarter call. And, obviously, the European retailers, they're kind of categorized as fast session apparel, I guess, Primark this more promotional. And all 3 have already have sizable market shares in Europe where they operate alongside smaller higher-priced, higher price point apparel retailers. Also, we obviously have, for every 21 UNIQLO growing aggressively here, I'm just curious, if we assume that these large-format retailers continue to grow their share of apparel sales, do you view that as a positive or a negative regarding the same property NOI growth prospects of this domestic Simon portfolio?","Richard S. Sokolov","It's Rick. I think that we price our real estate based on what we believe is the value of the real estate. And everyone is going to have to compete for that real estate. The bottom line is that it has taken H&M a very long time. They are now happily established and growing substantially. We're working with ZARA, but frankly, we have a lot of very established domestic retailers here that are very competitive and continuing to grow. So the more people we have are interested in our properties, the better off we are will enhance this demand and our job is to do the right tenant mix and to price the space right, and I think we've been doing pretty well so far.","David E. Simon","Yes, but it's a good question and its again, it's a little more art than science. You've got to weigh the traffic that they may generate versus the competitive nature they may put certain retailers under. And whether or not they're bringing a different consumer in. So you put it all together and you got to make judgment calls day in and day out. So -- but it's a good question and it's an art. You got to be very, very thoughtful about that, Jim.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Then finally for me, and I maybe asking you to repeat yourself, David, but, I think, you did cut out on this. In terms of the Primark deal at King of Prussia, you mentioned it was, I think, is an easier decision because of the specific location. Can you just clarify what you meant by that?","David E. Simon","Well, if you've been to the mall, they're -- in this case, the Sears box is not as well located as if it were in the middle of the mall. And our decision may have been a little bit different had it been. And it just -- so it's really a location issue. And the power of that mall is shifting in terms of kind of a focal point given our expansion is now -- we're actually under construction and it was really -- we felt good about it, and we've got Sears' cooperation on what we were trying to accomplish to improve the mall, and we did think that because of their position, Primark would be great to drive traffic down to that wing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a quick question. On last quarter, you guys talked about a couple of deals on the development side that were not outlets. I'm just curious if there's anything to update on that front.","David E. Simon","You mean on full price?","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right.","David E. Simon","Yes. We are getting closer, not quite there, but we're working diligently on 1 ground-up full-price development that, I'd say over the next short period of time, that we'll be making an announcement on. It's not quite everything is done, but we are optimistic that this will be a partnership that we're looking forward to, to working on, but it's not quite all done, handshakes in place, but stay tuned on that. We think it'll be great and it will be besides the redevelopment, it will be our first full price now in quite some time.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And do you have a rough size sort of size?","David E. Simon","The total investment will be north of $200 million. And we're going to be around the 50% owner.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Mueller from JP Morgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm curious, if you would weight your sales based on mall NOI, how different would that number be compared to the $613 that you report?","David E. Simon","Great question. It would be much higher. But that's a great question because -- it's a great question and in fact, because every dollar is the same, it doesn't really -- it doesn't, obviously, doesn't do that. But the fact is we could do it, but I don't have the [indiscernible] about 10% higher.","Stephen E. Sterrett","Yes, 10% higher.","David E. Simon","10%. Steve Sterrett -- he's leaving so I wouldn't count on any numbers that he said. Steve Sterrett says its 10%, but, I think, we could probably do a little bit more work and get a better number, but is a very interesting question.","Operator","There are no further questions so I'll turn it back to David Simon for closing remarks.","David E. Simon","Okay. Thank you, and I look forward to seeing you in the future.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com.","For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you. We had a productive quarter. We're pleased with our strong financial results. We started, completed, opened several significant redevelopment and new development projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio. We completed the acquisition of The Shops at Crystals, and we continue to achieve strong operating and financial results and raised our dividend yet again. Results in the quarter were highlighted by FFO of $2.63 per share on a comparable basis excluding a gain on the sale of marketable securities. In the prior year period, FFO per diluted share increased 9.1% or $0.22 year-over-year for the quarter. And for the first six months, our comparable FFO per diluted share is up 12.1% compared to the prior year period.","Our operating metrics were strong as well as our cash flow. Our mall and premium outlet occupancy was 95.9%. The 20-basis point decrease in occupancy from the prior year period is a direct result due to the new developments and expansions we opened recently. Leasing activity remains healthy. The malls and premium outlets recorded releasing spreads of $8.88 per square foot, an increase of 14.8%, and our base minimum rent was $50.43 which was up 4.9% compared to last year, reflecting the strong retail demand for our location.","And as a reminder, we provided additional new metrics summarizing the composition of our total portfolio NOI. Please see this in the supplemental and the release. And for the second quarter of 2016, our total portfolio NOI increased 7.4% and has increased 7.6% year-to-date. Our comp NOI increased 3.2% for the quarter and is up 4.1% year-to-date. Total reported retail sales per square foot at our mall and outlets were $6.07 compared to $6.20 in the prior year period.","Let me put a couple things in perspective. Reported retail sales continue to be negatively impacted by the strong dollar at some of our tourist-oriented malls and outlets. Reported sales per square foot for the malls was down slightly compared to the prior year, primarily due to a retailer and a state with no sales tax, implementing sales restrictions. We mentioned this previously and is important to reiterate and excluding this anomaly, our mall sales per square foot increased for the period. Lower tourism spending continues to impact retail sales at some of our premium outlets. Excluding the negative impact of these high performing tourist-oriented centers, retail reported sales per square foot for the premium outlets was flat. In fact, our traffic in our outlet business thus far is up 2.65% for the year. And finally, the second quarter I'd like to point out that retail sales trends improved progressively with June, recording the strongest monthly sales performance with total sales volume at comparable properties increasing across all of our property types.","At the end of the quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing at 33 properties across the platforms. Our share is $1.4 billion. We continue to expand, transform, enhance our properties. We completed Stanford Shopping Center. And over the next several weeks, we'll complete a number of other transformative and redevelopments including the completion of the connector at King of Prussia that will link the court and the plaza, creating 50 new specialty stores, a comprehensive redevelopment expansion to The Fashion Centre at Pentagon City, a densification of Phipps Plaza with the completion of AC Hotel by Marriott and multi-family residential units. We're also underway with the transformation of La Plaza in McAllen, Texas where we demolished the former Sears box, are under construction on an expansion wing that will accommodate up to 50 specialty stores, four junior anchors and exciting new dining plaza, all of these are accretive returns. We'll continue to flow and fuel our profitability and construction includes among others, but not an exhaustive list, Woodbury Common, Sawgrass Mills, The Galleria in Houston and on.","Our new development is focused on important markets where demand is there. During the quarter, we opened a new Tanger Outlet in Columbus. It's off to a great start. It's been a partnership with Steve. Our construction continues on our new outlet in Clarksburg, Maryland which will open in the fourth quarter of this year. We also recently broke ground on a new outlet Norfolk, Virginia which will open in mid-2017.","We've got exciting projects in \u2013 outside the U.S. We have an outlet under construction in Provence, France, South Korea and Canada, all will open in 2017, also fueling our growth. We also recently started construction in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia with Genting who is our partner in our other Malaysia asset. And construction is nearing completion at Brickell Centre in Miami. The center is almost entirely leased with 80 retailers and restaurants coming to projects. And we're also continuing construction with our high end retail projects in Fort Worth, anchored by Neiman The Shops at Clearfork.","Acquisitions beyond Crystals, we also bought our partner out in our Naples and Venice outlets. So we now effectively own 90% of these two great assets. We completed \u2013 turning to capital markets. We completed a successful euro senior offering, \u20ac500 million at 1.25% for nine years. Our liquidity stands at $6 billion, and we have an industry leading balance sheet as we hope you know.","We increased our dividend 6.5% year-over-year, 3% from the second quarter and we'll pay at least $6.50 which will be 7% over last year. We've also increased our guidance from $10.77 to $10.85. This reflects solid performance in the first half. In our current view, the remainder of the year, we are very pleased with our performance.","Questions are available.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, thank you. David, you referenced that there was a pickup in June relative to some of the other months. Do you think that we will start to see the annualization of the international shopper pullback? And will that have less of an impact in the numbers going forward?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, look I think it's hard to predict, Craig. It's good to see the June sales for our retailers were up. We're starting to see the stronger dollar anniversary, so it'll have less impact on the metrics, but I think more importantly, we're seeing other than the anomaly I talked about in the one \u2013 with the one state, our sales were fine and the portfolio outside the tour centers, sales are fine. And we're operating pretty effectively in a very slow growth U.S. economy. So the anniversary impact is coming up in the next few months. We're starting to see it stabilize, but it's very hard to predict.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then you've expanded your presence obviously in Las Vegas with Crystals, I just wondered if there would be differing strategies going forward, where you might take Forum Shops one direction and Crystals in another?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I think they're \u2013 as you know, Vegas, there's so much tourism there, I mean 50 million visitors a year. Each has its own distinct separate marketplace. They, obviously Forum Shops is bigger. It caters to not only a high end consumer, but also a broader consumer. Crystals is more luxury oriented. So I think they both have distinct markets. We'll continue to take advantage of those great assets, and continue to drive the income up in both. So I don't think there'll be a huge change in strategy, but a continuation of improving operations in both assets.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Hi. Good morning, David.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Hi. Look, I know a lot of the metrics were fairly positive. I guess the one that just sort of jumped out was sort of the rolling 12 month leasing spread which had a noticeable drop from 17.5% to just under 15%. Is there anything that sort of happened in this quarter that would have pulled that number down, and what do you think is a reasonable expectation going forward?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, look, again, I respect that everyone loves to focus on operating metrics, as you \u2013 you know me pretty well, Steve. What's the one operating metric that I focus on? Is this the question?","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","I know you \u2013 total NOI growth and total sales?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I look at cash flow growth, my friend, okay. So the other thing that I'd like to point out on that is that we put our entire bucket of activity in that number. I don't know what others do but \u2013 so, if we have as an example lease amendments, let's say we have a retailer that we have to restructure because we figure, well, let's keep him in, and operating while we'll ultimately release the space. That amendment goes into that spread. And, if there's anything \u2013 again, I'm pleased with the spread. I think we've so much outperformed on our spread that that number of 15% is pretty damn good, $8.88 over ending rent for new rent is pretty damn good.","But put that aside, if you are looking to grasp on anything, I would say it's somewhat affected by the fact that we have amendments due to some of the retailer situations that we've been dealing with over the last 12 months. I'm very pleased with the spread. $9 is a good number in a flat economy. I also \u2013 you look at our comp NOI which is where I'm focused on cash flow growth. You look at our comp NOI, we haven't just had a couple of years of good numbers, we've had a decade of outperformance versus our peer group. And as you know, when you comp over a comp over a comp over a comp, that's pretty damn good.","So we're very pleased with the number. If you want to point out something which I know is your job to do, I would say it's more the amendments which we view is something that we're doing in a very slow economic growth environment in the U.S. And we're dealing with that effectively and yet we're still producing very healthy spreads.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Okay. No, that's helpful. I guess, just secondly, in terms of sort of recapturing some of the department stores and the JVs that you got with Seritage, can you just sort of provide an update on sort of where you stand and the opportunities that you see over the next couple of years to maybe recapture some more boxes?","Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Steve, Rick Sokolov. We have continued to work with Seritage and Sears. We've got users identified for our properties in Seritage. As we mentioned last quarter, we're working with Sears just on how to downsize their stores, and that process is ongoing. I will tell you, if you look over the years, we recaptured 93 department stores and we've done a very effective job of deploying them. If you look at our anchor schedule, we have been going on right now, it's an ongoing process. We have a whole team dedicated to it. And the good news is we have substantial demand identified in each of our properties, so we know how we're going to deal with any of these stores that we do get the opportunity to recapture. David talked about La Plaza which was a Sears store. We got a Sears store back at College Mall. Now demolished and we're adding 365 Whole Foods, Ulta, small shops and restaurants. We're making money and making the properties better.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Morgan with Canaccord. Your line is open.","Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","As you look at the development and redevelopment pipeline, you've got $2.1 billion your share of cost for the projects that are going now and almost that in CIP (17:33), how should we think about kind of beyond the projects that are kind of in place right now, what the shadow pipeline looks like? I mean you talked about it is a tougher environment. I mean do think that this could be a peak that would slow going forward as some of these project completions roll off looking into next year or do you think you've got a shadow pipeline that's going to keep it going at around this level?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me answer it this way. We actually had a meeting yesterday on Sawgrass Mills and Jersey Gardens is just two examples that together would be $500 million to $600 million of redevelopment. So we're very comfortable and confident, Paul, that even the retail \u2013 the retail sales have been anemic this year that when you have properties like that that can't be expanded. We have the appropriate amount of demand to make financial \u2013 make the financial consequences very positive for the company in addition to making those properties even more important. So I don't think we're backing off at all or redevelopment and expansion of portfolio. The good news is we have such a good number of high quality assets that we'll continue to find opportunities to expand them. And I like I said, I mean Jersey Gardens and Sawgrass are just two simple examples that pope to mind, but that's going to be $500 million to $600 million spread and will be hopefully delivered in 2019-ish, maybe 2020-ish. And we'll continue to enhance their marketplace position.","So we haven't really changed. I think if we've changed anything is \u2013 and I mentioned, I think the last call or call before that, we put a lot in the system and that's kind of a little bit about \u2013 you saw the 20-basis point getting out. You might react to 20 basis points decrease in occupancy, I assure you I do not, okay. I assure you I do not. But let's \u2013 but we put a lot in the system over the last whatever six months, primarily in the outlet that we've decided to spread some of those new ground up developments out a little bit so that we don't stress the system. And we get the lease-up that we want in those. But our strategy really hasn't changed. And I think we've got plenty of opportunities continue to enhance our portfolio.","Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then my other question, you've talked about and you provided a list of, pretty long list of e-retailers who are looking to open stores in your malls. And I wonder if you have an update on kind of how those rollouts are being received, whether some of these retailers might be initially opening three or four, these could become 20 or 30 or 40 or kind of how it's been playing out so far?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well. I'll let Rick do his list, and I appreciate you giving him the opportunity because he loves to read his list. I will say this though, there's so much creative stuff going on with new ideas, new concepts that as a simple example, we did a pop-up store with Woodbury Commons with Rent the Runway, where they actually sold some of their existing inventory. And it had unbelievable success. I'm not going to tell you how much they sold because I don't frankly know if I'm allowed to or whatever. But there's a lot of creativity and a lot e-tailers that want access to the physical world, and that's just a small example of a unique idea. I actually happen to meet with the CEO and said, do a pop-up store at Woodbury, okay. They did it, they had a great success. But now I'll turn it over to Rick to give you the list.","Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","The other thing I would tell you is there have been a number of them and we listed them. Obviously, you've \u2013 we talked about Fabletics, Birchbox, Yogasmoga. Everyone understands what the dynamic is going with Amazon. We just made a deal with UNTUCKit. The most important aspect of this is that all of these retailers that have Internet presence understand that a bricks-and-mortar presence in an essential part of their strategy. They get much higher conversion in their store. Their customer acquisition is frankly cheaper, and it's something that we're seeing more and more. We're working with frankly scores of them to come to our properties. It's certainly going to be a source of growth for us going forward in the out years.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And the condition on doing that deal was that Rick could not wear the UNTUCKit shirt, okay.","Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","All brand negative (23:33)","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. And so it's in the lease.","Paul B. Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No worries.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with UBS. Your line is open.","Robert Jeremy Metz - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. David, earlier you mentioned lease amendments having a bit of an impact on releasing spreads. Obviously, you're taking a selective approach here. But I was just wondering if \u2013 more generally are you seeing an increased level of tenants coming to you, looking for lease amendments or would it more or less be consistent with the prior couple years?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's really \u2013 I mean obviously there's some high level news out there with certain retailers. And it's really more of that category than just the person here and a person there. So it's kind of what you've seen. We have less year-to-date bankruptcies than we did last year, but so some of that's just rolling through the numbers that we had to deal with last year.","Robert Jeremy Metz - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just sticking with leasing here, obviously, more sales moving online and not maybe getting captured in your sales or occupancy cost figures. I'm just wondering, are you exploring any changes to your lease structures at all at this point to better capture and monitor those sales?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, again, our view is to get the market rent that's appropriate for that space. And retail reported and I underscore reported retail sales does not necessarily, as we've had this discussion, correlate to what the market rent for that space is. It's more of a function of location, property, location in the mall, property type, position in the marketplace and so on. So our focus is getting market rent for each and every space and doing it in a way that does not put us at risk with their sales and what we get paid for that space.","And that's not changing. Now there's a lot of things going on in the lease in terms of getting credit if they \u2013 the sale \u2013 again this is only a case when you have overage rent and we're hopefully marking at the market where overage rent, they've got to really outperform to pay us overage rent. But in order to \u2013 in their reported sales number, we're negotiating including if it's something fulfilled from the POS system and so on, that it be included in their reported sales number. But again, our focus is more on what the market rent for that space is as opposed to necessarily what the tenants' sales are going to be out of that space.","Robert Jeremy Metz - UBS Securities LLC","Good. Appreciate the color.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, good morning. You kind of touched on it earlier, but you guys have two ground-up outlets in process now for being developed in Virginia and Maryland and a number of full-price mall expansions going on. So how would you describe the demand for that space either outlet versus full-price or either one versus itself a year or two ago?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would say to you that the only \u2013 first of all, Clarksburg is going to \u2013 I mean Columbus, where we partnered with Tanger was 100% leased I think, maybe there's a couple of vacancies. So that was not impacted at all. We've got Clarksburg, where I think, it's going to be a great development, opens up in Q4. We've got \u2013 in that case, we are bringing in a very, what I'd call a high end mix, because we really kind of want that to be ultimately kind of the Woodbury \u2013 this is an over exaggeration, so don't hold me to it, but we wanted to kind of be the high end fashion outlet for the mid-Atlantic more or less.","And so there's \u2013 those retailers sometimes getting them to commit to a new outlet is a little longer process, because in a lot of cases, they don't manufacture for it and it's a function of their full-price strategy. I won't bore you with all the ins and outs of that, but that's going to deliver \u2013 we're going to deliver a great mix, and I think the demand has been excellent and we're going to hold a couple of spaces just to fill out the kind of the unique mix there and I'd say that the \u2013 I'd say the outlet demand for new product is good. It's not \u2013 it really hasn't changed.","The only thing that I would say for new projects is the luxury-oriented folks are taking a little bit of a more \u2013 a little bit of a breather \u2013 a lot of that because of what's going on with tourism. So that's a little bit what I'd call softer than it might have been a year plus ago. But not material as evidenced by the mix that we're producing at Brickell which is going to be a great project that the three partners have worked very hard to produce.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then it seems like over the past couple years, some kind of bright spots at the mall in terms of who's been opening and who's been doing well that you and your peers have talked about includes fast-fashion and restaurants. So was just wondering if those types of mall tenants are still generally looking to have larger stores or more stores or just generally doing maybe better than the other apparel type guys?","Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hi, this is Rick. We are continuing to very much focus on the addition of restaurants and food throughout the portfolios. There is still a considerable amount of demand. Just to let you know, last five years, we've added almost 200 restaurants across our portfolio. We had 25 last year. We have another 53 scheduled to open this year and next year. And so they're also finding substantially increased productivity when they are associated with our projects as opposed to a freestanding pad and that has certainly helped that demand.","In terms of the other tenants you alluded to. Certainly, the international tenants are continuing to grow. We've got and we've already talked about e-tailers, we've got brand extensions. There is still considerable demand for our space, and we're doing okay.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And, as Rick said, the restaurant demand is great.","Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yes.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning out there.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. We are out here. We are out here in the Great Midwest.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Increasingly important part of the country this year.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You bet, you.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","So just a few questions here, David. First, you guys obviously disclosed your rent spreads, and those sort of stats, and stay up (31:55), but can you give a little bit more color on sort of same-center ancillary income growth. As you guys have rolled out that program, is it still growing, is the growth really coming from rolling out more and more ancillary at each mall, or is it more or that maybe you've maxed out individual malls, so that more of the growth is coming as you roll out different programs to new malls and outlets too?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would \u2013 let me give you just a big picture view. I would say, it's actually in the \u2013 when you ancillary a lot of \u2013 put kind of our SPV effort to a side, we've actually reduced it pretty significantly in our high end portfolio. So we've cleaned out what I'll call a lot of stuff. And again, we think that's the right thing to do. It's maybe, it's clearly costing us some income, but at the end of the day, we think it's the right thing to do. So, if you look at kind of our high end portfolio, we've cleaned a lot of stuff out. And we're very sensitive to creating the environment where those retailers can do the most business. So, if anything, we've suffered dilution, and you know how I love cash flow but I've got to do \u2013 I've got to balance that. So we've actually reduced that and that's hurt us over the last few quarters. In the outlet business, it's probably picked up a little bit. So there again \u2013 there is an answer for everything, but I think we've done a \u2013 we put in some, what I'd call, veteran mall people to kind of run that business over the last couple years, and they've actually done a pretty nice job, increasing those ancillary. So, up in outlet, down in the high end malls, pretty significantly, and I think the rest of it's kind of commensurate with the marketplace.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Can you \u2013 but as far as the reduction at the high end malls, can you just give sort of a magnitude like a percentage like if you had a \u2013 was it a 5% reduction to overall ancillary income, 10% when you look in the aggregate what you guys do?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's enough for me to notice, but we put it all in our numbers and our numbers are our numbers, so I don't want to get into what amount, but it's been \u2013 it could be \u2013 let me frame it this way a little bit. It could be, at a big mall, $1 million bucks, how's that? How's that if you really want to pinpoint the \u2013 on something.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","$1 million...?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, at a big mall. At a big mall, it could be $1 million.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","So $1 million going away?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, no. At a big mall \u2013 at one big mall.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So we've done it at a handful of malls, but at a big mall, it can be $1 million.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. That's helpful. Second question is, just looking at your European portfolio, obviously, a lot of unfortunate tragic events that have occurred, what has been the impact at the retail level? Have \u2013 is it people are going forward and life goes on or have you seen any impact to either tenant openings or sales or anything like that or maybe just increased expenses from things that have to be done?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, in our ownership interest again, we have basically two ways we operate in, in Europe. We own properties through \u2013 primarily through McArthurGlen. And then we have our ownership interest in Kl\u00e9pierre. Kl\u00e9pierre is a public company. I think they reported today. And their numbers have been pretty good, look at retail sales. The only country that I'd say which is not insignificant here that's a little bit underperforming, but still up, is in France. And I don't know that I'd necessarily equate that to the \u2013 what's happened terrorist-wise, but just France general economy is a little bit behind, say Italy, Spain and the Netherlands and Scandinavia and so on. So but that's \u2013 all that data is out there for you. I think their business is actually pretty decent and they chug along. We see no impact whatsoever in our McArthurGlen portfolio.","Look, they have \u2013 their assets are in a lot of cases tourist-oriented. And so if tourism changes they'll have that you'll see that impact a little bit. But we haven't seen it so far. Their numbers have been pretty impressive year-to-date.","Alexander D. Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Thanks a lot, David.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning, Michael Bilerman as well.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Just a follow-up on the department store recapture. To what extent do you think we'll continue to see department store closings? And how do you think about sort of the economics of redeveloping a box like that in terms of the cost per square foot of the redevelopment and then looking at sort of the rent that you can get on new tenants versus the increased rents of the department stores currently there?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Christy, first off, all of our recapture activity has been included in all of our development yield tables. And I think we've said that we work it out and we get comparable yield that we can get in the rest of our development projects. There's a range from the high single-digit, low double-digit. We've identified the boxes and every deal is unique as to what the costs would be for redeveloping the box. Is it a full box user, are we splitting the box? How the box is configured? But all of those yields are in and the most important thing is that we've been able to produce our results and we've had a great deal of activity in that sector as witnessed by all the anchors that we continue to add across the company.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And are you closer to executing on some of the Seritage deal?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry, could you repeat that?","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Are you closer to executing on some of the Seritage projects that you've discussed...","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're again working with Sears on the economics and configuration of their downsizes. As soon as we have that in place, we'll be able to proceed. We have identified and have firmed up commitments for the vast majority of those boxes.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, David, it's Michael Bilerman. I had a quick question on the balance sheet. Back at our conference in March, you talked about wanting to sort of hoard more capital at this stage, rather than spending a lot of capital. And if you look at the balance sheet today, it's the best it's ever been in your entire history. You talk about $6 billion of liquidity and significant amount of balance sheet capacity and unbelievable cost of capital. How should we interpret that position? And is it gearing up to be able to be opportunistic in the next cycle or still within this cycle? And how should we think about the capital that you have?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, look, I love being in the spot that we're in. We have no plans. As you know, we said it publicly, we're out of the big deal business. I mean I reserve the right to change my mind I guess. But if you ask me today, I'm out of the big deal business. Eventually, as we all know, there's going to be cycles in our \u2013 in economic world that we live in. And Rick and I are grizzled veterans, when it comes to real estate, recessions and stuff.","I mean so it's always good to be in that spot. Obviously, Andy is here. We've worked very hard to be in that spot. It allows us to grow our dividend. It allows us to put capital back into the business that feeds on itself. So I think pretty much nothing's changed, Michael, it's business as usual. We have no intention of really doing anything with that other than continuing to build that. And I don't if there'll be a cycle. I have no idea, but we are out of the big deal business and we're going to maintain that kind of liquidity and capital, primarily to \u2013 that's the balance sheet we want. We think that should be valued by the market. I'll let you decide whether it is or isn't. I don't know and it allows us to reinvest in our portfolio. I think the one thing that that we all talk about physical retail and we talk about physical real estate and I don't care of what, whether it's an office, a hotel, a mall or strip center, if you don't have a good looking product and you're not, your customer's not going to show up.","And if you're \u2013 if you got an apartment building, you got an office building, you got a mall, you got a strip center, you got a physical retail store, if it doesn't look good and then it's not, doesn't have the right services, and it doesn't have the right tenant mix or clientele, you're going somewhere down the road, that's the competitive society that we live in. And I think our capital allows us to try. We don't execute this the way, I think we can continue to be better, much better in this. But our balance sheet allows us to have a really, really, really good looking physical product and we've got a lot of work to continue to make it even better, better, better. And I would encourage anybody that owns physical real estate or leases physical real estate, that's our goal, that's our job. You got to have \u2013 I mean, just like if you're Boeing, and you're manufacturing airplanes, you go to their manufacturing facility, I guarantee it's state-of-the-art beautiful, and that's what they do with their capital.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Right. And you're still earning very good returns on that incremental investment so it's creating a lot of underlying value as well?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And that's why we have the balance sheet that we've got today.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Right. Well, then the question is whether you think there's going to be something bigger from an investment perspective at your assets that you want to position for, right. So being able \u2013 Christy asked about the department stores, whether you'd become much more aggressive at putting a lot of capital and being very aggressive in the near-term to sort of attack that, right, having to \u2013 it's not being out of the big deal business buying someone else, but you can certainly produce something internally with your own space that may require above average capital spend for a period of time?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, look, I think with all the activity there, I think we see that kind of continuing at the pace that it's been. I mean we've been obviously very active the last few years doing that, and lot of this good stuff is coming online. So I think, if outlet new development slows, I mean that's more capital that we can dedicate to getting the box money back. So I kind of see that as a steady state frankly. So, but I don't \u2013 we're not warehousing capital to do some big transaction. It's basically to continue to be a appropriately rated company and continuing to have the capital to invest in our products. That's the goal.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks, David.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Adornato with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Paul Edward Adornato - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. Good morning. Was wondering if you could provide an update on what you're seeing in terms of traffic at your properties, appreciate your comments on the tourist visits, but what else are you seeing in terms of traffic?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you may have missed this. In the outlet business, our traffic is up 2.65% year-to-date, even though spend is down in some of the tourist-oriented centers.","Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","On the malls, what we're finding is that the traffic is stable, and interestingly, I know a lot of retailers have reported decreased traffic. What we're seeing is that the consumers are still in our properties, but they are visiting less stores on each visit, and it gets back to David's point about the physical presentation. Our retailers need to have stores that present compelling reasons for these consumers to visit them as they're walking our properties. So there will be less traffic because they're stopping in less stores, but the measures that we look at, the traffic in our properties overall is stable.","Paul Edward Adornato - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And so, as a follow-up, whose problem is that when it comes to leasing? Does that fall back on the retailer or ultimately you need to attract that retailer as well?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, listen, we're going to take responsibility as well. The retailer needs too. I think we're all in this together kind of deal. So we've got to have the right retail mix. We've also got to be able to introduce technology in the mall that gets people to visit. I think what Rick was really saying is that with all of the research that's done by consumers and when they go to the mall, they're not probably doing as much window shopping as they probably have done historically. They're more kind of on a mission to \u2013 they know they want to go to these three stores. It's our goal, and obviously the retailers' goal, but it's our goal to get them to spend more time, more time means more spend and visit more stores. We have to take some of that responsibility as well. We're certainly not shirking that. And I think that's where technology can help us do that.","Paul Edward Adornato - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. And so what specifically are you rolling out and how is that going in terms of...","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we got \u2013 we have much too long of a conversation to do that, but there's a lot of communication that we're doing directly to the consumer that we will hope, we'll hope that it will get the consumer to stay longer as well as visit more stores. The communication helps visit more stores. Staying longer I think is on ambience, a diverse \u2013 more mix, restaurants, entertainment, et cetera, that will help in that cause.","Paul Edward Adornato - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I know we've talked about the rent spreads earlier, but just curious in the context of the commentary about the overall economy being soft, that's been your commentary for quite some time as well as...","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","By the way, have I been accurate in that? I just want to know.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No, you have been accurate. No question there. I guess the question is just around sort of pricing power with your tenants, I mean however you want to define it if rent spread's not necessarily the best metric. Just curious if there's been any change there?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I said rent spreads, somebody asked me a question, I explained to you that we put amendments in our rent spreads, okay. And if I had to isolate \u2013 again, I think the $8.88 is pretty damn good, but if you had to isolate, why wasn't it 17%, it's because of certain amendments where we're taking the decision either to work with the retailer or do it more of on a temporary fashion while we re-lease the space which makes economic sense.","And again I would also point out that year-to-date our comp NOI is up 4%, 4.1%. The economy is growing at 1%. I don't know, you tell me what it is. You got a bunch of people on your payroll that will tell you what the economy is growing. Maybe not on your payroll, but on the bank's payroll. And we're outperforming 300 basis points which is not \u2013 You got to put it in perspective, so what's your question?","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I guess the question was regardless of the spread, I mean how are you thinking about pricing power with your tenants today versus maybe six months ago or a year ago?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think every \u2013 we don't have a cookie cutter commodity product. So every deal is different. In some cases, we have pricing power. And frankly, in some cases, we don't because of whatever, competitive situation, bad space, mediocre asset. In some cases, we have great space, great asset, high demand. We put it all in the blender, we produce the results that we produced. And I don't \u2013 I can't answer \u2013 I don't have a cookie cutter answer for you. I mean it is deal-by-deal. We are driven deal-by-deal, space-by-space, lease-by-lease. We've been doing it for a lot of years and that's what we continue to do. And there's just no easy answer I can give to you. Other than all of that dynamics of what I just described, funnel into our numbers, that funnel into the results, and then we declare our results.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's fair enough. Another question just \u2013 in terms of the investment side of things, I know you're out of the big deal business here, and you also said that, you're not really seeing any real impacts in Europe as of yet. But I was just curious if you \u2013 do you expect to see some opportunities open up over there particularly in the UK, obviously, the dollar is strong right now, so it would help the investment case, although I know that's not your focus, but just curious how you're thinking about the investment opportunity over there?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, look, I think all of those transactions are very difficult. I mean I \u2013 here is my short answer on the UK, so I offered a company who bought an asset, diluted the company's shareholders down by 25%, I offered \u00a34.25, they told me the company was worth \u00a36.50, and the stock today is trading at \u00a32.70, okay. So I'm not enthralled with \u2013 I think the UK \u2013 it's impossible to make deals happen unless somebody wants something to happen. So I'm out of the big deal business. The UK, I've no interest in the UK where \u2013 other than I have a affinity to a football club there that I really love, okay. But, beyond that, I doubt that there'll be any great opportunities in those markets...","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, no worries.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning, guys.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Go back (53:55) if I could to the Seritage stuff that a couple of people have asked about. The first thing, Rick, I'm curious, I thought when these were all set up originally, each of the boxes, there was a specific plan laid out for which part Sears would get and which part Seritage would get. And so are you guys negotiating to try to change that or try to take more of the space, I guess from the Sears... (54:23)?","Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","The primary discussion is just on the cost of implementing the agreed upon downsizes. In a couple of instances, the way that we've been able to procure users would make it more efficient for both Sears and us if there were slight reconfigurations, but that's not the issue. It's just a process of, you talk about loading docks and separating air conditioning systems and vertical escalation systems and entrances, it's just a complicated process that we're going through.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Then I find also then on that, you hint at some point the landlord has to provide Sears with a six-month notice to vacate and then they have six months to actually leave the property, have you guys given or I guess has Seritage given or the joint venture given notice to Sears yet to vacate those various assets?","Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","We have not and we will not until we have a firm understanding of what our capital requirements are and what our returns are going to be, and we can't do that until we finalize these discussions.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. So none of the stores have been given that six-month notice?","Richard S. Sokolov - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","No.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then the last thing guys is, do you still own the Seritage stock that you got as part of this whole transaction?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And you plan to keep that I guess, is that the idea?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I mean the plan, plan is a funny word, right. Hard to say, Rich. No real \u2013 just hard to say.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. All right. Good. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, no worries.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. So just a broader question about market rents for A malls, if look back at a couple two years of leasing activity, you roughly signed rents at $68 of square foot to $70 a square foot, I would think over a two-year period or more, the noise of good spaces versus bad spaces probably gets out of your away with law of large numbers. So just curious, do you think market rents on average for your product has grown recently and what do you think will happen going forward?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we don't \u2013 we give you every year our earnings estimates, our comp NOI estimates, and that's made up of a lot of things, and including our view of what certain spaces are worth and what we think there'll be \u2013 the rents are. So I mean I don't know what else \u2013 I mean, that what else I can tell you that other than what I've already said earlier.","We haven't backed off or \u2013 if anything, we've increased our guidance. We haven't backed off our comp or portfolio NOI. We've actually outperformed so far. All that kind of ultimately shows itself kind of our view. And, again, we don't have \u2013 it's not like we can \u2013 it's \u2013 we're not a hotel, so even if we \u2013 our market rent view changed up or down, I don't control the \u2013 they have a lease there. So, again, it's only going to impact, what, 8% of portfolio per year. So we always \u2013 take an example, let's say we got nervous and we cut all these bad deals, wouldn't really impact us at the end of the day because it's only 8% of the portfolio per annum. Now, if you did it several years in a row, we catch up with this. So, again, market rents, it's not \u2013 I don't mark my portfolio up or down every day like I do a hotel business. That's why we have stability of cash flow. That's why we can withstand cycles. That's why we've had this history of comp NOI increases, and I don't know what else I can do other than answer it in that fashion.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. I mean the reason I ask is just trying to gauge the difference between the NOI growth from \u2013 stemming from favorable vintage releasing which is any real estate company versus market rent growth. That's why I asked that question. But my second question is more on leverage. You've always done a little mix of European denominated debt or euro denominated debt versus U.S. I'm assuming that spread has gotten more favorable towards the euro. Any change in larger plans of how to refinance from debt coming due, maybe more geared towards Europe versus here?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I mean we're pretty much hedged on the margin, and so we're not going to get over allocated to euro. We're only going to finance kind of what our investment base there is and we are pretty much hedged. So, if we \u2013 even though there may be a rate differential, we'd have to swap it back to the U.S. dollars because otherwise we would be over allocated and we are, as I said, we're hedged. And that could be something we would look at. But we \u2013 to me, it's a little too cute. I'd rather finance my U.S. assets in U.S. dollars, and my European assets in European dollars, and my Japanese assets in yen, and the currency fluctuations are the currency fluctuations and we have the natural hedge with our investment base. And that's been the strategy. I don't think it'll change.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Okay. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Hi, just have a couple quick numbers question. One, are there any material Crystal acquisition costs in the quarter? And then, secondly, your occupancy cost was $12.7 million in the quarter. How does that compare to the combined levels that you had in say 2007, 2008?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean I don't have \u2013 the answer is no, and the first one, and then Tom will get back to you on what our occupancy costs in 2007, 2008 is. I don't recall, frankly.","Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No worries.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. Two quick questions from me. I'm sorry if I missed this previously, but you mentioned about the anomaly with some sort of sales restrictions in a particular state, and again, I'm sorry if I missed it, but could you elaborate on that?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you. And then, secondly, I know you've said you're out of the big deal business, and you said that there's not necessarily opportunities in Europe.

Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Yes. Good morning. Just a quick question around the lease amendments that you talked about earlier on that has some impact on releasing spreads. Is there any other detail you can kind of share about those amendments, kind of how they come up, why the decision was made to actually do them?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's a lease-by-lease, store-by-store, mall-by-mall analysis. And I mean we make judgment call, that's what we do every day, judge. Do we want to re-lease it, how, what's the downtime, is \u2013 does it give us time to re-lease it, on and on and on. So it's 50 years of experience that goes into that.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And there is a mix of tenants like large national guys and local guys, and it's like a whole mix of people, that are kind of impacted by that?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's just the nature of our business for many, many years about what the right thing to do is with that retailer in that specific space.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. No worries.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum with Boenning. Your line is open.","Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you. I'll keep it very short because I know there are some other calls coming up, but David and Rick, quick question. Your vision of the mall in five years, how is the tenant composition today going to change in your view in terms of the percentage of, for example, entertainment as a percentage of the overall mall tenant base?","David E. Simon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, look, the simple answer is there's no cookie cutter answer, and it's all going to be \u2013 the mall business and the retail business, you can have these big overwriting things, but the reality is how it gets executed really focuses on trade area-by-trade area, layout-by-layout, physical configuration-by-physical configuration. And so therefore, there's no overall answer to that, other than simplistically, I think the mix will be more diverse. There will be more entertainment, more food services, more other services, and there'll be technology in it to enhance the shopping experiences. There'll be more services, but how that all gets computed into one particular scenario will depend differently on the North side of Indianapolis versus the South side of Indianapolis. So that's just the nature of our projects, and the good news is we've got an organization that can figure out, I hope the North side of Indianapolis versus the South side of Indianapolis and what's right for that trade area. That's simple answer.","Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Just curious, what's your favorite football team?","David E.

The supplemental information is available on the investors.simon.com.","I would now like to introduce David Simon.","David E. Simon","Good morning. It was a strong quarter with excellent performance in our core business. We had strong progress on our growth strategy, which includes redevelopment and expansion of existing properties to meet retailer demand and enhanced productivity, development of new Premium Outlets and our continued smart acquisition strategy. FFO was $2.21 per share, up 11.1% from the third quarter of 2012. Our FFO exceeded the first call consensus estimate by $0.05 per share.","For the malls and the Premium Outlets, comparable property NOI growth was 4.9% for the quarter, driven by tenant sales up 3% to $579 per square foot. Occupancy up 90 basis points to 95.5%. Our releasing spread was a positive 15.2%, or $8.05 per square foot. Retailer demand for space in our properties remained strong and healthy, driving our occupancy increases. Our retailers sales continues -- growth continues to be ahead of GDP. And more important to us, our existing leases are under market rent. And keep in mind, we see almost no or very little correlation between tenant sales growth and our NOI growth due to our ability to replace underperforming retailers. We have good visibility for strong NOI growth over the near term.","New development, just quickly, we opened 3 new Premium Outlet Centers during August, all of which have exceeded expectations. All were nearly 100% leased at opening, and sales per square foot of all 3 properties are trending above our portfolio average. The total net development cost of the 3 were $400 million, that's not our share, but in total, we expect a first year return of 10.5% on our cost.","We broke ground on Premium Outlets in Charlotte and in Montr\u00e9al. And we finalized joint ventures that are under construction in Eagan, Minnesota, which is in St. Paul, Minneapolis; and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in our new partnership with McArthurGlen.","On the redevelopment expansion highlights, The Shops at Nanuet opened in October, a complete transformation into an open-air environment, providing everyday shopping and activities plus dozens of fashion and specialty retailers unique to the area. It's 98% leased. Community acceptance and early reports on sales have exceeded expectations. We also opened a 105,000 square-foot expansion of Orlando Premium Outlets in October. It's 100% leased. Redevelopment and expansion projects ongoing at more than 35 properties in the U.S. and Asia.","Overall, our multi-year pipeline of new development and redevelopment and expansion projects is key to driving growth in NOI. We continue to expect development investment at least $1 billion annually, from '13 through '16 go projects. Go projects include Roosevelt Field, Houston Galleria, Woodbury, Stanford, Del Amo, just to name a few. In other words, they are under construction.","International, just let me mention a few things. Finally, we completed the closing of our joint venture with McArthurGlen. It includes ownership interest in 5 McArthurGlen Designer Outlets located in Vienna, Venice in Naples, in the Netherlands, near D\u00fcsseldorf and one in the U.K. near Kent. We also own a 50% interest in their management and development company, which has a strong pipeline of future projects and opportunities. We're excited to partner together. Great platform for high quality retail real estate in Europe and a strong team of professionals. This partnership supports and extends our international growth strategy. Important industry synergies will be taken advantaged of in upcoming years, similar to what we're accomplishing with Kl\u00e9pierre.","Total consideration for the recent investments is approximately $500 million at a cap rate of slightly north of 6.5%. Kl\u00e9pierre announced the revenues a couple of days ago. We continue to believe we are well-positioned to assist them in delivering greater value from their platform. European retail recovery is just getting started, and they are beating financial and operational expectations.","Capital markets, annuities, investor service upgrade at SPGs, senior unsecured debt to A2 with a stable outlook. We are 1 of only 2 REITS with an A-rating from S&P and Moody's. We completed a $750 million Eurobond offering to complement our McArthurGlen and Kl\u00e9pierre investment. It taps into broad market, expands our access to capital, provides a natural hedge and a strong demand enabled more favorable terms for lending for leading European real estate players. Rate of 2.375 for 7-year notes.","Dividend, quickly, we increased our quarterly dividend from $1.15 to $1.20 per share, as a result of continued strong performance and a raise of our taxable income estimate, a year-over-year increase of 9.1%. Total dividends paid in 2013 will be $4.65 per share compared to $4.10 in 2012, an increase of 13.4%. We will, again, raise our first quarter dividend after our taxable income estimate is complete in the first quarter 2014.","Today, we're raising our FFO guidance to a new range of $8.72 to $8.78 of FFO per share. The primary driver of this increase is strong operating performance across all platforms. This increases the midpoint by $0.10 from our last one in July and $0.30 from the midpoint of the range from the beginning of the year in February.","Our commitment to shareholder return and our ability to execute has built an unprecedented track record of meeting or exceeding expectations on a quarterly and annual basis for at least the last decade. Our nearly 20-year history as a public company since IPO in December of 1993 is as follows. Total shareholder return of approximately 1,975%, or 17% annually for 20 years. Our FFO grew in 1993 from $150 million to over $3.15 billion in 2013, using the midpoint of our guidance range. Our equity market cap grew from $1.8 billion to approximately $58 billion today. And we're not resting, the range of opportunities in front of us is exciting and we'll continue to focus and work very hard to produce strong results.","We're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","To use a favorite metaphor for Steve, we're going to tee off with you. On the Eurobonds, just sort of curious what the reception was over there as far as -- is there a dedicated REIT bond community? Or do people -- are they generally -- as in do they look at you guys as a real estate company or do they look at you as a corporate America, Fortune 500 company?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Alex, it's really the latter. The real estate market over there, the investment grade real estate market isn't deep enough that there are people who are dedicated real estate bond investors. So the interest was very high. I think we met with almost 50 investors during a 4.5-day roadshow. Almost all of them ended up coming into the deal. They are money managers, insurance companies, pension funds, really sticky, good, patient money. But they are -- they certainly viewed us not only as a best-in-class real estate company, but as a major U.S. corporate who has a presence in Europe, but also gets 90% of its income from the U.S., which was an important diversification element for them.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up to that. Should we expect you guys to issue in Japan if you are looking at outside the country for long-term capital?","Stephen E. Sterrett","It's a good question, Alex. I mean, I would say this. Right now, we have a multi-currency tranche on our credit facility, and we do have yen outstanding that acts as a hedge against our equity investment in our Premium Outlets portfolio in Japan. No plans, at the present time, to go to the bond market in Japan, but that's certainly an option that would be available to us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","David, a question on the outlet business. So the recent openings, you're up to probably 25%, 30% of NOI housed within outlets. And I'm sort of curious, one, we sort of reevaluate at this point sort of breaking that out as a stand-alone in terms of metrics, in terms of performance, just given the size and how good it's performing. But also, as you think about the pie assignment on Page 19 of your supplemental, where the sort of outlet to go over the next 5 years from what you can see relative to the other pieces in there? And maybe you can talk about sort of that range of opportunities that you see that you ended your comments with.","David E. Simon","Well, no, the fact is we really run this together, even though we have separated some personnel. The fact is, we really run the business as one entity on the outlets and the malls. So we don't see any reason to separate it out. And the fact is, both are -- we couldn't produce these results if both weren't producing very favorable results. They're both material enough. So the fact of the matter is, this is -- our numbers are a real good indication of what's going on in our business, whether you want to just look at malls or outlets. It's really -- it really is -- requires to deliver, both have to produce these kind of results to have it shown together. Now, with respect to the outlet business, look, that's where our new development is focused. As you know, we just opened 3, which is pretty good work. We've got a good pipeline of 4, 5, 6 others, a couple of which are already under construction. We've got another 3 or 4 that are in the pipeline. So that's going to continue to move the outlet business percentage up. On the other hand, as I mentioned to you, we are under construction, or about to be under construction, in Stanford, the Field, Del Amo, Houston Galleria, just a -- I won't -- I know Rick wants to list them all, but I will not let him. So just to name a few. And I think that will start to kick in '15, '16, '17, that will probably rebalance the pie chart as we look back in 3, 4 years from now.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","What you're saying, the range of opportunities, as you sort of -- you ended your comments with that you're not resting on your laurels, you see a range of opportunities. Obviously, you talked about the development in outlets and all the redevelopment that's happening, what other sort of scope should we think about and how it impacts that -- your pie chart or the company in terms of opportunities? That's what I sort of want to dig into a little bit.","David E. Simon","If I told you, then you would upgrade somebody and the price would go up. So I'd rather just keep that to myself.","Stephen E. Sterrett","Michael, this is Steve. Just to put a pin in it, though. Over the last 4 years, we spent over $12 billion in acquisition of assets, so not an insignificant number.","David E. Simon","Yes, look, I think, as Steve said, is as we look back since 2010 -- and these are gross numbers, we've purchased about $12.8 billion -- these are gross, so it includes debt assumption, all these other stuff, not necessarily our share. But we've acquired about $12.8 million. We disposed about $2.7 million. And we've developed $1 billion of new stuff ground up. So, again, I know it gets lost in the sauce, but we're always very focused on upgrading and reconstituting the portfolio. And we see -- look we see, international growth ahead of us, Michael, if that's what you're asking. And in the U.S., we've got the expansion pipeline, which is overwhelming. I mean, literally, nobody in our industry is doing what we're doing, expanding our existing great assets. Nobody. And also complementing that is all the new development we're doing in the outlet business, of which, as you know, we're executing consistent with the returns that we've done historically. Toronto is great. St. Louis is great. We're under construction in Charlotte. Montr\u00e9al based upon Houston is great. Vancouver, now that we're in the McArthurGlen partnership, that's going to be good. We got a couple of new sites that we're working on, some ourselves, some with partners. Tampa is an example, and so on. So there's a lot to do. And how that pie chart changes, we'll see. But the fact of the matter is, we see pretty good growth organically just assuming we can execute the way we have in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","David, we understand that you've joined some of your mall peers to do a beta test of same-day delivery with Deliv. And I'm remembering back to a conversation we had, maybe 10 years ago, where you had talked about Domino's Pizza and the fact that they weren't in the pizza business, but they were really in the 30-minute logistics business, and wouldn't that be cool if the mall could figure out how to do that. Is that affectively what you're trying to accomplish here with this beta test? And is that really the future of the mall in order to compete with the Amazons of the world?","David E. Simon","Well, look, I do think the mall has a unique advantage in that it's already got the infrastructure -- physical infrastructure to satisfy consumers that want same-day delivery. Now it sounds great, it's a little more complicated than that. But to the extent, one of the things having spent yesterday with our mall team, just kind of going -- not property by property, that we look forward to on a couple of weeks. But the thing that I am focused on in our mall business -- and when I say mall business, I include the outlets, is that we have to make -- we've always made retailer service a priority. So Rick and I are as good at sucking up to retailers as possible, okay? Sometimes, Rick is better than I am, but we both can suck up when required. The one thing we don't do the way I would like us to, is I really want to -- I want to provide better service to our consumers, the actual shoppers. And whether that's -- something we instituted last year was just surprising delights, come to the mall and we're going to give you a free cup of coffee, we're going to schlep your bags. We're going to make your visit really better. Think about the hotel level of service at a good hotel when you're checking in and they're taking care of you to make your stay pleasant. With that said, we do think delivery, or schlepping, you remember we started YourSherpa -- probably not politically correct, but whatever. But we started this years ago, we are actually too far ahead of our time. But the fact of the matter is, we want to increase the level of customer service that we provide to our shoppers. We think this is consistent with that, whether this venture will do that or not, we don't know, we'll going to continue to experiment, we've got a whole smorgasbord of things that we're investing to do that and the sole purpose is to make the consumer visit more pleasant, which is a huge focus for us this year, next year and the year after.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That makes sense. As I thought about this, I said to my myself, is the next evolution that I go to your website for whatever mall I'm shopping at, and I can do a search for white shirt, and then instantly your website brings up every white shirt that's being sold in the mall, I can click on which one I want and buy it. Is that the next evolution that you have to get to, the integration of inventory of all your retailers onto your website so -- that is the interface?","David E. Simon","Well, I would say that would be terrific if we could ultimately get to their store-level inventory and be able to communicate that to the consumer, much like the mall aggregates all the physical stores. If we could figure out how to do that, that would be great. It's not that easy because you have to essentially get into the customer -- or the retailer's inventory. But the one thing I want you to do is when you do go to the mall, I want to be able to tell you, when you go to the mall, here's what's new in retailer XYZ, here's what promotion XYZ retailer has. Here's who does have a white shirt, to go to what retailer. So you have a -- your first stop at the mall is going to be able to communicate to you what's new and what's exciting so that makes your visit that much more pleasant if, in fact, we can do that. And more profitable for you. So I think it's interesting to do it while you're in the physical environment, as it is whether you're at home or on your mobile device.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Spector with Bank of America.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm actually Craig Schmidt. I'm noticing the new development blended stabilized rate of return is 9%. Is that more due to higher cost or are the rents unable to be pushed as much as say maybe 1 year ago?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Craig, it's Steve. It's really neither. That number, the mix changes from time to time. We opened some projects, as David mentioned, the first year return on the stuff that has opened, which is no longer on the list, was 10.5%. So it's simply a mix change. But there's been no real fundamental change in our ability to get rents or cost control or our expectations for our development pipeline.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And I just -- I noticed the leasing spreads have been up 4 quarters in a row and, on a dollar basis, have grown from $4.86 to $8.05. I'm wondering, where can they go from here? And is that from limited supply of quality space or just a growing demand from retailers?","David E. Simon","Well, it's a function of demand is solid, and you got to look at what's expiring. So as I said, we -- there's a huge focus of our retailers sales. We've tried to explain the correlation is slight, if at all, and it's in a lag. The fact is, as you know, retail sales have gone up dramatically since the Great Recession. And you look at what's expiring and you look at the supply and demand characteristics, you put it all together, it's more of an art than a science, and that's why we're able to have pretty good releasing spreads. Now, the fact of the matter is $8 is pretty damn good. We're finishing our budget for next year. We're going to see good comp NOI growth just like we had in the last 2 or 3 years. And that ultimately does not take into account when we look at what the Houston Gallerias and the Fields and the Del Amos are going to do after those developments are done. And those malls have been transformed to take the rightful position in the 21st century of great real estate that can't be duplicated. So I can't -- we're not going to give you a number, but things are okay and we'll continue to pound away.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was wondering, did you see anything change in terms of traffic during the third quarter?","David E. Simon","Well, generally, September was a pretty bad month in terms of traffic and sales for all retailers. And we're starting to hear and feel the traffic is bouncing back in October. But clearly, clearly, the general economy has slowed. And we're no -- the fact is, we get impacted by that less than most others because of where our properties are positioned and the depth and breadth and the diversity of our properties. But the fact is, we're not denying that the world -- the U.S. has actually slowed. We could talk philosophically about why, but it's nothing with what we're doing. But we're -- we certainly have seen that from our retailers generally across the board to both high-end, middle and at the more moderate customer base.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then, I guess going back to one of your answers before where you mentioned -- if I mentioned the stock, it would go up, upgrade it, blah blah blah. Off-the-cuff comment there?","David E. Simon","Yes, and probably a stupid one. Yes, off the cuff and stupid. It's a little early. We're usually at 11:00, 9:00 we're trying to get our groove on. So the fact is, it's probably off the cuff.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cedrik Lachance from Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to think about outlets for a second and when we look at some of the recent projects, some of them -- just in the industry in general, some of them have been more, or been far more correlated with population centers rather than being further outside. What do you think it means for the projects you must develop over the next 10 years and what does it mean for the existing real estate -- in the outlet business that tends to be at the outskirts of town?","David E. Simon","Well, again, Cedrik, I believe there's been one that's been built that's more infilled. So we do not hear -- I will just tell you this, our outlet business is great. We're building terrific products. We will not make pronouncements about what the future of the world is going to be, we're not that good or arrogant. We're going to continue to do what we do. We're picking -- we've always picked, over the last several years, major, important metro markets, usually suburban locations -- Toronto, St. Louis, New Hampshire, go down list, all of which have been very successful. We're continuing to do that. There may be 1 or 2 built that's more urban. But one does not make a trend. We will not make pronouncements here. We're not in that business. We're in running our business day in and day out to increase our cash flow, make smart investments, smart developments. And our track record indicates, so far, knock on wood, we're pretty good at that. But I will not make pronouncements if that's the new trend, one does not make a trend.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. What do retailers say about their preferred locations in terms of outlets, and whether or not they do you have an interest in trying to move more infill?","David E. Simon","Well, the fact that we're 100% leased on every outlet that we opened gives you an indication what they're telling us.","Stephen E. Sterrett","I think, Cedrik, the retailers want to be where they can be as productive as possible. And what you're finding in all of our properties is that we continue to add high impact retailers, making them more and more attractive to consumers, which drive sales, which drives retail interest. There's no magic to this business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Thinking about dispositions for a second. I don't think you addressed those, Dave. You sold off 2 this quarter, and I'm curious, have you given more thought to maybe selling off a bigger chunk or spinning out a group of your lower tier regional mall assets in the U.S.?","David E. Simon","Well, Rich, the fact is, we're always looking to do as much portfolio management as we can. And as I mentioned to you earlier, I mean, since 2010, basically, $12.8 billion of acquisitions, $2.7 billion of dispositions, $1 billion of new development, not including the redevelopment. So that's part of our focus day in and day out, and that will always be an important thing in terms of what we do. And the form of which that takes will depend on market conditions, but we'll continue to do portfolio management. It's very important, very vital. It's been something that we've been pretty good at over the 20-year history of a public company. So we'll continue to do that, Rich.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But no real thought, Dave, to a big chunk, I guess, of assets as opposed to 1 or 2 at a time as opportunities arise?","David E. Simon","Well, again, I'm not going to share exactly the internal workings that we do day in and day out in terms of how do you do the best portfolio management possible. But needless to say, if you look at our history, it's an important thing that the senior management team needs to do. And we'll continue to do it to the best of our ability. So I'm not saying one way or another exactly how that will be done, it'll just -- we will portfolio manage to the best of our abilities.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to go back to -- along the line of Craig's questioning, and again, releasing spreads, ability to keep raising rents going forward. Steve, could you give us a sense of where occupancy costs are right now relative to historical levels, and how much that gives you confidence about pushing rent going forward?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Tayo, the occupancy costs are 11.4%. I think we give you about 5 quarters of trailing in the supplemental on Page 23. And that's down 100 to 150 basis points from where it would have been going back to 2010.","But I think, the other point I would add, is that it's been very stable over those 5 quarters. So we are -- we've been at that 11.3% to 11.4% range, and we still have momentum in our business. And that bodes, I believe, very well for our ability to hopefully continue our performance going forward.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. But with your -- with the tenants at this point, when you're going through a lease negotiation like, how much are they really kind of bringing up this issue of slowing tenant sales in general in a tough retail outlook when they're negotiating with you? Or do they just want the space so badly, it doesn't really come up?","David E. Simon","Well, let me answer that, I mean, the perception that retailers negotiate -- let's take an example, let's say, their comp NOI is up 4% and they're willing to pay $11. And the comp sales are flat, they go to $10. It's not reality, okay? If they look at it over a longer period of time, what they're going to do, what the return on equity and profitability in that store is. So, again, we try to give you a sense of these numbers generally, what's happening in the -- from our retailers. But the fact is, comps -- the immediate ups and downs of comps have no bearing on what rent we can charge overall. And so -- over a long period of time, potentially. But the one thing you have to remember is, our comp sales also include the retailers that are going out of favor. And if they were in favor 5 or 7 years ago, sometimes, they're able to negotiate whatever rents because we think they are a new and exciting retailer. If that wanes or waxes, the fact is, we're able to replace that retailer with someone else that's there. So there is no, \"Boy, I had a bad quarter of sales; therefore, I'm going to charge -- I want to pay you less rent.\" It doesn't work that way.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's definitely helpful color. I think I was up along the line of, if you've had 3 quarters of bad sales, so that's kind of what I was kind of thinking. What happens at that point. But I think the explanation has been very helpful.","David E. Simon","Sure. No worries.","Stephen E. Sterrett","Don't lose sight of the fact that between 2010 and 2012, over that 3-year period, sales were up 25% in our portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just since no one asked it here, I'll just throw it out there. Just wondering if you could give us your latest thoughts here on what you're seeing from JCPenney. And given that they are discounting pretty heavily to try to claw back some share and sales, just wondering if you're seeing or noticing any impact on other parts of the mall as a result of those efforts.","David E. Simon","Now, I would say, generally, it's not -- there's not a real impact of the mall environment. Both with the old Penney, the potential new-transformed Penney, and now the recovering to back-to-basics Penney. I mean, if you go through kind of the 3 cycles the way they were doing it, the radical change, now back-to-basics Penney. The fact of the matter is, it really hasn't impacted kind of the entire mall environment than what we have. If they get back to the basic Penney, having them -- they do broaden the mix generally in the environment and they appeal to a more moderate consumer, which we'd love to have in a number of cases, in a number of malls, as well as the higher-income consumer. And that market is there for them to appeal to that consumer in the mall environment, which they've done historically for 100-plus years. So -- and even before the mall environment. So we'll wait and see how they do that. But it's really had no impact on the -- what I'll call, the mall environment.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So, I mean -- so as they -- I mean, they are making some progress on the sale declines, so I'm just curious if that's hurting anybody else. But it sounds like not.","David E. Simon","Well, look, we're glad that they are. But again, it's not a huge impact on what's going on in the mall.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Yang with Evercore.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Maybe for David. I'm curious if you any thoughts on the B mall or even C mall sales market, which has been surprisingly active this year. Maybe in terms of the prices being paid for this type of assets. What that might mean for the value of your stock, if anything? And then, also, maybe building off of Rich's question. Do you think spending on a B-mall portfolio would unlock some value for guys?","David E. Simon","Well, there's a lot there. So -- and you broke up out on the end. Did you hear the end part?","Stephen E. Sterrett","The potential of...","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I guess, maybe just starting, just what your thoughts are in terms of the prices being paid for the B and C malls, and what that might mean for the value of your stock, if anything at all?","David E. Simon","Well, I'm not going to comment on the value of our stock other than you look -- you need to look at us as a company that can increase its cash flow and its dividend and it has a lot of future, very high returns on equity investments, underlevered, ability to execute its game plan. We get caught up too much on A malls, B malls, tenant sales, all of that stuff. Put it all in the blender, you allocate it, you figure out what's most important to you. What's most important to me is cash flow growth and return on investment and equity, and that's what we strive to execute. And ability to finance our business appropriately, making smart investment decisions, which all kind of factors in. Then the market decides what the value of the stock should be. I don't -- I don't get carried away one way or the other. And the fact is, we look at every asset as it's very important to our business. We look at the future growth prospects. If we might dispose of them, we look at what the price we might get. We'd factor in the taxable income, what we might have to do in terms of dividends if we sold it. Because, as you know, we're at our taxable income number, it's growing rapidly. Our dividend is going to grow. We put all those things in and we try to do the best we can, and we'll see where it takes us. So it's good -- the big picture -- I'm not going to comment on price other than it's, I think, is very positive, generally speaking, that there's a lot of activity in -- if you want to call it B or C malls, call it B or C mall. And I think that never hurts us as an owner of -- if you want to say we're an owner of B and C, that's fine, it never hurts us that there's a lot of capital activity in that business.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And maybe for a follow-up instead. Can you maybe talk about your expectations for cash flow growth in your A malls versus the B malls, and whether you think that's going to compress in the coming few quarters or even years?","David E. Simon","Well, I think, historically, the better the center or the more -- let me say it differently, the more market share any piece of real estate has, the better its cash flow growth characteristics they have. So whether it's A or B, is irrelevant. It's really a question of, does it have market share, what's the competitive outlook. And those that have that position have better growth characteristics, generally speaking.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Patinkin with BMO Capital Markets.","Josh Patinkin","Thinking about McArthurGlen in the European outlet business, specifically the leasing side. We have upside exposure in the U.S. with overage rents? Is it similarly structured there? Or any other nuances we should be thinking about?","David E. Simon","It's very much structured towards sales. But it's even more clever in the sense that they have -- in their leases, they get a percent of sales. But the high watermark is then fixed at kind of their base rent, so you get the best of both worlds in a sense. And these centers, on average, do just a -- if you convert, you all can convert, but we'll do it. These things average about $900 a foot. So it is a -- the ones that we've invested in. And as we think over time, we'll be able to invest in other outlets in Europe through McArthurGlen. We think it's a very productive portfolio and extension opportunities and the like. So we think it's -- we like it and we expect it to be a very good investment for us over time. And I think we're coming in at a decent valuation. So again, that's our ability to assess real estate, handle the complexity of a partnership like this, different countries, different personalities. We're one of the few companies that are able to do a deal like this. And that is a, respectfully I say, a competitive advantage for the company.","Josh Patinkin","In terms of growth there, how penetrated do you think Europe is with outlets relative to U.S. and what's the opportunity set in your view?","David E. Simon","It's good. Because the right to build in Europe continues whether it's an outlet or even a full priced, it continues to be very high -- or very hard, I should say.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So we see quite a bit of a mall trades here in the last couple of months, and given the activity in the market, was curious on your assessment of recent A- and B-mall asset pricing. Has there been a notable change in cap rates or return expectations giving -- given rising rate expectations and flowing sale trends?","David E. Simon","No.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. One more follow-up, if I may, on the releasing spread question. You guys also had a pretty good pickup in CapEx spend this quarter versus prior quarters. How much of this improved releasing spread, would you say, was bought this quarter with the higher CapEx spend?","David E. Simon","None.","Stephen E. Sterrett","None.","David E. Simon","Yes, you really -- yes, none. I mean, that -- there's some -- always going to be some quarter-to-quarter volatility, but no issue there. We don't buy -- we're very frugal, as you know, when it comes to tenant allowance and the like.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the comments in terms of upgrading the assets, and you've done a great job over time and very strong redevelopment pipeline now. And when you go through the mall portfolio, mall-by-mall in the next couple of weeks, how much do you have in terms of shadow redevelopment pipeline, where you look at it and say, \"We'd love to do this redevelopment, but don't want to do so until we -- as we look at the struggling anchors here, if this were to happen, we'd do it.\" Just trying to think about that -- the opportunity in terms of that shadow pipeline there.","David E. Simon","Well, look, let me just -- if I could just comment generally on it. We are in the midst, again, of doing the biggest extensions and the biggest redevelopments that we have. So as an example, I'm not going to do the list. We are under construction in the Field, Roosevelt Field, we are under construction in Stanford, we're under construction shortly in Houston Galleria. And we're getting the approvals in the King of Prussia to create the extension between the 2 big assets. We just got approval from the BRA at Copley, we still need another hurdle. So we are literally -- we just finished Nanuet, Shops at Nanuet, which -- if anybody that's seen the mall prior to what we've done before, you would be pleasantly surprised not only just with the transformation but with the lease-up. So we are -- so for Del Amo, to name another one, we're in the midst of a huge construction there, bringing Nordstrom in and all the rest. So right now, the biggest focus is executing these huge, big redevelopments that are going to be really exciting. And there's a lot of opportunities beyond that. And our pipeline, in terms of redevelopment, is in the $4 billion to $5 billion range. But beyond discussing it, because everybody can have the shadow, the fact of the matter is, it's happening right now. Right now it's happening. So this is no longer, \"We're going to do this,\" it's actually happening. And I've got the pictures to prove it, if you're interested.","Stephen E. Sterrett","And the only thing I would add is David touched on the major redevelopment projects, we're also adding 39 new anchors across the platforms this year, and we've been adding that every year, and each of those additions just make our properties stronger. We also have an ongoing renovation program, where we're renovating a number of projects every year. And all that is just part of what we're doing to keep our products relevant and enhance their market share.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Roane with Hilliard Lyons.","Jeremy Roane","I was wondering if you could speak on what has driven the property operating expenses down and maybe shed some light on if this type of expense reduction can be expected going forward?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Jeremy, it's Steve Sterrett. It's a couple of things. One is, as David mentioned earlier, we have sold some assets. We also had a wholly-owned asset that converted into a joint venture in 2013. So there are fewer properties which is causing part of the decline that you're seeing. The rest of the decline is caused by the fact that insurance costs are a little lower. It's really those 2 items that are driving it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Rick, I got a -- just a question on sort of occupancy. 95.5%, I recognize that includes the outlets, but I think that's the peak, overall, and certainly ahead of where you were even in the fourth quarter of last year. And so I'm just curious, as you head into the holiday season when you start including some of that temp spaces, how should we think about occupancy and full the portfolio is? How you're balancing that with rent, which continues to move up in terms of the spreads? And then as you think about '14, given the fact that you've already leased a lot of that space and done your renewals, what's that visibility that you have into '14 in terms of occupancy? It seems like a great place to start from at 95.5% today.","Richard S. Sokolov","Well, first, we don't include temp space in the occupancy. Secondly, what we're doing is making our space more efficient, and we are going to be able to continue to generate increases in NOI because we're constantly looking to see how we can make our space more effective by bringing in more productive tenants. David made the point earlier, by decreasing the amount of the space allocated to given tenants. And frankly, we still have leasing going on in the pipeline. So we're never going to be satisfied and never get to the point where we say to you, \"Well, we're fully occupied.\" The bottom line is, look in the Premium Outlets, they're 100%, for all intents and purposes, and we're still driving our NOI and driving spreads, because we're doing more effective leasing, more effective space allocation to more productive tenants.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So where does occupancy go then? I'm just -- I know you don't include temps, so what does that mean for the fourth quarter in terms of...","Richard S. Sokolov","I would certainly hope that we continue to show advances over where we are.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And your '14 outlook in terms of how much you've already done relative to that role?","Richard S. Sokolov","We're certainly going to anticipate that we're going to be able to increase it in '14.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Harris with Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","This still a little early for us old folks.","David E. Simon","I know. You know what? No doubt, okay? No doubt.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","I know you talked a little bit about sales on this call, but if you look at your percentage rent growth line, in the first half of the year it was growing about 30% or more, and we're down to 10% year-over-year growth in the third quarter. That seems consistent with the slowdown that we're hearing from a lot of the mall retailers. Is that -- I mean, can we assume that you're all thinking that for temporary slowdown and that we will pick up even in this quarter?","David E. Simon","Well, the fact is that some of our percentage rents -- we've had certain tenants that have run into harder sales and then some that have picked the balance up, so it's all over the lot. But we'll see how it -- we'll see how the next couple of months pan out, David. It's very hard for us to give you a really specific answer to that question. We do have certain earnings tie -- risk tied to percentage rent. We gave -- we took that into account in raising our guidance. And -- but it's clear, and we're not denying this. It is clear that -- and it's not Simon Property Group, it is clear that the economy has slowed. You've seen it with wages, you've seen it with employment, needless to say, we don't have to get into what's going on in terms of leadership in our country. None of which we use as an excuse because we put blinders on, the best of our abilities, when it comes to that kind of stuff. But we're operating at a high level in a very slow growth economy. And we are outpacing the growth in the economy, and that's all that we can do. But we are affected by the economy. I mean, I wish I wasn't, but we are. And...","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","What period does this most remind you of in, say, the last 10 or 15 years, David?","David E. Simon","Good question. Good question. The fact is, I don't have an immediate -- usually I would just make something up, but I can't even come up with that at this point. But I would say a little bit like coming out of -- my initial reaction would be coming out of the -- when we were public, coming out of kind of the '97, that era where we're just kind of -- we weren't -- we hadn't ended, we'd survived and it was just grinding -- we were grinding about. And by the way, we we're grinding, I got double digits FFO increase, okay? So just keep that in perspective. But kind of like that, David, would be the initial off-the-cuff reaction.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Can I sneak in with a quick one for Steve?","David E. Simon","Sure. Sure.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Steve, with the issuance of the Eurobond, it reminded me, are you embracing -- have you used any of these tax structures that have sort of coming under greater scrutiny like double Irish or even The Netherlands, Luxembourg to structure your offshore interest?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Not really, David. It's pretty plain vanilla. We record -- as an example, we record tax expense as it relates to the Kl\u00e9pierre earnings that we picked up our share of every quarter. So relatively plain vanilla structure.","David E. Simon","Yes. In fact, it's -- just to reinforce what Steve said, if you look at our -- we did -- as we made more international investments, we're having to pay taxes in those jurisdictions. And if you see in our P&L, we actually separated that out so that you can see that impact, because it's becoming less than trivial.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Right. Simon is not Apple.","David E. Simon","No, no. I wish I were. And I like its stock quote [ph]. But I don't want the pearl icon on me, but I do wish I were Apple.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Well, isn't he urging share buybacks and dividends, so you're kind of halfway there.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of John Kim with CLSA.","John P. Kim - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I just wanted to follow-up on your comments on international opportunities. Right now, international is about 8% of your NOI. What level do you feel comfortable just going to in the next few years? And then also geographically, where do you see the most compelling opportunity between Europe, Asia and South America?","David E. Simon","Well, we don't -- our only goal is to make smart investments, and investments that we can add value to. So the fact of the matter is, if the -- if our international business stays the same or goes up slightly, it doesn't -- that's not how we think. We're only looking to make smart investments where we can add value. And we have a higher threshold in international investments, because it's a lot of work and it's got to be -- there's no desire here just to do international for the sake of international. The desire here is to make international investments because, one, we think we can add value; and, two, is because we think at the end of the day, we're going to make money, and Kl\u00e9pierre is a perfect example of that. So I don't have, in my mind, it ought to go from X to Y. And each jurisdiction that we're in is different, but we are doing new development in Asia. We're not an acquirer of assets in Asia just because it's a tougher market. And we're sticking to the outlet business and markets that we're in where we can develop and it meets our threshold return requirements, which has been, certainly a real challenge in China, as an example. And that's why we did an investment in '08 and '09, we got out of it, and we haven't done anything since.","John P. Kim - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I was going to actually follow-up on -- if there had been any update on your view to China and Brazil?","David E. Simon","Well, China, I gave to you. Brazil, we continue to look at opportunities there in the outlet sector, a few sites that we're in, but nothing really imminent in the marketplace.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer part of today's call.","David E. Simon","Okay, thank you. I know you have a number of calls to go to, so thanks for your participation.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

My name is Allison, and I'll be operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Ms. Liz Zale, Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs. Please proceed, ma'am.","Liz Zale","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Simon Property Group's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Liz Zale, Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs. Joining me on today's call is David Simon, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. We refer investors to today's earnings press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements.","Please note that this call does include information that may be accurate only of today's date, July 29, 2013, and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the earnings release or the company supplemental information, including this morning's Form 8-K filing. The supplemental document is available on simon.com in the Investors section.","And with that, I would like to now introduce David Simon.","David E. Simon","Good morning. It was another productive quarter. FFO was $2.11 per share, up 11.6% from the second quarter of '12. Our FFO exceeded the first call consensus by $0.04. For Malls and Outlets, comparable property NOI growth was 5.9%, driven by occupancy, up 90 basis points to 95.1%; a growth in the releasing spread to $7.49 per square foot, or 14.1%; base minimum rent per square foot, 3.6% higher than the year ago period. And our tenant sales were up 4.2% to $577 per square foot.","Now let me turn to just some deal activity. On May 30, we acquired a 390,000 square-foot outlet center in Portland, Oregon, $447 million. This is a very productive center, with sales in excess of $600 per square foot. It's 99% leased, has a great tenant lineup and fits terrific with our Outlet portfolio. And it's been rebranded Woodburn Premium Outlets. And as you would expect, it's immediately accretive to FFO.","On June 3, we announced our JV with McArthurGlen to invest in certain of their designer outlets and become a partner in the property management development companies. They have a terrific and one of the best performing portfolios of high-quality retail real estate in Europe and a good, strong team of professionals. The transaction supports and extends our International Premium Outlet strategy. We completed the initial phase of this transaction and are now 50-50 partners in the management and development companies. And we also will become a partner in their new designer outlet project in Vancouver and are working to close our investment in several of their existing centers.","On May 7, we sold Laguna Hills Mall for $110 million.","Now let me turn to new development. Phoenix and Shisui opened in April, both 100% leased, both strong openings. And we're pleased with the performance. The third quarter -- this third quarter, we have 3 new Premium Outlet Centers that will open. Toronto, this week, August 1. You're all welcome. St. Louis, which is 100% leased, on August 22. You're all welcome. Busan, Korea maybe a little bit out of your way, but it is 99% leased, and it opens on August 29. The construction started during the second quarter at our Premium Outlets Montr\u00e9al, which is our second Premium Outlet Center in Canada. Vancouver will be our third. And let me just turn to redevelopment activity.","A lot going on. I won't go through everything, but some highlights. In April, we completed the redevelopment of an existing limited building in Dadeland Mall. It's great. Go look at it. The redevelopment of Walt Whitman opens this September, with the addition of retailers and restaurants on the exterior of the building. The Shops at Nanuet in suburban New York City opens in October. At this project, we actually demolished the existing mall and created a new open air center. The redevelopment of Lenox Square continues as does the transformation of Del Amo Fashion Center, among several other centers that are all listed in the 8-K.","And on the Premium Outlet front, we completed expansions at Paju and Seattle during the second quarter. Expansions are underway at Orlando Premium Outlets in Vineland and Johor Malaysia. Both of these projects will open in the fourth quarter. The significant expansion at Desert Hills continues, will open in April of next year. And finally, on that front, we started this quarter the $170 million redevelopment expansion of Woodbury Commons in New York.","The Mills -- Sawgrass Mills, we opened the expansion in The Colonnade Outlets during the second quarter, as well as the redevelopment of the former Wannado space. Macy's opened at Gurnee Mills last week. In addition, we have significant box activity throughout The Mills and Mall portfolio with numerous stores under construction.","Our pipeline in new development, redevelopment projects is significant and growing. Stuff is coming online. We're also under construction with several projects. We expect this to continue at least $1 billion annually through 2016. And I'll remind you that we're funding this primarily with $1 billion of our free annual cash flow generated by the company.","Just quickly on financing. We're pleased with the Standard & Poor's upgrade in May with our corporate credit rating and senior unsecured debt ratings were increased to A level. We believe this reflects our conservative balance sheet strategy, the quality of our portfolio and the ongoing focus of being a good steward of capital.","We continue to be active in the debt markets. So far, year-to-date, we did 17 new loans, approximately $2.4 billion, of which our shares is $1.7 billion. The average interest rate on the loans is 2.9%, and the average term is 8.1 years.","Kl\u00e9pierre reported solid first half results. I won't go through them in detail. They're available. Shopping center gross rents, which represents 94.4% of total rents, were up 4.1%, or 2.5% on a like-for-like basis. They increased their 2013 guidance for net cash -- net current cash flow per share. And they continue to upgrade the portfolio through development, redevelopment, as well as the disposition on noncore assets.","Today, we increased the top and the bottom of our 2013 FFO guidance once again to a new range of $8.60 to $8.70 of FFO per share. This is an increase of $0.20 from our initial guidance or over $70 million. And as always, we are extremely focused on the successful execution of our plan for '13, from the effective leasing and management of our high-quality existing portfolio to the successful delivery of our new and redevelopment pipeline and the achievement of the returns that we have outlined.","We're now ready for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt of New York.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I look at the supplemental and it says the openings projected for 2015 and beyond, and it lists Del Amo and Roosevelt Field but it doesn't list Copley Place and Houston Galleria. Is this just because those projects are starting later or is there a change in plan for those assets?","David E. Simon","No change at all. We are -- actually, once they are formally approved within our internal process, they go on a schedule. Copley, we're actually going through, just a little bit more permitting approvals, which we expect to have by the end of the year. And then The Galleria, we have an announcement coming shortly. Stay tuned. We approved it internally. They'll both be on our list. No real change of plans on either one.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And I also noticed in the anchor section, you're adding a Wegmans to the Montgomery Mall. May you be adding supermarkets to other centers and was there any change that you made in terms of parking or access to make Wegmans work with the rest of the mall?","Richard S. Sokolov","Craig, it's Rick. The Wegmans is being built on the site of a former Boscov's, which we demolished. And the land was suitable to be able to have all their parking accommodated. We are putting several outside uses in Montgomery just to be accommodative to that, so we're having some uses we think will work well with the supermarket. And we're also adding a Fairway Market at Nanuet. So these types of high profile, high-volume users are, we think, very additive to the properties.","David E. Simon","Craig, I remember you used to asked about Nanuet all the time. So now thankfully, it's opening in October. And we're basically virtually leased, not everybody will open by this year. But by spring of next year, all 100% will be opened.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was actually by that site a couple of weeks ago. It looks like it's pretty transformative.","David E. Simon","Yes, it should be. We're excited about it.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","One last thing. Are you able to give a cap rate on the Laguna Hills Mall that you sold in May?","David E. Simon","Well, I'll let you do the math. The NOI, if I remember correctly, was around $6.5 million or something in that range, $6.5 million.","Operator","And your next question comes from Quentin Velleley of Citigroup.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just on the McArthurGlen acquisition. Can you just talk broadly about the opportunity in Europe with Outlets and how involved Simon senior management will be with the management and growth of that business?","David E. Simon","Well, I think there is a significant opportunity, both within their existing portfolio and the ability to add extensions to them, as well as continue to upgrade the tenant offerings and add to the footfall of those centers through tourism efforts and the like. In addition, McArthurGlen does have a significant pipeline of additional opportunities in terms of new development. So when you couple those, as well as we do think there'll be acquisition opportunities within their portfolio and others, we think it's going to end up being a significant platform for our growth over the next several years. It's a complicated deal not only because it's in Europe and you're in different countries, but also the ownership of the assets are owned not by just one individual, but by various partners and funds. I think over time, as we solidify the platform, bring our expertise to the table, along with their assets and their people, it should be a very good deal for us. So we're excited about it. And the sales productivity of these centers is very high, and there's not a lot of them. And they're very well accepted, and there's not that many players in Europe that do it at such a high level. So we think, ultimately, it's going to be a good transaction for us.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I think you still own a stake in Value Retail, the other outlet developer and owner in Europe. Are you now a seller of that stake?","David E. Simon","Do you have an offer for me?","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I don't have the money.","David E. Simon","Okay. No, we're happy with that stake. But we're always interested in whatever we can do to benefit our shareholders. But that investment has been good for us. We anticipate continuing in it. As you might know, I mean, that was kind of an investment that the former Chelsea made. We've added to it over the years. We've got a significant embedded gain compared to our book value of it, and they do a very good job in terms of operating their centers as well. So we think we're a long-term owner of it, but I never rule anything out.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, there's been a lot of media speculation on the Colonial investment management platform in Australia. I know you guys are constantly looking at global opportunities. Is the Australian mall industry one that interests you?","David E. Simon","Well, maybe. Haven't ruled it out. But we'll look at anything. I mean, Westfield does such a good job. We've always been a little bit reluctant to enter that market. On the other hand, it's an interesting market. It's very stable. We like the people there, and the malls there do very well. So I wouldn't rule anything out, just like we've monitored Brazil for years. Haven't found the right transaction. We wouldn't rule any one particular place out. The one place we continue to be the most concerned about, as we look internationally, is China just because it's a tough place to figure out who's on first. Australia, to some extent, has a lot of benefits, that it's a very transparent market.","Operator","And your next question comes from Christy McElroy of UBS.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on McArthurGlen. With regard to the property management development partnership, will there be any immediate impact to cash flow, just thinking about any fees? Or is that further down the road?","David E. Simon","Well, it's a profitable management company, so our investment will have a return associated with it. Now that will just end up flowing through our JV line, so it's not going to be in our management company. So it will be hard for you to see. But they're profitable, and we expect to have a pretty good return on our investment in the management company.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","What was the investment?","David E. Simon","Well, it's really separated into 2 pieces, but both for the management and the development was GBP 25 million.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Are you able to disclose the Q2 '13 only year-over-year change in sales?","David E. Simon","Say it again?","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just the quarter change in sales, so if I were just to isolate the second quarter sales and look at it on a year-over-year basis.","David E. Simon","We don't do that, but it was up about 1%.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, regarding some of the new sort of in-store customer tracking technology that some retailers are using today, are you having to do any upgrades to the technological infrastructure of your malls, such as increasing bandwidth or other changes? And are you using any new technologies to sort of collect any of your own data on customers or analyze shopper traffic patterns?","David E. Simon","Well, look, that whole area, we are treading very, very carefully because it is lots of privacy concerns. So we have not -- we've looked at it all. But the fact of the matter is, until the folks in Washington feel good about it, we are watching it and we're not really playing in any of that stuff because we really don't know what kind of privacy violations it may generate. So I would tell you that we're treading very, very carefully and have done nothing along the lines that would be able to track anything like that, period, end of story. Now with respect to -- I think the big effort generally in the mall industry is we're all investing in WiFi networks throughout our malls. We're doing that as well. We're starting at the bigger ones first, and that's really primarily for the benefit of our consumer. But to the extent that it can help facilitate our retailers, we're happy for them to participate. But again, I would tell you, on the privacy front, we're not doing anything. We're treading very, very carefully.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And from a CapEx perspective, what are the sort of per mall costs associated with adding the WiFi?","David E. Simon","It depends. I'd say, generally, it's around $150,000 a mall, but it really depends. Somewhere in that range.","Operator","And your next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Steve, you've been a little quiet so far, so maybe I'll lead off with you. As far as the A rating, is this a blessing or a bit of a curse? In any way, does it limit your ability whether it's on the redevelopment front or on the overseas investment front? Does being an A student, does that hinder your guys' flexibility or would you rather be A-?","Stephen E. Sterrett","It does not hinder it at all, Alex. And in fact, one of the additions that we made to the 8-K this quarter was to give you some look at some credit metrics over a 5-year look-back period, and you can see how the metrics had improved. The coverage has gotten better, leverage went down, debt to EBITDA went down. So I think, if anything, it's just a reflection of the continued strengthening of the balance sheet. And to the extent that we can absolutely borrow at cheaper rates than anyone else in our sector, I think that's absolutely a good thing.","David E. Simon","And I'll just add, S&P, they're pretty smart folks. They've seen what we've done historically, both in redevelopment and M&A activity, so they have every expectation that, that will continue. And they don't necessarily just rate you based upon being a status business. They rate you on what you've done and what they expect for you to do going forward. And our redevelopment pipeline of $5 billion thereabouts, as well as our continual activity in finding smart external investments, is part of our history of our company. And they actually like that stuff because it's obviously increased our return on equity and increased our cash flow and made us a better company. So that's all factored into how they look at us going forward.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then the second question is going onto the McArthurGlen and Kl\u00e9pierre. The first part is just, when you were talking, David, earlier about buying out in McArthurGlen, presumably, that was buying out some of those individual ownership stakes so that it would be JVs that you would own McArthurGlen assets with McArthurGlen and Simon as the ownership structure. And then separate...","David E. Simon","Correct. That's correct.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then separate is, it's early on, but down the road, do you synergies between Kl\u00e9pierre and McArthurGlen? Or in your view, these are 2 totally separate platforms, they each have to stand on their own?","David E. Simon","Well, I think, initially, they are definitely 2 separate platforms and definitely will stand on their own. I mean, they both have very successful operating platforms. And they have obviously dedicated management for both, and they're both big businesses. But I do think, with time, there certainly could be cooperation between the 2, but it's not necessary. But I would expect the 2 to cooperate over time. And especially in France, where McArthurGlen has at least 3 in the pipe of new potential developments, given the history of Kl\u00e9pierre and developing it in France, there's no reason why some sort of cooperation wouldn't make sense for both companies. And we'll certainly encourage that. I happen to know both guys who run it, so that will make it a little bit easier.","Operator","And your next question comes from Cedrik Lachance of Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","David, when I look at some of the recent acquisitions, they always seem to be largely strategic. You think about the big picture. You look at adding outlets to Europe, where you obviously have the full price presence. It's got similarities with what you've done in the U.S. The approach always seems to be primarily strategic. Do you also look at plays where you would find more distressed real estate, where you would find big discounts to any of your asset value? Or is this on the back burner and you keep looking for strategic acquisitions?","David E. Simon","I can't tell you -- there is nothing more than buying something cheap that excites me and the team here. So we love to buy things really cheap. And if that can be done on a distressed basis, we like it as long as -- ultimately, we've got to believe in the real estate because we're not -- well, I wouldn't say we're traders. So at the end of the day, we've got to have a long-term view that we like the cash flow that's being generated from the real estate. But to some extent, I mean, if you go back to the Kl\u00e9pierre deal -- and look,","Europe is still squishy, to put it mildly. That was a -- I wouldn't call it a distressed situation, but it was certainly at a pretty decent discount to NAV in an uncertain future. And not many people are investing in Europe. When we talk about McArthurGlen, there are not many people that are, at this point, taking the position that Europe is a good place to invest in. So to some extent, both of those transactions are somewhat contrarian. And if we see those as capital ebbs and flows throughout the world, I mean, I would hope that we would be able to take advantage of it. So we certainly love to try and do that. It's not what we do every day. We've got to believe in the real estate at the end of the day. But I would tell you that we've done it historically, so we would hope to continue to find those kind of opportunities.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And when you look at it currently, are those investment possibilities primarily outside of the U.S.? Or do you see potential, either distressed here, distressed properties or even companies that might be at prices that are of more interest in the United States?","David E. Simon","I would say, Cedrik, generally, those kind of opportunities are outside the U.S.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Would you be able to share the cap rate on Woodburn?","David E. Simon","You won't believe it, but it was 10.5%, only because we had a long-term option to buy it at a 10.5% cap rate. So it's not a reflection of market value, but it just goes -- it's a long history there, but it's a pretty good deal for us.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","How did that option -- how was it put together?","David E. Simon","It was really by the outlet guys with Craig over a number of years, history of kind of that whole relationship. I really -- it's not really all that material how it got there, but it just -- it's a good deal for us. And importantly, it's a very good center.","Operator","And your next question comes from Steve Sakwa of ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I was hoping that you guys could focus a little bit on the core portfolio, since that's the primary driver of, I think, growth here. You guys are now 95% occupied. The business is really kind of hitting on all cylinders. When I look at the re-leasing spreads and look at kind of where ending rents are for next year, they actually are lower in '14 than they are for the balance of this year. And I'm just curious how are you and Rick thinking about kind of the leasing, the discussions with tenants and kind of what are you guys doing differently today, given where you're sitting with the portfolio as well leased as it is?","Richard S. Sokolov","It's Rick. Basically, we are spending a lot of time just focusing on our mix, focusing on getting the right tenants in the right spaces to maximize the productivity, to maximize the rent that they can pay. And I will tell you that a lot of the calls that David and I receive are tenants worried about whether they're going to be renewed in their spaces as opposed to having to solicit interest in the spaces. So we're in a pretty dynamic market. All of the improvements we're making to this portfolio, in the renovations, the redevelopment, I think, over the last 4 years, we've probably added 200 different anchors to these portfolios. We're just taking market share and making them better. And I think that the thing you can focus on is the fact that our occupancy cost is 11.3%. And as you see with our spreads and you see with the momentum we have, we're going to be able to continue to grow that NOI because of all those reasons.","David E. Simon","Steve, I would just say, look, I mean, the fact is supply and demand is a little bit better. But our philosophy on how we operate the business is not all that different. I mean, we've seen cycles ebb and flow. At the end of the day, what's best for the business is creating the win-win with the retailer, and we've done that. We don't get to where we are today if we hadn't taken that philosophy over the last 50 years. So it's not all that different. Sure, it's better to be in this kind of environment, where supply and demand is in the owner's favor, but that changes, too. And so at the end of the day, it's all about just trying to create a win-win, which I think the history of our company suggests we know how to do it.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Maybe a quick question for Steve. On the Page 22 on the supplemental, you've obviously got a fairly large decline in the Other income. And even if you strip out some of the things like the gain on land sales, the Other was down about $10 million and it's down about $12 million for the year. Can you sort of just talk about that and how do we think about that business in the back half of the year and into next year?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Sure, Steve. There are a couple of things that were in Other income in 2012 that aren't there in 2013. If you remember, we talked from time to time on prior calls that we were owners of some mortgages, so there was some income flowing through from that debt. That debt has all been paid off. Likewise, we were the mezz lender to The Mills. That debt was obviously retired as part of the transaction in 2012. And then we have had, as you mentioned, both lower land sales, as well as, on a year-to-date basis, much lower lease settlement income.","David E. Simon","Yes, just to reinforce there because I saw your -- well, just to reinforce, the core business of the -- what's in the Other income, sponsorship, all of the ancillary things that are generated from the ball business is up this year compared to last year. So there's no change there. That category does represent a lot of our other activity, whether it's loaning folks, buying mortgages. Sometimes, we loan developers money, where we get an option to buy. As Steve said, we bought mortgages. Last year, we sold our investment in the domain residential. So that also category represents kind of the other activity that the company does that's not its, what I'll call, its operating business. And it's a little bit lumpy, no big deal. But the important point is, it is other income, which is good. It's not other losses, that's point one. Point two is that the core business sponsorship, et cetera, is all trending up this year compared to Q2 of last year and year-to-date. Now I don't have exactly that number, what it's up, but we can certainly get it to you pretty quick unless you have it. We don't have the core business number, but we can get that for you, no big deal.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, David, just talk maybe a little bit about the Brazil situation, your relationship with BR malls and sort of what's going on in terms of looking for deals down there and kind of the weakness in Brazil and how do you think that sort of plays out over the next year or 2?","David E. Simon","Well, look, the joint venture that we have with BR, the first deal we were looking to build an outlet center in was in S\u00e3o Paulo. And as you know, it ran into right-to-build issues. Those, still to this day, have not been satisfied, at least to our comfort level. So at this point, it's a no-go deal until that gets satisfied. And if it does get satisfied, then we'll have a decision to make. And we'll have to assess the climate, both short term and medium term, in deciding whether or not to go forward. But the condition precedent to that decision is not yet there, and that's the right-to-build issue. There is a couple of other sites that our team went down to look at. That may be in the pipe in the future. So let's put that aside. I mean, the macro stuff there is concerning all the supply in the market is concerning. That's kind we kind of like the Outlet business because it was different. It was new. It was going to get ahead of a lot of the supply that came on, on the full price. Obviously, you've got to weigh the macro in. But long term, Brazil is a great, great country with a lot of dynamic growth to it. But we're very cautious on a market like that, and we haven't found the right deal. And thankfully, in hindsight, our decision not to invest aggressively there has been the appropriate one. So we'll wait to see. I've always worried about the cash flows from the buildings that have been built there and whether that was sustainable with all the new supply, the fact that a lot of the cash flow comes from parking. There's a whole host of things. The cost of the goods down there is significant. The high-end malls there, whether they're profitable for the retailers or not, still it's a question mark. So there's a lot there to underwrite. And essentially, that's -- you should assume that those questions have been factored into the fact that we have not made an investment in Brazil.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a question on sales growth. With regards to the increase from $575 a square foot reported in the first quarter to $577 reported now, do you think the sequential increase of 35 basis points is a sign for concern as it's somewhat weaker than the other recent quarters?","David E. Simon","No.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","No, okay. And then can you comment on which areas of retail seem to be doing especially well versus the ones that are keeping that number from increasing as much as it had been in previous 3 quarters?","David E. Simon","Yes, I'll let Rick talk about that. But I will say this. I mean, the ups and downs of retailers and retail sales is a historical fact. But the increasing of our cash flow year after year is also a historical fact. And so we don't get overexcited whether sales go up 5% or down 5% because we know that the cash flow that we generate from our buildings has a long history of increasing, given that we've got tenants in there that are very profitable and we have leases that are below market. So when we look at -- we give you this information, I don't -- I have never pulled my hair out based upon -- or jumped up for joy when sales have increased. I mean, we're just giving you the facts. The fact of the matter is our comp NOI is going to grow because our market rents are well below what leases are rolling over, as someone pointed out earlier. So I just want to reinforce that point, and then Rick can go ahead and answer your question.","Richard S. Sokolov","Just to add a little more color to that, the stronger regions for us were New England, the Mountain states, Southwest and South Atlantic; a little weaker were the Plains, Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes. The stronger categories were juniors, women's specialty, accessories, men's shoes and women's better. And the weaker areas were women's popular, home furniture and women's special size.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Did you guys talk about a yield expectation for your investment in McArthurGlen?","David E. Simon","Well, we're going to -- when the whole deal closes, we'll give that to you. But as we said initially when we announced it in May, that it will be accretive, and it's going to be -- we believe it's going to be a profitable transaction. But until all the elements of it close, we're not going to get into those details.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And you guys made an investment in 6 interests in their malls. They own about, I think, about 20 or more. Was it just because of the structures in the individual malls or was it more selective buying?","David E. Simon","Well, again, we haven't closed on 4 of the 6 yet. But when those close, some of those interests are held outside of MGE, which again, over time, I think we'll have the opportunity to the extent that we want to, to buy interest in some of those assets. But they're not really, at this point, owned by MGE other than a couple, which we kind of collectively both agreed that we didn't want to buy at this particular point. So again, this is a long-term transaction that we feel will be able to increase our investment in but in a methodical, thoughtful way. And we're just focused on finishing the first deal, and then we'll be able to look at other opportunities going forward not just with some of the other assets that they manage, but don't own or own very little, but also other opportunities out there.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the 5.9% same-store NOI growth, could you help us -- could you break it out a little bit, maybe how much of it will fund the revenue front versus expenses? And it looks like your tenant reimbursements increased pretty significantly. How much of that looks driven by that as well?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Ki Bin, this is Steve. You hit the 3 components. Minimum rent was over half of it. A contributor was also the net increases in recoveries, if you will, and then percentage rents. If you look at our overage rent line on both the consolidated financials, but then also our share of the JV income, overage rent was a contributor as well.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And is that -- the increase in recovery, so what thought about that, it seems this is higher than it's been before on a year-over-year basis?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Well, I don't think it's higher than it's been year before, but it's -- we're 90-plus percent converted to fixed CAM. We have annual escalators of that fixed charge, and that annual escalator has been at a higher rate than expenses have been growing. And in fact, we've done a really good job of holding expenses relatively flat, so that's been additive.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And last question, and I'll kind of leave it open-ended. Surprised that you guys didn't include the outlet development in Philadelphia with Penn REIT in your, I guess maybe it's too new, in your development pages or disclosures. And I guess I'll leave it open-ended, maybe you could comment a little bit about that?","David E. Simon","Yes, I mean, it's -- once we approve it internally, it will go on our schedule. We expect it to go forward. It's still finalizing the permit. We're actually rushing, I hope to start this year so we could open next year. That's going to be touch and go just because we have to go through some permitting stuff. Once we do it and approve it, it will be there. We expect it to be a good deal. Penn REIT approached us with the site, I don't know, 1.5 year, 2 years ago, Rick, probably?","Richard S. Sokolov","About a year.","David E. Simon","We looked at it. We did a little bit of tentative pre-leasing with the retailers. They expressed an interest. We're going to build it once we get permitted, not overly complicated. And then, hopefully, if we do get to jump through the hoops that we need to jump through, we could actually start this year and then have a chance of opening next year. But like I said, that's right on the bubble. If not, it will be a '15 opening.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Is that a 50-50 JV?","David E. Simon","No, we own 75%. We have -- and they own 25%, and we have a small partner in our piece. So I think our effective, I remember, is around 65%. Our effective ownership is 65%.","Operator","And your next question comes from Paul Adornato with BMO Capital Markets.","Paul E. Adornato - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I guess this morning, Hudson's Bay was talking about spinning off their real estate into a Canadian REIT. And so the question is not on Hudson's Bay or Canadian REITs, but really just the longer-term trend of the anchors trying to capture the real estate value for their own shareholders. I was wondering if you had any thoughts or comments on that dynamic and how you might see it playing out going forward.","David E. Simon","Well, I will tell you that the attractiveness of a company like ours versus a captive REIT are a completely different set of institutional investors. What people look to in our investment is the growth, rising dividends, the dynamic nature of our company. And by investing with us, they've been well rewarded by our ability to increase our earnings and our dividend and, obviously, the resulting stock price increase. In those captive REITs, they're basically a different set of investors. They're bond-like investors. So it's a whole different thing. And if a retailer wants to do it, I mean, god bless them. I mean, if they makes them ultimately a better retailer and they can use that capital to reinvest in their business, it's no big deal from our standpoint. So there are some that are also trying to redevelop some of their boxes. I think they have found that to be really difficult, and I think what they'd rather end up doing is trying to figure out what the fair market value is and then look for the developer, i.e., us to make the profit. And that's been the nature of the development business for years is that the developer tends to get the development profit because they know what they're doing. So I don't think any of this is really all that different. I think it's potentially an attractive way for them to raise the capital to fund Saks. And if they can do that and make the combination a better, more profitable business, we're all for it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Harris of Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","It looks as if we ended the 30-year decline in long-term interest rates in the first half of this year. So if rates are going to be going up, what do you think Simon might have to do differently over the next 3 to 5 years in order to generate returns as attractive as the returns you've been able to generate over the last couple of decades, David?","David E. Simon","Well, look, I think the plan has been put in place, David, which is for us to generate the kind of returns that we want to generate that we've done historically, it's really the redevelopment, new development pipe that we've produced. And that's bigger than it's ever been. A lot of the returns that we generated historically was because we bought a lot of stuff at good prices and the values went up, and we added value through increasing the cash flow. The arbitrage that we have in the redevelopment and new development business, and as large as it is, is actually higher even with higher interest rates. So as long as we can execute, and that's assessing retailer demand and making sure the costs are right, I think we can still do what we've done as we've shifted more toward redevelopment and new development as opposed to acquisition in terms of how we look at all the capital that we're plowing back into the business. So I don't think we have to do anything extraordinary. And other than -- and it is extraordinary other than execute our pipe, which is huge and complicated. But if we can do that, I think we're in good stead.","Stephen E. Sterrett","David, I'd also remind you, as I think David mentioned in his opening remarks, we fund that pipeline with free cash flow. So in theory, the cost of that capital is 0, so the arbitrage is very good. But I'd also remind you, we have $2.9 billion of debt coming due next year. The weighted average interest rate is 6%. We've got $2.9 billion coming due the following year at a weighted average interest rate of about 5 1\/4%. So even though with the spike in interest rates that we've seen, today, our bonds trade in the 3 3\/4% range for 10 year. So there still should be a very positive pickup as we refinance that debt over the next couple of years.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Steve, you read my note that I put out a month ago or so, and I've made 6 suggestions that REITs might adopt by way of strategy and tactics to generate performance in a rising rate environment. Would you just care to expand on why you think that managing leverage over the cycle would perhaps not be the right way to go?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Well, David, listen, I think one of the things we should have all learned coming out of '08, '09 is that the world changes. It's a volatile place. The price we pay for being a REIT is that we don't fund -- self-fund our debt from cash flow, so we should all run with a fair bit of liquidity. And I think we should all run with relatively conservative balance sheets. So you and I might disagree on that particular point.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just a point of detail on the McArthurGlen deal. If we think about the return expectations you underwrote there, on the existing assets, do you think those assets are going to produce higher returns than dollars invested in the existing outlet centers in the U.S. and so we're looking really at this transaction as offering the better returns from development as we go forward? Or do you think it's going to be -- you're going to get attractive returns out of the existing assets as well?","David E. Simon","Well, look, I think the returns that we were able to generate out of the U.S. Outlet business are pretty damn good. So there's not much out there that we're going to do that's going to rival the returns that we get from new development and extending our existing U.S. Premium Outlet business. But that doesn't mean that, that should eliminate us making other good investments. And we are as busy as we've ever been in the U.S. Premium Outlet business. We're not doing every deal. I mean, there's lots of other outlet developers doing lots of new business in that space, both redevelopment and new development. So we're focused on what we can do, and that's great. And we're piling a lot of capital on that as evidenced by the new development and the extensions at Woodbury and Seattle and Desert Hills and Orlando and Vegas, et cetera. But that doesn't mean that the stuff that we're doing in Europe is not going to be attractive over both the medium and the long run. It's not quite as good as the U.S.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Right. I mean, having seen a couple of those McArthur assets over the years, I mean, I only think [ph] they've been pretty well managed. I'm not suggesting that you couldn't squeeze some more out of them, but it's not like there's huge amount being left on the table, I don't think.","David E. Simon","Well, people have said that about other stuff that we bought, and we figure out how to do that. So I'm hopeful we can do the same thing here as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Kim of CLSA.","John P. Kim - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on your potential interest in CFX retail in Australia. Internationally, your acquisitions have primarily been through joint ventures. But regarding CFX, I was wondering if your preference was again to go this route. Or would you entertain the idea of fully owning and managing the assets, given the high quality of the portfolio and given the fact that the management rights are for sale?","David E. Simon","Well, we didn't say any of that. So I think someone asked a big picture question about Australia, and that's all I said was we haven't ruled it out. We've -- so I really can't add anything more to that than what I just said.","John P. Kim - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. Then maybe I could just clarify, is the Commonwealth Bank's potential sale of its management rights and interest in CFX, is that something that's heightened your interest in Australia than a normal investment?","David E. Simon","Well, again, we haven't -- we look at opportunities worldwide, and that would -- to the extent that, that surfaces, we'd look at it just like anything else. I mean, I can't really expound on it. There's nothing really to add at this point.","John P. Kim - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. Just turning to another Aussie company. There are market reports that Lend Lease, who you've transacted with in the past, is looking to sell its ownership stake and management rights of Bluewater in the U.K. Would a single acquisition like this be appealing to you in complementing your European investment? Or do you still prefer a platform in entering a new market?","David E. Simon","I would say one individual asset would have -- this is a generic statement. It would have to be a unique individual asset in a market that we're familiar with for us to do it, to do that as supposed to just -- I'd prefer a platform. Certainly, an asset like Bluewater is unique, and it's a very good asset. But generally, it would have to just -- this is a generic statement. For us to enter into a market that we don't -- we're not -- we don't have any presence, it would have to be the best of the best in terms of an asset. I'd prefer a platform, and that's basically a generic statement, outside of it being kind of the best asset in that market.","John P. Kim - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Can you comment on whether or not the U.K. is within Kl\u00e9pierre's domain? Or is it sort of an open market for either one of you to invest in?","David E. Simon","Well, first of all, there are no restrictions that we have vis-\u00e0-vis Kl\u00e9pierre other than, I'm Chairman of the Supervisory Board and I've got to obviously act accordingly. They are not in the U.K. I don't -- there's never been any discussion that they'd have any interest in the U.K., and I don't foresee that at all.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Maybe a follow-up to an earlier question for both David and Steve. What sort of interest rate environment are you guys managing the business towards over the next few years? Are you expecting higher rates in, say, the next 2 to 3 years?","David E. Simon","Well, are we? Sure. I wish I could tell you what the rate is, then I would also be trading treasuries, I guess. But the fact of the matter is we're being as aggressive on refinancing our business as we can. We're not all that excited doing, trading dollars, which essentially is, to some extent, our secured debt's got obviously, make whole provisions and all of it or most of it. But as soon as they are open to prepay, we're refinancing that. We don't necessarily believe in funding the make-whole premium. It's basically trading present-value dollars. It creates lumpiness in the earnings blah, blah, blah. I'm not a big fan of it. We may do it in one particular context on one deal. But I mean, we're as active as we can, Steve, on refinancing.","Stephen E. Sterrett","We are. And not only that, Jeff, we have, despite the fact that LIBOR is at 20 bps and hasn't moved, and there would be a temptation to float. The fact is 90-plus percent of our debt is fixed-rate debt. And we've done the match with long-lived assets and long term fixed-rate debt. I mean, Jeff, I think David's right. I think rates are likely to rise. Having said that, they've already moved 75 to 100 bps, and we don't have a lot of robust economic growth in the economy today. But I do think it's probably likely that we'll see a higher rate environment going forward.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Have you guys seen already any demonstrable impact on asset pricing, either deals being retraded, or do you expect a better acquisition environment ahead?","David E. Simon","No, I mean, I don't think there's been a really reaction on the transaction side because of rising rates at all. I have not seen that at all.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And maybe this one's for Rick, just on occupancy costs, I'm curious. The pace of sales growth is decelerating, but re-leasing spreads have been fairly healthy. Why haven't we seen an increase in occupancy costs? And do you think that's going to ratchet up in the next 12 months?","Richard S. Sokolov","Well, one of the components of occupancy costs are sales and the rents. Frankly, we're only rolling relatively small percentage of our square footage every year. And our sales have been growing pretty aggressively, and our spreads have been growing right along with that. So as we pointed out earlier, given that we're 11.3%, we think we still have considerable room to grow our rent even in a moderating sales environment.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And just maybe an understanding percentage rents. I know overall, the portfolio does about $577 a square foot. But when you guys look at who actually pays percentage rents, does the sales productivity of those tenants vary much from the portfolio average? I'm just curious if the productivity of the percentage rent payers is sort of higher or lower than the portfolio as a whole?","Richard S. Sokolov","It is all over the block. We've got over 1,200 tenants that pay us percentage rent. So we have a very wide and diverse base. And really, there's no particular corollary between how would you say, sales productivity and the payment of percentage rent.","David E. Simon","And to amplify Rick's point about 1,200. A lot of our percentage rent payers are actually department stores that pay a 1% or 2% or 3%, depending on the vintage of the original deal. And I would tell you that, that's a big component of our percentage rent. And as you might imagine, it's been kind of static over the last several years. And in some cases, down when you're talking about a penny.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just one last question, actually, for you, David. I recall that I think Simon or Chelsea had bought in Craig's interest in their Carlsbad's outlet years ago for, I think, around a 10 cap. Are there any more of those purchase options still lingering with Craig?","David E. Simon","We're looking. I'd like to find a few more, but I don't believe so. But if I stumble upon it, I'll let you know.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nathan Isbee of Stifel.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just focusing on the same-store growth. You're in the mid-5s through the first half of the year against some pretty tough comps in '12. And you had mentioned earlier in the year that some of the redevelopment might weigh on '13 growth. Would you say you've navigated through that better than expected, or should we expect some of that to rear its head in the second half of the year?","David E. Simon","Well, I think our comps -- I have been very, very pleased, and it's above our own internal budgets on our comp, our comp NOI growth. So it's -- we've -- the team, the folks, the leasing, the management folks have done a fantastic job year-to-date and beaten my own internal expectations. So they've done a great job.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I mean, so looking ahead to the second half of the year, I mean you do have some pretty easy comps from last year. Is there anything out there in the redevelopment that should make us think that you would not continue what you've been doing here in the second -- in the first half?","David E. Simon","Well again, redevelopment, we exclude. So it's really -- it's not -- that's not a net number. So let's put that aside. I mean look, there are unknowns in the business environment, right? Sales. I hate blaming the weather, I will never blame the weather. Even if we miss one quarter because of the weather, you will not hear the weather excuse here.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Will you take credit for it though?","David E. Simon","We won't take credit. We will not blame an early Easter, a late Easter, early Halloween or a late Halloween. But there are lots of things, Nate, out of our control: tenant bankruptcies, lousy sales, lousy weather, whatever, international politics, U.S. politics, whatever changes the consumer mindset. So I mean we're still in an uncertain environment, that's why we try to be very cautious in how we look at things. And I've been, as I said to you, I wish I could give you a number, I won't. You know we don't. But I've been very, very happy with the way the teams executed operationally. They've done a great job thus far.","Operator","And your next question comes from Vincent Chao, Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to clarify, just on the McArthurGlen deal. I know you're going to provide more details when it finally closes. In terms of the guidance update though, I mean is there anything baked in for accretion for McArthurGlen and also, any transaction costs baked in?","David E. Simon","No, not at all, not -- it's not in our numbers. Correct.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then, just going back to the interest rate commentary. I mean, appreciate the color on not wanting to pre-pay some of the mortgages. But just curious if you're thinking about pre-funding some of the unsecured debt that's coming due, given where rates are today, how they've backed up in light of your rating increase or improvement there?","David E. Simon","Yes, that's a distinct possibility as we look out in the third and fourth quarter. That -- I would -- Steve, can add to this. But I -- we always are trying -- we always get ahead of that schedule. So it wouldn't surprise -- it shouldn't surprise you if we do that some time this year.","Stephen E. Sterrett","Yes, I mean bonds are like mortgages in that there is the equivalent of a yield maintenance. There's a make-whole. So to some extent, you are trading dollars. But having said that, much like we did in December of '12, we went to the bond market to pre-fund, if you will, our '13 maturities because we knew what they were. If you look at our debt maturities schedule, we've got about $900 million of bonds coming due in 2014. So as David mentioned, we do look at the market. We monitor the market. One of the great things about the bond market is that you can go relatively quickly. And so we do have that option to pre-fund that at some point in time.","Operator","And your next question comes from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just 2 quick ones on McArthurGlen, sorry about this. But the EUR 435 million was an equity investment. Can you let us know what the associated debt is that goes along with that?","David E. Simon","We will outline all of that when we're closed on the transaction. But the leverage on -- there's nothing extraordinary about the leverage amount on these assets. So -- but we'll lay it all out with all the facts once all of the elements get closed.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Do you think that's Q3, or is that Q4?","David E. Simon","Let's see. When Q3 -- I would think that it should be completed by the end of this quarter.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, last question. What was the trigger to sell the Laguna Hills Mall?","David E. Simon","It's very interesting. We had a redevelopment plan -- even after that redevelopment plan, given all of the -- what the assets are -- if you've been to Laguna and you know kind of the -- what we owned in Orange County, what the spectrum does and what the spectrum is, our Mission Viejo and Brea Mall. Even with the redevelopment, even though it's well located, it was never going to be a really good core asset like Brea or Mission or Orange, the outlets in Orange. So we said, \"You know what, we can reinvest -- we can take that capital and reinvest it in what we think will be a core opportunity at the end of the day. \" And it was really that kind of thinking.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Yang of Evercore.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","David, you mentioned having no additional purchase options with Craig Realty. But I do recall you did have some prior agreements with Prime when you ended up buying Livermore and Grand Prairie. So maybe based on your comments, is it fair to assume that you have no prior agreement, option or other with any private outlet owners at this time?","David E. Simon","Well, I'm just trying to think. Don't put me on the spot like that. I can't remember everything. We will do -- we are about to do another deal with Prime that actually will probably sign up this week. So -- and they've announced -- it's no secret. I mean it's in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, which we think is going to be a terrific investment for us. And -- so you're putting me on the spot, I mean -- but we've got a couple of other opportunities. So I just want to be careful how you characterize that. But there's other stuff that we're working on that we'll have options to get in on. So I shouldn't unilaterally say, \"Yes, you're right.\" I think there are other stuff out there.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","All right, sorry for putting you on the spot. But maybe for that deal with Prime in Minneapolis, I mean, can you talk about the pricing and the cap rate on that potential deal? And are you going to buy up the entire center outright at this point?","David E. Simon","In that case, there's no option to buy it, frankly. But it's -- we're development partners. So that's -- we're just going in on the development side. So the returns are consistent with kind of what we've developed over the years in the outlet business.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. But you are going to be an owner of that project, right?","David E. Simon","Correct, correct.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And I'm just curious. Why is the expansion at Woodbury Premium Outlet so expensive, given the relatively modest expansion of physical space there? Is there anything unusual going on with that, that would lead to that $170 million investment than you're thinking?","David E. Simon","Well, we're upgrade -- first of all, parking is really expensive because we have to deck the parking to create the additional space. We have a tight site to start with, and we've got a lot of infrastructure work in terms of the parking. A lot of -- we're redoing all of the ingress, egress, all the roads around it. And then, I mean as much as we love the center, it is long in the tooth. So we're also bringing it, keeping it consistently, with consistent theming, but it does need to be renovated. But at the end of the day, even with that said, so you have the parking, you've got all the road work, it's going to make it better for the consumer to get in and out of. We're renovating the mall. We've got some demolishing -- a couple of buildings. You put it all together. New York ain't cheap. It's not like building in the Midwest, you put it all together. I had the same reaction, frankly, but I still like the returns. And it's -- it is the world's best outlet center. So if we're going to spend money anywhere, it ought to be in the world's best outlet center. And so you put it all together, it's a good return. And it is what it is. We're actually very excited; it's progressing. We actually -- originally, were going to do over a 3-year period. I told the guys to go back, figure out how to get it done in '15. And they've come up with a plan. So we're going to -- this thing is going to be hot and heavy for 1.5 years. But I think afterwards, it will reinforce its position as the world's best outlet center. So we're -- we couldn't be more excited about a project than that one.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. But a lot of nonincome-producing work that you're doing there. So a good return to you, but below the 12% that you're getting on some of the other redevelopments in the outlet space?","David E. Simon","Correct, correct, correct.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And then just a final one. I know it's a small potential investment. But can you maybe comment on your intentions that, that land at Oyster Bay that you're trying to buy with some of your partners?","David E. Simon","Nothing really to say other than to the extent it moves forward, us and our partners will look at it and come up with a plan that's got -- that's subject to zoning. And we would expect to come up with a responsible development plan, but it's all going to be something that's going to be subject to getting zoning approvals. But we hope to benefit the community there and work with the community there to come up with the appropriate plan. But it's going to be driven, not just by us, but our 2 highly regarded partners.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Is the goal to build a regional mall at that site longer term?","David E. Simon","No. No, no, I don't see that at all.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Back -- way back to the recovery ratio questions, Steve. The JV recovery ratio is up pretty extensively in the first and second quarter of this year. Is that going to continue at that kind of rate, you think? I mean are we level at 2Q for a recovery ratio in the joint venture platform?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Well, Rich, it's just, I mean, ultimately, it's math. It's a function of where the expenses go relative to the contractual increases that we have built into our leases. Give me your view on where you think inflation is headed and where costs are headed. So far, over a period of several years now, we've been having expenses grow at a slower rate than the escalators in the leases. So it's been additive to the comp NOI growth. In any event, Rich, I would say that the pace of the additiveness will probably slow down.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. That's fair. Then the -- you commented, David, on the, on what's going on in Brazil as far as outlet centers go. What do you think for North America, in terms of how many you can build annually or some number that addresses that sort of concept over the next 5 years?","David E. Simon","Well, I can't put a number on them. I mean there's a big pipeline out there. We're going to do a handful, lots of other guys are involved and trying to do a number of them, and we'll see. I mean I -- not clear to me that they'll all get built, but obviously, it's the flavor of the month. There's any center that's out there that is not meeting its performance expectations, turns into an outlet center. They're all harder to do than what people think, but there's a lot of, obviously, very capable, confident developers out there trying to build outlets. The important thing is, what we build is good. And I can't worry about what others build. I can only worry about what we build. And it's every intention, on our front, to only build what we can lease and generate a positive return on. And thankfully, Rick, we haven't really screwed up yet in the new development side. So hopefully, that will continue.","Richard S. Sokolov","And the only thing that I would emphasize, and David touched on it earlier, is that in addition to new developments, these expansions that we're doing are at some of the best outlet centers in the world, and they're not small. Desert Hills is 147,000 feet. Las Vegas North is 147,000 feet. Seattle was 90,000 feet. These are big substantial expansions that were bringing great retailers, making some of the best in the world even better. And that shouldn't be lost sight of.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. While you're on that, Rick, I have a question for you on Desert Hills. I just was in the area and saw that one. And it's always been a great center. And I'm curious, I didn't quite get exactly what you're doing there. It looks like you might be building a golf course in the middle or something?","David E. Simon","Even though Steve wanted us to...","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, I thought it was finally time to have a golf course at an outlet center.","Richard S. Sokolov","What's going on now is -- there's really 3 things going on simultaneously. We are, as David alluded to at Woodbury, we're building a parking deck behind the existing larger section of Desert Hills, plus we've already built additional great parking behind the smaller section. And now what you're seeing in the interior of the larger section is the actual development of the retail space that's basically going to be an inner ring. So we're going to maintain our race track layout, but it now instead of being single-sided with parking in the middle, it's going to be double-sided with parking in the decks.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I got you. So how many retailers do you have there, do you think?","Richard S. Sokolov","Well, we're adding 147,000 feet. And frankly, one of the things we've been able to do to drive our NOI is to try and be a lot more disciplined on the size of the retailers and maximizing our revenues by trying to fit as many new retail concepts into the space as possible. So I would hope that it would be several dozen, but it remains to be seen because people want as large a store as they can get there.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. I got you. And last thing, guys, do you have any updated thoughts on JCPenney and how they're doing, I guess, over the past quarter?","Richard S. Sokolov","The only thing that I would comment on is that we're obviously in the stores. The stores look good. We know as much about their sales as you do. I will tell you that through our channel check, the debt's trading at par. I think this is just a matter of giving the management team time to position it where they want to position it. It's still a formidable retailer with considerable gross sales, and we certainly hope they can recapture market share and resume a growth profile.","Operator","And your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Two quick ones with Steve. First, Steve, the reversal of the provision for credit losses. I'm just wondering how much of that is a signal to the Street, about how confident Simon is feeling about tenant credit?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Well, Tayo, it's not really a reversal of a provision. It's just the fact that there were some receivables that we had reserved for, and in essence, written off, that in fact, were subsequently collected. But I will say this. As we look at our credit profile of our tenants and as we look at our receivables every month that we do, number of outstanding receivables, number of tenants on the watch list is pretty muted right now. And I would say the overall health of the retailers is pretty, pretty strong right now.","David E. Simon","Yes, other than I just -- there are a few out there that -- and don't ask me to name names because I won't. But there are a few out there that still have some clouds around them, so we are -- we're focused on 2 or 3 out there that are relatively decent sized for the mall business that we'll have to just monitor how they ultimately turn their business around.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, just the JV income, Steve. First quarter, that number was about $54 million. But I think you mentioned that number was on the high side because of some mark-to-market on the Kl\u00e9pierre leases. But in 2Q, the number comes in at $56.5 million. I'm just kind of wondering, from a run rate perspective, what makes sense for us to be modeling?","Stephen E. Sterrett","I would say, Tayo, the run rate is probably more in line with what we saw in the first quarter, backing out that onetime trend [ph], onetime thing we talked about. So it's in the high 40s to about $50 million a quarter, I think.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So what happened this quarter again to make it still elevated?","Stephen E. Sterrett","There was a gain, a small gain, that flowed through related to Kl\u00e9pierre's sale of their home office headquarter building.","Operator","Sir, we have no further question at this time. So I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Simon for closing remarks.","David E. Simon","Thank you very much. Have a great rest of the summer. See you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation.

We refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of the risk factors relating to those forward-looking statements.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com.","For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We had a very productive quarter and are pleased with our impressive financial results. We started, completed and opened several significant new development and redevelopment projects that will further enhance our portfolio. We successfully executed several capital market transactions, extending our average term and reducing our weighted average interest cost. And most importantly, we continue to achieve impressive operating and financial results.","Results in the quarter were highlighted by funds from operation of $2.47 per share, which included a $0.36 charge for the early redemption of our 5.65% notes. On a comparable basis, excluding the debt charge, FFO per share was $2.83 and increased 7.6% year-over-year. We continue to report solid operating metrics and grow our cash flow.","Our mall and premium outlets occupancy ended the quarter at 95.2%, a decrease of 40 basis points compared to occupancy at the end of the first quarter. Tenant bankruptcies processed during the second quarter for retailers including, but not limited to, Rue 21, Payless, BCBG and BB impacted our occupancy by approximately 100 basis points.","Leasing activity remained solid. Average base rent was $52.10, up 3.3% compared to last year, reflecting strong retailer demand. And for our locations, the malls and the premium outlets recorded leasing spreads of $8.13 per square foot, which was an increase of 12.9%.","Reported retailer sales per square foot for our malls and outlets was $618 compared to $607 in the prior-year period, an increase of 1.8%. And for those of you interested in how our international centers are performing, we reported retailer sales were up across the portfolio.","Total portfolio NOI increased 5% or more than $70 million for the second quarter and more than $150 million year-to-date comp NOI increased 4.4% for the quarter. And as a reminder, we do not include lease settlement income in our comp NOI.","On an NOI-weighted basis, our operating metrics were as follows. Reported retailer sales on an NOI-weighted basis was $770. Average base minimum rent was $68. Leasing spreads would have been 14.1%. These metrics demonstrate the health of our portfolio.","The type of operating metrics and returns I mentioned are the result of disciplined investments and focus on our operations. At the end of the second quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing in 25 properties across all three of our platforms, with our share of net cost at approximately $1 billion. We completed the Galleria in Houston in the second quarter and opened up the former Saks space for a small shop, tenants and restaurants.","Construction continues on several major redevelopment expansion projects at some of our most productive projects, including La Plaza, The Shops at Riverside, Aventura, Allen Premium Outlets. We expect most of these to open within the next 12 months. On new development, we had another busy quarter, opening four new outlets, three international; Provence, France; Siheung, Seoul, South Korea; Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia; and, of course, we love the U.S., one in Northbrook, Virginia.","Construction continues in our mixed-use development in Fort Worth at The Shops at Clearfork, which will open in the fall of this year. We also commenced construction on a new premium outlet center on the north side of Denver, scheduled to open in September of 2018.","Kl\u00e9pierre, as you know, reported strong financial results last week. They are positioned well to continue to capitalize on the strength in the Europe, improving economic conditions and increasing consumer spending.","Now, quickly on the balance sheet. Another active quarter. We completed a dual-tranche senior offering, a total of $1.35 billion with a weighted average coupon of just over 3% and weighted average term of 7.8 years. We completed the two early redemptions of our senior notes totaling $1.85 billion. And during the quarter, we closed six mortgage loans totaling $1.1 billion, of which our share is $573 million with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.5% and a term of 8 years. And during the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 billion shares of common stock for $244 million. Our current liquidity is more than $6.5 billion.","We also increased our dividend for this quarter to $1.80 per share, a year-over-year increase of 9.1% and a 3% increase from the second quarter of 2017. We will pay at least $7.10 for the year of 2017, which is an increase of 9% compared to last year of $6.50 last year. So, we also raised our guidance to a range of $11.14 to $11.22 of FFO per share. This \u2013 the midpoint of this range is an increase of $0.04 from our prior-year guidance after giving effect to the charge relating to the debt extinguishment of $0.36.","Finally, to conclude, while we don't like to promote, we would like to remind those investors who are interested, we produced yet another quarter of impressive results and operating metrics. There is no company in our industry that has our breadth and quality real estate is as diversified by type of retail real estate and as active in the mixed-use development of real estate and has built and operated successfully in Europe and Asia, has consistently increased earnings cash flow and dividends, has the access to capital with an A-rated balance sheet or as innovative in terms of operations, including connecting with the consumer in deal making from retail to entertainment to venture capital or various corporate transactions like we have.","We're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. Given the re-leasing you're doing in the face of this challenging retail market, are you starting to decrease your exposure to apparel?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yes. Rick?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Let me just give you a couple of metrics. Literally, our apparel now is down to the low-40% as an allocation of our GLA. More importantly, when you look at our new deals over the years, (09:52) we're literally having almost 20% less in terms of allocated to the apparel and shoes and food services, allocated is going up substantially.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And the new tenants coming in, are they able to match or even perhaps beat the rents that the exiting apparel guys are paying?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Absolutely. As you see in our spreads and our average base rent increases, we're able to continue to drive our growth in rents.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Now, I would just add, Craig, the list of new tenants is as interesting as we've seen in quite some time. If you would like, Rick is absolutely prepared and, in fact, excited...","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Enthusiastic.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","To give you the list. However, that's entirely up to you. But I...","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I would love to hear the list.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Okay. I will tell you that it \u2013 from restaurants to new retail concepts, to e-commerce, to street, to malls, there's a lot going on. Now, Rick, without further ado, without further ado, please, please list off some of the ones that we're talking to and in fact doing some business with.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","And these are all tenants that we have in fact executed leases with and are opening stores in both our mall portfolio and our premium outlet portfolio. In the mall, UNTUCKit, Eloquii, b8ta, Peloton, Juice Generation, thredUP, Tommy John, Indochino, Flying Tiger, Calzedonia, Muji, Deavaley (11:34) Rituals. And these are from international, and Shinola, Nespresso. We've got \u2013 and frankly, I could keep going for another 15.","On the premium side, we literally have Dockers, Cody, Basler, Hackett, Havaianas, Hickey Freeman, Karl Lagerfeld, Schua, (11:55) Lafayette 148, Marmo...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I told you, once you get him started, it may never...","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","And frankly, I could go on for another 30 names. The important message is, these properties are vibrant, there is a lot of demand and we're able to execute leases that are growing our rents.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And just one last thing for me. Just maybe some commentary on the Mills, the leasing spread of up 24.9% what's driving that?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We frankly have done a very good job of bringing over to the Mills both our full-price mall tenants and our premium outlet tenants. So, the Mills now encompasses value retailers, full-price retailers, off-price retailers and they're very vibrant environments.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. The sales there have done very well. We've added a lot of restaurants. It's just been a very good, solid business for us.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","David, I think your prior same-store NOI growth forecast was 3%. You've now trended well above that in the first half, so it would indicate a deceleration in the second half. Has that forecast changed at all, given the year-to-date performance above that level and in the context of the current retail environment? And to what extent did maybe expense controls contribute to that pace?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well. Christy, we don't \u2013 our industry gives out a lot of information, as you know, lot of operating metrics. We have always taken the position where we don't update our comp NOI. Obviously, if we didn't feel like we could hit the number that we give at the beginning of the year, we would tell you. But we don't update it every quarter. We have \u2013 we're not going to get into that issue, but we're always trying to outperform the guidance that we give to you and we'll see how it goes.","We are \u2013 have a little more volatility maybe than some other folks because of our overage rent given our tourism properties, and that's trending in the right direction. We love the dollar weakening. But we got a year to operate, and we'll see where the number is. The most important thing is, if we felt like we weren't going to hit the number that we told you from the start, we would tell you.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then, just given all of the list of retailers, there appears to be a lot of still demand for space. How are you thinking about in this environment with more store closings, but in the context that there is still demand? How are you thinking about \u2013 in your conversations with retailers around store closings versus providing rent relief, how are you thinking about rent relief versus just letting those stores close?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, look, I think if I could take a step back and just talk about the company in a sense, I mean, we \u2013 Rick and I are like, I mean, we're \u2013 I hate to say it, but we're like really experienced in tougher times, okay? We actually do our best work in tougher times. I think a lot of that is because we have the judgment of when to fish or cut bait, when to help a person restructure, when not. A lot of these are judgment calls. But as you know, I mean, we have always more or less outperformed when all boats aren't rising with the tide. So, that's what we do.","I will tell you it's not a very fun environment. We're working extra hard. We're pounding the pavement more than ever. We got to go get deals. We got to figure out. We got to restructure some. We got to do all that. It all goes into a blender. We'll use the best judgment we can. And hopefully, we make the right decision. Some of which we do a lot of times. But sometimes, we make the wrong decisions.","We operate historically. And we can go through chapter and verse, but we operate historically when things are a little bit rocky at the very best of our industry, and that's what we're all about. So, there's no set answer. Every situation is case by case. I'd rather it we weren't dealing with this environment but we are, so we just deal with it head on, do the best we can. But I think we'll be leading the charge within our own industry.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, David.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just maybe a follow-up question on that and tying it into (17:06) results. I was just curious if you guys are using more short-term leases at this point in the cycle.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I think that basically is a case by case basis. In this kind of environment, you do tend to do a little bit shorter-term deals because you are betting that the market or the environment will get better, but I wouldn't call it dramatically different. Less than 1% of what maybe our volume is in that category. But again, these are judgment calls. It makes all the sense in the world, frankly, in a lot of cases to do short-term deals, if you feel like the environment's going to get better.","I know, in my own personal view, I could be wrong. But I do think that our environment is going to get better. But that's just my instinct. I would not necessarily bank on it but \u2013 so, in that case, I think doing short-term deals makes \u2013 it could make sense. But a lot of that is also \u2013 the thing about us is that we make the \u2013 unbelievably, given the size of portfolio, but we make decisions space by space, mall by mall, retailer by retailer. We put it. And so, every \u2013 we just don't \u2013 it's just not like, okay, you stamp it out. It's every deal is a little bit different, and that's where our judgment historically has at least allowed us to do okay in the tough environment.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks for that. And then, maybe going back to an earlier comment that you made out liking the softening dollar as it relates to tourism. I was just curious if you could comment on what, if any, benefit that had on 2Q FFO results, as well as the updated outlook.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I think it stabilized some of our tourism properties. But it hasn't had what I'd call \u2013 I haven't really seen it big time yet. But we had a real benefit. We've been \u2013 I mean, we've been, as you know, for the last two years we have, as remarkable as our growth has been and industry leading. We have had an Achilles heel of a strong dollar and a reduction in tourism spend. So, again, you have to put that in perspective. I know we're a little bit bigger company. I know we all want to get granular to the last detail. I assure you, we do run that way. We have a lot of moving parts, and we've been suffering from that. And if we get to the point of stabilization and, in fact, an increase in tourism spend, I think, that's really good for us. But I think it's too early to call that yet.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. Good morning, David.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC","I was just curious. Obviously, you guys had a very strong comp NOI number in the quarter. And I'm just curious. The occupancy decline that you incurred sequentially, was that mostly kind of an end-of-period sort of occupancy decline, or did that occupancy hit kind of happens throughout the quarter and that quarterly run rate is a bit more of a normalized number? Should we look for a little bit of a step-down in the Q3?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, a step-down in occupancy or comp NOI...","Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC","A step-down in the kind of run rate of NOI going from Q2 into Q3.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We don't \u2013 as I said to you earlier, we gave you our view of what our comp NOI will be at the beginning of the year. We do not update it quarterly. I don't think we should ever get in that business. I think, when you look at our business, you got to look a little bit long term not quarter-by-quarter. If for some reason we felt like we weren't going to hit what we told you at the beginning of the year, obviously, we would tell you that. We're not in that position. And the reality is that the occupancy dropped because, as I said in my prepared remarks, we flushed through various bankruptcies. We still have more to do and we \u2013 some of these things are negotiated as we speak.","As an example, you've got Gymboree, which is in bankruptcy. We're negotiating now. Those things have deltas. The good news about our company is the size, the different avenues of growth, the different levels of real estate, the different product type, the international exposure, the way \u2013 the other step that we're going on and we'll be able to manage that, and we're \u2013 we haven't backed off our comp NOI. But we do not, Steve, do it by quarter. I'm sorry to inform you that. But as you know, that's been our \u2013 as far as I know, I don't think we'll update our guidance every quarter, but there's a lot that goes in that, but we don't update comp NOI guidance.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC","That's fine, David. I wasn't looking for an updated number. I was just trying to get a sense as to where the occupancy fell and when the shortfall kind of came. It was end of quarter, beginning of quarter, but we'll...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I mean, I really don't know. But I'd say \u2013 and Steve Broadwater is here. He's telling me throughout the quarter.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC","Okay.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Okay?","Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah. And I guess, maybe a question for you or Rick. When you just sort of look at kind of your watch list, and we've obviously had a lot of tenants that have either restructured leases or filed for bankruptcy, how would you sort of characterize kind of the length of the watch list in terms of stores today versus maybe six months and a year ago?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, look, I mean, there are still others out there. But we're dealing with what I'd call the material, bigger accounts now as we speak. So, I'm not ready to call it my Ben Crenshaw moment. I don't know if you play golf. Do you play golf, Steve?","Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC","I do.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Okay. So, remember, Ben Crenshaw at the Ryder Cup, when the U.S. was down and they had that feeling, I'm not ready to call it my Ben Crenshaw moment. But what we're dealing with some of these troubled guys. I would \u2013 it's very interesting. A publication just wrote about kind of the biggest problem in that area. As you know, I wrote about it in my shareholder letter in 2015 that I saw the handwriting on the wall from some of these leveraged retailers, can't have too much leverage in any business frankly, let alone the retail business. You're talking to a guy that has done workouts in the early 1990s. Rick is a workout guy, too. We're \u2013 I think we're getting through most of it, but there are still some out there that may or may not hitch.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. The only other point I would make and it's really lost in a lot of the dialog by the by Payless, Rue, Gymboree are all restructuring, all of those lenders are converting their debt to equity and they're going to emerge with very substantial retailers with much better balance sheet. You compare that in 2009 where the REIT creditors did not have the confidence in the sector, and they were taking a liquidation bid instead of restructuring and that seems to be missed in all of the other conversation out there.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And I guess, just last question. As you guys think about kind of future redevelopment opportunities, has anything really changed in terms of kind of the taste or the ability to get some of the newer, larger redevelopments kind of underway at this point?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Not really. I mean, obviously, the big potential pipe that we're \u2013 will happen is the big department store recapture. We're being very methodical about it. We are being very focused on paying the right price for the real estate. We're also very focused on how we manage it internally in terms of resources. But that pipeline will be big. It will be material. It will be beneficial to our real estate, but we're going to be reasonably methodical about it.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thanks. That's it for me.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you. Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey. Good morning out there. So, two questions. The first one is, in thinking about Ascena and other brands like that, how often are you guys surprised about which retailers either declare bankruptcy or which \u2013 or if a retailer just wants to close stores, which stores they actually close? Do you guys find that you generally have a pretty good read on it, or do the retailers sometimes surprise you?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I don't want to comment about any one particular retailer. But generally, if a retailer is in bankruptcy, obviously, that gives them flexibility to basically cancel the lease. We kind of know. I mean, it's not \u2013 it's \u2013 sometimes, we're surprised. Obviously, there's a lot of games of chicken played. They hire workout guys that are meaner and tougher than Rick. We have stare downs. But you more or less know, in bankruptcy, kind of what's going to shake out.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And then, the second question is, in last quarter's earnings calls, your \u2013 one of the bigger peers said they want to explore options. Obviously, if nothing happens, how do we interpret that as anything other than sort of not good for retail outlook or mall value? So, if nothing happens, do we say like, hey, retail is actually going to get a lot tougher or malls aren't worth what we think they are? Or is there a way to think of it in a different way?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I'm not really going to answer that question, okay? So, that's \u2013 we're very focused on what we're doing. I'm not going to really get into that debate, Alex. I'm sorry. And we're \u2013 that question is better addressed not to us.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. I appreciate that, David. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","No worries.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","On your same-store NOI growth rate of 4.4% in 2Q, I think this was stronger than the market was expecting, which is encouraging, especially considering GDP growth was maybe 2%. But people often talk about differences by quality. And it seems, just looking at the results and what you guys quoted versus other retail peers, that portfolio mix including property type is becoming important.","So, I was just wondering if you could discuss to what extent you see levels of strength vary by mall versus outlets versus mills or if it's by region or help us otherwise try to understand what could be differentiating the Simon portfolio.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I do think property type plays a role into that, for sure. I mean, there's no question about that. But I also think the depth and breadth of the organization plays a role in that as well. And I think we're an important vendor to a lot of retailers because we have good real estate where they make money and we do a lot of things to improve the portfolio. We're doing a lot of stuff on the marketing front to drive traffic. We're here to help our retailers with all sorts of programs. I'm always somewhat surprised on the ones that do participate and others that don't. We can help drive traffic to their store. But I think it's just part of \u2013 we've \u2013 I would say we've pretty much outperformed year-over-year.","I'm looking at Steve and Tom. They can give you the numbers. But we pretty much always had really leading comp NOI growth, so it doesn't surprise me that we're leaving the pack again this year, including the strip center guys. We're \u2013 we've outperformed them as well. So, I don't know. I just \u2013 it's just something that we take pride in. There is no guarantee that we'll continue to do that. But it's \u2013 that's what we've done historically in terms of strip centers, malls, retail or whatever.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, along those lines, again, the 2Q result was pretty impressive. I was wondering though, if you look at your income statement, and I totally get that this is consolidated and it doesn't include JVs, revenues rose 3.5% year-over-year in the quarter and expenses were up 2.9%. And when you get outside of malls, other sectors regularly break out same-store NOI between revenue and expense. So, I was just wondering if you could give any color on how the two lines, revenues and expenses, would look for Simon.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I mean, the \u2013 I think part of the issue is that we've consolidated some assets with our European outlet business. So, you're seeing a little bit of that in terms of the revenue growth. Now, on the other hand, expenses there, they don't operate probably at quite the margin we do. But there is no \u2013 we are such a size (32:12) that there's just nothing that you're going to point to that's that out of the ordinary. And we try to run very efficiently.","I mean, we kind of knew, as you know, what we did on the corporate G&A front. We knew this was going to be a tough year. Rick and I and a few other executives are taking some reductions in comp. We just think it's a right thing to do in this environment. So \u2013 but the one thing that we will not do is run these properties so that they are not \u2013 we think of our real estate as hotels. And that's not to say we perform this. But if we \u2013 we have to have a good product, and the product has to feel good to the consumer, and we're not skipping on that side as well.","But you had some movement...","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We had some movement in these numbers from what's consolidated and what's in the JV and some portfolio movement which my guess is more of the answer to your question than anything else.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, just last one. Would you say, on NOI, it's fair to think that margin is continuing to expand?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We're focused on it. We're not miracle workers.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Could you talk a little bit about your views on usage of CapEx to close on deals and, more in particular, if there is any noticeable trend in the CapEx you're using for new rental value that's on a percentage basis, if there is any noticeable trends going forward?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","This is Rick. There is absolutely none. If you go back over the years, our TA per foot has been in a very tight range, and it remains in that range for this quarter.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, okay. It's hard to kind of account for the timing of when you spend the CapEx which is why I asked that question. And...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Did you \u2013 I think you broke up there. Could you restate what you just said? I'm sorry.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I just said sometimes it's hard to triangulate and to account for the timing when you spend the CapEx versus when you're doing lease \u2013 doing new leases.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well \u2013 but again, CapEx is \u2013 yeah. We show you our tenant allowance number, okay? CapEx is basically associated with redevelopments in the portfolio or new developments. So just want you to understand it kind of \u2013 if it's a tenant allowance, that shows up as outlined in our 8-K, okay?","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And second question. In 2016, you guys capitalized internal leasing costs of about $49 million, still a very efficient number compared to the size of your company. But just going forward, I was wondering if you had any thoughts on the new accounting rules that are coming out that might require you to expense most of that.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. Well, we're going to follow GAAP. So, it is what it is.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So, do you actually have an estimate of that $49 million? Is most of that going to be expensed or a portion?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Not at this \u2013 when it comes into force in 2019. In 2019, we'll give you that number. But we don't at this point. But I'm sure our number will be comparable to anybody else's.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Morgan with Canaccord. Your line is open.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Good morning. On the store openings that you talked about, Rick, at least, when you look at where some of the newer concepts are going, some of the e-commerce retailers and others, it seems a little concentrated in the kind of A-plus malls and outlet centers. And I'm wondering, as you have discussions with some of these chains as they're rolling out the first 20 or 30 stores, I mean, how do you think the pool of malls is ultimately going to be for these concepts, if they're successful? I mean, do you get conversations starting where they see themselves as potentially having 200 stores or 250 stores, or is it maybe going to be more limited than that?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, in fact, as we talk to them, it's not unusual for them, when they're opening their first store or their second store, they're going to want to do it in properties that they have the highest confidence in. But I will tell you that when you look at the e-tailers as a class, there are now over 280 stores in the United States from the pure play e-tailers that are opening stores and you go through in UNTUCKit, Warby, Bonobos, Blue Nile, Eloquii, Fabletics are all raising incremental rounds of capital that is dedicated to opening stores. So it's going to be a process, but I believe they have all recognized that having a well-positioned fleet of stores is certainly necessary and optimal for them to grow their business.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Do you think we'll see kind of this next wave \u2013 I mean, obviously, they're raising capital for this. But in your conversations with them, they're planning for sort of a deeper wave of growth within the mall space.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We've seen it. So, for example, Eloquii opened their first store. They're now opening three more with us. Blue Nile opened their first store with us. They're opening four more with us. It's going to take time, but it's absolutely happening.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I think \u2013 look, I think, Paul, here's what I would say too, and Rick said it but let me just say it as well. The retailers always will tend to go, as Rick said, to the no-brainers early on. But then they realize the profitability they make and then they will grow. Depending on what kind of retailer they are, that could be 400 stores, 200 stores, 50 stores, 20 stores. The news that's important is that, in this cluttered world of trying to get people focused, we are seeing more and more brands that want to gravitate toward where traffic is, and traffic continues to be in a number of centers. And I do think, from the e-commerce folks, there is \u2013 not all, but there is a limit to attracting eyeballs online that they can't get in the physical world.","Now, I mean, malls are getting a bad rap, but the reality is we see it in media, we see it in the entertainment world, we see it on the food side, we see it with the theaters, they \u2013 we see it with the fitness guys like at Life Time. They all want to congregate in the best location and where the traffic is and by and large in communities throughout the country, that's the mall. And that has not changed.","So, I know the narrative might be a little bit different and I know, obviously, retail is under more pressure than it has been in the past, but I have my own theory on that, which I've explained to you in a few shareholder letters. But that's the good news here. Now, that doesn't mean that there's \u2013 you have to cycle some of the poor performers out with some of the better ones. And by the way, we've been doing this for quite some time.","We all remember Woolworths or W.T. Grant or Steve Roth is on the phone doing his thing, Corvettes. I mean, you go down the list, Caldor. I mean, that's just the way it works. But between media, virtual reality folks, they want to be where the traffic is and where people want to hang out and that's by and large the kind of stuff that our industry has. Please don't lose sight of that.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thanks. My other question is just on the buyback, you continued to exercise it in the quarter. And when it came up last quarter, it seemed like you were suggesting that it is something that we should view as an ongoing kind of part of your business, at least on a leverage-neutral basis. Is there any update to that? Is it something that maybe people should think of as just, when they look at their models, something that should be incorporated on an ongoing basis?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I still think it's in our arsenal to give back capital to shareholders. Obviously, we're more focused on our dividend growth because that is testament to the cash flow that we generate from our properties. And as you know, I mean, we're going to have at least a 9.1% increase this year, which, my favorite guy, I've quoted Ben Crenshaw, now I'll move to Adam Sandler, that ain't too shabby. Okay?","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Right, all right. Great. Thanks.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi. I was wondering, are the batch of newer tenants on the shop side that you've been leasing space to over the past couple years, are they taking the same-size stores as a lot of the legacy retailers that they've replaced?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Totally a function of the retailer. Some of them want a larger format like Muji. Some of them want smaller formats like Eloquii. And frankly, our job, and we've talked about this in other calls is to basically be able to manufacture space. And in our great properties, getting back space just enables us to drive our NOI by bringing in more tenants and raising revenue and raising productivity.","Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And I guess on the restructuring side, I think a few tenants were mentioned. I know you don't want to talk about specific tenants. But generally speaking, when you see a restructuring and these tenants come out and they're in a better financial position, are they typically doing something different on the operating side too to drive sales or it's just better overhead, better ability to pay rent. I mean, what have you generally seen over the past few years?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I think the biggest issue is they don't have any debt. So, they can \u2013 I mean, without the debt, they can invest in their business. And it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. You have too much debt, you obviously have to service that debt. So, how do you service that debt? You reduce your investment in the stores or your investment in technology, you reduce the inventory in the store, right, because you can't afford to have the inventory in the store and you reduce the service. You put it all together and it is self-fulfilling, without question. And unfortunately, we've seen that.","And so, the most important thing is, when they are restructured, they have \u2013 they now have the cash flow to do those three things, hopefully invest in the store, hopefully invest in more inventory, hopefully invest in better service and, to some extent, technology.","So, that's the model. And unfortunately, we've seen it go in different direction. But we're hopeful that, as Rick said, we're seeing some of these folks restructure. We're here to help them within reason to do that. But it's not our fault that they're in the spot they're in. And let's not lose sight of that. We are, on the other hand, been investing in our product, we've been investing in our services, we've been investing in our marketing. We have not run from our responsibility to make these physical asset better and to communicate with the consumer directly to get them excited about seeing what we have to offer in our \u2013 in the physical world.","Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. That was it. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to drill down into the numbers a little bit. It looks like you had a nice rebound in Aero this quarter, maybe $15.2 million versus the $5 million headwind last quarter. How should we think about that going forward? And, David, I know you mentioned some seasonality with Aero last quarter. Is that $15 million how we should be thinking about that going forward?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","You have to look at Aero \u2013 yeah. You can't really look at Aero quarterly. But you got \u2013 for us, we look at it annually. And obviously, the first quarter was a huge transition, a big loss which I don't think the market understood. That's why we might have been off a couple of cents or $0.02 or $0.03 in consensus. That's very normal for a retailer to have their losses early on and then start to make it back up. So, what we're seeing in Aero is exactly what we thought we would see, but we don't give quarterly guidance.","I will tell you this, though. They had a \u2013 I mean \u2013 knock on wood, I mean, we're seeing very good progress at Aero and we're still comfortable with how we modeled Aero in our numbers. Our increase in guidance has nothing to do with Aero. So, we're still got in the totality of the Aero results the way we saw it at the beginning of the year. But they had a good second quarter and back-to-school is percolating. Lot of work to do there, but this is a brand that had $900 million of sales and it's got a core constituency and we think it's going to be okay.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then, maybe just one more question for me. It looks like cash NOI was up. Straight-line rents were down. Could you maybe walk us through the moving parts and how those two buckets work with each other and how we should be thinking about that going forward?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","The straight-line reduction was a function of the \u2013 if we have any straight-line receivables on our books and somebody cancels a lease through bankruptcy, we have to write it off that quarter. And that's why you saw a pretty significant decrease...","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So, not like \u2013 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cut you off, David.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","No, no, no. It's \u2013 basically, the vast majority of that is essentially the write-offs of the bankruptcies that we may have had on our balance sheet.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. So, not like free rent burn-off that was being put into the same-store NOI pool or anything like that, primarily bankruptcies?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","No, sir. All primarily the bankruptcies. We got to write off that receivable right when the lease is rejected.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Or they go into bankruptcy.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's helpful. And then, one other quick question. It looks like interest expense went up. Is that because the buybacks went on the line of credit, or am I speaking about that correctly?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well. Yeah, I mean, it's debt in our cash flow. So, we're not necessarily borrowing...","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Just to do our buyback, we have enough cash flow to do it out of our cash flow. So, I just...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, I just \u2013 nothing major there other than we did \u2013 I think we did have a write-off on our old revolver that may have gone through the second quarter because you got some of that on the balance sheet.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We have the redemption every 30 days.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah, the redemption, which we had an extra 30 days. And then, we also have the consolidation of the certain MG assets as well. So, nothing unusual there other than a couple of consolidations and the extra time on our \u2013 extra 30 days on our redemption.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. That's it for me, guys. Thank you for the additional color.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure, no problem.","Operating: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, folks. David, just given your comments on the unhealthy relationship between debt and retailing, as a derivative I guess on that business, what do you feel is the right level of debt for a retail real estate owner? And has that changed in the past year or two?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, for a real estate owner, look, I think \u2013 look, I like the spot we're in, especially if there is more volatility in the capital markets. I think we all have to be careful with too much leverage in any industry or in any business. I live through it. Rick live through it, which is good for our shareholders to know that we've got a few spurs on our boots, right? Spurs on our boots, right? That's not on our results, right? It's on our boots. But I don't want to give you specific numbers. I think every company needs to come to their own metric. We're kind of disciplined. And then, the A rating, we want to maintain that. But I think every businesses \u2013 everybody should come to their conclusion. I would hate to give you a number that's right for the industry.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And how do you think about the acquisition of Whole Foods by Amazon? I know it's not one of your tenants. I guess, I'm wondering, do you think Amazon or maybe another group entirely could target a mall anchor? There is no shortage of them, considering that frankly the enterprise value of some of these publicly-traded mall anchors are really a fraction of the consideration that's been paid for Whole Foods, particularly when you look at it on a per square foot basis?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I have a lot of interesting thoughts on it, but I will provide none of them on the record. But I do think it's \u2013 the good news for us, as an industry, it does reinforce that, in my opinion, the importance of connecting with the consumer through a physical business. But beyond that, I really \u2013 I mean, we really don't \u2013 I really don't want to comment on that. I mean, I have a lot of opinions. But I just kind of share them with my board and some of the guys here. But I don't really want to get into that. It's not \u2013 they're just my opinions, and who knows if they're right or wrong.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Maybe just one last question for Rick. I guess, sort of, a two-part or \u2013 as far as it relates to leasing, can you talk about any themes, particularly geographic themes, to new leasing activity or volume of leasing activity of late? And on the renewal side, I'm just curious if you see any change in the rent growth or concessions compared to the past few quarters.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","On the renewal side, the answer is no. Again, if you look at what we reported, I think it shows pretty steady, consistent progress where we were last year in connection with our renewals for 2018. So, there is nothing there. In terms of geographic, not really. We have obviously a very strong and focused effort to get local tenants involved in our properties, and I think we're doing a good job with that. But there's no regional, geographic trend that would drive the leasing activity.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Look, and I think entrepreneurialism is back. Lots of people want to start up a business. We're seeing explosion in the food area. We've obviously seen explosion in the fitness and wellness area, cosmetic area. So, all of that, we've seen it in the mixed-use area. So, I think that's all good. The stuff does take time. You do have downtime. But in that sense, we're excited about having the ability to broaden our mix, which I think is very important for us to do.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Barclays. Your line is open.","Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Just back to an earlier comment. Why do you think the environment is going to get better? What do you see in the broader market or maybe within your portfolio that gives you the confidence?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I said I'm not ready to declare that, okay? But I'm starting to think about it, and we'll see.","Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then, what's your view on dispositions right now. Would you be interested in selling any of your Non-A Malls?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, we always think about selling some assets here and there, and we'll continue that. But we're not \u2013 we've never believed to sell assets just to sell assets, we got to get the right price. We go through a very detailed analysis to do that. And if we feel like we're \u2013 we'll get a fair price, we'll sell some, what I'll call, non-core assets. But we're not under pressure to do it, and we'll continue to cull the portfolio though. Okay? Thank you.","Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Yes. Good morning, everyone. Congrats on a great quarter. Question, could you talk a little bit about your views on the retail outlook, kind of, U.S. versus Europe versus Asia on how that could influence some capital allocation decisions over the next few years?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, listen, I \u2013 the great thing about real estate is it's so unique that we've operated in three major areas and we could get caught up in the macro viewpoint of a country or a \u2013 where capital is flowing. But at the end of the day, it's all about location and supply and demand. So, let's take Japan as an example. Japan, from an overall macroeconomic environment, you would think to yourself, boy, the retail is going to be terrible, okay? But yet, we've got great properties, we got a great product, we have a great partner and we've been kicking tail for each and every year in Japan.","So, we look at it. We really \u2013 and obviously, you want to be careful about where you allocate capital if you don't have \u2013 if you have a concern generally about the country and property rights and stuff like that. But we've avoided those kind of countries. And I would say, right now, we feel good about our Asian business. We opened up in Kuala Lumpur with Genting. It's off to a great start. We just opened in Provence, France. It's off to a great start. Another one in Seoul.","So, I think we can still make money selectively. It's important to know macro trends. But at the end of the day, it's all about the local business because I kind of learned that just watching the Japan scenario play out for us. But at the end of the day, we feel really good about kind of how we've allocated where we are. We can be opportunistic outside of the U.S. But our core focus will continue and always will be the U.S.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Sure. Okay. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, a question for you on your JV with Seritage. Curious if you're thinking about perhaps making more investments on that front, buying out your partner in some of the existing boxes and maybe incrementally investing in more. Saw one of your peers recently do so. I'm curious what your thinking is here.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I think what \u2013 that deal was good for both companies, good for Seritage, good for General Growth. And there is possibility win-win intersects between us and Seritage and Sears for the foreseeable future, and we will try to create that environment and I'm sure they will as well. But there's no guarantee. Anything could happen, but we're always looking to create win-wins for our partners, Seritage being one of them and Sears indirectly in that they're in a lot of our real estate. So, a deal like that made sense for both of those parties. It certainly is possible as we think about things, but it's got to be a win for us as well and, obviously, for the counterparty.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got you. Okay. And then, I want to go back and get some incremental thoughts on leasing spreads. Last year, I think it was third quarter, you and GGP, I believe, first noted the impact of leasing spreads. I believe it drove your spreads down almost 400 bps sequentially. So, I'm just curious here, now, that you've had a couple quarters of 13% spreads following the 10% in 4Q last year, should we be thinking of spreads in this low-double digit range near term? And then, also, just want to confirm that the impact of these amendments are included in same-store NOI but not in spreads.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","No. If it's \u2013 we define it in our \u2013 if there's a lease that's longer than a year, it's in the \u2013 all amendments are in there, okay? And that's defined in our 8-K exactly how we do it. We don't make \u2013 we don't give guidance on rent spreads. We give guidance on \u2013 we don't give guidance on occupancy necessarily. We kind of give you a flavor for it. We don't give guidance on tenant sales. We give guidance on FFO. We give guidance on our comp NOI.","And I'm not going to make predictions of rent spreads. I will tell you that they were down from a couple years ago primarily because of the general retail environment and, obviously, some of the tenant restructurings we've been dealing with, and we'll see how it shakes out.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Fair enough. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum with Boenning. Your line is open.","Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. David, I have a question for you. You guys clearly are executing better than some of your peers. Does that make you think about your ability to add value to other portfolios? And maybe can you give some comments broadly on how you're thinking about possible M&A, especially if there are changes to boards, et cetera? Does that make you change your big game hunting theory?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, as I said to you, I'm out of the big deal business. And I really haven't changed that point of view. If somebody wants to call and talk to me, I'm certainly going to take that call. But I think, Floris, it's \u2013 I wouldn't overreact to one person's quarter here or there that we're outperforming. I will say, over a long period of time, we've tended to have really good comp NOI growth within our \u2013 if you want to call us a mall company, we've been at the top of that, and we certainly have outperformed the strip center guys over the same period of time.","Some of that is a function of what I said at the end of those marks, but it's really not fair for me to like comment on other people's numbers. And I wouldn't react to other folks with one quarter here or one quarter there. Real estate is a long-term business. You got to invest in the product. I think we all make too much out of one quarter here or one quarter there. All these guys are good operators or they wouldn't be here today. And I think you just have to give the benefit of the doubt to people in our industry. It's easy \u2013 I think \u2013 well, I don't want to go there, but the fact is it's \u2013 no one should overreact to one quarter or another. I think everybody's doing the best they can do.","Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Okay. One other \u2013 thanks for that, David. One other question. As we look at the mall sector, clearly, everybody's trading at big discounts. In your opinion, where do you think is the greater mispricing? Is it in the B malls or is it in the A malls?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, look, I think our industry certainly compared to other industry is being mispriced and I'll leave it at that. I think you can be a successful B mall operator.","I don't think you're going to zero. I will tell you that without question. I think a lot of these what people want to call B malls, if they're in the right town and that town is stable and they're a good operator and they're focused and less worried about trying to please Wall Street but more interested in pleasing the community, they can do fine. Their growth may not be as robust as the ones with what I'll call \"A\" properties, but they can do fine.","They may never be able to satisfy Wall Street and the institutional investor wanting kind of real estate that you could put on an annual cover, but they can do fine. But it's got to be focused on the community first, what they can do for the community and then the rest can follow. But look, having well-located real estate gives you a lot of opportunities to change it up over time and to make it better, which is what a lot of us have been doing for decades, not 5 years, 10 years, not 20 years, not 30 years, but 50 years, 60 years, Talban (01:06:28) 50, 60 years; Simon, 50 years, 60 years; General Growth, 50 years, 60 years; CBL, 50 \u2013 40 years, I don't know. I mean, that's a testament to those guys and a testament to their product, and we shouldn't lose sight of that.","Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Great. Maybe one last question on HBS. Any sort of comment based on the sort of the latest news coming from there or strategic plans with your stake in that company?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","How \u2013 guess how I will answer that.","Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","No comments?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","The answer is, I have no comment on that. Our joint venture continues to do exactly what we thought it was. HBC has been a great partner. I've got all the confidence in the world in that team. Richard Baker is a very creative guy, but it's \u2013 we're not a shareholder of HBC. So, it's just not \u2013 it's not \u2013 there's nothing I can comment on that activity.","Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Thanks, David.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. It's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. Thanks for taking the follow-up. David, I wanted to take your comment about the sector being mispriced from a public stock perspective. I'm curious in your conversations with institutional investors either your \u2013 some of your current joint venture partners or prospective partners, how they are thinking about the business both from your non-core potential asset sales or stakes in some of your high-quality assets and how those conversations are going and trying to navigate that mismatch.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, we don't like selling stakes in malls. Obviously, you do it if you need the financial flexibility. But we've always looked at bringing in partners, if there's a new opportunity and we want to manage our balance sheet. That's the way we've looked at it so \u2013 but, Michael, institutional investors aren't always right. I mean, so, sometimes, they buy it.","I'll never forget. I had one of the biggest and best sovereign wealth funds. I begged them to help me buy General Growth when they were in bankruptcy, and that was an 8.5 (01:09:20) cap rate, and this was before all the histrionics on the recap and all that stuff. But just \u2013 let's go buy it together, and the guy wanted a 9.5. (01:09:30) And I mean, so, they're not always right. I don't really have a comment on it. We're really not that active looking for institutional investors.","Now, if we had a new deal to do something, I think we'd find the capital, but we haven't been really out looking for it. I think, on the B mall, the mall activity is starting to percolate. There's probably more people thinking about it a little bit more and somebody, I believe, in rolling up the \u2013 what is perceived as the downtrodden, whether that is the reason it's debatable. But what is perceived as a downtrodden, it's going to make money. It may not be appropriate for a public company \u2013 for public companies. But somebody is going to buy a lot of this stuff with cash flows and make a few bucks.","Rick and I may \u2013 maybe we're going to start a new company so...","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","If we think about \u2013 if I make an analogy Q2 back in 2009, and I guess to go back to that time, but you did pretty big solid for the industry, right? You issued debt and equity and allowed the REIT market, capital markets to reopen. Isn't there some sort of analogy of being able to sell some interest in high-quality assets at remarkable cap rates to sort of prove evidence in some ways about where the stocks are trading. And I don't know if whether you agree with that or not.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I think that's the silliest idea in the world. Honestly, why would I want to sell an A asset to make a print for you to be comfortable with and then you say, oh, it's great. But then, oh, but that's only the top of the portfolio. Or you have to sell B assets now, and C assets and E assets and D assets, it's a short lived \u2013 we don't think about like that. We think about operating our business, how to make it better for the consumer, how to market better, how to lease it better, how to redevelop better, not financial engineering that will be short-lived and have no impact.","Why would I want to give up growth rate \u2013 a growth rate of an A asset? So, you will say, well, that's great. But what about the rest of your portfolio? It just makes no sense to me. We don't need to now. I understand if you need to because you need the financial flexibility. But as evidenced our ability to raise $1.350 billion in three hours, thankfully, we're not in that spot. That's just not what we do.","But like I said, if there was a deal that we felt was good, I think we could raise institutional capital if we wanted to. Maybe we don't. We don't need to. I just \u2013 I am \u2013 I just don't understand that logic. It is short-lived. I mean, others have done that and they got a one-day pop. And now, they've lost the growth. Now, look, they did it because maybe there is too much exposure of one mall and I get \u2013 and maybe they needed the capital for other things. So, there are reasons to do it. But to do it just to print so it makes the NAV investors happy, I don't know. Forget it. It ain't happening.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's why I asked the question to get your perspective on it.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I hope I gave it to you.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Your answer was very clear. Last one...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","You may disagree with it. But at least, it's clear, right?","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Well, okay. Your point is, if you needed the capital, you would do it otherwise, as there's no reason to put up a print on the screen, which I understand.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","The last one. Just the overall environment with a lot of the headlines, the news media, even your retailer, public retailer conference calls. And I would say some operators and I know you said don't look at one quarter, but not all of the mall brethren operate at the same level you do or able to strike the same type of deals that you can and being able to stay ahead of the trends. That's why you are you and they are they. But how do you not let that whole perspective negatively impact the environment and become the self-fulfilling prophecy to some extent.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I think we all have to be careful about that, right? So, I think the retail community has been overly negative on the mall product. I don't know why they do it, but we're just going to get up off the mat, keep doing what we do. So, I'm not \u2013 this isn't sugar coating. We're in a tough environment, but we've seen it before, yeah. Could this be different this time around? Yeah. But I don't necessarily \u2013 I don't buy that equation, okay? That's not how we're operating our business.","Do you need to be \u2013 maybe a touch more conservative? Do you have to hoard a touch more capital? Do you have to be a little more flexible with retailers? Of course. But I \u2013 but we don't see the end of our business. I think Rick told me he went to the ICSC meeting, and it was kind of all the negativity and I heard it from like four people. What did you say exactly, Rick?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I basically said we had a board meeting and it was a close vote, so we decided to stay in business.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","So, I do think the narrative is a little more negative. I think a lot of that is facilitated by investors making the other side of our bet. It's interesting. It's like I have a lot of points of view on certain transactions out there. We have never really seen that before. It's very interesting to see how that side of the world operates, but where we're \u2013 we got to deal with it. So, look we after this meeting Rick and I are going to be spending six hours approving capital projects to make our properties better, and that's how we're thinking about the business.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Well, I appreciate you sticking on to take the questions.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. No worries.","Operator","Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to David Simon for closing remarks.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.

Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Good morning. The last couple of months obviously have been challenging as the country has endured the devastating impacts of natural disasters and tragedies, which have impacted millions of people across the country including many of our Simon employees and their families. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all affected. There has been significant disruption from Texas to Florida, Puerto Rico and California. And due to the dedication and heroic efforts of our field team members, thankfully, all of our personnel got through these events.","Across all of our platforms, we closed 45 of our centers for combined 412 days due to natural disasters including the one that occurred in May at Colorado Mills due to a hailstorm. All of our centers in Texas and Florida had been back to normal. Our centers in Northern California now back to normal, operations as well after the horrific wildfires there. And we expect Colorado Mills, which has been closed since May to open in time for the holidays.","Our two centers in Puerto Rico are currently not open and we are in the process of making repairs where possible. We expect full restoration of these centers to take some time given the damage to Puerto Rico's infrastructure and availability of building materials. We are fully insured for this event including business interruption insurance. We currently expect the closure of Puerto Rico centers to impact our FFO by approximately $0.03 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and this reduction is currently included in our guidance. I couldn't be more proud of the Simon team who have demonstrated courage, resilience, perseverance and how they professionally responded to these unprecedented events.","Now, let's talk about the third quarter. We had another very productive quarter and are very pleased with our financial results. Results in the quarter were highlighted by funds from operation of $2.89 per share, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year. For the nine months ended, our comparable FFO per share growth was 6% which, without question, will be at the high end of our peer group. We continue to report solid operating metrics and cash flow growth.","Our malls and outlets occupancy ended the quarter at 95.3%, an increase of 10 basis points compared to the occupancy at the end of the second quarter. Leasing activity remained solid. Average base rent was $52.42, up 3.3% compared to last year, reflecting strong retailer demand and pricing power for our locations, the malls and outlets. Re-leasing spreads of $7.21 per square foot, an increase of 11.2%. Reported retailer sales per square foot for the malls and outlets was $622 compared to $604 in the prior-year period, which is an increase of 3%.","Total portfolio increased 4.8% year-to-date or $212 million and 3.9% for the third quarter. Comp NOI has increased 3.6% year-to-date and 2.5% for the third quarter. I remind everybody, once again, we do not include lease settlement income in our comp NOI disclosure. Also as a point of reference, our third quarter growth is typically less than the growth rate we achieved for the first half of the year if you are interested in that and have a desire to look historically.","Now on an NOI-weighted basis, our operating metrics were as follows: reported retailer sales on NOI-weighted basis would be $776 per foot compared to $622 per foot; average base rent would be $68.54 compared to $52.42; leasing spreads would increase 17% compared to 11.2%. And these weighted metrics, again, reinforce the quality of our assets, and they're not to be ignored.","At the end of the third quarter, redevelopment and expansion were ongoing at 31 properties across all three of our platforms. During the quarter, we opened a significant expansion in Allen Premium Outlets in North Texas. We have a significant opportunity to continue to improve our portfolio through the densification of our centers with the addition of mixed-use components, hotels, multifamily, office, and others, and included in our supplement this quarter, you'll begin to see that list of activity.","We have a number of projects under way. We'll continue to add different uses to our centers where we see the opportunity to generate accretive returns. Construction continues on several major redevelopments and expansions, including The Shops at Riverside, Aventura Mall, Toronto Premium Outlets, just to name a few, and we expect these, again, to open over the next 12 months. We recently opened The Shops at Clearfork, great new center. This open-air center is an excellent example of the type of vibrant mixed-use, community-centric environment we create, along with our partners. We have carefully curated a mix of shopping, dining, entertainment, office. And The Shops at Clearfork will be the dynamic hub of a timeless asset in the terrific city of Fort Worth, Texas.","Construction continues on two new outlet centers, both in really good markets, Edmonton, Canada and north side of Denver, Colorado, which will open in the spring and fall of 2018, respectively. Our share of redevelopment activities continues to approximate $1 billion.","Simple update on capital markets. During the first nine months of this year, we closed on 12 mortgage loans totaling $2 billion: our share of that is $1.4 billion; weighted average interest of 3.12%; term of 6.8 years. Our current liquidity is $6.5 billion. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever. We have the highest investment-grade credit rating in the industry, more than five times interest coverage, and I again reinforce our financial flexibility is a real advantage that cannot be but continues to be overlooked.","Today, we announced the dividend of $1.85 per share for the quarter. That's a year-over-year increase of 12.1%. We will pay $7.15 per share in 2017, which is an increase of 10%, and look out for 2018, which will be higher. We are updating our guidance range to $11.17 to $11.22 of FFO per share. That is the highest in the REIT industry. This is an increase of $0.03 on the low end of the range compared to our prior guidance, even with the $0.03 reduction for the quarter I mentioned previously due to the closure of our two Puerto Rican assets.","So, finally, as you can see from our results this morning, we produced yet another quarter of impressive results and metrics. We continue to invest in our product and generate the kinds of returns that will continue to grow our earnings, cash flow and dividends. We're now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning out there.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","This is not that far out there. We're in the Midwest. It's not like we're way out there, okay?","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Well, that would be...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","There is activity for all of those investors, west of the Hudson. I just wanted to point people, I want you to point that out. Alex, what can I answer for you?","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Well, thank you for that. So two questions. First, just in Puerto Rico, can you just tell us sort of a breakout number of tenants who are paying, or said differently, the number of tenants who aren't paying? And then on the business interruption insurance, maybe for there or elsewhere, what the impact is and if we should expect anything into next year or if the $0.03 is really just in the fourth quarter this year and next year we shouldn't expect any impact?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. I'll give it to you, really very high level. So, we've taken a deductible. We had a deductible expense that went through the P&L in the third quarter for Florida and Puerto Rico. After that deductible, we're fully insured.","In the fourth quarter, there is nobody paying rent at this point. We don't collect business insurance until all of that is resolved. And they won't begin to pay rent until we restore the building. And I wish I could give you a sense of that, but it's really going to depend on the next couple of months because there is a lot going on down there and power needs to be restored permanently. And as I said, we're doing our repairs and restoration work concurrently, but it's going to take some time to get it going.","So, that $0.03 is what we expect. That would have been essentially our net operating income for those two properties in the fourth quarter. It could drag into 2018. However, if it does, we would expect some of that eventually to be recouped through the BI, but we can't book the BI until it's actually cash collected. And so, when we do our earnings and 2018 guidance, we'll have a better idea of exactly the impact.","Again, I'm more focused on the tragedy at Puerto Rico. At the end of the day, if you extrapolated the $0.03, that's less than 1% of our business. So, it's obviously immaterial. But we're more interested in what's going on there. If you take out our redemption here, you know that we earn well over $11.50. So if we're at $0.11 or so, that's basically less than 1%. Even you, Alex, can do that math, right?","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yes, although I do have a colleague for backup if need be. Then the second question is, in the other income breakout, the lease settlement income jumped and then marketable securities gains. Could you could just provide a bit more color? And then on that lease settlement, was any of that from Teavana, or is that still outstanding?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","None of that is from Teavana and there's been a little bit more lease settlement income this year. Again, that's not in our comp NOI. As you know, we did own Seritage stock. We did sell that. And I would only point out for those of you that \u2013 I would hope most people would study our P&L without making statements, is that we also had more than offsetting what I'd call unusual expense on the expense line, all of that you can see in our 8-K, in our P&L.","So I think like this is all washes. If anything, it's a little bit more negative, but that's up for you guys to determine. And we outperformed even with the deductibles, even with the extraordinary expenses that we incurred that were higher than what I'd call the higher than normal lease settlement income, and obviously the Seritage marketable securities gain. It's a gain by the way, not a loss. Let's keep that in mind too.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Thanks, David.","Operator","And our next question is from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning. It's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. David or Rick, can you just talk about occupancy in terms of the trajectory as we move into the fourth quarter and into next year? And right now in the third quarter, you're sitting about 100 bps over last year, which was a record high. You got to 96.8 bps by the fourth quarter, you're at 96.3 bps in the third quarter. How should we think about the trajectory into the fourth quarter relative to that spread, and how does that line up as we move into next year from an occupancy perspective?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We should have improvement in the fourth quarter. That's number one. We're not going to give you a number. Number two is we give you guidance in 2018 in February, but the reality is the only reason why it's down is we've had some extra bankruptcies this year. We had a bunch in 2015. We had less in 2016. We had a bunch in 2017. The portfolio is in excellent shape. So, we'll continue to improve upon that. And we've done more leasing this year. I don't have the exact number. Rick might have the total number. But we've leased a lot of space this year, what, over...","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","7 million square feet.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","No, it's more than that, but the point is \u2013 and we're dealing \u2013 the issue with bankruptcies is you're at the whim of the court. So you have a lease, they can cancel it at a moment's notice, and it does take time to lease. But we've leased over 10 million square feet this year. That's a lot of leasing and we'll continue and improve. And like I said, I think we'll have an uptick in the fourth quarter.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Right. I was wondering whether that year-over-year spread is going to continue to widen. So you've gone from 40 basis points, 70 basis points to 100 basis points relative to last year given some of the bankruptcies. How we should think about how the fourth quarter is shaping up, whether that 100 basis points stays flat or whether it narrows as people start to take the space?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We had a lot of bankruptcies go through the third quarter. You can't lease space in a month or two. It's certainly harder to lease space to open up for the fourth quarter once you get that space back in the third quarter because you have build-out and so on. But like I said, we have an uptick, and it's essentially all on the margin the way I look at it.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then second question in terms of capital, and you talked about how strong the balance sheet is and how much liquidity. I noticed that you didn't buy back any shares in the third quarter. Can you just elaborate a little bit about why that was the case and how that differed relative to what you did in the first half?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","The simple answer to that is we've got \u2013 we're very close to some significant redevelopments that we're excited about, and we are very conservative. So we're creating a pile of financial power that we want to take advantage of, and we've got a little bit more redevelopment that you'll see in the next, I don't know, month or two. That's really exciting for the portfolio, and we figured we might as well hoard some cash.","And actually, we also love raising the dividend. I love raising the dividend 10% a year. I really like that. So between the redevelopment, raising the dividend, having a balance sheet that cannot be compromised, with significant firepower, I know it's all ignored right now, but I don't ignore it, and I'm going to rely on my judgment that that's stuff that I shouldn't ignore.","So I know no one wants to pay attention to it. I know nobody cares. But raising that dividend 8%, 10%, 12% a year, having a hoard of cash to put back in the portfolio of accretive returns is really exciting, and having a balance sheet tried, tested, ready to go to work is really a competitive advantage that I really like, and that's what we're going to do. So this dividend is going up, the earnings are going up, the balance sheet is going to get stronger. That's the model we got. That's what we're doing.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, all right. Thanks, David.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I noticed on the development activity report that the Edmonton project is listed under Mills. I wondered if this indicates a different leasing approach that maybe is broader in value scope than just outlets?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","It will be. It's always been designed as Mills. Our partner there actually owns The Mills in Toronto and in Vancouver. And this has always been organized as a Mills. It's enclosed. It's what I'd say bigger in size. So it's always been kind of \u2013 we consider it more Mills like with the boxes and the outlet and the entertainment uses.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","So our partner is the owner of Vaughan Mills and the one that they've just opened in Vancouver as well.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, that's encouraging.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yes.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then it seems like you may be taking a change in direction on the new redevelopments, maybe more densification, or is that something that I just need to wait the next couple of months for?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I think we've got a terrific portfolio set to do. So, the answer is yes, Craig. I think you'll see more and more stuff from us along those lines. Obviously, we're not going to do it just to do it. The idea is to increase the value of the portfolio. But Rick and I went over plans yesterday at King of Prussia. King of Prussia is basically a $2 billion asset. We had a Penney that just didn't fit there with Neiman and the Nordstrom and the Lord & Taylor and the Bloomingdale's at all.","You know the center very well. It's very big. We didn't need another department store. They've closed their store there. We could have done traditional, but the fact of the matter is the pivot of what's the front and what's the back of that center has evolved over time. And we have the ability for a hotel, apartments, office, and complementary retail with outdoor work and play space. That's going to be unbelievable for that community and, listen, we've got to do it. We got to get it done. We've got to open it. But I think that a lot of folks are missing those kind of opportunities and are kind of \u2013 you cannot, one thing you cannot do is replicate the real estate that we have and that's unique unbelievable opportunity. It's going to be a significant investment.","It will be our Hudson Yards version for suburban, but wealthy King of Prussia. It's a great market. It's a growing market. That's what having good real estate is all about and it's underappreciated, but I get it. We've got do it. We've got to prove it. But if you've seen some of the mixed-use stuff that we've done over the past few years, you've seen that our core competency is increasing in this area. So again, we will devote capital to those kind of projects that are very exciting and we'll take that $2 billion asset to, I don't know, $3 billion, $3 billion plus, why not, right?","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sounds good.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Hi. Good morning.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Hi.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Hi. Just a couple of quick things, David. One, I think you mentioned that you did have a deductable hit in the third quarter, but I don't think you quantified it. Could you give us that number?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","$2 million.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","It's $1 million per occurrence. The flood in \u2013 Harvey and all the flooding did not reach the deductible expense. We had other expenses, but not up to that number.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks. And then I also noticed on that other income page and expense page, professional service fees were up quite significantly, and I also noticed that the regional and home costs were down. I just don't know if you can provide any commentary around the large jump from professional fees in the quarter?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, it's mostly associated with legal expenses. As you know, we had this situation with Woodbury. You know our point of view in terms of how we felt about that, but they were significant, significant expenses. That, to me, is a one-time expense. And then obviously we're going to be \u2013 we're running our business as efficiently. We have the highest margins in the business. We've got the best overhead percent of revenue in the business. We take pride in that, that we have the highest margins. We take pride that we have the lowest overhead, again something that's underappreciated, and we'll continue to do that.","We did not have an LTIP for the senior dudes because we knew this year would be a little bit tough. It's actually coming out better than we thought. We're hitting every number. We've got best growth in the industry. We've got the best balance sheet. Our operating metrics are \u2013 sales were up. All of that is pretty good. But you know what? We thought it might be a little tough. And so we tightened the screws, and that's what I like about my team. They're willing to tighten with me, and we tightened.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Okay. That's good. And then I guess just lastly on that 10 million feet that you talked about leasing, I don't know if you or Rick could maybe provide a little detail, just broadly by category. Presumably, a lot of that was other things besides apparel. But can you just kind of help us give a breakdown of maybe how much was traditional apparel, how much was home, food, and just some of the broad categories to show the diversity of leasing?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","This is Rick. In our new leases that we have been signing, the percentage devoted to apparel is down about 20%. The percentage devoted to food and entertainment is up about 20%, and the number is over 11 million square feet this year over our three portfolios, which is malls, mills, and premium outlets.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Okay, thanks. That's it for me.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. Hey, guys. I just want to say being from the Midwest, I agree, it's actually not that far out there.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Right.","Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I had a question for Rick. I was just wondering if you can give us some high-level color here on the sales and traffic trends of the premium outlets versus the malls. And then maybe, just as a follow-up, can you comment on your watch list and any changes there? Maybe digging in a little bit, are you worried that we could get another bankruptcy or adverse retailer event here late in the year, whether it's a Charlotte Russe or anyone else of the troubled retailers out there?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We're not going to comment on individual retailers. That's not our place. Our premium outlet traffic is up. The mall traffic is stable. We're not seeing the kinds of trends that have been publicly reported by all these algorithms and black box things that have been out there and talked about in the trades. It's very stable and frankly, again under-reported, 2017, yes, there was a lot of bankruptcies. But frankly, we're also having many of our tenants get reorganized; emerge with very, very good balance sheets, and in the last several months, you've had Gymboree, Payless, rue21, all come out with restructurings with very stable balance sheets and growth strategies.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. On the occupancy that Mike Bilerman asked which I probably should have mentioned, I mean part of the dip in occupancy that we have is also we've added new product to the portfolio. So, they obviously, both in redevelopments, expansion space as well as new developments, they are never up to or 95% and I don't know what that number is...","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","About 30 bps impact.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Okay. So it's about a 30 basis point impact and I probably should have answered that when Michael asked in any event. So part of that is just the portfolio is expanding and you tend not to be initially at 100% occupancy when you open. But yet, once the space comes in, the space comes in our number and it is what it is.","Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, I appreciate that. And I guess, David, I was just wondering if you could just kind of talk about your appetite here for disposition, specifically kind of the lower end of the portfolio. You've talked about NOI-weighted results. So obviously further highlights how much of the revenue and value is really driven by the top.","So as I think about the 13 \u2013 I think you have about 13 assets in the other bucket and maybe just more broadly some assets where, for whatever reason, the market or maybe demographics are moving against it. Does it make sense to sell those sooner versus later, or just how are you thinking about pruning the bottom from here?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Look, I think it's a question of your assets that don't fit with our portfolio, we generally have been a seller or spinner-offer of assets. The market is not great. On the other hand, I think we'll have at least a sale potentially by yearend or early next year. But it's a very simple \u2013 there's no asset here that we lose sleep over or that we have consternation over. And it's a function of \u2013 if we get the right price, we'll sell. If we don't and the present value of those cash flow is greater than the price, I mean \u2013 to me cash flow is still \u2013 there is nothing to be embarrassed about.","I know this world doesn't want to focus on cash flow, but there's nothing to be embarrassed about cash flow. And I can take that cash flow and invest in something that's higher growth and that's okay. I mean, that's kind of what I think people like me should think about. But we'll continue to prune the portfolio. We're in pretty good shape, if the value is right, but we're not going to do anything that's a fire sale because we really have no need to \u2013 we can operate effectively.","The thing about us is we can operate effectively from luxury centers to terrific suburban malls, west of the Hudson, to outlet centers, to the Mills product, to Europe, to Asia, to mixed-use properties. I mean, we have the ability \u2013 I mean, the fact \u2013 if you had only seen how this company dealt with these devastations, our multiple would go up, okay?","You don't see it, but I see it. We had crews of people. We chartered plane. We had crews of people go down to Puerto Rico. We had people in the field that put their own personal situation on the back burner to deal with our physical assets. Crazy, crazy stuff. So, we can operate. I mean, people forget that we lost a mall in Nashville because of a flood that was shut down for, I can't remember, a year-and-a-half, two years? And we built it back better than ever. We'll build Puerto Rico back better than ever. Those assets are important to that community. We will deliver, and that's what people lose sight of. They want to focus on a metric here and there. I don't know. Sometimes it's interesting, but I don't know what you're asking. I forgot. But the point is, thanks for your question. If I didn't answer it, ask it again. Something about asset sales.","The point is we operate in any kind of environment. We do extraordinary stuff. We give back to the community. Simon Youth Foundation is important, check into it, look at what we've done for the Komen Foundation with Breast Cancer Research, look at the fact that our operating income, somebody reported sales that had operating income of $347 million. We had $1 billion, $35 million of operating income, 3 times, what somebody else had, and focus on that. Focus on those kind of things I think would be helpful in your analysis. You should tell us what you want us to focus on. On the other hand, it's a two-way street, my friend. Thanks for your question.","Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks for your time.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I think he called uncle. Next.","Operator","And our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. I was just wondering if you could talk about on the sales side, you guys did have a nice 3% increase this year year-over-year which is the strongest since 2013. So I was just wondering if you could comment where in the portfolio that was, if it was more the international tourists, high volume centers coming back or if it was across the board?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Simply put it's basically across the board. And you've got to remember, September, we've dealt with a lot of crap. So I mean I was really pleased with that number. It's across the board. And I think that there's definitely been a pause with all these natural disasters, but I mean unfortunately they hit us hard from Texas to Florida.","Don't underestimate the Las Vegas impact. Thankfully we had nobody involved. But it's a tragedy that changes the psyche of the consumer for a period of time. I think I heard from Southwest Airlines that their flights down to Vegas are down. It will come back, but we had to deal with that. And unbelievably, I mean we've never had malls where we had to shut because of fires. The untold natural disasters, what's happened in Northern California, it's been unbelievable. We had our partner in a mall there whose own home burned down. I mean just tragic, tragic stuff. And then obviously, the Puerto Rico situation is at another level.","So, even with all that said, our sales came in pleasantly surprised. I think the consumer mood is better. Look, we can talk online or not online, the reality is, I saw something interesting, how physical books outperformed. Electronic books, who knows, but maybe that's a trend. I think you'll see that as well. People get bored despite all of the rhetoric out there, you would expect me to say that. But generally sales and traffic are not bad, pretty good absent obviously these things going on and the tragedies of this unfortunate circumstances that we've had to deal with.","And again, I wrote a letter to the company. I can't tell \u2013 and I don't know how many people listen from the company on the call, but I can't tell you how people have stepped up in this company dealing with these crazy, crazy events. Proud of the organization.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for that response. And then I was wondering on recent outlet development projects. Denver is under construction. It opens about a year from now. I'm wondering how the pre-leasing is going there and how that trajectory kind of a year from opening looks at this point versus I know Norfolk opened earlier this year and others of the past.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Great. I think that's going to be great. Denver is a great city. The growth there is phenomenal. It's a great site right on I-25. We are ahead of the outlets, took a bunch of retailers there last month. I think, we've got a great design. I think, it will be a great addition to the community there.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","And I would say to you that there is still considerable demand in the outlet sector. Those tenants are growing and are actively looking for new opportunities. So, Norfolk now is performing very well and has got everyone open. And it's a lovely physical plant right on the water. We incorporated outdoor dining there. I mean, the \u2013 I would hope you go visit our product, Clarksburg, because the level of design and customer amenities is substantially elevated along with the tenant mix in these properties.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Oh, that's great to hear. Thanks.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Hi. David, I think you said your NOI-weighted spreads were 17% in the quarter. When I look at my notes from last quarter, you talked about 14% spreads. Is that an apples-to-apples methodology so they actually increased in the third quarter?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yes, sir.","Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And I guess on the development pipeline, about $1 billion right now. Where do you see that number trending over the next two years or three years?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I think it's got the potential to go up, frankly, because, as you know, we're going to have some opportunities like the King of Prussias of the world that are going to be really dramatic and change the face of some of these great pieces of real estate. So I think you'll see more from us in this area, even this year, that would tend to suggest that that number could be higher.","Look, we are very focused on the redevelopment part of our business, investing in our product. We're actually in very good shape there. We've done a lot, as you know, since 2010. And we're still very optimistic on \u2013 we'll announce at least one more expansion of a material asset this year yet, Rick, probably, right...","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","There should be.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","...with really good tenant demand. We'll announce another major mixed-use development at some point along the lines of King of Prussia that I talked about. So I think we've got good stuff working.","Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And I guess maybe for a second going back to the first question in the spreads again, going from 14% to 17%, does anything jump out over the last three months in terms of what would have caused that increase?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","No, we have such a large portfolio that they would have to jump really high to change a number.","Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it, okay. That was it, thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah, no worries. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone. I think I had a little headset technical issue there before. But, David, you talked a lot about the dividend and the importance of the dividend, and obviously you increased it this quarter and alluded to increases in 2018.","I know a lot of this has to do with taxable income and REIT rules and things like that. But I was just curious. As the markets continue to not really pay attention to the discount between the private market values versus your own stock, would you consider increasing the dividend more than you otherwise would in 2018 to continue to give back some of that return to shareholders?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I think the simple answer to that is yes. If you look at where we are versus what we paid, obviously to keep increasing that level off a bigger base, that's a pretty big number. And I think the simple answer is yes. We have the ability to continue to grow our cash flow.","And like I mentioned, I just encourage people to look at our operating income for the third quarter. It was $1 billion \u2013 operating income essentially being FFO, net income plus depreciation, more or less. It's $1.035 billion. Nobody gets excited about that number, but guess who does?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Guess who does?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I do. And you put it in comparison to other companies and some of their multiples, we are I think truly undervalued. But I'm not going to \u2013 Mr. Market is Mr. Market. We can only \u2013 I think a good way to demonstrate that is by raising our dividend on a consistent basis. We'll continue to do that.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then just maybe going back to your comments about the psyche of the consumer, obviously there's been a lot of unusual things going on in the country here and with the natural disasters and Las Vegas, as you mentioned. Overall traffic sounds like trends are stable. But I'm just curious if the traffic trends in Florida, Houston, and Vegas as well, sounds like maybe not Vegas, but Florida and Houston, have they returned to normal?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","It's interesting. What happens \u2013 unfortunately, we've seen this before. What happens it does \u2013 and I will say this to you. Prior to this like string of natural disasters, the business was actually \u2013 sales and traffic were up. They were good. And what happens generally is you lose the week before because there's the preparation and then you lose two, three, four weeks after because obviously people are not yet back to normal. Houston, having just visited Houston, we didn't really have that much property damage, but there was unbelievable amount of damage to that city. Now, give it to Houstonians and Texans, they come back fast and hard. Florida probably is wild because it was East Coast, West Coast, East Coast, West Coast. That hurricane couldn't make up its mind where it was going to hit. But the reality, it does slow traffic and sales. Florida is back a little bit more normal. I think Houston took a little bit longer to get back to normal given the amount of devastation there. Vegas, we were having a great September in Las Vegas, great. I think that's going to take some time. What happened there is horrific. But we'll see. It's so hard to predict, but these things, they don't just snap back day one. It does take time for people to get in their normal pattern. And I don't blame them, frankly. They've got other things to worry about.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, I agree. Okay, thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Your line is open.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. David or Rick, going back to your watch list and some questions about that, I was hoping that your early read on whether 2018 will be a better or worse year for store closures and bankruptcies based on what you've seen with tenants dropping off the watch list and reselling this year.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Look, I know we all want to talk about 2018. As you know, we don't talk about 2018 till our year is done. You're more than welcome if you would like next week, you can come to Indianapolis, spend. We go through space by space 200 properties, so it's mind-numbing. But we're doing our business plan for next year. If you want to burn a day or two or three or four or a weekend, come on in. We'll show you how we run the business. But we'll tell you about 2018 when we tell you about 2018.","All I can tell you is that we've got a great real estate operating model that has historically worked over many years and many cycles. We've weathered lots of storms one way or another. We'd certainly love a better natural retail environment. It's not quite there, it was headed there. We'd like a more stable retailer environment. We're diversifying away from the have-nots to the haves. That takes time, but you can't duplicate our real estate. You can't duplicate our balance sheet. You can't duplicate the fact that this company can operate across this country as well as in many parts of the world. And we put it all together. We put it in a blender. We pull the right triggers, and lo and behold, we grow our earnings, and that's what we're all about.","I don't expect 2018 to be any different than the history, but I've got the next two, three weeks of planning for the execution of 2018. But like I said, we planned for 2017. We're doing a good job in 2017. We're overcoming a lot. Whether it's retailer bankruptcies, natural disasters, changing market conditions, we did the same thing in 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, even in 2009. It is what it is.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate that. And then just going back to that second question, going back to re-leasing spreads, which I know is one of your favorite topics, you talked about the NOI spreads getting better, value weighted spreads getting better this quarter, yet the ones on page 23 of the supplemental, that spread got a bit worse this quarter versus last year.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I think that's a simple \u2013 the simple thing is that we had more. We put everything in there, so we had more box deals, so that tends to damper down the spread for the entire portfolio as opposed to the ones that don't have as much box activity in the NOI weighted. It's as simple as that. It's not always like that, but...","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And you \u2013 but just \u2013 yeah. No. Yeah. Just to be clear here though. If we're thinking about the impact to your cash, same-store NOI, are the numbers, the spreads that are on page 23 more important or the ones that you're citing on the NOI weighted spreads?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Look, the reality is there's so much that goes into NOI spreads is just one element of it. So, I think, you put it all in the blender, and \u2013 look, we've been operating with our NOI with the strong dollar with our overage rent down significantly, yet we've produced pretty damn good NOI \u2013 comp NOI number growth.","So there's so much that goes into it that it's hard. I would tend to look at \u2013 if I had to look at it, it's probably more important to look across the board, but they're both metrics for you to Q1. I don't \u2013 honestly, I've never run my business for metrics other than one, and guess what that is?","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","It's dividend growth.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, no, no, no. Cash flow growth, okay. Okay.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","That's the only metric I worried about, okay. So it is what it is. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Barclays. Your line is open.","Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. On Puerto Rico, sorry if I missed this, what's the basis point impact of Puerto Rico on SS NOI in the fourth quarter?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, it's $0.03 FFO all-in because we don't anticipate any BI and\/or those centers right now to be opened by the end of the fourth quarter. But they might be, but we don't anticipate it.","Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So you wouldn't quantify it from a basis point impact on SS NOI?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, it's less than one \u2013 it's out of NOI. It's completely out. There is no NOI that we're going to be booking in the fourth quarter. Is that your question?","Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Well, okay. I guess maybe from an NOI impact, what would it have been? Or how much is the take away?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Less than 1% essentially.","Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then in your lease negotiations with some of the retailers that have been challenged, if you look at you've handled them this year, I realized that's retailer by retailer and location by location. But are there any takeaways you can share from this process on how you might approach the leases that are coming up for renewal next year?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","It really \u2013 I think, you answered it best. It really is space by space, retailer by retailer. I mean, I think, we really don't \u2013 we do across the board account, client-oriented leasing as you might imagine, but it is space-by-space, lease-by-lease.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","And I would also tell you that, we're already working very significantly on next year's activity and we can evaluate now where we think market rents are going to be for the spaces coming up and we're doing everything that we can to have alternative users. So we'll have incremental bargaining power in that renewal process. If we don't get a rent we like, that tenant is going to be gone and we're going to bring in a new more productive tenant that's going to pay us more rent.","Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So, a couple. First, I guess David, the percentage of NOI from U.S. malls has continue to drift down over the last couple years, the spin of WPG a few years back certainly accelerated a piece of that. But now you're at below 50% for the first time in your corporate history, so I'm curious what you think the right balance of U.S. mall exposure is going forward in light of the new retail paradigm. And then also as part of that, curious if you're seeing any interesting acquisition opportunities out there. Anything that might be \u2013 that might fit your quality spectrum and are you sensing any change in the psyche of any of the owners of those quality assets?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, on the last question, not really. We're really not looking externally to \u2013 if we get approached, we'll certainly consider something but we're actually not looking that much externally.","As you know, the big focus has been on the redevelopment, new development and that continues to take up most of our time.","Look, I don't \u2013 we're not running away from \u2013 I just simply \u2013 the math is the math. The opportunities are the opportunities. The fact that we \u2013 we have always considered ourselves as a retail real estate company. I think, as things have changed, we now consider ourselves as a \u2013 we're going to have more mixed use opportunities. So that's going to change the mix a little bit on the margin, but we're not running away from the mall business, or running away from the U.S. business because literally, we look at opportunities, so granular. Like the previous question about how you look at leasing, it's space by space, mall by mall. I mean that's how we look at the opportunity set that we have here. And because of that, we may \u2013 the U.S. may go down \u2013 U.S. malls may go down, but it's really because we saw opportunities elsewhere not because we're running from the mall business.","We went in the outlet business in 1998, and I made a \u2013 we built \u2013 it's a funny story if you got a minute. We built a mall for $4 million of equity in Orlando. It shows you how just stupid I am. But at the same time, we spent this money on the Internet and we lost \u2013 remember \u2013 by the way, we were ahead of our time. Some of this stuff today probably will be worth $100 billion, but okay.","But we made some mistakes. I think, we had a $30 million write-off back in \u2013 around that period of time. And I \u2013 we built that outlet mall in Orlando. I had $4 million of equity.","I look \u2013 I think of my \u2013 what's our return on equity. David Bloom at Chelsea at that time came to me and said he wanted to own 100% of Orlando, and I go, well, not really. But he said, no, I'll give you $40 million for it. And so that was a 10x in about a year, which even the smartest private equity or venture capital guys like 10x in a year. I said, okay. Little did I know, in 2004, I'd buy it back at a number even greater than that.","But the point is we like to go where the opportunities are. We bought Klepierre in 2010 when the euro was going to be disbanded. We bought it at under NAV. So that \u2013 it's more \u2013 that's more our philosophy than, boy, I want to reduce the percentage of our mall business in the U.S. to get to this number, if that helps at all, and answers your question.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Certainly does. Certainly. I appreciate the perspective. And also I guess, speaking of opportunities, I'm curious on your thoughts on JCPenney this morning. Not asking for you to comment on them specifically as a retailer. I know you don't do that.","But was more curious about how you might be thinking about potentially buying back some of those boxes, maybe re-tenanting opportunities. And are there any natural expirations or store closures on the horizon that you might be concerned about?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, we really \u2013 I haven't really studied the Penney numbers, obviously. I know they weren't that good. We have confidence in JCPenney. I mean, obviously they had a \u2013 they're still recovering from the activity that occurred when they had a different shareholder base. And I have \u2013 I think that Marvin Ellison has done a very good job. We think they serve a real need to the consumer. I do think there's still unfortunately dealing with some of the traumatic events of their different shareholder base. That's taking time, but it's cash flow generating company. We'll study the number, see what they all mean, but I think they definitely have a loyal consumer base and have a business that generates operating cash flow and I don't expect anything too radical there.","But I think over time, we are going to want to get some space back from the department stores and we may get some space back but it's all going to be on the margin. They don't pay any rent even at places where they pay rent. So, the opportunity to re-tenant those buildings on an accretive basis is pretty, pretty significant for us. And to the extent that they're not investing in their store and we are investing in the mall, there is a disconnect to the consumer that we hope to \u2013 potentially, we can modify that disconnect by having a better or different use. We're poised. We're focused on it. We spend a tremendous amount of time assessing what we want back, what we might give back and I think the opportunities are a lot more significant in what we want back than what we might get back.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","And just with respect to your question on their leases in 2015 and 2016, they had 14 options, all were exercised. In 2016 and 2017, they had seven; all were exercised. In 2018, they have 6, 4 have already been exercised and we expect the other 2 to be exercised. So we've not been experiencing any closures through lease actions with Penney.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. Got it. Thank you for that. And one last more, if I can squeeze one in, I'm not sure if I missed it or if you didn't specifically mentioned what drove the year-over-year decline in that home and regional office costs? Is it just that you're right-sizing the organization given the smaller asset base and does that flow through same-store NOI? Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","No. Primarily, the reduction in our incentive comp and LTIP primarily.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. And then, is it \u2013 thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I mean, we're really not reducing, I mean \u2013 we're really not reducing any kind of overhead on that kind of base. So we're just \u2013 you get us for a cheaper price. Some may think that's good; some may think that's bad. But it is what it is. As I've said...","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We're always down.","[00330F-E Steve Hilton","We're on sale, so good point.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","I agree, I agree. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Good point.","Operator","Our next question comes is from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys, and given that my family is from Kentucky, I can assure you in the end it's not that far out there.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","All right.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. I want to talk a little bit about your same-store NOI. I'll preface this. I know you focus on cash flow and you look \u2013 we do as well. But how much do you think that same-store NOI might be being helped or might be helped by the development pipeline? The development pipeline obviously looks like it's a really big growth engine for you now and you started putting dollars in there...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","It's not in the comp NOI number, so until it's open for a year.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. And, David, what I was trying to think about was last year, you put up 2.2% in 3Q 2016 prior to...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Let me just reinforce this \u2013 and I've made this statement, Rich, historically, we do not look at our comp NOI on a quarterly basis. We do not look at that. Never have, never will. We look at it over a year. We told the market that we hope to do 3%. I think that's without lease settlement income, without new development, kind of a pure number, and we're on our way to do at least that. And for that, given all the complexity in the world today, that's pretty good. That's what I focus on.","I do not focus on third quarter number. I don't focus on the second quarter number. We give you the facts. We tell you and we look at it on holistic year basis because when overage rent comes in and out, it's variable, it's when they hit it, they could hit it in the third quarter, they could hit it in the fourth quarter. Third quarter tends to be the lower end of our comp, if you're Interested in that, I don't really look at that. I don't know what else I can tell you other than how I think about it, and that's how I think about it, okay?","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. So let me ask the question maybe a little bit different way. 3% same-store NOI guide for the year. I think at midpoint, how much do you think your development pipeline is influencing that versus your core portfolio, or is that just not something that...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I answered that. That's not in the number. Okay?","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you. It's all in the 8-K. You can see the components of comp NOI, and you can see the other new development which is not in the comp NOI. We've made that clear for a long period of time. Okay?","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks, David.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I'm curious. You guys produce obviously a lot of cash. You've been talking about that today. But you didn't repurchase shares in this quarter. Can you speak more broadly about how you're thinking about capital allocation in the next 12 to 24 months, and do you think you'll be using a greater share of your capital for redevelopment and expansions and where do repurchases factor into that?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","You probably were bored, which I don't blame you, right? We answered that question earlier, which is basically we've been \u2013 because of some of these mixed-use opportunities like King of Prussia that I've mentioned before, we think our redevelopment pipeline is going to potentially increase. So we're being very judicious on that.","In addition, the more I think about it, I just love raising this dividend 10% per year because the cost to carry on that is increasing. And I think that's more meaningful to long-term investors than episodic buybacks here and there. But it's in our arsenal. It's in our capital toolbox. We'll take it a step at a time. But we've got some really big mixed use opportunities and I just love having a powerful balance sheet. I just can't tell you how it excites me every morning.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess I should have asked it differently. I guess the question is it's not off the table then.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","It's never off the table, no. We have authorization and it's ready to go to work if in fact we're ready to go. And I would take that authorization seriously. Otherwise, we wouldn't have it.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And maybe this is a joint one for you and Rick. But I'm curious how are lease terms evolving in this environment and specifically around percentage of rents because frankly, I'm wondering if you think landlords get a fair shake on the accounting for retail sales because it strikes me that given the way consumers shop today, buying online, maybe returning in store, the reporting optics maybe favor the online channel of a retailer versus the bricks-and-mortar, and I'm just curious if you think leases need to adapt for that.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Our leases are very well positioned to cover that point, and we are very focused on making sure that all the sales that are required to be reported under our leases are being reported.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Jeff, I will tell you this. And I think you point out a really important point is that we are absolutely unequivocally underreporting sales. We can only give you what we get from the retailers. But we've done enough work to know that there is an issue there and I think our sales that we report to you would be higher even \u2013 and we have very interesting leases that deal with the point that Rick is making. But I am absolutely convinced that our productivity is much higher than what's being reported, even though the lease requires them to do so. So I don't want to get into that, it's a complicated matter, but what you point out is very, very interesting.","Now the market rewards \u2013 let's face it, the market rewards an online sale more importantly than it does a brick-and-mortar, so the market is trying to get retailers. The retailers would rather prefer an online sale to a bricks-and-mortar regardless of the possibility. But it's a very interesting point. And I will tell you today, in my humble opinion, there is absolutely an underreporting going on. But I don't want to say anything other than that. Okay?","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Understood. Do you think they have the systems? Most retailers have the systems to be able to handle whatever the new form of reporting would be? Like you said, they don't really have an incentive to adapt. But again, I'm just curious of these new leases you talk about, if you think they could be more broad-based in the future?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Generally, they know what they should be reporting, I would say so. And again, I want to leave it at that. Let's leave it at that. It's a good point. But I will tell, I do think it's safe to say that the numbers we have are underreported, absolutely underreported. It's a very astute point. And by the way, we're not giving that up on future leases. So because it's all melding, but you bring up a very interesting point, and I prefer not to talk about it after this.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. I have just one last question. I'm just curious. I'm sure in this environment you've been contacted by private capital sources maybe to look at JV-ing properties and whatnot. What sort of returns do you think they are looking for when they approach you guys? Are you able to speak to that?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I'm not sure. To do something new or to buy? I'm not sure I...","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","To buy interest in your existing properties.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We've had this discussion. I'm not really \u2013 I don't \u2013 that doesn't do much for us. So it's not something we really are pursuing.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, thanks. And sorry to you longer today, but just a couple follow-up questions. On the department stores, just given overhang on the stocks, on the mall stocks, are you seeing any initiatives that you're more positive on, or anything you could share from what you're hearing from your mall managers on some of the things we're reading about or seeing, because I would have thought, given your dominant properties, a lot of these initiatives would be occurring in your properties at those department stores.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","That's a big question. Look, I don't want to really get in too much about having a discussion with our clients. Look, I think ambiance, service, speed of execution is really important in today's consumer-oriented focus. I do think there are things that can be done at the store level that will improve that. I think as simple as a fast checkout at a store would improve sales and productivity dramatically.","And there has been a huge focus on technology investment towards their online activities. I'd love for that to shift towards the store environment, because that's a real advantage. And I think if they did that in a more comprehensive way, whether through checkouts, service, styling. There are so many things you can do today, much like Apple does when you go to their store and town squares. If the focus were to shift a little bit there, I think they would see a pickup in their in-store sales environment. And it's all over the board, Jeff, frankly. I do think it could improve.","And just like what we need to do, we need to improve our in-store experience on the stuff that we can -the in-mall experience on the stuff that we can control. So I think it needs to be a greater focus. It's around the edges. I'd like a little shift in that, but we'll see if that happens.","Jeffrey Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, and then another follow-up. Just listening to the comments on mixed-use earlier in the week, we received a lot of questions on the WeWork and L&T purchase, upper levels and...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Right.","Jeffrey Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Rick and I were thinking okay, that's just a unique situation. Maybe there are a few other properties like that in the country. But I'm listening to your mixed-use comments. Do you think that a WeWork type of format, do you see that entering suburban malls or your malls, or that's not what you're talking about?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","No, that's included in what we're talking about. Just so you know, we did a WeWork steal in Clearfork in Fort Worth, Texas. So no, I do think that environment will absolutely accelerate in the \u2013 again, I don't know that I would call these suburban. It's where the good demographic people live outside an urban area. There are still 330 million people, okay.","Jeffrey Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Urban and suburban.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Okay. I know New York City and San Francisco is urban environment, but there are lots of places outside of those where people live and work and play and be entertained. So the answer is yes, I expect us to do more and more with WeWork both directly like we did at Clearfork and through our relationship with Lord & Taylor. We know those guys. We like them. I've spent time with them. They're very creative. Both companies are very creative. L&T or HBC in that case as well as WeWork, good people too. I like them.","Jeffrey Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then my last question, I was just curious with the Amazon-Whole Foods merger. Are you more or less interested in adding grocers to your malls?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","No real chain. Chain, I think we've always liked it where it made sense for both parties, and the Amazon acquisition of Whole Foods doesn't change our thinking. I don't know if it's changed their thinking, Whole Foods' thinking, but it certainly hasn't changed our thinking. We'd love to have them in the properties where it makes sense for them and for us.","Jeffrey Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks so much.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just regarding The Edit @ Roosevelt Field, how are you connecting with and choosing these digitally borne concepts to participate in this effort? How are you leveraging your venture capital business in this? And is there a plan to roll this out further to more of your centers as you think about this as an incubator for new retailers?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","The answer is absolutely. Assuming this has legs, this will be rolled out throughout our network, and you have to look at our platform as a network and this will absolutely roll out. The great news is we've got a team dedicated to up-and-coming new retailers that may start digitally and then go online. Like MeUndies is a good example of that where we're opening a pop-up store in Stanford. So we have a team wholly dedicated to that. We also appear here which is a network where we're both an investor and a player. They actually started in London and have a number of \u2013 basically a platform that connects real estate owners with brands that want access to a portfolio in a very seamless way.","They've also been instrumental in identifying up and coming retailers or concepts. And so, it's a big effort on us to do that. And not only that but also lease, not just through what we're doing at The Edit, but also through just normal deals like the UNTUCKits of the world. I mean there's a lot of that new business out there that is exciting for us because we are bringing in the up and coming retailers or food operators that know how to connect directly through the consumer, but also have a little different spin on how they connect with the consumer in the in-store environment. I think they're very smart, digitally savvy, speaks to Millennials, we love them as part of our platform and our properties.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then just given the natural seasonality of retailer income, how should we be thinking about the impact of Aeropostale, the Aeropostale investment in Q4? So what's in your guidance?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, we don't break out that. It's in our guidance. We're pleased with the business. We bought it very \u2013 we're weighing the money. They're performing according to plan. I don't give out quarterly numbers, but there's a little more volatility in the fourth quarter like a lot of retailers, even tech companies have a lot of volatility in the fourth quarter.","There's a little bit more of that than what we have, since it's our first fourth quarter. Let's see what goes on. But we're weighing the money. We basically bought in at one time's cash flow. I kind of like those deals. If you have a few more of those, send them my way.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, David. It's Michael. If we can just come back to the professional fees and other, it's like a $34 million, $35 million increase in the quarter. I thought the settlement on Woodbury was just under $1 million. So that would be a hell of a lot of legal hours even at $1,000 an hour. So can you just break out just the big chunks of that $35 million because it's not an inconsequential number and I think (1:23:16).","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I think it's actually almost irrelevant because it's a one-time number and it is what it is, okay. So I'd actually argue that there's no reason to focus on it because it's out of the ordinary and it's not going repeat. And unfortunately, this is a very expensive scenario that we have to deal with.","The fee was nominal which reinforces what we \u2013 the fact that we, again, we made an announcement how we felt about it. I don't need to relive that. It's behind us. And so I'd actually argue the opposite of that just like the Seritage sale. It goes through the numbers but I wouldn't count \u2013 we're not going to replicate that gain either.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Right. I didn't know where it was coming from. That was just all legal expenses (1:24:22).","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We have other things that run through that. We actually had a write-off. And again, not to get in minutia but we actually also took a write-off in one of our European outlet development projects that also flow through that, that's a one-time number, but the delta is one-time including that write-off, okay? So that's the important message to send here, okay? I wouldn't worry about it too much. I mean I don't like it. Believe me, I don't like it. I'm not happy with it.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","It's a big number, right? It's a big number, but...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I'm not happy with it, but like I said, we had a European development deal with McArthurGlen that flows through that other number as well.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","But it's non-repeating, and I appreciate your question. It's non-repeating. It's out of the ordinary.

We were very active in the debt markets during the quarter closing our locking rates on 13 new loans, totaling approximately $2 billion, of which our share was $1.3 billion, the average rate was 2.92%, and a weighted average term of a little over 8 years.","Let me turn to the all important development activity. First of all, we opened the Phoenix Premium Outlet Centers in Chandler, Arizona on April 4. This center is 100% leased, open with an impressive collection of stores. I will not name them, Rick will if you're interested. Several high profile stores will be opening in the coming weeks, and the good news is the shopper response has been very strong and many merchants reporting as one of their best outlet openings in the last couple of years.","Shisui Premium Outlets opened on April 19. This our ninth center in Japan. It's located 15 minutes from Narita International Airport, serving Greater Tokyo. The center opened with large crowds and 70 media outlets opening, and we expect this to be a terrific center serving the area of visitors to Tokyo, given the proximity of the airport. Significant redevelopment projects were completed during the quarter; Apple Blossom Mall, Quaker Bridge Mall and South Hills Village. Several significant projects are on track for completion in 2013, including expansions in Sawgrass Mills, Dadeland Mall, Seattle Premium Outlets, Orlando Premium Outlets at Vineland, Walt Whitman Shops, and the and the re-grand opening of the shops at The Shops at Nanuet and the University Town Plaza in Pensacola.","Redevelopment expansion projects including the addition of acres and big bucks tenants are underway at 44 properties in the U.S., 2 in Asia. Our share of this cost is approximately $1 billion and the blended estimated rate of return is approximately 11%. We have 3 Premium Outlet Centers under construction, opening in the third quarter of this year. St. Louis Premium Outlets in Chesterfield, Missouri, opening in August 1, which is 96% leased. Toronto Premium Outlets in Ontario, Canada, opening August 22, which is 85% currently leased. Busan Premium Outlets in Korea, opening in late August. As we highlight in the press release, demand for space in all of these centers has been exceptional and we expect to be fully leased at opening.","We also have at least 8 additional new Premium Outlet projects in North America in various stages of predevelopment. Kl\u00e9pierre reported its first quarter revenues this week. You can read about them, so I'll be brief other than to say that rents were up for the quarter a total of 3.4% reaffirmed 2013 guidance. We've now owned our stake for 13 months. Progress has been made in several aspects of the business. They have sold EUR 760 million of assets. They have simplified their business with the elimination of the [indiscernible] sub-brand, as well as the ongoing sale of the office portfolio.","Their focus on operations, we've added a new CEO. They're generating additional Simon brand venture-type revenues, as recently evidenced by the Coca-Cola partnership. They strengthened their balance sheet through recent financing activities and they've opened 2 great malls in St. Lazare, Paris and Emporia in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. And I think if anyone has had the opportunity to visit it, visit those centers, you'll see that the company has clearly the capability to build first-class 21st century retail.","Today, we announced the dividend of $1.15 per share for the quarter. Over the past 6 quarters, we have increased the common stock dividend each quarter as we've been playing catch up to our taxable income. Our growth rate in our dividend has been over 31% over the last 2 years. Importantly, we anticipate, subject to review and Board approval, increasing our dividend as we anticipate our taxable income continuing to grow.","Guidance. Today we increased the top and the bottom line of our 2013 FFO guidance to a current range of $8.50 to $8.60 per share. This is an increase from $0.10 from the initial guidance in February of $8.40 to $8.50 per share. Strong operating performance is the driver of this increase.","Occupancy. Reasonable Mall and Premium occupancy cost of 11.3% and strong rent spreads give us good momentum. Finally, '13 is off to a good start, and we're ready to answer any of your questions that you'd like to post.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Spector of Bank of America","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's Craig Schmidt here. It sounds like you've made real progress on your dispositions at Kl\u00e9pierre. Maybe you could give some more color on what's left to do, as well as maybe some of your refurbishes that you've done in the portfolio, and any successes you've had in bringing new retailers to your Kl\u00e9pierre portfolio?","David E. Simon","Well, first of all, they will continue to sell non-core assets as well as the office portfolio. So they've got a couple of the office deals that are close to being signed up, including their headquarters. And they'll continue to sell kind of the smaller non-core assets, which frankly are very stable, solid centers, but they don't have the extension capabilities that we're interested in pursuing. And they've done a great -- a number of extensions like Plessui [ph] in Paris. On the east side of Paris, near the airport that I think represents the ability to take a smaller center and expand it. And on the retail front, we're continuing to solidify that. The operational side of the business is the true upside, the coordination among retail, what we do at Simon-brand ventures. How we operate the centers is the next chapter in the story. Obviously that takes some time. We've had to add to the personnel ranks, we had to set the strategy and we're pleased with what's going on there, and I think there'll be more to come.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And are you surprised that -- are you surprised that your ability to push rents, given the general difficulty in Europe?","David E. Simon","Look, I don't run this day-to-day. There -- some of these questions are better asked for them. We are not the ones pushing the rents. We're providing strategic advice and helping them focus on what is important in their business and also, showing them how we run our business so they can run their business. I'm not surprised that a number of those countries have stability in cash flow in tough economic times. I think what you've seen here in the U.S. is that the same thing happened here for us in very tough economic times. And the one area that -- where they're having the most difficulty is in Spain. And that is a focus for the company, but that continues to be something that is affecting the cash flow to some extent is because Spain continues to be under pressure for basically all retail real estate owners that have real estate in Spain.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. I was impressed with your 96% lease in St. Louis. Do you know how much will open in August?","David E. Simon","We should be in the 90s. There's always a few laggers, but that's a real number and we should be in the 90s. I mean, even though we'd love to open every center at 100% leased and operate it, sometimes it does take time. Phoenix is a great example. We're at 100% leased. We were in the kind of the low 90s to be at opening, but in the last couple of months, we'll be 100% occupied. Same thing will happen in St. Louis. There may be a couple of slow people, but we are 96% leased.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of UBS.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Follow up on Craig's question about the outlets. Can you disclose the expected yields at Chandler and St. Louis for 2013 and maybe discuss some pre-leasing progress at Columbus and Charlotte?","David E. Simon","Well, look, our yields in the outlet business continue to be attractive. These will be double-digit yields unquestionably, and Chandler will be probably north of 10%, St. Louis will at or about 10%. And in addition, as you may probably know, we're looking at Phase 2 now and, obviously, as we bring that online in St. Louis, we will -- the yields will go up. But they're both north of 10%. They are both north of 10%. Now on your question on Columbus, let me just say this, Columbus is a very competitive market. There's a lot of folks that have competing real estate there and sites. So we'll see, we may or may not be the victor in that competition, but we're working to continue to try and move that forward. Charlotte is basically a go deal. So with us in Tanger, we expect to start construction in the next 2 months. We're very excited about that project. I'm not going to tell you what the yield is because I don't know what Tanger does, but it will be very, very good. The retailers are very happy that we have put together our joint venture. They -- we very excited about going in and it's got to be at least over 50%, 60% pre-leased. Not that we really need it because the one thing that we know is we have 80 Premium Outlets in the world, I think. So we don't, Christy, we don't really need to pre-lease like some others that might, because we kind of know whether or not we can lease it. But Charlotte's go, starting construction here shortly and we're racing to do a '14 opening.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then I know that you continue to do quite a bit of anchor in big-box repositioning. Can you talk a little bit about what the retailer demand is like today for Mall anchor space? How you think about getting that space back from a re-tenanting perspective. And are sale leasebacks of anchor space something that you would consider if a major tenant came to you looking to raise capital?","Richard S. Sokolov","Christy, it's Rick Sokolov. The demand is as good as it has ever been, and I think that, that can be referenced by the number of spaces we have available. In our mall portfolio, we literally have 635 department stores and 1% of them, 6 or 7, are vacant. And that's the lowest it has been in as long as I can remember. We actively deal with every one of our malls to keep a running list of the people that have demand to get in there, and we are in a constant dialogue with our anchors that we've identified that we have the potential of getting back to try and make them better. And if you look over the years, I think we've added almost 175 boxes and anchors over the last 4 years in the portfolio. So we've been very active and it's making them a lot better. I do not believe we would really be interested in entertaining sale leasebacks.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And are you able to of quantify maybe a range of what you might pay for vacant anchor box space for the Class A mall versus the Class B mall?","David E. Simon","Well, each deal is very, very -- depends on a lots of individual characteristics of each deal. It's not really something that you can generalize about.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's Ross Nussbaum. One final question. The 4.8% same-store NOI growth you've generated this quarter, if I think about that relative to the occupancy gains you had and the re-leasing spreads over the last  year, it kind of feels like there's something else that's helping that number. Is there a piece there that I'm not thinking about?","David E. Simon","Well, I mean, partly is good sales growth, partly is that we're very focused on operating to the best of our ability. I would point out, last quarter, Q1 '12, we had 5.7% comp increase. So that 4.8% on top of 5.7% is just running the company as well as we can. But we're never satisfied. We're always trying to improve, and that's what we're all about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan of Morgan Stanley.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On your re-leasing stats, the opening number went from $53 to $55 [ph] , and I guess it's a 12-month trailing average. And so, I mean how much of your -- is there a disproportionate share opening in the first quarter because I'm trying to see the kind of forecast that number out it was a big jump given that is a rolling average?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Paul, this is Steve. Some of it is mix. In the mall business especially, there are more leases that are tied to traditional retailer's fiscal year end, which is January 31. And in fact, if you look at the supplemental, as I recall, the remaining square footage that we have expiring in '13 is in the 3 million to 4 million square foot range, where over a normal year like 2014, 2015, it's 8 to 9 million square feet. So we have dealt with a lot of the -- especially regional mall expirations that occurred January 31.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That makes sense. And then, I mean, can you maybe just characterize -- I mean, you provide a lot of -- you list all your redevelopment projects and it looks like there's like 37 in there and you have about $700 million it listed in that stock [ph] ,  which is -- I mean it's only about $20 million per project, but it looks like there's some that are kind adding new space and it should represent, I guess, a more sizable chunk of that. And I'm trying to see -- should we see -- should we expect to see more expansions of malls, given the demand and given your spreads and resulting in some lumpier projects that pull that number up? Are there lumpy projects in there that represent a big share of that $700 million?","David E. Simon","The lumpy projects are basically, hopefully ready to start shortly. And I'm not going to list -- I'm just from recall. I mean, the lumpy ones, you'll start to see later on this year and in '14, I they include as Roosevelt Field of Copley, the Lambeau, and Woodbury, King of Prussia, to name -- Houston Galleria, to name 4, 5 or 6 lumpy, bigger, bigger, chunkier ones. You're right. A lot of what we have now is, they run the -- they run the $20 million, $30 million, $40 million, but you have something like Nanuet, which is $150 million project and Walt Whitman is around $80 million. So you got a little -- you got it all over the Board. But the lumpier, bigger ones, we are essentially in our first phase of the Lambeau. We will begin our first phase of Roosevelt Field here in the fall. Stanford, Rick whispered to me, thank you, we're finalizing everything there to as many of you know to relocate Bloomingdale's, build them a new store and then we take over their existing Bloomingdale's store and carve it up for small shops. So the bigger, lumpier ones really are, hopefully, beginning to start second half of '13, and '14 will be a huge year for us, '15 as well, as these bigger, lumpier ones come onstream.","Stephen E. Sterrett","Paul, it's Steve. I would just add one thing to that. Because it gets lost in the sauce sometimes but between -- David mentioned Woodbury, but he didn't mention Desert Hills, Orlando Premium, Las Vegas North, those are 4 Premium Outlets that's all to north of $1,000 of food and sales where we are adding significant amount of space. And so we're -- those are projects that will come on in the next year or 2 as well.","David E. Simon","And as Steve said, those are, on average, are about $100 million a pop.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. So I mean, that number could, well it should really double, probably, in a year from now.","David E. Simon","It's going to balloon, and I think what we have said and what we've said and we'll say again is that this is our #1 priority. This is the huge focus for the company. This is where we'll spend most of our time. And the good news is we recognized this that the world was not going to end a little bit ahead of others. So we're in the midst of doing this now. Woodbury is going to start. Right after this, most people, after their first quarter, our earnings take the afternoon off, right after this, Rick and I are going to spend 2 hours on the final approval of Woodbury. It's $168 million deal, and it's going to really, really be cool and it's really going to start and we really got the approvals and blah, blah, blah, blah. And then in the afternoon, we do take a lunch break. Rick demands to go out to lunch. I like to eat at my desk. It's a source of much conflict in the organization, but right after that, we're approving, I don't know, 20-some odd different mall deals. So #1 priority, we're glad we're in the midst of this now and a lot of good stuff to come.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Would you think those blended stabilized returns are going to be around? I mean, you've got 9 -- you've got 14% for the Premium Outlets in there. Is that going to change much?","David E. Simon","Yes. Look, I think they'll all be very, very accretive to our company. I don't -- soon as the project gets approved and we put it in there, you'll see the return.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cedrik Lachance of Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","David, we knew that [indiscernible continues to grow in your portfolio and we're passed some previous peak. What do you think is stabilized occupancy?","David E. Simon","Well, actually, I've been very impressed with our leasing team that they've been able to achieve these occupancy levels. So I think the focus now is, it's always good to, on the margin, to continually increase occupancy. But, Cedrik, I do believe that the focus now will be making sure that the mix is the best that it can be. But I have actually been very pleased and impressed with our leasing team in the amount of their ability to drive occupancy. I don't tell them because then they'll, then they'll take the afternoon off, where Rick and I won't, but now, seriously, I've been very pleased with the results that they've been able to produce.","Richard S. Sokolov","And Cendrik, the only thing I would add is that the number that I'm thinking about is higher than I would have told you perhaps a year ago, because what has emerged in our sector now is you have a number, very high fashion, highly productive tenants like ZARA, H&M, UNIQLO, Topshop that are demanding bigger spaces. And because they are all bigger space, that's going to create incremental demand for our space that could enable us to perhaps drive the percentage higher than what otherwise be the case absent that demand.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So as you look at your ability to change the mix, what can it do for your ability to push rents in the centers?","David E. Simon","Well, look, it's relatively straightforward. The better the tenant does in terms of sales per square foot, the greater they have the ability to pay rent. And it's really that simple. So as we do that, we're hopeful that rent will follow or be part of that initial equation.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And turning maybe to densification. You've got -- you're talking about Copley earlier. It seems that you could add non-retail users depending on the city. How many malls do you own where you think you could add non-retail users and densify the site?","Richard S. Sokolov","Cedrik, it's Rick. Right now, we're working on adding hotels at 5 different projects, and we're working on adding multifamily at 4 additional ones. We're under construction with a multifamily project at Firewheel in Garland, Texas, so we still think there is very good demand for it. What we have found is that when we add these hotels and multifamily or condo components in our projects, they are yielding the higher room rates for hotels and monthly rentals from multifamily because people very much enjoy the mixed aspects of the community. So we think we bring an incremental value to those components and we're going to continue to pursue them.","David E. Simon","I just roughly put Copley aside because that's the big one. But there are at least 12 to 15 in each area that are of immediate focus. That doesn't mean it's limited to those, say, 24 to 30, but there is a list of those 12 or so in each category being hotel or and\/or multifamily that we're very focused on. In fact, we're going to prove this afternoon in Southdale more than likely. I'm still struggling with the returns because our returns are higher than the multifamily guys gets. But -- so I'm still trying, I'm still struggling with some of those deals. But I do think there is a pipeline to the advantage of that, and it's good for the real estate generally.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And just final question, in your Annual Shareholder letter, you talked about continuing to lead the industry and promoting the malls and marketing medium. How much more can you do? How much more income can you generate from that aspect of the business?","David E. Simon","Well, I think it's also just more than income in that. I could be wrong here, but I do think, I do think we're on the verge of a technology backlash. And our focus is creating a mall environment where people -- we had a meeting on this -- kind of a brainstorming meeting on this Monday, and something was said that was very clever, is that people today are looking down, they're not looking up. And what happens in the mall environment is we do give them the opportunity to look up and around and not just down. Down meaning at your mobile device and everything else. So I do think the mall has a unique ability to be part of that, maybe, next wave of trying to create social responsibility, community relations, community feel, and part of a process where we actually look up as opposed to look down. So it's a big focus for our company. The revenue side, obviously, we love cash flow, so we're cash flow junkies, so we're going to look to that too. But there's a unique ability for us to really kind of create community in our properties beyond that. And I think that's a huge mission for us to try and achieve. It's a long-term prospect, lots of ideas there, very hard to sort out exactly how we will execute it. But -- and the good news is, just to segue into the e-commerce, I mean, you're seeing more and more pure e-commerce companies opening stores because they know that people frankly want to look up, they don't always want to look down. So a great example is this Warby Parker, this eyeglass thing that was kind of the new hot dotcom thing and they're opening physical stores. Now whether they go to the malls or not, I'm not -- who knows? But the fact of the matter is, I think they recognized that people want to touch, feel, look up. So our mission is to get people to look up, not look down.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley of Citigroup.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's been a while since you combined the operating statistics of the mall and the outlet business together. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how it's just performing, some of the similarities and differences? And then as we look at the 79.6% of your NOI that comes from Malls and Premium Outlets, could you sort of give us a rough sense as to what the percentage is coming from outlets versus malls?","David E. Simon","Sure. I'll just say this. Steve can answer the second one. In the real estate recession, or I should say, not the real estate recession, because frankly, having lived through '90 to '93, this was child's play. But if you look at the general economy, our outlets clearly outperformed the malls during that '09, '10, and '11 period. And now I will say, Quentin, generally, in terms of sales growth and comp growth, they're relatively close. The outlets are still marginally better, but the difference between those 2 has narrowed considerably. Now with respect to the breakout, do you...","Stephen E. Sterrett","Yes. Quentin, if you actually -- in our year end [indiscernible] , that's posted on the website, we do break it out for you and I don't have it in front of me. But as I recall, the malls are 55% and I think the outlets are 25% because when you put the outlets and the mills together, essentially about 1\/3 of our NOI comes from the value side of the business.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just in terms of the ongoing success that you're having with Kl\u00e9pierre in terms of improving operations and capital and asset sales and so forth having an influence, are you spending a lot of time looking at a similar style of public company investment where you take a similar amount of minority stake and gets some Board representation? Is that something that's increasingly attractive to you, given the success of Kl\u00e9pierre?","David E. Simon","We have a thought about it from time to time. It's not a big focus for us. But it could lend itself to a situation here or there. But Kl\u00e9pierre was -- the reason we made the investment the way we did was for all sorts of reason, including risk management. So really, it would depend on the circumstances. It's not something that we're out looking to do, but in the right kind of context, it's conceivable.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","David, it's Michael Bilerman speaking. It sounds like if you're really a cash flow junkie, you should put advertising in the floors, that way you can get more money when people are looking down.","David E. Simon","We tried that. We've done that. We did \"buy a footprint\", but it didn't go over well. It was great for the kids. Then when I saw the adults using it, I thought it was a little tacky.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Thinking about Kl\u00e9pierre, I guess we've elapsed the 6th status for them to effectively go private. So how should we think about your stake and how you want to evolve over time, whether you want this to be stub [ph] outstanding, whether you want to bring it in-house, whether you want to bring a joint venture partner in. How should we think about how that evolves now that the, at least the REIT issue, the French REIT issue is elapsing?","David E. Simon","Well, Michael, I would love to answer that question, but I respectfully won't. We are pleased with the investment. We're making good strides. We need to make more strides. And I said the big problem with the company today is somewhat out of their control, not just dealing with the Spanish economy. But we're pleased, but I really, as much as I'd like to talk about that kind of stuff, I really can't. It is a public company. I've got to respect that situation. So we're pleased we are making very good strides. And I would say operationally, things do take longer there than they would than they would, say, here. But we've been pleased with kind of the blocking and tackling that the company is undertaking now, they still need to do a lot more, though we've been pleased with the progress they've made to date.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just going back to the rental spreads on Page 19 of your sup, and, Steve, you answered that the count, the retailer calendar year end, the January 31. But, I guess, I'm still having a hard time. March 31, '12, it's $7 million trailing at  $54, $49 expiring and now you're 3\/31\/3 [ph] 7.4 million square feet of $59 versus $52, and even 12\/31\/12, 8 million square feet of $53, $48, it just seems like there's -- that the opening\/closing arch is much, much higher this quarter. Whatever happened in the first quarter of 2013 was dramatically higher rents than at any point over trailing '12 [ph] any other quarter.","Stephen E. Sterrett","Michael, that's true, but if we also look, they were dramatically higher closing rents as well. So some of it is clearly mixed-driven. Some of it is clearly the fact that over the years, our portfolio continues to get better. And so the rents that we were able to do leases at 3 years ago, 5 years ago, 8 years ago were better, and those are all now rolling off. So --  but mix is clearly an issue, or component of it.","David E. Simon","And I would just point out that we have in our portfolio, U.S. portfolio, not including the Mills, or actually it does include the Mills, we have 121 properties that do over $700 a foot. So...","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","121?","Stephen E. Sterrett","That average $700 a foot in sales.","David E. Simon","121. So and as a Steve said, Rick said, we're really trying to make those properties better and better in all sorts of different ways. So that's going to  lead to more rent growth. But again, I would not overreact to one really good-looking statistic in one particular quarter. Just like I would ask for forgiveness to the extent that one quarter, we have a statistic that looks bad. I'm sure part of it is mix, we can drill down to it a little bit more, but demand is good and we got a reasonably good portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And just going, I guess, sort of back to Christy's question on department stores and just thinking about JCPenney in particular, especially if they brought in AlixPartners. Your sense of -- as you guys obviously speak to them, other department stores, how much do you think the massive Ala Moana trade has worked department store managements in thinking what their boxes are worth or do you think most people are pretty realistic in what they think their real estate is worth?","David E. Simon","Look, I can't speculate what Ala Moana, how that has affected the judgment of department store or retail CEOs. I would point out though since Ala Moana, there just hasn't been a lot of box trades and you can come to your own conclusion as to why maybe because they don't want to sell or maybe there's a spread between the bid and the ask. I don't know. But I can't speculate on how they think about that at all, Alex.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then going to Kl\u00e9pierre, while I know that you don't want to comment directly on their operations, can you just give us a sense as you guys think about the growth and what Simon can bring to their platform, this split between improving NOI versus bringing in the Simon brand venture type revenue stream and increasing that ancillary income. How would you think about the growth? Is more of it just going to come from NOI or is there a big opportunity, you think, to really improve the ancillary income that, that could be a meaningful contributor?","David E. Simon","Well, again, I'm not going to quantify that. It's not something I can do. Look, I think the important thing to put in perspective there, Alex, is that we don't run the company. We own a stake, we're pleased with the stake, we can show them how we run it and then they need to apply it. And we brought in, the company has brought in some talented people to learn from what we do, assuming we do what we do reasonably well. I mean, I'm not telling you we do what we do is great, because I always think it can get better. But assuming we do what we do reasonably well, we can show them how we do it and how we think about the business, but they've got to do that. They're the ones that need to do it. And it's not easy to do when the economy there is sputtering along and in some cases, still contracting, i.e., Spain. But they get what we're doing, they want to run the company better, they are running the company better. And I think as kind of I said in my letter, I do think there's growth there as soon as the economy of Europe generally stabilizes and I do think the economy of Europe will stabilize. It's not going to -- despite my personal view of it, it's not going to what continue to contract as it has over the last year or 2. So, I mean -- so it was a long winded answer, but I'm not going to speculate exactly how much NOI growth there is, but I do think there's improvement in how they run the business and I think they would agree, I think, that's their big focus in the upcoming years.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then just finally for Steve -- and thank you for new supplemental. On Page 23 in the CapEx and development page, there's an item called conversion from accrual to cash basis. And if you don't have this off hand, we can discuss offline. But just curious what that is.","Stephen E. Sterrett","Well, it's simple, Alex. We give you a CapEx number but there are CapEx numbers where we have accrued obligations like we got a construction build, but we haven't paid it yet. Okay. And all we're doing is giving you both the accrual number and the cash number because some people look at it and want the accrual number, some want the cash number.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, that make sense.","David E. Simon","Sure. And, by the way, that's been in there for a long time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Harris of Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Listen, there's a question, David. See if you feel -- how comfortable you feel answering this. Any thoughts as to what Simon might look like if we were to lose the tax break?","David E. Simon","I don't worry about that at all, David. I just -- REITs have been around for 60 years, it's not going to happen. I just can't imagine it's going to happen. As you know, it's revenue-neutral. If, in fact, there was some change, I think the -- I think most politicians understand the importance commercial real estate has in stabilizing the general economy. The last thing in the world they would want to do is create some kind of economic uncertainty. They've seen the fact that the downturn and what commercial real estate, how it handled itself in the amount of liquidity that reached -- brought to the table to stabilize pricing, and that create kind of what happened in the early '90s. And as I said, I have lived through that, as has Rick.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Me, too.","David E. Simon","You, too. Some others. It's not going to happen. But, by the way, if it did, we would, we would be best positioned to take advantage of it. Because, as you know, our cash flow is significantly above our dividend payment. And look, I have always fantasized, I probably shouldn't say this. So I always fantasized we pay out a $1.5 billion a year in dividends, $1.6 billion? What is the numbers now?","Stephen E. Sterrett","$1.6 billion.","David E. Simon","$1.6 billion. Imagine if I have that amount of capital through 2, 3, 4 years. So we would do some great stuff with it. But David, that's on a side, it's not going to happen. REITs have performed, they've been very important to the economy, they've been great for individual shareholders, they helped stabilized pricing. No way.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So no Plan B planning at this point?","David E. Simon","Well, we don't need to. But like I said, if the sun hits the moon and hits another galaxy, we will be better positioned than anybody else.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Well, tax breaks aren't granted in perpetuity. So I think the question is out there. A similar question actually related to Kl\u00e9pierre. I mean obviously, there's been a lot of talk about tax increases and public policy responses that may be somewhat more fluid in Europe today. Any notion at all that the tax status of the company like Kl\u00e9pierre is being questioned?","David E. Simon","Not at all.","David E. Simon","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Let me go back to the leasing spreads again, not to beat a dead horse here, but the 13%, so the 300-basis point pickup, when I first looked at that, what went into my mind was you're starting to roll some shorter term post-downturn leases and you're getting the benefit there. I guess what I'm trying to get at is, does it feel like this increase whether it's 200 basis points, 300 or whatever it is, is probably going to be sticky going forward or is it just purely an anomaly where Q2 rolls around and for some reason were back down to 10%?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Mike, it's Steve. Let me take a shot at it and Rick can weigh in or David. I think if you look at the -- we give you 5 quarters' worth of information, and the one thing you can see from the 5 quarters is that the spread has increased over each of the 5 quarters. The magnitude of the increase, this quarter was substantial relative to the trend that we had been seeing, but we had been going from the low 4s to the mid 4s to $5 a foot. So and, as I said, some of that is lumpy because of first quarter explorations, but the fact is, deal flow has been getting better, quality of deals has been getting better, occupancy cost has stayed relatively low. So as you want to think about it, as a mark-to-market or however you want to think about it, there is, there should be an upward bias. Is the upward bias from $5 to $7, I think that's hard to say. But the trend has been good.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, secondly, just curious about what are the thoughts on the pace of rolling out outlets in Brazil today compared to what you were thinking 6 months or a year ago?","David E. Simon","Let me answer it if I could. I think both. As you know, we've looked diligently in Brazil and diligently in China. Both markets for us have proven to be very, very difficult to find the right project with the right risk\/reward ratio, and hence we have nothing -- I mean, we're still working with BR Malls. We're still hopeful that eventually, we'll be able to do something there. China is proved to be a market that I continue to really question whether or not anybody can make money investing there, especially us. And so I'm hopeful that over time, we'll find the right opportunity with BR in Brazil, but that's taken longer than we anticipated. And then China is really, really on the back burner. And I have no regrets about it being on the back burner.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deutsche Bank.","Unknown Analyst","I just wanted to go back to JCPenney real quick. Just, obviously given the transition at the top there, I'm just wondering if you could share your thoughts on that move itself. But then also, given their sort of return to more conditional marketing tactics that they've been known for. At the ground- level, have you seen any change in traffic levels and that kind of thing since the move?","David E. Simon","Well, let me just mention, we're pleased that Mike Ullman is back. I think he will -- he's obviously a very confident, seasoned, thoughtful CEO and leader. And given all the turmoil that Penny was going through, a perfect choice to help stabilize the company. And that we have great respect for him and his ability. And I would say, generally having walked a number of Penny stores with David Contis and Rick over the last -- not just the stores. So the stores are looking better. So I think they're heading on the right track. It's very hard for me to speculate exactly how it's all going to shakeout. But the bottom line is the organization needed some stability and thoughtfulness, and I think Mike's perfectly the right guy to provide that,","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And just want to go back to some comments you made about the department -- no, the anchor space I, think, 635, only 6 or 7 vacant, so some of the lowest vacancy you've ever seen there. But then you also kind of you say that -- I think I heard no interest in sale-leasebacks. Just curious, if you could comment on what kind of demand is out there for additional anchor space, obviously with the, vacancy low, that's good, but I mean, are you seeing much demand for anchor space? It just seem like more people are moving to the outlet channel in terms of the traditional anchors.","Richard S. Sokolov","This is Rick. There is a great deal of demand for the space, and if you look at the kind of tenants that we're adding to the properties, we're adding Wegmans, Fresh Market, Dick's, theaters, health clubs. There is a substantially broader number of categories of retailers that want to take advantage of all the traffic en masse that we are creating at these properties. So we have, again, more demand today than we have had historically from a broader collection and a variety of retailers than we've had in the past, and all that is helping drive, I think, the growth of our property and the lack of vacancy among our anchor boxes.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. Do you have enough data points at this point for some of these non-traditional anchor malls, as far as how the performance of those malls compares to historically the traditional setup our mix?","Richard S. Sokolov","I think that all of our anchor components are part of the mix that we have at the property. They are not going to be game changing, but they obviously want to be a property that are consistent with their growth and in some instances, merely a function of whether we can accommodate the physical configuration. Wegmans needs almost 4 acres of land for a single level building, well in a lot of instances, that can [ph] happen. So it's really less a function of that kind of a correlation, a more a function of can we continue to give our trade area shoppers more reasons to come to our properties, then that's what we're all about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Moore of RBC Capital Markets.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","On the bankruptcy front in the lease termination front and that sort of side of the equation, it seems that things are pretty good. I guess, Rick, how would you characterize the outlook for lost tenants over the next 3 to 9 months?","Richard S. Sokolov","Well, if you look historically, our bankruptcy numbers have been up a little in '13 just because of Bakers. But overall, the credit profile of our tenants has never been better. Our receivables, Steve can elaborate, has never been in better shape or bad debt is stable. So we're feeling good about the credit profile of our tenants and more importantly, their rent-paying ability, which continues to be pretty strong.","Stephen E. Sterrett","Yes, Rich, this is Steve. Just to put numbers on Rick's overall statement. I think at the end of the third quarter, we were chasing $42 million of receivables that had been built, but not yet been paid and that's on about a $7 billion annual base of revenue that we bill either on the consolidated or the JV property. So you're literally talking about less than 2 days\u2019 worth of revenue. And the credit profile, as Rick said, is very strong right now.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I don't think my calculator decimals go out that far, Steve, so. Okay, good. And then on the outlets, I think didn't you guys do the development of Houston and Tangers doing Charlotte, and how do you split up Columbus? So, I guess, who's driving Columbus is what I'm curious.","David E. Simon","It's -- in Charlotte, we've actually switched the roles that we had in Texas. And in Texas, we were the developer and we jointly leased and they run the center. In Charlotte, they are the developer as there was the site. We're going to manage the center and will jointly lease. And then in Columbus, again, Columbus is a competitive marketplace. But in Columbus, we're switching back to the other deal. So it's been -- partnerships are very common in the real estate industry. All sorts of people are partnered, developers over the years have always partnered. We have a very good relationship with Tanger and so it's just kind of a natural to say, okay, this is a way it was here, we're going to swap there and then go back here, and then there's another deal to do, it would probably swap back to the way we're doing Charlotte. So long winded, but Charlotte will be a the Charlotte Premium Outlet, and then Tanger will be branding Columbus, if, in fact, we're the successful developer.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, David, how many more do you think of the 8 that you have going and you would do with or that you're thinking about for North America you'd do with Tanger?","David E. Simon","Well, in the 2 or in the 8, and that be of the 8 North America, that includes Canada by the way, and we are actually looking at another site in Mexico. And we've seen very good progress in our outlet in Mexico City. But of the 8, 2 of those are Charlotte and Columbus, of the 8.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And no more plans yet with Tanger?","David E. Simon","No, sir.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then the last things, the recovery ratio, I think it was pretty much a high this time, this quarter. I mean, is it going to stay up where it is?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Well, I think we're excited -- I tell you in a weird sort of way the recovery ratio the way those of us who have been around awhile that historically thought about it. It's kind of less relevant now because we are 90 plus percent converted to fixed KM, so the KM charge is just another fixed charge that the retailer looks at in the calculation of the total occupancy cost that they're paying to the landlord. Our fixed KM all have individual annual escalators. And if you look at our operating cost, they've been pretty flat. And as long as that's the case, you're going to see the recovery ratio the way developers have traditionally thought about it, continue to increase.","Richard S. Sokolov","But I will tell you just in terms of our ability to drive rents if you go back and we've given you some of the quarters in the K, but our occupancy cost is down over 100 basis points since 12\/31\/10. So we're still providing very good profitability and value for our retailers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Yang of Evercore Partners.","Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","David, you made some comments last [ph] quarter that demand is picking up in the B mall category that sales were actually okay. So 3, 4 months into the new year, is that still the situation generally that the B mall segment continues to perform okay?","David E. Simon","Yes. Yes. Yes. I mean, yes, it is.","Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then also, maybe for Steve based on some of your recent conversations with the lenders. Are the lenders taking a more conservative approach maybe to the B mall category given obviously what's happening at JCPenney?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Well, Ben, I would just say that lenders and I assume you're referring to the secured lenders, generally speaking, I have kept a more conservative posture. Loan to values are still relatively modest, underwriting is still relatively conservative. And that's true regardless of the quality of the asset.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. So no significant change over the past few weeks given obviously the new management team at JCPenney's and a lot of uncertainty going on with that particular anchor; is that a fair assumption?","Stephen E. Sterrett","That's fair.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe switching gears. You made some comments on China just now. On the back burner, just to find opportunities, just to make money. Can you just elaborate a bit on some of the challenges that you see in China today that makes you a little more cautious because I do recall that you guys did go to China a few years ago doing some anchored centers, and I was curious what you see today that makes it still very challenging for you guys.","David E. Simon","Well, that was a very good experience. And we brought 70% -- look, any time you invest capital and you only bring 70% of it back home, you learn a lesson. And I would say, Ben, generally, generally, the ability to underwrite the product there in terms of what the tenants are going to pay, what the costs are, what the approval process is, all of the elements of the P&L and pro forma, including construction cost, land cost, permitting, it's all very, not to say that people can't make money there, but it's all very difficult to really have a high degree of confidence. And when you think of the risks associated there, you would hope that the returns are better, at least on the piece of paper that you're ready to make the investment are. And frankly, they're not, and that's what -- that's where the big gap exist. And so a lot of it is, build and they will come, and that plays out pretty badly in real estate development. I mean, it's certainly, build it and they will come in the U.S. As Rick knows and I know, Rick's older so he knows a little bit more than I know. Build it and they will come did not make every mall successful. There were a lot of malls that frankly shouldn't have been built. So it's just very tough to have the level of precision that we want and if there were margin for error, i.e., returns on investment that were higher, you would take the risk. I just don't see it in everything that we look at on a piece of paper in China. Brazil is a little bit different. You can pencil better returns there. But again, finding the right site and the right -- and the ability to build and so on is a little more tough -- difficult but you do see a little bit of a -- you do see a much better returns at least on a paper.","Benjamin Yang - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And maybe just one final one on China. I mean, what type of returns would make it more attractive for you to go into China, given all the risk that you've kind of elaborated on?","David E. Simon","You'll know it when we do it, and right now, I don't see anything on the drawing board that's going to -- and again, please, the fact of the matter is, somebody could be very successful and we could miss an opportunity, but for whatever reason, whatever we're looking at, it's just not making sense for us. That's not to say others might not be successful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Patinkin of BMO.","Josh Patinkin","A couple of questions on Toronto Premium Outlet and the broader opportunity set for the Premium Outlet brand in Canada. Hudson Bay is opening their first outlet store there. Are you in a position to announce any other merchants?","David E. Simon","Yes, we will. I don't know when we're going to do that, but we normally do that. We normally have done that throughout the process, but we will. I mean, this should be, by all accounts, a very successful outlet center.","Richard S. Sokolov","We're already 85% leased and committed, and we will be putting out a press release in the next month or so. It's opening in August. So it's happening and it's gotten very good response from both the Canadian-based retailers, but also the U.S. retailers that are operating in Toronto already.","Josh Patinkin","Okay. So that was my next question. The American brand, I'm trying to assess their level of interest in Canada, and are the Canadian brands that are going in there, are they developing a made-for-outlet merchandising strategy similar to what happened?","David E. Simon","Some are. Yes, some are now. Hudson Bay is a perfect example. We have a wonderful relationship with the parent, which is, as you know, Lord & Taylor and we've picked up the phone and said, this, you're doing Lord & Taylor outlets in the U.S. a few here and there. You ought to do it with Hudson Bay and, really, we generated that idea. They thought long and hard about it and they were very interested in doing that. So I do think it will start a trend there, no question about it. And the U.S. folks are very interested, assuming they have a full price presence ahead of that. And Canada generally is very attractive to most U.S. retailers. But not all are there. And some of their outlet concepts will be delayed to the extent that until they have the full price there, which is coming and for us, with Toronto Premium Outlets, the luxury brands are starting to hit Toronto, and what we think over time, as they hit there, we have the natural place for them to do the outlet. But again, that's going to take time. In the meantime, we're going to have a terrific center and we have a Phase 2 there that would allow us to bring in the luxury guys as they hit kind of the greater Toronto market.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. As you look at Canada, how many Premium Outlet caliber malls are there to build in Canada do you think?","David E. Simon","Well, look, we expect in our, at least one of the -- now this was a great secret, now you've got 3 or 4 of the 8, but one in Mexico [ph] . One of the 8, at least 8 is in Montr\u00e9al, which we expect, again another meeting today on it, but we're going to start construction on that in July. And so that's -- we think that's a good market, a very good market. Now it poses a little trickier leasing because a number of the U.S. brands won't go up to Qu\u00e9bec, but we think that's offset by some of the international brands that really do like Montr\u00e9al. In fact, Montr\u00e9al is a great fashion city and they have great malls there, and we think it's going to be a great long-term project. So we've got Montr\u00e9al. Obviously, Vancouver is a very interesting market as well. We're focused on those kind of bigger gateway areas up in Canada.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Isbee of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","David, you've updated your FFO guidance at the first quarter for stronger operations. Just going back to the first -- fourth quarter volume you said on that call, it was going to be tough to match the 4.8% same-store growth you did in '12. Could you perhaps give us an update of those thoughts?","David E. Simon","Well, we -- look, the first quarter was very good. We had a -- what's really impressive for me is that it was off a really good first quarter in '12. So that's pretty significant cash flow growth when you had the 5 7 plus the 4 8, on top of the 4 8.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I agree.","David E. Simon","I am conservative by nature. I think the organization generally is even though we probably don't compliment them as much as we should, they're really doing a good job. So it would be -- I would be very, very excited if we maintained that we are not anticipating that. We also kind of trended down through the year. First quarter was better or so last year if you look, we kind of -- I don't remember where we were overall for '12, but...","Unknown Executive","4 8.","David E. Simon","4 8. So I think '13 we're heading the right direction. I'm really not answering your question, but it's off to a good start is all I can tell you.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then any thoughts about some of the fundamental strength of the B mall market. There seems to be some new entrants into the B mall category, people looking to buy some of those major assets [ph] , et cetera. What are your thoughts in terms of perhaps accelerating your sales out of that group, taking advantage of the new entrants to that market?","David E. Simon","Well, we're still going to prune the portfolio. So I'm pleased that there are new people coming in the market that are looking at deals. So I think that's good for us generally.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just finally on St. Louis. You have 97% spoken for at this point. Now that you're getting closer to the open, can you give us a little bit more, perhaps the insight into the negotiations with the retailers of why they chose your site over the competing and what type of sales they're expecting to get out of that?","David E. Simon","Look, I -- really, I'm not going to get into that, Nate, other than to say we presented to them what they thought the center was going to be like Cincinnati Premium Outlets. This is kind of how we envisioned the productivity and the mix. And that's been very -- it's a quite center, but it's been well received by the community and by the retailers. And that's how we sold it to the retailers. Now they have a lot of confidence that if we say we're going to build Cincinnati, they did, we did that, so that's how we kind of sold it, and to them in terms of how they should think about the productivity. The pricing was similar to that. I mean, and we took it from there. I mean, nothing beyond that, really. I mean, it was competitive, but at the end of the day, I think retailers have a level of confidence with us that -- in terms of the outlet product. I will say this, though, we got the -- this pricing in new deal, it's not -- the outlet retailer generally, they know what they can afford to pay. So as much as we'd like to say, there's just great, huge negotiation on rents, I mean they're used to saying, here's what I pay on the new outlet center and that's what they pay. So they're in a very good position to bargain what the rental rate is. I mean, the one thing they really wanted to do, they really don't like competing centers. They really like when there's one site and then they all go because they don't -- they know what they can afford to pay and then that's what they pay. So in Charlotte, as much as the market might think, boy, Charlotte looks like we're going to build that one center. The retail community loved the fact that they didn't have to worry about a competing site. They really, really like it. Now in St. Louis, I'm sure a number of them felt that way as well.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess your success there hasn't whetted your appetite for another bite [ph] .","David E. Simon","No. Look, we've lost plenty of those, too. And I mean -- but it's, like I said, it's not -- it's common to partner and just get a deal done for the community, for the retailers and be done with it. In this case, it didn't happen.","Operator","This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will like to hand the call back over to Mr. Simon for closing remarks.","David E. Simon","Okay. Thank you for your time and your interest, and we'll talk to you very, very soon.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation.

My name is Derek, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Shelly Doran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Shelly J. Doran","Good morning, and welcome to Simon Property Group's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to our filings with the SEC for a detailed discussion. Acknowledging the fact that this call may be webcast for some time to come, we believe it is important to note that our call includes time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today's date, April 27, 2012.","During today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the earnings release or the company's supplemental information package that was included in this morning's Form 8-K. This package is also available on the Simon website, in the Investors section.","Participating in today's call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.","David E. Simon","Okay. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. The scope and breadth of our company can be best described by a high-level overview of our activities and accomplishments during the first few months of 2012. First of all, financial and operationally, let me just state that FFO was $1.82 per share, up 13% from the first quarter 2011. We exceeded the First Call consensus by $0.14. We have now met or exceeded expectations for 31 of the past 33 quarters. For our malls and Premium Outlets, comp NOI grew 5.7%, and you'll recall that our comp NOI for first quarter 2011 was up 2.3%. Tenant sales were up 11.2%. Both individually the malls and the Outlet portfolio were up double digits. Occupancy was up 60 basis points. Average rent per square foot was increased by 4.4%. Releasing spread was a positive 9.7% or $4.74 per square foot. ","Now let me turn to transactions. As you know, we invested $2 billion in purchasing shares of Klepierre, the second largest owner of retail real estate in Continental Europe. With assets valued at a portfolio EUR 16.2 billion, we now own nearly 29% of the company. I'm Chairman of the Supervisory Board, and we control 3 of the 9 board seats. Our investment provides opportunity for significant value creation through exchanging operational best practices, creating synergy through our leasing and marketing efforts and the generation of ancillary revenues. We'll be actively involved in the Klepierre capital allocation decisions, including allocation of capital amongst the various assets and the countries in which they do business and we'll be providing guidance on investment and divestiture decisions and balance sheet management. We view this investment as having significant optionality for us given the countries in which Klepierre operates, the large number of assets that it owns and manages and the successful operational platform that it possesses. From a capital point of view, it essentially replaces our previous European investments, which were liquidated at a significant gain to our shareholders over the past couple of years. ","Now let me turn to Mills. As you know, we acquired the interest of our joint venture partner in 26 of 36 assets of The Mills Limited Partnership for $1.5 billion. Transaction completed at a good cap rate for us and reinforce that this has been a good deal for us and our partner, Farralon. We believe there is upside in the assets with growing NOI, and we'll continue to pursue many of the redevelopment opportunities in the portfolio. At the end of the day, both of these transactions will be immediately accretive to FFO. To fund Klepierre and Mills transaction, we sold unsecured notes and issued common equity. We sold $1.75 billion of senior unsecured notes in 3 tranches. Rates on the 3 tranches of notes were the lowest ever achieved by a REIT by an average of 76 basis points. We issued 9.1 million common shares at a price of $137 per share, and our rating of A-, A3 were affirmed by all 3 rating agencies. In addition, we weren't done with that. We acquired another 25% ownership interest in Del Amo Fashion Center where our major redevelopment is in the planning stage, and we sold our interest in Gallerie Commerciali in Italy at a gain to our investment. ","Development activity, if I may turn to. We successfully reopened the fully restored Opry Mills to a great public reception. Space at the center is approximately 90% leased and committed. In addition, we started construction on 4 new Premium Outlet Centers, all scheduled to open in 2013: Shisui in Japan, our ninth Premium Outlet in Japan; Phoenix, serving the greatest Phoenix and Scottsdale areas; Toronto, which actually the groundbreaking was this week, our first upscale Outlet Center in Canada; and Busan in Korea, our third Premium Outlet in Korea. In addition, we signed agreements to develop Premium Outlet Centers in Brazil with the well-known and well-respected BR Malls, and in China, with the well-known and well-respected Bailian Group. And we're focused on a site adjacent to the Disney Shanghai. Continued construction on 2 new Premium Outlets that will open in the U.S. this year, Merrimack, New Hampshire and south of Houston, Texas. We continued construction on 25 renovation and expansion projects in the U.S. and in Japan with 2012 and 2013 completion dates, and we continue to expect our share of development spend to approximate $1 billion in 2012, '13 and '14, respectively. ","Let me turn to the dividends. As you now know, we've announced our third consecutive increase in quarterly dividend from $0.95 to $1 per share. Our dividend is now fully 25% higher than it was one year ago at this time. In addition, we are very pleased and honored to be added to the S&P 100 Index in the first quarter, joining the likes of Nike, Starbucks, Honeywell and DuPont, all well-known companies where equity market caps are comparable to ours. ","Guidance. We increased the top end of our 2012 FFO guidance. Initially, as you know, in February, we had guidance of $7.20 to $7.30. Our range now includes a range from $7.50 per share to $7.60 per share, so we increased both the top end and the bottom end of our guidance. Factors contributing to this increase: essentially stronger operating performance and recent investment activity. ","Now let me just conclude, and we can talk about any questions you may have. Our portfolio of high-quality irreplaceable assets continues to deliver strong results and is second to none in our industry. Just to illustrate that, I know the size sometimes of our portfolio is somewhat overwhelming, and all of our activity obviously is hard to appreciate sometimes. But let me just put this in perspective. We have in our portfolio of assets 12 that generate over $1,000 per square foot. Our top 30 U.S. average -- assets average over $1,000 per square foot in sales and provide 1\/3 of our SPG NOI. Our top 50 U.S. average $886 per square foot in sales and provide 1\/2 of our SPG share of NOI. And importantly, our top 100 assets average $700 per square foot and provide 3\/4 of our NOI. Needless to say, we're off to a good start and active, and we're ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Christy McElroy from UBS.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Given GGP's recent deal with Sears to buy back some boxes and leases, I'm wondering if you're having any discussions with the retailer to do the same? And of the 119 Sears boxes at your malls, are there any that you would specifically point to where you would say we could unlock pretty significant value at that mall if we got the box back?","David E. Simon","Well, look, we're not going to get into discussions that we have with our individual retailers. We have a good relationship with Sears. We expect, over time, for a number of those properties to be reclaimed or redeveloped, but nothing really to report beyond that. And look, we do think there's value there. We'll be conservative in how we value the real estate and how we look at it. But I think, over time, it will provide an opportunity for the company.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","We've heard recently from some specialty retailers that lease negotiations for Class B malls have started to move in favor of the landlords again. Can you discuss your ability to raise rents at B and B- types of assets? And if I think about your rent spreads being 10% across the portfolio, how would that break out between sort of the Class A stuff and the Class B stuff?","David E. Simon","One thing we don't like to do is go through Class A and Class B. We're very focused on increasing the cash flow in all of our assets. Obviously, the ones that have higher sales per square foot, we're able to drive a little bit better bargain. We look to win-win for the retailers. We're doing a lot of business with retailers throughout the portfolio. Our rent spreads -- our averages mean a lot because they're not -- with a portfolio of our size, we can't have one particular center rollover or one center doing so much more business that it's driving the statistics of every other at the portfolio. The business has firmed up, and we're pleased with where it's headed and where it's going. Retailers are looking for growth, so I'd say things are all pretty good. Rick, you want to add anything?","Richard S. Sokolov","I would just underline David's point. If you look in our 8-K and see where our renovations are and where we're adding anchors and department stores, it's throughout the portfolio, and we're increasing market share across the board and that is enabling us to drive that pricing. And to underline -- quantifying David's point on the square footage, when you look at our sales and our statistics, that's on the basis of almost 60 million square feet. So there is no way for outliers to influence that. It's a broad operational trend that we're reflecting.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then just lastly, how much capital do you envision investing in outlets in China and Brazil over the next 5 years? And what kind of projected returns are you forecasting?","David E. Simon","Well, look, it's safe to say that we would -- every international development that we've done in the Outlet business has had double-digits return in the 15%-on-average range. We would expect that that's kind of the hurdle we're shooting for. In any event, we would expect those to be at least double digits. Brazil, generally, we think the market can support in the 10 to 14 opportunities initially. Cost of those will, on average, be in the $100-million-plus range. As you know, we are partners 50-50 with BR Malls. That gives you the scope of the situation. In China, right now, our focus is on one particular development and that we're going through the numbers on that. It's a little bit early to give you kind of the scope of magnitude of that, but we think it's a great site having visited it personally. It's a great opportunity for the company. The demand from the retailers is very strong. China is -- you got to be extra cautious there. We've had an experience where we learned a lot in China. But generally, I think it will be consistent with the build in what we've done in Korea and what we've done in Japan. Cost of construction, land values are all kind of the same there, but I don't want to pin those numbers down just yet.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Jeff Spector from Merrill Lynch.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple of follow-up questions on Brazil. David, did I hear you say you had 10 to 14 potential sites?","David E. Simon","Over -- yes, over a period of time, correct.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I'm not as familiar with all of the different markets in Brazil. I mean, is there any change in the site criteria? Or are you saying in your first analysis you feel that there are 10 to 14 sites that really fit that Premium Outlet-type criteria, density-wise?","David E. Simon","Correct, that's correct. And we've got currently -- so that's over an extended period of time. We've got one site identified in S\u00e3o Paulo. We're not in the position to disclose that yet. If all goes according to plan, we have the chance of opening that in late '13, but more likely early '14. And then we're currently evaluating another 4 additional sites. So that 10 to 4 (sic) 14 is over an extended period of time, but we've got 1. We're very close to moving forward on and then another 4 of that are further along than that.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And for now in Brazil, just sticking with the outlets or you're still looking at mall opportunities, full price?","David E. Simon","This is the primary focus right now.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then switching to your investment in Klepierre, you -- I think you carefully said that, right now, you're actively involved on the balance sheet divestitures. You didn't talk about operations at all.","David E. Simon","Well, I did mention that. You may not have picked it up. I mean, we've had some very good beginning discussions with the senior team there. We've owned the stock for 6 weeks, so you have to put it in perspective that their senior management team is actually coming here next week. But we're going to coordinate certain retail leasing at the Shopping Center Convention coming up in May in the U.S. -- Shopping Center Convention. So it's early days on that front, but it's safe to say that there are 3 or 4 areas of focus for us: operational synergies; leasing synergies; cash flow enhancement, all of that in one category; capital allocation in another category. Along with that is what assets should they be involved in? Where should the focus be? What countries our long-term holds, then balance sheet management and then investment divestiture decision. So all of those are kind of the 3 or 4 buckets that where we're focused on, both as directors and as shareholders, and the cooperation has been excellent. There's nothing so far that, in our short involvement, that has caused any concern for us. Look, Europe has got some macro headwinds. We knew that going in. The fact of the matter is, these opportunities surface when the going is tough, but we're in this for the long haul. And we think it's a very good platform that we can help continue to move in the right direction, and actually have bottom line impact improvement on. But that's going to take time.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And are you personally spending a lot of time on that investment?","David E. Simon","Yes.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Going forward? Okay. And then my last -- I'm sorry.","David E. Simon","No. Sure. I mean, I'm Chairman of the Board. And like I said, yes, we're very involved, not just me, but my team as well.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then my last question on development. Anything -- any new potential sites on the full-price side, mall side, the Lifestyle center side for you?","David E. Simon","No.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","U.S.","David E. Simon","I'm looking at Rick and the answer -- we're just making sure we're both saying no. The answer is no, not really. We think the returns, in order to really induce the full-price guys with the cost of development, are just too skinny still. Demand is still not quite there. And the fact of the matter is, with our redevelopment pipeline, we got great stuff going on, I mean, really good stuff going on. And with our development or our Premium Outlet development, we are under construction. Let me just reinforce this. We are under construction in Phoenix. We are under construction in Toronto. We are under construction in Korea and Japan. We're looking at a couple other areas. We're busy, and these are all very good returns that we are building new too. So at this point, why chase full-price retail at lower returns when we got our plate full of assets.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Michael. I'm here with Quentin Velleley. David, I just wanted to start, you think about Klepierre, $2 billion, but you're an $80 billion enterprise today, so its 2.5% of your asset base, and it is taking up a lot of your time. You've been to Europe twice in the last month. How do you sort of balance something that's a smaller part today of the enterprise and driving value for the other 97.5% of assets? And then taking it one step further, you own 30% of the entity today. You're in this for the long haul. You obviously want to see a lot of improvements. The price you're going to have to pay for the other 70% if you do want to consolidate could be meaningfully higher benefiting Klepierre shareholders rather than Simon shareholders. I'm just -- how do you sort of balance all this?","David E. Simon","Well, just on the first point, Michael, that's what I do, okay? So the one thing that I think amazes folks given the scope of this company is that, that's what we do. Rick looks at whether we're getting market value on a new Gap lease. I mean, as weird as it sounds, that's just what we do. So I still think a $2 billion investment ought to warrant my serious attention. So that's just what we do. We've got -- we've added a few people to help. We added Contis. We added Fivel so we could leverage a little bit, my time and Rick's time to do it. But that's what we do. We sweat the details. That's all we know how to do, and we don't see changing from that. And I view -- look, the thing about Klepierre, it's got a portfolio. Its share of this is not quite that. It's about EUR 14 billion. But the portfolio that it overseas is EUR 16 billion. That's a big opportunity for us. And Europe is in a state of flux, which is an even better opportunity for us ultimately to reinforce our company's position as a global brand, and there are great benefits to being global. Many of our -- if you look at our peer group in the S&P 100, and I just read you a few names, they're all global. Our retailers are going global. And I think it's great, great opportunity. It's a great potential platform for us to really have a significant presence there and create kind of a sister or fully integrated Simon company over there. We've never had that opportunity. I don't know that this can be that, but it's certainly worth the opportunity. And I think coming in at below NAV, even with all the macro headwinds, I don't see how we'd lose. But it's possible we do, but we don't. But when I go through this list of companies in our similar cap range, News Corp, Nike, Colgate-Palmolive, Lilly, Starbucks, Ford, Disney, Union -- well, Union Pacific isn't because it's all railroad, Boeing, they're all international global companies. And I think it's important for us to be in that spot. And so look, Flowers, one of the great value financial investors there is, is moving to London because of European opportunity. So this is a great platform. We'll see where it develops. It potentially could go -- it could end here. On the other hand, we could take this investment and make it something special. And I have no problem as long as our shareholders are rewarded along that process and sharing the wealth.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Quentin here, just a question on the outlets in Brazil. With U.S. fashion merchandiser sort of 3x to 5x more expensive in Brazil, how do you expect the international retailers that are going into your outlets, how do you expect them to, I guess, compete given the improved U.S. visa process and also the improvements in Brazilians' ability to purchase over the Internet?","David E. Simon","Well, look, there are more and more international retailers landing in Brazil and dealing with the tariffs. And certainly from a customer point of view, if we can land those tenants and deliver more value to the customer, then -- that's why I think we feel like these outlets will be very successful. It will not have the percentage of international grounds like China, Japan or Korea will because of that particular issue. While we think there's enough there -- and with the Brazilian retailers as well to populate those centers. And there's been one kind of outlet that's been built there and it was successful. I think you're going to have to go small, do this in phases. But I think, over time, you'll have more international penetration.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Just switching to Europe, maybe if you could just comment on the health of the hotter markets in Europe. How do you think they're going to change their business models and evolve to some of the challenges they're facing?","David E. Simon","Well, I think that -- look, it depends on the retailer. I mean, we were, as you know, partners with Ocean and their business model has been very successful and they continue to do very good business. Carrefour, as you know, is a big partner, so to speak, with Klepierre. And they've gone through some fits and starts in terms of where they want to go. I think they've got new leadership. It sounds like they are back to focusing on being very price competitive and that, we think, will drive traffic, and we think ultimately will help us with the Galleries, which we own. And it's very interesting, Quentin, just you know because you got a funny accent. But the hypermarkets there, they're disappointed when they do EUR 80 million to EUR 100 million, whereas if we have a department store or anybody that did  EUR 80 million to EUR 100 million in our shopping center, we'd be very thrilled. So it's all relative. I have all the confidence in the world with where Carrefour is going that they'll continue to be a very worldwide class retailer.","Operator","Your next question will be coming from the line of Cedrik Lachance from Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Yes. So just one follow-up with some funny accent. Just maybe a quick one on The Mills. Just in terms of how you're organizing information right now. A number of The Mills properties were moved into other operating properties. Is there anything we need to read into that?","David E. Simon","Well, I think what you would read into that is that we're probably not long-term owners of the 3 assets that are still owned by TMLP. One of those, actually we're evaluating that and that is we're hopeful that, over time, we can reposition that asset, but a couple of them were probably not long-term owners.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. In regards to your ability to market to market those assets, is it a -- timing and ability to market those assets, what do you think that would be?","David E. Simon","I would think it would certainly be clarified in the not-too-distant future. About 12 months or so.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and thank you also for the sales disclosure. In regards to the decision there on the sales front, it includes the outlets, is that correct?","David E. Simon","Yes.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. if we were to exclude outlets from, let's say, the top 100 category, what would happen to the sales productivity there?","David E. Simon","It probably wouldn't matter all that much, but I don't have that in front of me. But I'd give you a sense of this. It's probably a 75 to 25 split, roughly, to give you a sense of order of magnitude, out of 100. Next call, we can get really specific, but I don't have it entirely in front of me. But I think that gives you the general nature of it.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Paul Morgan from Morgan Stanley.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just sticking with that top 100 is 75% of your NOI. Any thoughts given the B mall sales that have taken place by some of your peers that you might be interested in culling the, kind of the other 120 there or 25% of the NOI making any efforts beyond kind of the -- kind of single-asset-type brokers?","David E. Simon","Well, I think the good news is that, that market seems to be firming up. There's more players in it. And so I think, historically, Paul, we've always wanted to call the portfolio. As you know, that's been a relatively tough exercise. But with now Starwood hasn't closed yet, but assuming it closes, you've got a couple other players out there that are looking to invest. I would expect us to continue to play in that game. We did sell one mall at the end of -- it really actually closed at the very beginning of this year, Gwinnett Mall in Atlanta. So we are -- we would expect to do that. I think there are more players there and that's the good news. We're trying to understand what their strategy is going forward, and I'm sure we'll, over time, continue to cull the portfolio to some extent.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And if I can just go back to Klepierre. As you look at kind of the leasing platforms and you mentioned some kind of the global element to the retailers, I mean, do you think, having the time you had spent with them and then looking at their portfolio of tenants, do you think there's more opportunity to bring their tenants here and your tenants there? Or given your express[ph] strength in Europe, you think you've kind of already been well on top of that and it's not that incremental from here?","David E. Simon","I actually -- I think that probably the more likely opportunity is to bring U.S. retailers there. And as you walk the malls in Continental Europe, they're not -- they're okay. They're not greatly merchandised. I think it possesses a great opportunity for a number of our retailers. Again, that takes time, and there are some that are making inroads there. But generally, I would think the opportunity will be more U.S. to Europe. But, and Rick can comment on that, but there are also opportunities, as you know, for retailers there to come here. And they're actually making progress to get U.K. retailers. As an example, Primark, which is a well-known, very good U.K. retailer to add to the European retail mix there. So I think it will be a little bit of everything. But I do feel that our U.S. retailers do think Europe is an opportunity for them. Rick, you want to?","Richard S. Sokolov","And I would say to you just on the other way, if you like, there's no doubt that the relationships that we've created in dealing with the H&Ms and the ZARAs and the Legos are going to stand up some very good stead because we're just now an incrementally more important part of their global footprint, which is what we have always aspired to be.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And just lastly, sticking with the Europe. I mean, how do you think about other opportunities for investment now on the continent given you have a minority stake and you might have a different capital position, but how would you handle the kind of the conflicts with looking at outlets or looking at other opportunities that come up via Klepierre or independently?","David E. Simon","Well, look, the outlet business, Klepierre has no involvement in. So I don't view that as any particular conflict. I think it gives us a great opportunity. There are so many options on the table for us now that we've got -- have an investment in a very fine company like Klepierre. Other way, they're very good developers. They build great product. I encourage you to look at some of the stuff that they've built. I mean they're a first-class organization. We think we can respectfully add to that, but they're not -- they're damn good on their own. And I think as we look at opportunities, we'll sit with them and say, okay, what makes sense. So it could be within Klepierre. It could be in a joint venture with Klepierre or it could be completely on our own. But we certainly want to see Klepierre, our investment in Klepierre appreciate. I mean that's the #1 goal. And I just will say, on the outlet side, that we -- they have no presence in that. That's really not something that they're really going to do, and I would view that as kind of a separate path for us to look at what our opportunities there are in that sector.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Alex Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","It is pretty telling of a French organization to appoint an American to be chairman, so that's a pretty strong statement in and of itself. Question on -- you guys took a major stake in Klepierre and yet when you went to Brazil, you just did a JV with BR Malls. Can you just speak about the opportunity or your thoughts on taking a stake in BR Malls? I mean, speaking to people, there's a lot of respect for BR Malls that the Brazilian market seems to still attract a lot of long-term interest. So sort of curious why you opted for just a more of an asset JV rather than more of a corporate JV the way you did with Klepierre?","David E. Simon","Well, we really didn't talk about that too much, and Brazil is -- I think we want to get our feet wet in Brazil, do it a little bit more methodically. The values there, calling up a tremendous amount, and BR Malls is a big company, okay. And then you get into the currency risk, though it seems that their currency seems to only appreciate versus the dollar, but put that aside. So there's lots of issues there, but we really never got into that kind of dialogue. At this point, we're focused just on building out the outlet, the platform with them.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","So it sounds like it's more of a learning curve whereas you've had many years of European experience, you want to build that experience in Brazil? Is that...","David E. Simon","And I think so, and look, remember we had exposure in Europe. And I almost view this as kind of replacing what we had. Yes, we put a little bit more money in it, but with a better company with better growth, long-term growth prospects even though the world is a little wacky there, a proven organization, lots of optionality on where to take that organization, a way to hedge our currency investment because we can borrow in euros. So there's all sorts of math associated with it that works a little bit easier than in Brazil. Just a quick response. I mean, it's a very complicated question, but just a quick response to your question.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then separate, and along the same lines, your comments, David, were about China were rather tempered about just focusing on one site. Just sort of curious, especially given the recent political scandal over there. Has that made you any more cautious or what is driving your hesitancy about China?","David E. Simon","Well, it's obviously just a big, big market and a very complicated market, but what's driving us, it's very simple. The international brands are just -- they're kicking ass there. And just -- if we can get an outlet built in the right location, we're very confident we can lease it up. And we have, we think, partnered with a good person to partner with. But we still have to prove the math, prove the ability to make the numbers work and all that. And it's just a big complicated market. And they take -- when they like something, they just build it, as you know, right? So supply and demand sometimes is not as thoughtful there as it might be in other more mature markets. So we just got to make sure that we can make money doing these things. So I think doing 1 or 2, thereabouts, is probably the right way to go for us right now.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Steve Sakwa from ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Rick, I guess, just first question, as you're talking to kind of the larger tenants, the Targets, the Costcos and the like, I know you guys have done a lot. You've replaced a lot of department stores and anchors and added. I'm just wondering how much more activity do you think there is from them and, I guess, as you look through kind of the top 100, how many more assets can you sort of touch, meaning, how much more sort of inventory do you think you can sort of touch and put -- and are these tenants also looking at kind of the bottom 100 properties or are they really focused on sort of the top 100?","Richard S. Sokolov","In fact, it's throughout the portfolio. And if you just keep track of what we've done in the 8-K, this quarter, we've got 51 anchors that are being added throughout the various platforms, and that's up from the 30 that we've listed in the fourth quarter '11. And on top of that, we're on another 38 anchors. Target is still looking for opportunities. We're adding them at Coddingtown. We're adding them at South Hills in Pittsburgh. And we have a number of other opportunities that we're discussing with them, but also with a whole range of other potential users. We've added Arhaus Furniture. We opened a new Lord & Taylor. We're opening Macy's at Gurnee. We're opening Last Call Neiman Marcus at Ontario. So it's across the board. And we're working with supermarkets. We're opening Fresh Market at The Falls. We're opening Wegmans in Montgomery Mall in Montgomery County in Philadelphia, Earth Fare in Hamilton. So we're across the board and there's still a great deal of interest and we have opportunities because in a lot of instances, we're moving out weaker anchors and replacing them with stronger ones.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it does seem like it's kind of permeating down into kind of the B mall product as well?","Richard S. Sokolov","Well, it's throughout the portfolio. Again, we don't like to categorize A, Bs and Cs. It's throughout the portfolio. When you look at the scope of what we've been doing and just we've identified every one, you can see it's throughout across the quality spectrum.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Dave, I guess I'll bring up the question because I asked Bobby as well. But just in St. Louis, I mean, I realize the outlet business has been fairly competitive. You've certainly won your fair share of battles in different markets. I'm just wondering kind of what your thoughts are in St. Louis. And is that a situation where only one project gets built, and is it just kind of a race to the -- just kind of the start line here?","David E. Simon","Well, I'm surprised it took that long to bring up. But look, St. Louis is a good opportunity to build  an outlet center. I'll just say this, when we get approvals, we will build an outlet center in St. Louis. We don't have approvals yet. We expect them in the near future, but we will build there. And we're very confident in our ability to lease it and provide a very good return for our shareholders. So we've got to get approvals. That's the only road block that I see in terms of our building the center.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And if I'm not mistaken, I believe there's something on May 9. Is that correct, when you're supposed to get some final approvals, or is it further out than that?","David E. Simon","Yes, let me -- I'll turn that to Rick. He can briefly give you, but we've got -- we're very confident we're going to get approvals, but we still have to finalize that. And then when we do, we're building. So go ahead, Rick, you want to?","Richard S. Sokolov","So there is the hearing on the 9th and the final hearing is on May 21. And then we can start the development at the site.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, David, just lastly, on just kind of other outlets within the U.S. market. I mean, kind of what does the shadow inventory look like or pipeline or potential deals that you might be looking at?","David E. Simon","Yes. Well, look, just briefly Phoenix, as you know, is under construction where, Rick? 60...","Richard S. Sokolov","60% committed.","David E. Simon","60% committed, so that's all systems go. Toronto, there's been a lot of discussion. We're wildly excited about that. That's under construction.","Richard S. Sokolov","60%.","David E. Simon","60% committed.","Richard S. Sokolov","And announced The Bay.","David E. Simon","And announced The Bay, which is a well-known department store there. We think that's important because that will facilitate a lot of the wholesale accounts, so it's all kind of going according to plan. St. Louis and Phoenix both announced a Saks' Off 5th as part of our new development there. We have one site in Florida, which we're finishing approvals there. I'm afraid to didn't mention the city because there'll be 6 guys on sites, so I've got to refrain to do that. But needless to say, we are really excited about that. And that could actually start, Rick, don't you think this year, maybe?","Richard S. Sokolov","Yes, yes. That could start in late this year. And we also have Merrimack Middle East over by Dubai. It's opening on June 14 and it's 100% leased. And we have Texas City that's opening in October. And that's substantially leased and what gets lost...","David E. Simon","Yes, go ahead, that's where I was going.","Richard S. Sokolov","In all the expansions that we're doing in some of the -- that's outlet centers in the world. The outlet -- Premium Outlets is under construction, opening in June of next year. Chicago Premium Outlets, we're expanding. Desert Hills Premium Outlets is starting next month. We are expanding Orlando Premium Outlets, down by Disney to third quarter this year. We're expanding Woodbury. And we're expanding Las Vegas - North Downtown, and that's starting in October of this year. Well, those 6 expansions combined, there are probably 2 or 3 additional new products adding square footage as the most productive outlet centers pretty much in the world.","David E. Simon","We've got -- we're working closely with the town, but Woodbury is really -- could be really exciting. It's the best outlet in the world. And what we're thinking about doing there working, obviously, closely with the town. But assuming we make progress and get some approvals there, I think we take that asset up to yet another level.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Ki Bin Kim from Macquarie.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","This is Ki Bin. Just going back to your acquisition of Klepierre and going back to your comments about corporate level synergies -- not synergies, but sharing best practices and of that sort. I'm guessing the brainpower would shift more from you to them in terms of expertise and best practices. So how do you get compensated for that given that they still technically owning an equity investment and not close to any kind merger [ph]?","David E. Simon","Well, let me say this, we are never too proud to learn from anyone. And in fact, they're a very accomplished company, so I would expect us to learn a lot from them. And I think that's absolutely part of the order. I mean, part of our investment philosophy is we're going to learn a lot from them in terms of how they run the business and operate. And it's all part of being a global company in that you take a little bit of everything that you learn across the world and you make everything you have across the world a little bit better, and that can drive the needle. So I would hope, and I would expect that they could actually show us a few things here. So that's very important that I say that. And at the end of the day, if we can add value there, that's fine too because our shareholders will benefit from our investment. And I mean, that's just part of -- it is a little bit risky to go into Europe right now, so we had to weigh that in a sense against taking on the whole enchilada and what's the best way for us from a capital allocation point of view. So those are the trade-offs. And I think we're satisfied today kind of where we're at.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","I know at a 30% stake, you're still far from an M&A, but is there any sharing of personnel?","David E. Simon","At this point, no, but we do have the ability to add a senior management person to the management board there. And I think that, over time, as we assess what the areas where we could be most beneficial, we'll figure out what that -- who that person might be. And I think that will develop over the next few months. So I do think there will be the opportunity there. We do have our Vice President of International Operations basically coordinating and liaising, I think is the word, right, our activities there. He'll be in the office there, so we would hope to have some input on that kind of basis.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","And just to -- if you clarify one point, I know it's a $2 billion equity investment, but the overall size of the investment is closer to over $4 billion on Klepierre. So could you actually comment on the FFO yield on investment?","David E. Simon","I don't know where you get the -- we look at it as a $2 billion investment.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","Oh, I'm saying if you include the leverage of the company.","David E. Simon","Well, we don't look at it that way. When we're an equity investor, we have $2 billion at risk. We don't have $4 billion at risk, so I'd argue that completely with you. But let's put that aside. Your question, again, I lost it.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","It's back to the FFO yield accretion.","David E. Simon","Well, look, you can do the math. I mean, it's a public company. But it is accretive, certainly, to lower yield given where we -- what the multiple we bought it at versus our multiple and where our cost of funding was for the deal.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of David Harris from Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Are you hedging this in anyway, this investment?","David E. Simon","Yes, we have hedged. Steve, how much have we hedged?","Stephen E. Sterrett","David, we left $1 billion U.S. out on our line dominated in euros, so we're 50% hedged on our equity investment.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And does the prospect of President Hollande sit you [ph] with any terror? I mean, you did make references to the uncertainty, but I think the prospect of a socialist President of France is perhaps a little larger in the...","David E. Simon","You know what, look, why is that different than the U.S., right? So...","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Well, I have heard specifically, David, that there has been talk around the firm -- the French REIT structure coming under attack?","David E. Simon","No, absolutely not. Look, I don't think that, that -- when you look at the properties and how their merchandise is mixed, I'm not -- I don't think that changes the consumer behavior. What's going to change consumer behavior is where the economy goes and whether that's better under Hollande or Sarkozy is up for debate. I'm certainly not in the position to say who's better at what. But what fascinates me about Europe and what they're going through is the one thing that I will say is that with respect to Europe, at least they're tackling their deficit problems. David, you're very familiar with what's going on in the U.K. You can certainly argue it's too much or too soon or however they're doing it, but we're in complete denial here.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","We have the world-reserved currency, which allows politicians to behave as they do here.","David E. Simon","Sure. But at some point, that changes. So look, I'm not losing sleep about the French elections, and in fact, nor the U.S. elections in a sense that I think the economies of both can overcome bad politics. Look at the -- we could argue about the level of recovery, but the fact of the matter is you can't keep the American business environment and the American entrepreneur down. We want to grow, we will grow. And look, I don't view that the French economy all that different.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Back on a more, perhaps, mundane, you've raised the dividend 3 consecutive quarters and that's obviously been pretty impressive. I know it's hard to pin down your tax liabilities and such like as we go forward. Is it reasonable to think we're going to get this every quarter now?","David E. Simon","Well, at some point, not every quarter. We're still chasing our taxable income. So the answer is, at some point, we'll catch up. But I shouldn't really say more than that, other than at some point it will -- we're still chasing it. At some point, we'll catch up, but we're still chasing it.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","I mean, is it any way possible to characterize the growth in the dividend relative to the FFO? I mean, I know it's probably too nefarious at this point to do that. But if you would degrade your FFO by, say, 10%, growth in the dividend is going to be the order of 12% or 13% in the most general terms?","David E. Simon","I mean, there's a lot that goes into it, especially with asset composition changing. But put that aside, I mean the fact is, our earnings are really growing and our dividends really got to grow.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","It's going to grow faster, okay.","Stephen E. Sterrett","It's Steve. There clearly is a correlation between your dividend growth and your FFO growth. It's not a perfect correlation because, as an example, in an acquisition, we may get a step up in assets, which allows more depreciation expense. So you may not have as much taxable income growth as you do FFO growth, but there is a high correlation.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Nathan Isbee from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just actually focusing on the core multiple portfolio. Your sales have been growing double digits quarter after quarter, yet the rent spreads, they're strong but still aren't back to where they were a few years ago. And it's still an uncertain world and you have some tenants downsizing. But what point, given the sales productivity, can you say to the tenants, \"Sorry, we're going to demand rents to reflect the sales progress,\" and see that acceleration in the rent spreads?","David E. Simon","Rick, you want to?","Richard S. Sokolov","Yes. There are a couple of things that are relevant in evaluating the spreads. One, if you look at the growth in our average rent, it has been going up considerably every quarter. Secondly, we are building into our leases annual increases in rent. If you go back historically, before we did that, when a lease expired, you had a much lower base rent because we weren't getting consistent guaranteed bumps in minimum rent over the term of the lease. And that has been a major advantage for us in order to take the risk of tenant performance out of our financial matrix. And when you look at the spreads that we're having, build that in, it's been a considerable benefit.","David E. Simon","And I would -- look, Nate, I would also just add that, look, sales are important, but it -- there is also, I mean, let's face it, everything is going well, we're running the business better. You can always get better, but there's still a number of retailers that are having margin pressure or comp sales pressures. And that puts pressure on our business and so that's why the spreads aren't -- not everybody in the retail world is hitting on all cylinders. And they may have margin pressures which puts pressure. We want them in the center or we don't have backups right away. So there's still -- obviously, our average is really important because of the size and they give you a real good indication. But the reason it's not $8 or $10 is because there is a handful of retailers that are important in the portfolio that are under margin pressures or sales pressures. And instead of just telling them, \"Get lost,\" we're still working with them as they try to improve their business.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","All right. And then just quickly on the Halton Hills. You've only announced one tenant. Can you give us maybe a little more detail on it?","David E. Simon","Sure. Rick will list you some tenants.","Richard S. Sokolov","Yes. We're basically 60% committed now and leases that are going, Banana, Brooks, Cole Haan, Converse, Gap, Levi, Nike, Puma. We talked about The Bay, Under Armour, Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss, Michael Kors. It's going to be an outstanding selection of retailers and we're going to create what is going to be the unique Premium Outlet environment in that market.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So given that tenant mix, another competing center perhaps a few miles closer to Toronto you think people will be willing to drive past to get to yours?","David E. Simon","Well, look, I'm not going to really comment on this other potential site other than to say there are a lot of merits to our site and, Nate, we're opening next year, okay. We don't have to get any approvals, we're done, we're under construction and we'll lease the center, so I don't know what else I can tell you other than that. And you can draw your own conclusions. We're done, we're moving and we have no worries.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line Ben Yang from KBW.","Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","David, going back to your comments on the new players making a push into the mall industry. I'm just curious what you think these newcomers might mean to the small industry longer term given that it's an oligopoly that obviously benefits from fewer, rather than more owner-operators?","David E. Simon","I missed part of your -- can you just restate it because I just -- the connection wasn't that good.","Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just obviously private equity trying to make -- increase their presence in the mall space. It's an oligopoly. Fewer owners are better than more owners, and I'm just curious to get your thoughts on what this might mean to the industry longer term?","David E. Simon","Well, I certainly don't use oligopoly as any -- by any stretch of imagination. I mean, retail, if you want to hear my -- I'll save you a lot of diatribe here, but retail is really competitive. Malls compete with all sorts of retail, online, strip centers, Lifestyle centers. So that may be your view of the world. It's not mine because we -- it is really a competitive industry across the board and it's tough, very tough. So the more the people want to come into the business and put capital into it, I think the better for us. I'm not sure I answered your question. Look, at the end of the day, operating your real estate is -- the key to success in retail real estate primarily is to contract at the sale [ph] office. Has been operating it better versus buying it, right, and then finding the right time that cap rates are x and waiting for cap rates to move in your favor. That's not always the case. But generally, unlike office where it's really more of a potential timing where it can help. So the answer for a lot of those folks is just how do they operate it? And can they operate it effectively? And if they can, maybe they'll make money, which I think is -- which is good. It attracts more capital. Institutionally, and Steve can comment on it, I mean, institutionally, the level of interest from deep money institutional investors in high-quality retail assets has never been higher and price is secondary because they look at the returns -- I shouldn't say price, going in yield is a secondary consideration. It's really the growth of the NOI. And I mean, it's never been higher, frankly. But again, the need for us to look at that source of capital is not critical, but it's never been higher.","Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. But I guess the difference this time is that unlike a passive attention [indiscernible] that gives you guys money. These guys are trying to actual platforms to run their businesses, but that is helpful. But just moving along, you also made comments that the B malls are firming up. I think Rick mentioned retailers are generally opening up across the board. You're obviously always trying to cull the low end of the portfolio. But does this make you maybe more or less inclined to sell your B malls, maybe taking advantage of mall buyers out there, but maybe at the risk of missing the recovery in the B mall space?","David E. Simon","No. Look, I think we're good enough to know what we believe in, in the future and what is better in other people's hands in terms of just a poor allocation of our human resources. And sometimes, it's okay to sell and let somebody redevelop it just because we've got enough to do and we want to allocate our resources elsewhere. So I think we can handle that issue in particular. And I said I like the fact that there's more people coming into that market, might lead to a few more sales from us over a period of time.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Rich Moore from RBC Capital Markets.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","David, on Klepierre, can you buy or build something together in a joint venture given that you guys sit on the board of Klepierre?","David E. Simon","Sure. I mean, it would have to be subject to approval of their board without us participating. But certainly, sure. I wouldn't say -- yes, absolutely. I mean, if we had a development or acquisition and we could certainly partner. It would have to be approved by the board without our involvement, but sure.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, all right. Good. And then, on Del Amo, that has always struck me as very good real estate. I used to live out there in that area. And yet nothing has ever -- nothing seems to ever come on that asset.","David E. Simon","Yes, we know, we know.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I mean, what are you guys thinking there? I mean, what is the plan? You said you were working on a big redevelopment there. What is the idea?","David E. Simon","Well, I'll let Rick start. But you're 100% right. It's been a source of frustration for us. I mean, we were working on some plans when we bought Mills in April of '07, right. Those got derailed by the '09 crunch. They're back up and running. We have real confidence in that. Otherwise, we wouldn't have bought. That was ahead of our bigger deal with Farralon. Rick, this is Contis's baby. He's not here to tell you about it because it might take 10 minutes. But Rick can give you the highlights of what we're doing, and we would hope definitively to really start this thing next year. But let Rick, can give you the high level.","Richard S. Sokolov","Just a couple of bullet points. One, you can change everything about a property other than where it is, and it's in a great, great market that is really underserved by fashion retailing. We've got interest from a couple of fashion anchors. We've got great support from the city and we're looking at a total redevelopment of the property that would substantially change its character by keeping some of the existing anchors, replacing some of the anchors, adding anchors and the best thing is we've got substantial demand from retailers and restaurants. So there's a lot to do. We're spending a great deal of time on it. We have people based out there that are working on it on a constant basis, and we're very optimistic we're going to be able to do it.","David E. Simon","And the only thing I'd say, given the size of the property, it's going to be in a couple of phases. But the first phase we would hope to start in '13.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So this is probably a few hundred million dollars in total, something like that?","David E. Simon","Yes, I think that's probably right.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And do you think we'll get that fashion department store that the previous CEO of Mills promised us about 6 or 7 years ago?","David E. Simon","We'll let you know.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, good. And then a couple quick questions for Steve. Were there any acquisition expenses this quarter? I mean, I can't figure out where they might be. I thought they might be in G&A, but I didn't see anything in there.","Stephen E. Sterrett","They were not, Rich. Under the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, when you make an equity investment, you capitalize those expenses, so they've been capitalized as part of the investment in Klepierre line.","David E. Simon","And I'd just say we have de minimis cost on that Farallon deal that we just put in other expenses.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the percentage rents in the joint venture jumped pretty significantly, and I'm assuming that's because there's more percentage rents in the Klepierre portfolio. Is that right?","Stephen E. Sterrett","There were no -- we did not record any results associated with Klepierre in the first quarter, Rich. So that's organic activity related to the portfolio.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So why would those be so high? They seemed abnormally high. Maybe I'm missing something, but they seemed unusually high.","Stephen E. Sterrett","Well, there's -- we have a number of venture properties in very, very good markets that have been benefiting from the influx in visitors and that's what you're seeing. We've had great sales programs.","David E. Simon","And also that includes the Japan -- some of the Japan expansions and all those are -- in Japan, they're all basically, and in Korea, they're all percentage rent deals. So we've had great success there. The one thing on our...","Stephen E. Sterrett","In fact, that's a good point, David, because part of the results driving the JV line, Rich, are if you remember, last year, was the earthquake in Japan, so we had much better results coming out of Japan first quarter of '12 compared to '11.","David E. Simon","And one thing just to keep everybody in perspective, when I mentioned all these assets, our international outlets on average do about 1,000 a foot. And those are not in the numbers that I stated at the end of my prepared remarks.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Michael Mueller from JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just one question. You obviously have been very complementary of Klepierre, and you seem like you want to be in Europe longer term. So just thinking, what would cause you not to step up and increase your investment over time once the option period becomes effective? Is it just what's going on with the sovereign issues in Europe or is it something else?","David E. Simon","Well, I mean, it's hard to know exactly where we are and what we're doing, but look, I think, as I said to you that what we have done there and what the company, all the assets and intangibles that the company, the company being Klepierre, possess I think just gives us tremendous amount of optionality on the whole of Europe, and we'll see where that goes.","Operator","Your final question will be coming from the line of the Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. Brazil and China, did you guys talk about potential yields on those developments, what that could look like?","David E. Simon","Not yet because we do that once we start construction, but I would say to you, Brazil -- I said it a little bit earlier, I mean, we would expect them to be consistent with kind of mall yields there, double digits. And China, we would expect that to be consistent with our Asian development, which have all been in the mid-teens. But we'll give more clarity to that once we start construction on something.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the Phoenix construction, could you talk about that in relation to Arizona Mills being so nearby, whether that creates any issues in regards to trying to lease up that asset?","David E. Simon","Not really. We view them as 2 separate distinct markets. Arizona Mills is more of an infill project. It's actually weathered the Phoenix situation pretty well, the Phoenix economy pretty well. And we think they'll hopefully be a little bit complementary, and we'd expect given the infill location and the fact that the outlet will probably drive more tourism where Arizona Mills is probably more -- considered more of a regional mall in the sense in terms of less tourism that they'll both be able to prosper as the economy continues to improve.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that's despite the fact that Arizona Mills has a whole bunch of outlet-oriented stores in it already?","Richard S. Sokolov","I think you need to focus. Arizona Mills is almost 1.3 million square feet. It's got a substantial entertainment component with a theater and sea life. It has a number of tenants that are, as David said, regional mall-type tenants. There's a Penney outlet. There's Forever 21, there's H&M. So it really is focused on a much broader market. And while there will be some overlap, it's a relatively small percentage of the square footage in the merchants of Arizona Mills.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it, that's helpful. And then to Klepierre, is the European market dramatically different such that the Simonization process that you guys are so good at in the U.S., is that easily transferable to these assets from generating ancillary income, banner income like all the kind of other things that you kind of established as industry practices here in the U.S. How easy can you really translate that over to their stuff?","David E. Simon","It's certainly more of a challenge than it is here, but we have had some success in our previous European investments in doing that. And what's interesting, it's changed a lot in that the retailers are now much more global than the ones that we deal with in the U.S. and in Europe. So I'm hopeful that it won't be as easy as it is here in doing that. I mean, when we buy something that we don't own, it's a pretty easy transition. There, it's going to take more time, but I think the opportunity exists.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just one more last question. In regards to this question about A malls and B malls, I think they've all been pushing, trying to get confirmation from you that there is demand similar to the B malls. But you don't quite seem to want to confirm that. Just kind of curious one way or another why that's so?","David E. Simon","Well, I think all we said is we don't like to say A or B malls. You know our portfolio. You can decide what you think of it. We like it a lot. And our statistics that we report on each quarter would have to -- given that it's a huge asset base, it would -- the averages are meaningful, and I don't think we could produce these results if only the top end of the assets were producing results. So how does that answer the question?","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Well said.","David E. Simon","Okay. It's hard for me to -- I appreciate the conflict because that's a real challenge sometimes.","Operator","At this time, I'm showing no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. David Simon for any closing remarks.","David E. Simon","Okay. Thanks for your time.

We had a very productive quarter and are pleased with our financial results. Results in the quarter were highlighted by funds from operation of $3.04 per share, an increase of 5.9% compared to the prior year.","Our reported FFO exceeded -- per share exceeded the First Call consensus at the end of the first quarter by $0.10. Adjusting the prior year for the $11.3 million impact of expensing internal leasing cost our FFO per share growth was 7%. We continue to grow our cash flow and report solid key operating metrics.","Total portfolio net operating income increased 1.7% compared to prior year and our comp NOI increased 1.6%. NOI growth was impacted by approximately 100 basis points due to the impact of retailer liquidations and bankruptcies resulting higher bad debt expense, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and slightly and NOI, slightly lower NOI from properties undergoing significant redevelopment.","Redevelopment activity is moving quickly and in some cases, it's moving quicker than we originally anticipated. For example, the transformation of Northgate in Seattle, which was originally budgeted to occur next year, will start this summer with the demolition of the mall. The NOI will be significantly reduced while we begin this massive redevelopment. These types of decisions are in the best long-term interest of the asset and our future growth. Especially when you think about a property like North Gate where we are replacing a majority of the retail with the NHL Seattle Corporate office, practice facility, ice skating facilities for the public as well as significant residential, hotel and office uses.","Leasing activity remains solid, average base minimum rent was $54.34. The malls and outlets recorded leasing spreads of $14.17 per square foot, an increase of 27.3%. Reported retail sales per square foot for our malls and outlets was 660 per foot, compared to 641 in the prior year period, an increase of 3.1%. Keep in mind this growth is on top of a very strong growth throughout 2018, and reflects a late Easter and Passover as well as some recent lackluster tourism spending at some of our tourist oriented centers due to the strengthening dollar.","Our malls and outlets occupancy ended the quarter at 95.1% an increase of 50 basis points compared to prior year. On the outlet business which we continue to drive corporately, we broke ground and it's interesting to note we broke ground on Siam, Premium Outlets in Bangkok, which is our first outlet in Thailand. This center is scheduled to open in the first quarter of 2020. We are also delighted to have received approval to begin construction on our luxury designer outlet in Western Paris located enormity. The center's proximity to Paris, coupled with its affluent fashion conscious local trade area offers significant opportunity for tourists and locals.","Construction actually in May of this year. Queretaro, Mexico in May will open and Malaga in Spain will open in the fall. We will also open a new outlet in Cannock, England in the fall of 2020. So let me just restate this. You're talking Bangkok. You're talking Paris. You're talking Mexico, Malaga, Spain and Cannock, England all because of our corporate resources dedicated to the outlet business and all of these will be thoughtful investments, high return on investment and add to our overall franchise value.","Redevelopment activities are underway at more than 30 properties domestically and internationally across all of our platforms, where we are creating monitored, innovative, live, work, play, stay and shop communities. This includes 10 former department store space, redevelopment projects that are ongoing and we have more than 25 projects in various stages of pre development.","We continue to then supply our centers with the addition of mixed use components including hotels, multifamily office and uses. As examples during this quarter, we started construction on a 430-unit multi-family residence at Round Rock Premium Outlets and construction began on 80 hotels by Marriott at Delano [ph] 177 keys, Sawgrass Mills, 174 keys as well.","Our extensive identified pipeline of more than five billion in new development, the redevelopment opportunities across all of our platforms will fuel our future NOI and FFO growth and reinforce our well located properties.","As many of you know, we're excited to have launched the data version of Shop Premium Outlets and are encouraged by the feedback we have received thus far. This is a unique long term investment for us, which capitalizes on the power of the Premium Outlets brand, our large base of loyal and engaged shoppers and the strong relationships we have with our retail partners.","This is an opportunity to extend our reach, enhancing and deepening our relationships directly with our shopper. We look forward to a full public launch, ongoing cost in the platform. We'll continue with these costs running through our income statement.","Balance sheet, our liquidity at the end of the first quarter was $7 billion. We expect to generate approximately $1.5 billion in cash flow after dividend distributions, which we will use to fund the investment in our development and redevelopment opportunities.","We continue to have the strongest credit profile in the industry, including net debt to NOI at 5.1 times, fixed charge cover ratios of 5.1 times and approximately 95% of our indebtedness is fixed rate, long-term issue rating of A\/A2 and during the quarter, our board of directors also authorized a new common stock repurchase program with $2 billion.","Today, we announced our dividend of $2.05. This is an increase of 5.1% year-over-year. Including this dividend, we have now officially paid over $100 per share in dividends to our shareholders since becoming a public company. Yet another accomplishment that separates us from others. We're also reaffirming our guidance this year in the range of $12.30 to $12.40 per share.","Just in concluding, we produced another quarter of impressive results and operating metrics. We continue to operate our business with a long term view, a focus on cash flow generation, managing each asset as if it's our only asset. Our track record speaks for itself whether it's 1, 3, 5, 10, 7, 6. We have outperformed the industry and earnings cash flow and dividend growth, through the combination of our assets, people, hard work. We expect to continue our industry leading track record.","And we're now ready for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is open","Craig Schmidt","Thank you. Just to clarify what's the Opry Mills settlement in your original guidance of 2020, $12.30, $12.40?","David Simon","Well, Craig we don't give specific itemized guidance. As you know we do give you comp NOI guidance, and I think, it's important to remind folks that every year we have a lot of ins and outs of our company, because of our size. So this year as an example, we expect to have lower lease settlement -- lower lease settlement income from -- compared to last year. We budgeted a higher distribution income from our value retail investment, which we now expect to be lower.","We have a stronger dollar than we anticipated. We're accelerating our vacant anchor and redevelopment program, as an example in Northgate, which does about 15 million of NOI. We're shutting that mall down essentially this year so that's different than our budget. And then obviously, we have some unanticipated bad debt. It's now not called bad debt, but I'll call it bad debt for this quarter because of the -- you know the bankruptcies that occurred in the first quarter.","And then we have certain SPO cost. So as much as you would like us to itemize each and every aspect of our business, we will -- we don't do that. We're a big company. We've got roughly $5 billion of FFO. So, again put that in perspective. We are an earnings machine. That's how we think about ourselves. We obviously knew about the settlement when we gave you guidance. It was disclosed in our 10-K at on February 22, but when we disclose that. But we don't give itemized specific guidance because of the nature of our company is a little bit different than others. And I hope that addresses your question.","Craig Schmidt","Okay great. And then on the leasing spreads that are up 27.3%. Was this impacted by anchor releasing or what drove that number higher?","David Simon","Yes, I think it's generally a mix. We are taking out some less performing retailers, putting in better ones. We're not going to guide necessarily for that, that spread, but we're certainly proud of it. And our mix continues to change. We -- we have felt confident we still have leases that are under market and we expect to continue to post the positive leasing spread.","Craig Schmidt","And then just finally, the month-to-month leases increased. I know this, they did that last year as well. Is there anything that happens seasonally that increases month-to-month leases in the first quarter?","David Simon","Not really. I mean, a lot of -- a lot of the bigger, larger accounts just take some time and that's really all that's ongoing there.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. Well, thank you.","David Simon","Sure. No problem.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeremy Metz","Hey, good morning.","David Simon","Good morning.","Jeremy Metz","David, morning. Going back to last quarter, you were expressing some caution around the closing environment and the bankruptcy that you saw lingering out there. You seem to know that you thought they were going to pick up. We've seen a number of closing announcements since that last call. So just wondering how you're feeling today, looking at what's out there and what still needs to possibly shatter here in 2019?","David Simon","Well, good question, Jeremy. I think it's safe to say that we did anticipate some bankruptcies. We are looking at a few others that we'll see how they -- how the rest of the year shapes up for them. We were a little bit -- a lot of cases when you do run into a bankruptcy, you do see kind of a reward [ph] opportunity. Couple of bigger ones just liquidate it that was different than our plan.","But that's what makes our company unique is that, we\u2019ll take that space back. But that's what makes our company unique is that we'll take that space back, we will lease a lot. And I don't think it will affect the long-term prospects of our cash flow generation, but it's going to take some work this year to balance that. But I think most of the bad news is behind us. I can't guarantee that.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. I appreciate that color. And then just I was wondering if in terms of your tenant sales, and 3% increase, is there any sort of additional detail or just color you can provide across some of your bigger categories here to understand kind of what's helping lift that, and on the other side, what's what's dragging on it right now?","David Simon","Yes, I'd think [Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it's Michael Bilerman. David, I don't know if it's just our line, but your line it sounds like you're at a bad McDonald's drive through.","David Simon","Well, I don't -- it may be your line. I haven't heard that before.","Michael Bilerman","No, no. There you go. Now, now we can hear you. That's perfect.","David Simon","Okay.","Michael Bilerman","Thank you. You talked in your opening comments about the impact to total NOI from the increased bad debt, the foreign exchange. What you're doing at Northgate, which sounds very exciting from an NHL perspective. How much of that impacted the same store 1.6% in terms of -- I know wouldn't be the redevelopment, but I'm sure the store closures and the bad debt may have had an impact, and did that shift at all your view towards the 2% growth for the year.","David Simon","Yes, I think, I said this obviously if I was in the McDonald's drive if you didn\u2019t hear it, but for Northgate has no impact on that. That's in the portfolio NOI number, because it was -- it's going through a redevelopment. The fact is though we had budgeted a lot more NOI through that this year, that's now going to go off line.","So it does affect our overall $12.30 to $12.40 estimate. And I will put that in mind, remember that's $12.30 and $12.40 which I do think is the leading REIT per share earnings, but you would know that better than I would.","And I -- basically the number between the stronger dollar and the extra bad debt expense is around 100 basis points. I did -- I think I said that in my commentary early, but you may not have heard that. So I \u2013 and getting to your question, the 2%. If we felt, we had to back off that, we would tell you today, listen there are no guarantees. But we have a lot of levers in this, in this company and we're going to try to achieve that to our best of our abilities. We felt it wasn't achievable, we would back off it. We are not backing off of it. I would say the biggest unknown is not necessarily future unanticipated bankruptcies, but our average rent always is you know at the -- you know we're at the mercy of retail, retailers and that's a number that we do have a little bit of volatility in it, because of our high producing properties.","So yes. So that's the one element that we watch every quarter and we'll see how it shakes out. But the reality is if we wanted to back off of 2% we would tell you today that we're not at that point.","Michael Bilerman","Right. Yes, I know what threw me off is when we talked about 100 basis points in the opening remarks. You talked about the impact of retailer liquidations and bankruptcies, resulting in higher bad debt, the effects and then the slightly lower NOI from properties going into redevelopment. And so, I took the 100 basis points as being total. And I was trying to get the impact just at the same store pool on that 1.6%.","David Simon","Yes, it covered a little bit of both. But the reality is, the biggest comp NOI situation is because of the foreign exchange rates, and the bad debt.","Michael Bilerman","And you talked a little bit about percentage rents, and that having an impact as things go through the year with all the accounting changes that got implemented this quarter. From a disclosure perspective, you've now rolled everything into the lease income line. Right. So now that has the minimum rents, the percentage rents, has a tenant reimbursements, if often has the bad debt. Can you...","David Simon","Yes. You say we -- we\u2019re not its\u2019 not we talked to talked to our [Indiscernible].","Michael Bilerman","No, I get that. What all the other companies have done is, they've given us a supplemental disclosure. The way it was before in a separate page so that we can still look at the trends of reimbursement, we can look at the trends on percentage rents. We can look at what bad debt was. And so if it's possible. I think I know investors would and certainly from an analytical community we would really appreciate getting the same level information knowing that your face of the income statement furnished to the SEC is going to be the way it is. That you've presented it, but having that supplemental disclosure on each of the line items I think will be helpful as we model the company given the various pieces that do have some seasonality and volatility in them?","David Simon","Well, I appreciate the comment. The reality is, we don't want to necessarily do that. So when the SEC says you can't do that, then you\u2019re asking us to do it. I'm not sure what the right approach to do that is. We take your comments certainly under advisement. For us to say bad debt, when there is no longer a bad debt, is not something we necessarily want to do, but well let's see how this year shapes out, and we're not -- we're certainly open to it, but we don't know what to call it if it's not allowed to be. It's contra revenue as opposed to bad debt expense.","Michael Bilerman","Correct. No\u2026","David Simon","We don't know. It's a little -- it's a little tricky, but you know, we\u2019ll. I do think generally we disclose all the relevant facts of our company. We have an exhaustive 10-K. We have an exhaustive 10-Q. We do an 8-K. I think our industry; the REIT industry does a tremendous amount in disclosure. Much better than many other you know Corporate America. So you know, and again, I always maybe I fail at this Michael, but our company is -- it's just a little different. It's a little bigger. There's more moving pieces. We're more international, we're got more platforms. We have much lower overhead. So it's just -- we're a different, a little different animal, and to get into the nitty gritty detail that you get from all these other companies, we could -- we could argue whether it's really all that material and relevant. So we'll have that discussion for a later day.","Michael Bilerman","Yes, that was just more, so trying to be consistent with what you've provided before, so that we can keep up with the trends that we've modeled the company for the last 20 years on. But happy to follow up off line and share some examples of with you as well.","David Simon","Sure.","Michael Bilerman","Thank you, David.","David Simon","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open.","Nick Yulico","Good morning, thanks. Looking at the development, redevelopment pipeline, yet, you raise the expected yield on that 8%. It looks like it was the new developments that are getting higher yields now. Can you just talk about what's what drove that higher?","David Simon","Well I mean, it changes every, it's just the mix of a little bit. We do as I mentioned to you, we have driven through our corporate relationships, have driven the outlet business internationally. We've got some really good returns on that coming online. And then some of these redevelopments, we're taking back, anchor department stores or are driving that. But it's a mixed number, and it's subject to change quarter-to-quarter. But again, the general theme about our ability to adapt to having accretive return on investment hasn't changed.","Nick Yulico","Okay. And then just going back to the online platform, it sounded like for the Simon Premium Outlet business. I mean, how is that, how is sort of early customer adoption looking there, and it sounds like you're spending money on that, but should we think about that as being additive to earnings this year in a positive way?","David Simon","No. I don't think, it'll generate, you know we expect it to generate FFO losses. I'm not -- as much as I know you want to know the number, I'm not going to necessarily give it to you. Certainly, you know and again, this is one of the things that when we budgeted our initial $12.30 to $12.40 that we re-affirm. We weren't really sure whether or not we were going to get the beta or not. But, we're able to withstand, reaffirm our guidance and withstand those losses even though we got the beta.","So, and we do expect to be you know for public sometime in the next few months. So those losses will go through. I would think in the scheme of our company, we can handle it. It's a long term investment and we continue to be excited about it, and ultimately be an important part of our company and our platforms. But, it's it's early days there. So I can't necessarily make specific predictions other than to say we wouldn't be doing unless we felt confident. But, -- but we'll see.","Nick Yulico","Okay. Appreciate it.","David Simon","No worries. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Good morning. David and Rick. I guess, I was wondering if you could just maybe talk a little bit about the leasing environment. Obviously, it was nice to see occupancy up you know 50 basis points here despite all of the closures and bankruptcies. So just -- what if you sort of think about the pipeline and the activity level, you know how would you sort of maybe stack up the pipeline today versus say a year ago, and kind of the mix of those tenants?","Rick Sokolov","It\u2019s Rick, Steve. Frankly, there are still a great many tenants that are happy to have the opportunity to get in to take advantage of the inventory that we have now, that we haven't had historically. And that leasing interest is frankly accelerating.","And if you think about it, we've got new retail concepts. We still have a lot of retailers internationally, they're trying to come into this market and have significant space needs. We are growing the retailers, because they all have made the decision. They need to have a bricks and mortar presence. And we still have the brand extensions from our existing retailers.","So there is a lot of activity from a lot of different sources, and I think that's reflecting itself in our occupancy and in our spread.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And I guess, David to go back to your comment earlier and this was touched on a little bit about the accelerating sort of opportunities that you have on the redevelopment side. I know you've sort of generally budgeted about $1 billion a year plus or minus. Do you see that number dramatically changing, just given the activity level that you've got or is it sort of on the margin?","David Simon","Yes. I do. I do think you know I do think it's going to increase, but some of the bigger ones that we have ready conceptually of what we want to do. We're still in the midst of planning approval process. So we've got just to take two examples that are jump out at the top of my head, Brea and Stonebridge both in California. I mean are big, big developments, redevelopment I should say with a former share stores that we now control. Those are 300 plus apiece in that range, and that's not, as you know we don't we don't put that in our profile, until we get approval and both internally and obviously with the municipalities there. So, yeah it is. And we are, I mean, we are blowing and going on that front. So generally across the company, we're really, really I'd say as active as we've ever been.","So the answer is, I think it's going to go up. It's a little bit out of our control in the sense not that we don't want to do it, but we have some big ones that are going through the planning process. But, I don't think it'll be 2 billion a year, it could average $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion just to give you kind of an order of magnitude. But it is -- it is active and it hasn't. It's not slowing down anytime soon.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. Thanks very much.","David Simon","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, good morning. Good morning out there.","David Simon","Good morning.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey David. Yes, I'd echo Bilerman's comments on the disclosure. If you get your accounts comfortable with it to break out those line items that were compressed and aggregated would be -- would be helpful. One of your hallmarks has been growing cash flow annually and not you know just presenting the numbers as you grow regardless of -- if you know this quarter it seems more like an anomaly as far as what was going on the quarter between the outsides [ph] Opry Mills on our numbers it looked like NOI was late. I obviously, I can't speak for my peers, but as far as the NOI that's coming off line for the redevelopments, you mentioned that you're not going to guide line by line, but yet we're all looking at you guys making your number. Are there some points here that you can talk about maybe whether there was some onetime items that impacted NOI in the first quarter, or maybe sort of quantify what the NOI impacts are from things coming off line, that help us you know better..","David Simon","Yes. Look, I think I explained that to you. But I'm happy to do it again. I mean, we have -- we have we are. Let me just say this. I think we had a very strong quarter. And our numbers are pretty damn good. But I appreciate, I appreciate your comments. Let me, let me give you a few things just comparing quarter-over-quarter, but also keep in mind, we did lose, we did have a much. And again, it's not called bad debt expense anymore, and I know I know everybody knows that I know accounting. So you know it's not -- it's not, it's not bad debt, it's contra revenue. But we had a much, we had a much bigger bad debt expense than we did quarter-over-quarter. And that's what affected our comp NOI number now.","And I also want to make sure you understand that the Opry settlement is not in our net operating income. Are you clear on that? That's in our other income area.","Alexander Goldfarb","Yes of course.","David Simon","Okay. So, but we also had lower lease termination income from quarter-over-quarter. That was a material number you can basically see that that was around 7, so I'll just give you a couple things. And that's why I think you'd feel a little bit better about what we -- what we produced this year. We had lower lease settlement income, $0.07. We again, we do only and I've made this perfectly clear. I made it perfectly clear last quarter. We as you know we're an investor in Value Retail. We only book. We do not book our pro rata share of net operating income or FFO. We only book when we get cash receipts. So i.e. cost, the cost method of accounting. Are you familiar with that? I am. You are, that was one of my favorite classes. The reality is we had $0.06 lower and you can see that in our 8-K obviously least capitalization foreign exchange. We did dispose of our HBS. You know HBS, Europe operations. You know that's another $0.05, $0.06 you put it all together.","So that that gives you a sense, and kind of what's moving around. And again, that's what we -- that's what happens with the size of this company. And again, I try to -- I try to push people there because that's what happens. But, we did have 7% growth when you take into account, just trying to normalize the new accounting for leasing cost, which is pretty good and in a market that\u2019s dealing with a lot of bankruptcies.","And then as my favorite would say, and I wrote about him once, I don't want to attribute to him but I'll say, not too shabby. Okay. Not too shabby.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then can you just. David, but can you give us some context for the rest of the year, the NOI that maybe coming off line from the redevelopments?","David Simon","Well, it's all in our twelve thirty to twelve forty. And again, what I was trying to explain on Northgate we had budgeted, you know the one thing we're not going to do is budget every mall and show you every mall NOI and it's just -- it's not what we're about. And again, remember to take twelve thirty five times three hundred and sixty three shares outstanding and that's our total rental total FFO. We work and I just give you a simple example, okay. We were budgeting Northgate mall around 15 million of NOI, because we thought the redevelopment of that was really going to start in earnest in 2020.","That 15 million is going away, okay. That's just one example. But I'm not going to get in here about every up and down in our company because we've got -- that's not what people do when you run a big company. Okay. If you have 10 assets or I don't know who does that but that's not what public companies should be talking about. I mean, we have ups and downs on assets every time. And what you said earlier still holds true.","Alexander Goldfarb","You mean that you guys just grow year after year?","David Simon","We're going to grow year after year and we have $1.5 billion positive cash flow after dividends and let's keep that in mind as well.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you for your time.","David Simon","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Caitlin Burrows","Hi. Good morning. I'm wondering if we could talk on the leasing spreads to this quarter they were pretty high. And I guess that's understandable as department store space gets converted to higher rent uses. But I was wondering if you could comment on in line space in particular, how rents trending there? How would you compare in place rents versus market rents for that, I guess subset, but significant subset of your space?","David Simon","Well, again if you look at our occupancy cost we still feel like we have a -- certainly opportunity to continue to drive spreads, and I think that hasn't changed. And then when you add the redevelopment opportunities are getting either the space back for the right price and\/or lease is terminating with these boxes like you know the penny box with King of Prussia where they were basically, I don't remember, Rick, what were they paying a foot five, six\u2026","Rick Sokolov","$5.","David Simon","Five bucks a foot. And we haven't even started on that one. I think there's going to continue to be the rent spreads that we have historically achieved. The environments, obviously there's a little bit more supply due to the bankruptcies. On the other hand, you know and I don't want to overemphasize this, but generally the retail community really values physical retail on one hand. On the other hand an additional hand they are now valuing who the landlord is. Who has the capital to continue to invest and evolve the product, which was the mall business has been doing for year after year, it has been around 60 years and it is always evolved during that period of time and will continue to evolve.","We're in a good spot because one is they want physical retail. It's profitable to them. Two is the landlord today and I assure you this, please talk to whomever you want. You guys have a great system of information at Goldman Sachs. And it could get into the consumer business even more you'll have even more information. Is that the landlord is really, really important. It's always been. But now the ability to invest, the ability to make the products and continue to evolve is really important. We have those attributes. So we have to execute, but that's you know people are going to when they when they look to open to buys and they look to make a bet on it, we\u2019re going to be top of mind.","Caitlin Burrows","Got it.","Rick Sokolov","The only what I think to add, David has been emphasizing the size of our enterprise when we have our -- that\u2019s statistic that millions of square feet of openings. So that's not something that's not a number they can't influence by just one or two transactions. That's a whole lot of transactions and that's a very pronounced trend.","David Simon","And I'm glad you said that Rick. So when I would also say to you is that we don't feel like you know one of the reasons we've grown, the way we've grown is because we've been really decent capital allocators. So I think, Caitlin you'd say that, right?","Caitlin Burrows","Yes.","David Simon","You don't have to answer it. It's not fair. I don't have to say it. You can write whatever you want to write. So don't answer that. So -- and the reality is our size as Rick mentioned also allows us to say, hey, you know we'll just milk this asset because we don't believe in the long term location. So, we can actually be almost scientific. I mean our business is an art not necessarily a science, but we can be scientific about where we want to put our capital because at the end of the day not any one particular asset obviously some are more important than others is not going to make or break our company. So that again gives us the ability to be you know it kind of feeds on itself in terms of why you're a decent capital allocator, because you can be clinical in the sense about where you want to put some doubt. And I hope that makes sense to you.","Caitlin Burrows","It does. Thanks. And then maybe also when we think about comp center NOI, so its 1.6% 1.6% in the quarter. I know when you guys were originally giving guidance you\u2019d pointed out that in 2019 kind of extra additions from development wouldn't be as significant this year. But now you have the growing pipeline, so I guess any commentary you could give on when we -- when you think that redevelopment activity will start to create a larger spread on that total portfolio, NOI growth versus comp center. Could we see that in 2020 or you think it would take longer?","David Simon","No. I think 2020 is good because we have a lot of new developed coming online and I do think you point out very good points in that. We always thought this year was going to be a little muted because we really -- I mean the international outlets do take time. We have a couple opening this year, but most of that's open in 2020. And then we have a lot of redevelopment ongoing. It's opening in 2020. So then you've got obviously the downtime -- when you when you're restructuring a piece of real estate like Northgate then you've got a lot of moving parts about that.","And literally we just made the decision, we were studying the last two or three months and we felt like look if we just go ahead and scrape the center we're going to accelerate the development. That's not great for our earnings this year, but in the long run it's the right thing to do. So, we have a we have a number of those that we just -- we're just going to try to make the right real estate decisions as opposed to short term earnings impact. But yet with all these moving parts, with all the volatility with certain retailers we're still got growth. We've still got a billion five cash flow. We still have the best dividend coverage. We\u2019re still growing our dividend and we're still had growth in our earnings.","With all that said and our new investments in SPO [ph], I mean we're going to -- we're trying to land the plane at the $12.30 to $12.40 range which as my friend, not a friend. he doesn't know me but I feel like I'm a friend, not too shabby. ","Caitlin Burrows","Okay. Thanks for that.","David Simon","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Rich Hill","Hey, David. I saw you bought back some shares this quarter. So I was hoping you could maybe give us some color about how you think about that relative to the various different capital allocation choices, decisions that you've mentioned previously on the call?","David Simon","Look, I think we have that flexibility if there's weakness in the stock, we\u2019ll get active. We've been \u2013 we did it in 2017 and 2018. It\u2019s certainly, we feel like it's a good investment and investing in our company through share buybacks is a real opportunity. And that's why we've got it. We had run out of our authorization and that's why we got -- that's why we got reauthorized. So, I expect it to be in our arsenal this year and if there's weakness in the stock well we're going to be active.","Rich Hill","Got it. And then one modeling question. It looks like in 1Q 2018 and other income, you had some distributions from other international investments which maybe were not included in 1Q 2019. Is that something that we should expect to come in 2Q or 3Q or was that a one-off event in 1Q 2018?","David Simon","Yes. Look, this is associated with our investments and value retail. That's one of these things that we have. I said it earlier but I'll just restate it more succinctly I hope. We cost account or that. So we only book cash income when we actually get this dividend or distribution, technically it\u2019s a distribution from the business. Last year we -- that was all associated in the first quarter. We had budgeted number this year. It looks like that number maybe, we may have over budgeted. So, but again it's a little bit harder for us to budget. So, we took our best estimate. Unfortunately it's coming in lower not because anything is going on with the business. It just -- that's just -- we're not in control of that situation. So, we don't anticipate that coming in like you're going to see that in Q3 or Q4 or Q2. So, and that's all associated, that distribution income is all associated with our interest in value retail.","Rich Hill","Got it. Okay. That's it for me. Thanks you. That's very helpful.","David Simon","Thank you. Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jeff Donnelly","Good morning. David, just since you're talking about capital allocation, I'm curious where is external investment, whether that's another malls, platforms or even I guess financing other malls that you might not own, fall on the spectrum of that allocation considering that your redevelopment pipeline is around 7% to 8% return. Do you give much consideration to that these days?","David Simon","That's a good question. The reality is nothing has peaked our fancy at this point. I wouldn't rule it out but it's, honestly we looked at a few things, not again corporately but just the asset here or asset there. Nothing has really peaked our interest, but that's still -- we're still looking at individual assets here and there. And there could be one or two that we would add to the portfolio, Jeff. So it's still there. We're fortunate enough to be in a position where we could do that. We do have people that approaches to do stuff and if it's really good long term real estate fairly priced I mean I think we would have an interest but it's not -- we're not, I'd say we're not active, that active but it's -- I wouldn't rule it out. But we're not that active.","Jeff Donnelly","Do you feel you're better served by waiting? You certainly have one of the better balance sheets, better liquidity if anyone out there in the public markets and probably private markets and access to capital is certainly key right now. Do you think you're value propositions get better the longer you wait?","David Simon","That's a good question. I don't -- what do you think? Some days I wake up saying I should wait, other days, I don't know. The answer is I don't really -- it's a tough one to say. I think we've been doing the right stuff, but we're happy to take input.","Jeff Donnelly","I'll hold off on that a little bit. If I could maybe for old times sake direct one toward Rick? Is it -- some of the other retail REITs out there have been saying that the challenges in the volume of tenants coming in the front door, it's the flow leaving out the back. I'm just curious with Sears and the Sears filing behind us if you will as an industry, do you think Simon has seen the peak of unanticipated tenant loss, the ones that surprise us all whether you manage that is square footage loss or rent loss. Is that all in the rear view mirror or do you think this is sort of a plateau we're going to operate at for a little while?","Rick Sokolov","David mentioned it earlier, we would hope that we'd have seen the vast majority of the fallout from the over-levered retailers that just liquidated. You can never say there isn't going to be somebody else out there that goes, but we're making very good progress in releasing the space. We are getting back and we still have very good demand then. The bottom line is our properties are getting better and better, there's $1.5 billion that we're talking about. We're adding great tenants, we're renovating properties, we're adding amenities. We are making this portfolio better and more attractive to retailers. So I think we benefit in the long run from what's going on because our properties are getting stronger and others may be getting weaker.","Jeff Donnelly","And actually, the last question for you David. Can you talk about the costs you see with the shoppremiumoutlets.com website and is that just merely a referral site to your retailers or are you guys engaging in fulfillment there?","David Simon","Well, it's early days. Ultimately, I can't predict exactly all the services that that this business will provide. And no, unfortunately I cannot give you the cost, other than the cost of this is now again another thing when we budget our numbers we weren't really sure whether we\u2019re going to get to better or not and ultimately operating. We're now doing that. And it's kind of been in our estimates, but I can't -- I'm not going to itemize it at this point. At some point we anticipate we will, but in the meantime we're just going to accept the burden in our overall corporate numbers.","Jeff Donnelly","Thanks guys.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Mueller","Hi. Good morning.","David Simon","Good morning.","Michael Mueller","Just curious how well is the bottom quartile of the portfolio holding up when you think of sales, spreads, NOI growth. Is it close to the average or is that a big gap?","David Simon","It's everything is an asset by asset. Again, you've got to look at the asset in its trade area and what's going on with that trade area. I mean there are a couple of malls where we've had the department store closures. It's interesting, we've actually seen a small shops pickup from that, but it could put -- maybe there were leases in those from the department stores so those no longer are generating income.","So I would say when we look at sales and everything else, there's no absolute trend that you can put a finger on and they're still holding their own. We have a big portfolio. There's always going to be a couple of assets that that put pressure on, put pressure on us, but we've been dealing with that for since I've been here that's just 30, let's see what years?","Rick Sokolov","Its over 19.","David Simon","Okay. So that's only 29 years. Rick\u2019s has been doing it for 63 years. I'd say, he started this when he was five, so, it would be a lot more fun. So, I mean we always have assets that put pressure on us and we figure out how to deal with it. But a couple of them where you had a couple of department stores close at the same time. Yes, they are little bit more of a pain in the neck.","Michael Mueller","Okay. But it doesn't sound like there's a broad based large gap once you had a certain sales level toward the bottom?","David Simon","No. It's really. It really is an asset by asset, and what -- is it the only mall in that trade area and all the typical real estate stuff.","Michael Mueller","Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Barclays. Your line is open.","Linda Tsai","Hi. The line item that you call bad debt expense isn't really bad debt expense? You said it was up a bit quarter-over-quarter. Do you think 1Q is the higher, could 2Q to be higher and when would it start to see improvement?","David Simon","Well, technically it's now called a contra revenue number. So I'm not -- we don't -- we had an anomaly in Q1. We don't expect that to happen the rest of the year. So I don't know if that answers your question, but we did a much bigger contra revenue hit to our revenue this year \u2013 this quarter versus certainly last quarter and our expectations of that are to decrease.","Linda Tsai","Okay. And then when you look at some of the advances that Amazon is making, most recently the availability of one day Prime shipping up from two days, do you think this \u2013 do you see this is having a meaningful impact is driving more market share shift? Some analysts have discussed the idea of shipping elasticity faster you get something the more you buy. I'm just wondering if you have thoughts about this?","David Simon","Well, I mean there's -- and that's a big question lots of lots, I don't want to talk about one particular company, but that's a big question and probably I\u2019m happy to talk to you about online. I do think from a society environmental point of view we should be thoughtful about this drive for, what is it do to our environment? What does it do to our infrastructure to drive this one day shipping to whomever does it. And I don't know. We'll have to see what happens. I think our retailers do generally have a real significant advantage with the footprint that they have because the bottom line pickup in store doesn't cause extra transportation and environmental cost. It already exists and it does -- the consumer does want convenience and speed and it seems to satisfy that desire. So, we'll see how that offsets against the one day shipping. But I don't really have any other comment than that.","Linda Tsai","And then final one; how do you feel about the retail environment in the U.K? What are some of the similarities or just similarities you see with the U.S. right now?","David Simon","While in the U.K, we're only in the outlet business. And right now with the pound it's actually pretty decent. So, we don't have any pull price in England and with the pound a little bit weaker tourism, okay, we're building a new center there that we think will be good. I mean, there is some trepidation from retail commitments on the new stuff. But long term we don't expect any real inability to lease outlet up.","Linda Tsai","Thanks.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of in Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim","Good morning. So, talking about your shop Premium Outlets platform it's an interesting idea and there's probably a lot of upside from data analytics to the fees or just being more involved in the ecosystem. So, a couple of questions. One, how the demand pipeline looking from other retailers wanting to sign on? And second, while there is kind of interesting single interface in the backend piping is actually at nine different retailers that are funneling up their different systems and shipping methods to SPO. And for example if I'm a customer that want to buy one thing from each retailer, I would get nine different packages and pay potentially nine different shipping fees. I realize this is just a beta version, but longer term how do you think about that? And do you to offers kind of singular shipping and make it really work?","David Simon","Well, I think, listen, you can't -- when you build something it's like building a shopping mall. When you build something, you know what that mall is today maybe something what it is it's going to be different five years from now. So I think we -- that's how we're thinking about that. And I think all the great Internet companies and startups and all of the new technology companies have all started with one product, one idea and then morphed into several. I mean obviously you can look at Amazon, Google as prime examples about where they started and where they end up. You can look at we works. You know they call themselves we company now because they go in different directions. So I think you have to put that -- we're not even close to those companies, but we have to think about our product just along those lines and that we start somewhere as we get traction we add to it.","So in direct response to your questions I will say we're adding more retailers. We do have a universal shopping cart. And yes you're right, we're not in the fulfillment business today but one day we could be, one day we could be doing it from the mall or the outlet. So we'll have to see how it transpires. But it is early days. And I think the retail receptivity has been rewarding otherwise we wouldn't have started. If the retailers hadn't expressed an interest in our product, we would have killed it couple years ago.","Ki Bin Kim","And you bring up an interesting point about the Internet companies, but they're also kind of bound by a different set of rules versus Simon, I mean I think it feels like the focus is on lot more revenue than expenses, almost like 90-10. But for your company, a cash flow driven company, the markets probably are a little bit more hesitant to allow you to express losses for the sake of kind of a longer-term revenue potential. So how do you, how do you think about that dynamic?","David Simon","Well, I guess, I guess what I would say to you is there is nobody that values cash flow more than me. And I think you know that, right? So we're getting into this business, it's got -- we're going to invest in it like we invest in our real estate product. If we thought -- and I -- there is no guarantees. You're right, it could, maybe we don't find the secret sauce, maybe we don't get the consumer buy and maybe this maybe that. But there is nobody that values cash flow more than, more than me. And we've got enough of free cash flow that is to build this platform and see where it goes, and if we, if we're not successful then we're big people and we'll go on to the next. In the meantime, we're not going to risk the company. It's not make or break, it's -- I don't want to say it's on the margin, but this is what we do, we invest in our products and this is just another produc.","Ki Bin Kim","All right. Thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan with BTIG. Your line is open","Jim Sullivan","Okay. Thank you. David, not to beat a dead horse, but I just want to be absolutely clear in this, when you have the insurance recovery out of the operating mills this quarter, I think you made it clear, but I just want to confirm that those recoveries are not in operating income, right?","David Simon","That\u2019s correct.","Jim Sullivan","Okay, good.","David Simon","It's absolutely correct. And by the way, it wasn't a recovery. Well, it was a recovery, but we had to actually litigate to get the recovery. So it was a settlement of the lawsuit, but that is not in our net operating income to be absolutely clear.","Jim Sullivan","Okay, good. Thank you. Second question. You've talked and written for a couple of years about kind of the industry issue about over-levered private equity owned retailers and how they conduct their business and how it's really not been good for your business.","It appears, and I don't know maybe Rick can chime in on this, but the so-called digitally native retailers that some quarters have written a lot about appear to be in the early stages of doing a series of IPOs, we'll see if they're successful, but a few of them who I think are in your centers are talking with underwriters and we may be entering a phase where the next phase of capital formation in terms of who's company in the front door as opposed to who is going out the back door.","Maybe a group of well-capitalized maybe profitable maybe not, retailers who are going to raise a significant amount of capital in the public market, we'll see if that develops. But I'm just curious from your standpoint, do you regard these this new retail, this new development of retailers as a material source of incremental demand or not?","David Simon","Well, I would generally say yes, but I think we're early days in it. I don't expect suddenly a 60 store or a 100 store expansion from the folks, but I do think -- and with all the -- with all of the changes that have occurred in our industry and with all the changes that have occurred in corporate America, I will say this, the entrepreneurialism, the idea, the ability to get something funded, the idea to create a new concept has never been greater. That's terrific for us. We want to nurture those. In fact, we're not opposed to helping those folks grow their business and in some cases we'll invest in that.","There is nothing -- I'm not saying that it wouldn't be great not to -- people -- I don't necessarily love people shopping online, Jim, as you might imagine, but this technology has allowed just a lot more entrepreneurs to get started. And I think that's terrific and we're embracing that and trying to help them in every way we can and I think it's good. Are they at the point now where they're going to do a 100 stores a year, no, but in some cases 20, 30, 40 stores. Rick, I don't know if you want to add?","Rick Sokolov","The other thing that I would say and it's sort of related but different; there have been several announcements about companies spinning off various businesses. Historically what we have found is when these new businesses are formed their first call is to ask to figure out how they can grow that business because now they have a dedicated management team and dedicated source to capital and a much more focused growth strategy because there are standalone business and that there is something that going on right now that I think is going to augur well for us in the future as well.","Jim Sullivan","So green shoots, but not maybe material element at this point?","Rick Sokolov","There is activity and we're taking advantage of it and it's more than isolated instances. I mean we're working with scores on these retailers online and they are all agreeing that having a bricks and mortar presence is an essential component of their overall offering. So that is a very good thing and we're taking advantage of it because they're going to the better properties which we have.","Jim Sullivan","Okay. Very good. Thanks guys.","David Simon","Thank you, Jim.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Wes Golladay","Yes. Good morning, everyone. I just had a quick follow up on Jim's question and we talked about the digitally native tenants, but are international tenants coming to the U.S. a bigger portion of the leasing versus the digitally native? And then who is driving the majority of the shop lease, and is that still the existing tenants?","Rick Sokolov","Well, international tenants think about international, H&M is an international tenant, Zara is an international tenant, Uniqlo is an international tenant. These, all -- these tenants all have substantial space needs and are looking to have the United States become a major market as part of their global footprint. So they're a much more significant source of demand right now than the online retailers.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then the existing, I guess the leasing you're seeing right now, is it still more domestic tenants or is it the International tenants actually exceeding those right now in the open to buys?","Rick Sokolov","It's hard to say in terms of comparing the two. They both have significant demand and that's been reflected in our occupancy.","Wes Golladay","Okay. Thank you very much.","David Simon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hong Zhang with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Hong Zhang","Hey guys. Two quick questions from me. I guess number one, are you still expecting any business interruption insurance from Puerto Rico? And would you be able to provide what the sales per square foot number is on an NOI-weighted basis?","David Simon","Yes. On Puerto Rico, no. And then on the NOI-weighted number is sales $8.42.","Hong Zhang","Do you know what it was last year, 1Q 2018?","David Simon","[Indiscernible]","Hong Zhang","Okay. Thank you.","David Simon","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Omotayo Okusanya","Yes, good morning. Just along Ki Bin's line of questioning, I just wanted to focus on XPO a little bit. First of all I wanted to -- if you could just remind us what economics of that business is in regards to what kind of deals you strike with the retailers when someone actually does buy a product through the site? And then second of all, also wanted to understand the competitive advantages of the platform in regards to what stops one of your competitors from doing a very similar thing?","A - David Simon","Well, okay. Well now the answer is we're not -- we get a percent of revenue, and just like we get in our in our leases today. So it's very similar. We get very much what marketplace driven internet side would get. We get a percent of revenues. Our competitive advantage and I'm sorry, I kind of you know we have great premium outlet portfolio, where the consumer knows what we stand for in that business, both internationally and domestically. We had terrific CEO relationships at the retailers across the board. We're known in through our Simon Venture Group and we're known in the technology space. We've got personal investor relationships throughout. We have the wherewithal to make the investment. And it's a little more complicated about why we chose initially outlets versus malls. I don't really want to go through that. But, I do think we have competitive advantages that a few have. But, I guess somebody could try and do it, but we'll see.","Omotayo Okusanya","But there's nothing contractually that prevents a retailer from signing on to a similar platform, if someone else tried to do it?","David Simon","No, not at all.","Omotayo Okusanya","Great. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","David Simon","Yes, no worries. Thank you. Okay. I think that is the last of the questions. So we appreciate all the comments, questions and input and we'll talk you soon. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

Presenting on today's call is David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

We had strong results to wrap up a very good year. Our FFO for 2017 was $11.21 per share which includes a $0.36 charge for the early redemption of our senior notes. On a comparable basis full year FFO per share was $11.57 an increase of 6.4% year-over-year which without question will be at the high end of our peer group.","To put our FFO per share in perspective, the $11.21 is more than $4 billion in total funds from operation which is the highest amount we've ever reported and the highest in the industry. Through active portfolio management, disciplined investments, relentless focus on leasing and property management operations, our annual FFO has increased almost $1 billion since we completed the spinoff of Washington Prime Group less than four years ago, yes $1 billion.","We have achieved a compound annual FFO rate of 8% over the last three years and more than 12% over the last seven years. Our growth rate has outpaced the growth rate of all equity reached by more than 400 basis points over the last seven years and has been more than double the rate of earnings-per-share growth for the S&P 500 over the same time period.","For the fourth quarter FFO per diluted share was $3.12 an increase of 7.2% year-over-year on a comparable basis and as a reminder our fourth quarter results were impacted by the closure of our two Puerto Rican centers due to continuing restoration efforts of those centers. We continue to report solid operating metrics and growth of cash flow.","Our malls and premium outlets occupancy at the quarter ended at 95.6% an increase of 30 basis points compared to the occupancy at the end of the third quarter. Our ending occupancy was impacted by the bankruptcies processed during the year as well as some of the new space we added to the portfolio from our new development and expansion openings.","Leasing activity remained solid and improving. Average base rent was $53.11 up approximately 3% compared to last year and the mall and outlet recorded leasing spreads of $7.42 an increase of 11.4%. Reported retail sales per square foot for our portfolio were $628 compared to $614, an increase of 2.3%. Total portfolio NOI increased 4.5% for the year or more than $265 million, and comp increased NOI increased 3.2% for the year 2.2% for the fourth quarter. On an the NOI weighted basis our operating metrics were as follows; retail sales - reported retail sales on an NOI weighted basis would be $779. Occupancy would be 96.3% and our average base minimum rent would be $68.97.","We opened five new developments in '17 totaling 1.9 million square feet, which are promised to be really good additions to our portfolio. In the U.S. we opened Norfolk Premium Outlets; The Shops at Clearfork in Fort Worth, Texas. Internationally we opened Siheung Premium Outlets in South Korea; Genting Highlands Premium Outlets in Kuala Lumpur and Provence Designer Outlets in obviously Provence, France.","Construction continues on two new outlets in Edmonton Canada and Denver, Colorado, used to be called the Intermountain region for the call and they'll open in the spring and fall of this year respectively. We've also started construction on two international outlet projects in Mexico and Malaga, Spain and both of these are expected to open in the fourth quarter this year.","Transformational redevelopments and expansions at our marquee properties continue adding a total of 635,000 square feet including La Plaza Mall in place of a former Sears store. Other expansions include The Galleria in Houston the second phase of The Shops at Riverside Woodbury Commons, Allen Premium Outlets and Roermond Designer Outlet in the Netherlands. We will also complete major redevelopment expansion projects this year at some of our most productive properties including the Aventura Mall, the redevelopment at Town Center at Boca, and the Toronto Premium Outlets expansion.","In addition we expect to begin construction this year on a number of transformational projects where we will replace department stores with significantly more productive uses at Phipps Plaza, King of Prussia and Southdale Center. As a reminder, we expect to fund these redevelopments and expansions and densification projects with our internally generated cash flow after our ever increasing dividend.","Now, let me talk about the fourth quarter. We acquired and gained control of 12 Sears Stores in our portfolio. We acquired the 50% interest from Seritage in our JV of five Sears Stores and they are included Brea Mall, Burlington Mall, Midland Park Mall, Ocean County Mall, and Ross Park. As part of the transaction Sears announced these five stores will be closing in the next few months and we will begin redevelopment shortly thereafter.","We have now acquired the right to terminate five leases, existing leases of Sears Stores at the following locations; Broadway Square, Cape Cod Mall, Northshore Mall, South Hills Village and Tacoma Mall and we also bought two Sears Stores at Stoneridge shopping Center and Wes Town Mall.","Turning to the capital markets of course we were active continuing to lower our borrowing cost. We issued $2.7 billion of new senior notes with an average term of just under eight years 7.9 to be accurate at a weighted average coupon of 3.07% and retired $2.6 billion of senior notes saving 60 basis points. We amended and extended our $4 billion dollar revolving credit facility and lowering our pricing grid at the same time and towards in 2022. We completed 20 mortgages totaling 2.9 billion which our share is 1.8 at an average interest rate of 3.37% and the term is 6.7 years. Our liquidity ended the year at approximately $8 billion.","We continue without question having the strongest credit profile in the REIT industry, in the entire world, we ended 2017 with a net debt to EBITDA of 5.5 times. Our interest coverage ratio was 5 times and we continue to have an A and A2 rating which we actually think is under valuing our credit. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever providing us with superior operating financial flexibility to continue to create long term value for our shareholders. And I reiterate this is a distinct advantage that continues to be overlooked by the market.","Dividend, we paid a record dividend in 2017 of $17 or $7.15 per share and achieved a compound annual dividend growth rate of more than 11.5% over three years and more than 15% over the last seven years and today we announced our first quarter dividend of $1.95 per share for this quarter and year-over-year increase of 11.4%.","Now turning to guidance and we're ready for your questions, our guidance range is $11.90 to $12.02 per share. This represents 6% to 7% growth rate compared to our 11.21 we reported. Our range is based on the following assumptions; portfolio, NOI growth about 3%. No planned acquisition or disposition activity. Interest rate and foreign exchange rates based on current consensus and a continued share count - diluted share count of approximately 350 million shares.","We are now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Caitlin Burrows","Hi, good morning.","David Simon","Good morning.","Caitlin Burrows","Good morning. Since 3Q earnings, we all know that M&A has been in the headlines for the industry and you didn\u2019t touch on it in the prepared remarks. So I was just wondering, well first, as far as we know you didn\u2019t put in a counter bid for Westfield and GGP, so I think your stock might be lower based on conversations we've had.","But second, you said in the past that you're out of the big deal business and my question is more just around why, what's different now versus in the past when acquisitions like [indiscernible] DeBartolo and Prime made sense, is it that the math doesn\u2019t work out at current share price, could it work with more leverage, but you don\u2019t want to go there? Is it operation where you get less out of it than in the past? Just wondering what's different now versus in the past?","David Simon","Well, I means that's \u2013 I think I need a written, I need that listed in a written way that I answer all of them. Look, I think, here's what's ironic and funny about all this M&A activity. The market was dying to have a mark on a portfolio. Okay? Dying. Well, my God we don\u2019t know what the value of regional malls are. Unibail as you know has agreed to acquire Westfield and they did it at a very healthy evaluation and yet the market yawned on it.","So I just find the whole thing ironic. We continue to be out of the big deal business. We're not involved in any of the activity there. And your best asking you know those participants how they feel about it. We've got a lot to do to continue to grow our company. Nobody has our growth, I mean high to sit back and think about we grew our FFO, we spun off by the way with WPG I think if I remember right about $200 million of FFO more or less.","We made a billion two back and did not with a lot of M&A activity frankly. So we've got a lot to do. We don't need to do anything. I think all of this activity reinforces the strategy that we've had that I think scale in any and all industries is important. Our balance sheet is underappreciated. I think if you look at the Unibail Westfield transaction and compare their debt to EBITDA and compare to ours at 11.5 to 5.5 with the same ratings, you will see the amount of firepower that we have.","But right now that firepower is on the sidelines and we're not involved in any of the activity. But anything that we do I'm pretty sure that will add value to including, you know including you know buying, remember when the market puked all over Rio [ph] Postell [ph] I am happy to tell you it had a record year OPCO [ph] did over $40 million of EBITDA. We bought it for 1 times cash flow and it's alive and kicking.","So you know, whatever we do we're hoping to add value to and we wouldn\u2019t do a transaction including any redevelopment or development that wouldn\u2019t add value to, but the market's got it's mark and I think the market should be pleased that it's got its mark.","Caitlin Burrows","Thanks for that and I guess just on that topic of staying on the sidelines, I just want to hear your thoughts on does that mean though that Simon as the company is still in touch with discussions that are going on, deals that are occurring and it's a deliberate decision to stay in the headlines? I've heard some concern from others that by staying in the sidelines Simon might be missing out on some rare opportunities. So I just want to hear your take on how I'm assuming that's not actually the case?","David Simon","Well, again I say we're not active, but I can and that's activity, but I would venture to say we typically be, we're typically buyers when no one else is, and we're typically not buyers when everybody else is. And that's just the way it's been and that's why we have $12 projected this year of earnings which is way ahead of everybody. That's why we have the balance sheet that we had that's way ahead of everybody. And you know we're a little bit different than most. I hope you accept it and appreciate it.","Caitlin Burrows","Got it and then just one on a different topic if I could. You mentioned the firepower that you guys have in terms of your balance sheet. Just looking at your development pipeline, the portion that's in process now, it is down from last year and the year before. So I was just wondering what the outlook is to getting this up again? I know you mentioned a few upcoming transformational projects that would suggest that they weren\u2019t yet in process as of the end of the year or is that the amounts that have been completed just haven't been able to be replenished?","David Simon","Well, look we - for whatever reason we don't put a \u2013 you know we don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know, the word fabricate is a bad word, but we don\u2019t put our shadow pipeline in numbers. What Tom does is show you what deals we've approved and basically are under construction. So as an example, the Sears transaction that I spoke about, none of that redevelopment activity is in that number, nor is Phipps, or is King of Prussia you know and I'll go down the list.","So what we do is we tell you the truth. When we approve it and we're about to spend money on it and it's been approved by our appropriations committee, it goes into the 8-K and we spit it out to the market. We don\u2019t think we need to do a shadow pipeline because you know I don't know it's a waste of energy to try and do it. We have plenty to do and we'll be as aggressive as ever, but on the other hand one of the hallmarks of our company is our return on investment and return on equity, because without that you can't grow your earnings.","And we are about growing our cash flow. Cash flow growth leads to dividend growth which ultimately or discounted cash flow model leads to more value in the company. Operating metrics do not. Okay? Operating metrics do not. What leads to valuation growth in my opinion and certainly in the real community there may not, may be not as a technology area, but is cash flow growth, return on investment, and you know, so I - so the long answer to your question is, we have a lot to do and a lot of these projects are in the process of being finalized in terms of scope, scale, pricing. And once we formally approve it, it feeds into our 8-K and you'll see that number go up.","Caitlin Burrows","Got it, thanks for that and yes I work hard. If you want know that I noticed that the rate of return did increase to 9% so that's great to see. Thank you.","David Simon","Thank you, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Spector","Good morning, it's Jeff Spector here with Craig.","David Simon","Hi guys.","Jeffrey Spector","Hi, good morning. Just a clarification on the guidance. I believe David, you said that portfolio NOI growth over 3%. Can you provide a little bit more detail on that? Is that \u2013 that's not same-store correct that you're just talking about the prior\u2026?","David Simon","That is not same-store, same-store the way we define it will be slightly less than that. We're trying not that I want to like name companies, I've already named one. It's probably not a good idea to keep doing it. But we want \u2013 you know we see what others do like Federal where you focus on the NOI growth.","We're trying to get you know as our company gets bigger, you know the impact of the expansion and a new project becomes less and it's easier for us to describe it just in terms of our total portfolio NOI so we're trying to get folks to start thinking about like that like they do with federal and again I'm not criticizing great company. I'm jealous, much higher multiple, and it seems to like the way they do it and so we're focused on that. But it will be slightly less than the 3% based on our numbers today.","Jeffrey Spector","And can you provide any of the details behind that in terms of let's say occupancy expectation or\u2026?","David Simon","We are doing it exactly the way we did the last year and one year after. We do not provide leasing spread forecast. We do not provide the occupancy forecast. We've never done that Jeff and I have no real desire to do it. You know, again we can - we can - we can just be obsessed with metrics, I'm obsessed, we're continuing to grow our company, make our company better. I'm not obsessed with metrics and I think unfortunately you know we can - we can get into that the rabbit hole. But the reality is I'd encourage you to look at $12 compared to the peer group, look at our multiple, look at our dividend yield and then come up with your investment recommendations.","Jeffrey Spector","Okay thanks. I think Craig has a followup.","David Simon","Sure.","Craig Richard","I just want, great \u2013 I just wondered as the project is changing in some degrees that lets you go from 7% to 9% in the stabilized returns for the malls?","David Simon","There's always a mix change. We are excited. You know, and again Craig, we are - we are excited about, you know the redevelopment efforts that we've got on the drawing board, you know from Phipps to King of Prussia to the Sears transaction. So there's going to be, I can't tell you how excited we are to get, you know to get these spaces back, where the media likes to make it as the beginning of the end, we think it's the rebirth. Okay?","And I can't tell you how excited we are to continue to do our - you know, our varied redevelopments. You know the biggest issue for us is just managing all the activity. It's not from an investment point of view. You know, again if you look at our business, people can grow their company if they increased their leverage. Right?","Now technology companies, if you looked at their quarter-to-quarter increase in debt you'd be really surprised by how much you know maybe they are buying growth, we're actually trying to keep our balance sheet relatively flat because we know that there's a lot to do. So in that sense if you look at our net debt it's relatively flat year-over-year which is still kind of remarkable given that we've had all this activity.","Richard Sokolov","And Craig I would just say, you just followed our NOI has been increasing every quarter, projects roll off and new ones roll on. The beauty of our redevelopment positioning is that we are able to manufacture new redevelopment projects to continue to enable us to grow our cash flow.","Craig Richard","Great, and then just of the 12th that you have started did you gain control, how many will be under construction in '18?","David Simon","Well, that's hard to say. I mean we still have permitting to go through. So I \u2013 let's put it this way, all of these are well advanced in terms of plans and we're all through \u2013 we're going through the permitting process, but I would hope to begin a handful this year.","Craig Richard","Okay, great, thanks.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Michael Mueller","Yes, hi. Good morning. I have three questions here. I guess first, what was the NOI weighted weakened spread compared to the 11.4% you reported? Second, can you kind of talk about 2018 store closure expectations versus what we saw last year?","And then third, it's little bit more of a technical question, curious why the Edmonton Outlets are considered a Mills project on the supplemental as opposed to an Outlet project?","David Simon","Well, I'll try to take them in the reverse order. So it's basically, if you know [indiscernible] they basically own the Mills up in Toronto, Vaughan Mills. They built one in Vancouver, South Vancouver. And if you look at Edmonton it's really enclosed. It's got a lot of the big boxes and it's really more of a mills type of physical product than it is in outlet center where the outlet centers tend to be open air and village settings.","So it's got \u2013 I don\u2019t know off the top of my head, but 12 to 13 boxes at least, you know similar to what we would have here in our mills and what they would have there up in their Canadian mills. So it really is - it's really a Mills project.","Second is, you look \u2013 if I remember the numbers 90 and 2015 we lost 900 some odd thousand, 2016 we lost 300,000, 250 to 300, 000, 2017 we lost a million too. Right? Good numbers see? Okay, so my memory is still with me. And we \u2013 look, it's hard to predict, but I would think that it's going to be significantly less than 2017 and that's the good news. And the opportunity is look we \u2013 you know, it is much as you and I want it more than you want it, okay? So let's just be clear. I want it more than you want it for that lease have to occur when you lose a million two.","You know, it does take time and if you miss the season, you know it\u2019s a process. So and that's why to some extent our occupancy dropped in addition to some of our adding some new space that basically is over 2.5 million square feet in new space between the new centers and the expansions. So the reality is we got work to do to get our occupancy up. I expect that number to be down.","And then on your final, the rent spread on the weighted is slightly less than that number, I don\u2019t have it at the top of my head which is I know surprises you, surprises me as well, but we can certainly work on that and get that to you.","Michael Mueller","Okay, thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning.","David Simon","Good morning.","Alexander Goldfarb","How are you?","David Simon","Good.","Alexander Goldfarb","And I guess I'm fired up. So two questions from me.","David Simon","Do you want me to be depressed, what do you want me to be Alex, talk to me, tell me how you want me to be?","Alexander Goldfarb","You are always in a good upbeat mood, so I'll leave it there. And I assume you're going to Minneapolis in a few days.","David Simon","Actually I'm not. I'm going to be watching my, no I am not going to be going to the Super Bowl.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, two questions David, the first one is on the tax cuts, the retailers themselves you know corporately are among the biggest beneficiaries on tax rate and yes there were north of 30% effective. So obviously you know they stand to benefit big time. We've seen wage increase, bonuses, what are you seeing from the retailers themselves as far as reinvestment in their stores, in their brands, in their platforms, and how do you think it plays out at your centers?","David Simon","Well, I'll let Rick answer, I'll just be very, less wordy. You know, in my prepared remarks I said improving. So I think the fourth quarter sales were improving. Not every retailer, I mean some retailers yes, no, I mean but generally improving. The mood is improving. And obviously the tax \u2013 given where retail started with the board or adjustment tax to where it ended up, you know, I think is good for the general retailers and I think they've all concluded. Thankfully you know, some are in a better position to do it and then others that reinvesting in their store is not such a bad idea. Rick, you can add to that.","Richard Sokolov","And we would obviously like to see them invest more because the physical atmosphere that we can provide in our stores is going to be very important. All three of our platforms were up year-over-year in sales. Happily we also found some firming in the tourism markets where several of the markets that had been down are now showing some strength, so that's helping as well and we are encouraged about the trends there.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay and then the second question is, David, between the impact on Puerto Rico and I'm not sure what you guys are now recovering on business interruptions during\u2026?","David Simon","Well, Alex let me interrupt you there. We don\u2019t recover anything on that because I won't go through the arcane which I could, but I'll leave the accounting arcane treatment to the side. Reality is we cannot book business interruption insurance until we get so there is no - there is no income whatsoever when it comes to Puerto Rican assets okay? And we explained that to you last time.","Even with that said when we started our guidance and put the redemption cost aside when we started our guidance I left some of these headlines about guidance short, guidance this, guidance that, yet no one, I'd never see the headline that says, highest growth in the industry. I\u2019m waiting for that, Alex you could probably start that trend. But even with losing Puerto Rico and the bankruptcies that in a lot of cases were unforeseen, we did beat our guidance that we laid out for you and this time last year okay? And not like our normal you know crush beat, but we beat it by $0.03, $0.04 something like that, and Tom I'm looking at Tom.","So again, I just hope you appreciate that. I mean it's not - it just doesn't - we don't roll off the log here. We grind it out. We did beat our earnings when you take out the redemption charge despite Puerto Rico not being in the numbers and then obviously the decrease in the NOI loss from Puerto Rico which is not a crazy number, but it's few cents.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, well just to finish the question David. Just curious how the rise in interest rates but the benefit on FX, how those two netted out as you guys laid out your 2018 is it than that wash or is that favorable or unfavorable one way or the other?","David Simon","Yes, it\u2019s basically a wash.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay.","David Simon","We're not that levered with that much floating rate debt for that to really hurt us that much and then obviously our international business is about 10%, so when you put it all together it's not going to - it's on the margin.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of the Omotayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Omotayo Okusanya","Hi, yes. Good morning everyone. Just following up on Alex's question about FX, could you just talk about the impact of FX on same-store NOI in \u201917 where I believe there was a bit of a drag versus in \u201918 way to put it that consensus estimates and FX would actually be a positive to same-store NOI growth?","David Simon","It's basically flat and again there's a good thing about it, it may help tourism in the U.S. which we get a benefit of. So we'll see, but so it's not material in a sense and I \u2013 and again remember that international, you know that's why we try to guide you toward portfolio NOI, but international is not in our comp NOI, you know that, right?","Omotayo Okusanya","Yes.","David Simon","Okay.","Omotayo Okusanya","Okay. That\u2019s helpful.","David Simon","Okay, so the only benefit that we will see from the domestic which is what we do for same-store NOI is what impact the weaker dollar will have on the tourism spend okay? Not the foreign exchange number. You're with me, right?","Omotayo Okusanya","Yes, correct.","David Simon","Okay, okay, just want to make sure.","Omotayo Okusanya","Okay, that's helpful. That makes a lot of sense. Second question, you have a kind of an expansive list of densification projects here that\u2019s kind of good to see. Just curious with your partner in that densification project, are you participating in any of the upside associated with these upcoming hotels or office buildings or anything of that nature? I'm just trying to understand and I'm trying to understand the relationship to how it works.","David Simon","Well, yes of course we\u2019re partner - if we don't do it ourselves and we're partners of course we participate as a joint venture. A lot of these deals that we've done are 50-50 straight up deals. We get the value of the land which in some cases is higher than what our book basis is, it's never been lower and then we share in the upside absolutely. You know, and then I think with time there will be a trend for us to do more and more of these on our own. As an example at Fifth we plan on doing a hotel, the Nobu Hotel on our own.","The office building that's programmed in that at this point is on our own. We may or may not bring a partner in, but although - if we do bring a partner we'll certainly have upside, if we don't just sell the opportunity at a premium and then let them develop it.","Richard Sokolov","And I would point out that this densification is not new for us. We've been doing this for a decade and we've been reaping the benefits as we decide when we want to asset managing, we've sold a number of these densification projects and make a lot of money doing it. So we've been doing this for a long time and we're just going to come up with incremental opportunities.","Omotayo Okusanya","Okay, so I guess the expectation has I mean, in \u201918 we should see decent increase in the income from unconsolidated entities from all these JVs?","David Simon","Well, it's - a lot of these are under construction, so I don't think \u201918 is a big year for that, but they'll be you know there'll be some, I think you will continue to see more and more projects being added in our portfolio. We had a substantial increase quarter-over-quarter in the number that we included in the CAG.","Omotayo Okusanya","Got you. Okay, just one more from me I appreciate the patience. There have been press releases about the Tijuana situation has been resolved between the two parties. Is there any color or commentary you can just kind of provide about lessons learned through that process?","David Simon","From us?","Omotayo Okusanya","Actually from both sides, because I\u2019m just kind of curious how was it settled, what's the ultimate decision? But does it give you confidence about system supporting your lease structures and I\u2019m just kind of curious?","David Simon","I don't think it's fair to ask us. The last thing we want to do is get into an argument with one of our clients. However, if we feel like it's not and this is a generic statement, if we feel like it's not being appropriately dealt with we have no choice but to do what we did. It's not what we want to do. We're not in that business, but if we feel like we have to protect our position we will and it - but it took a lot of took \u2013 you know generically when you have these situations it takes a lot of judgment what to do and not something I'm excited about doing, but if we have to we will.","Omotayo Okusanya","Fair enough. Thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks, good morning.","David Simon","Good morning.","Steve Sakwa","I guess David, on the buyback, I noticed that the volume was much, much lower in Q4 than in Q3 and I\u2019m just wondering was there anything that maybe precluded you from doing buybacks and was there something about the share price or just your liquidity obviously is in very good shape, so I just thought maybe some comments on the buyback and how you're thinking about that in 2018?","David Simon","Well, we \u2013 well, I guess, I think as I look at \u201918 and I look at and I really study other credits that are like ours or that at least rated the same as ours, I shouldn\u2019t say like ours but rated the same as us, I see a lot more firepower than they do and that - it's important for us to maintain that rating. But I think we're underappreciated by how they evaluate things. So it is - a long story short, it gives me more \u2013 a stronger position to continue to be more aggressive than we were in the fourth quarter.","The fourth quarter is just kind of an anomaly in that it wasn\u2019t anything legally precluding. There was a period of time when the stock really got hit. And we went in and then it jumped back up, so we and then before you know we're in the blackout period and then we can't do much more. So it's really more on that front, nothing other than that. But you know when I look at ratings of companies that are the same as ours, we have a lot more firepower and that gives me more confidence to be more, perhaps more aggressive here.","Steve Sakwa","And just to be clear, you're not assuming within the earnings for next year that there's any buyback activity, so there's no benefit from potentially using the firepower on the buyback.","David Simon","That is 100% accurate.","Steve Sakwa","Okay and then just this is a little bit more of a medusa [ph] question, but when we look at kind of the income statement, home and regional costs as well as G&A were down substantially '17 over '16. And I'm just trying to figure out are the \u201917 numbers you think, sort of good starting points in run rates to think about \u201918 or was there something abnormal in \u201917 that brought us down versus \u201916.","David Simon","No, I think they're pretty consistent. That's a new run rate. What I \u2013 at the beginning, you know the executives here did not have - and again you can get me going philosophically, but we decided not to take any long term incentive for \u201917 and take and express to the market that we're going to do what it takes to continue to run our business as we've also retired a couple of people that we're that we haven't replaced at those kind of levels. But I think those are pretty close to the run rate sort of more or less. If it's up it's more inflationary up than anything else, but I would look for that to be more the new normal, maybe slightly up just from an inflationary point of view.","Steve Sakwa","Okay and then maybe just a touch back on lease and I know you sort of circled this a couple of times and your commentary about good and improving and maybe just get Ricks commentary, but as you sort of sit here today and kind of survey the landscape in the leasing environment versus a year ago, it much feel better but how many, if you just help us kind of quantify or think about kind of the environment today and the discussions with tenants versus say six months or twelve months ago?","Richard Sokolov","It's Rick, Steve. It is clearly a firmer environment. The tenants are more constructive in their view of their store platforms. If you looked at all of the comments that the tenants had coming out of ICR, I think all of them basically were saying that we have made progress getting our portfolios right side. David has already commented. We view \u201918 as hopefully going to be a less debilitating year in terms of reworks and bankruptcies and we're doing a lot of refit.","We have made substantial progress on the bankruptcy space. We got back. We're leasing it on rent. That for the most part are higher than the rents that the bankrupt tenants had and we are encouraged and frankly it doesn't hurt that we have a great portfolio of properties that tenants want to be in.","David Simon","And there seems to be just one other small point on that is there seems to be a lot of the, and without naming names, a lot of the folks that are, that were a little sketchy last year seemed to stabilize their business a little bit more. So again, that doesn't mean there's not a shoe to drop with you know one retailer versus the next. But it does seem \u2013 there does seem to be a sense that some of the folks that we're \u2013 could have gone left or right are kind of stabilizing their business.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, great thanks. That's all from me.","David Simon","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of Citi. Your line is now open.","Michael Bilerman","Hi it's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. Maybe Rick or David, just sticking on the leasing these, as you think about the pace of your openings, this year been a sub page 23 you are at 6.7 million square feet, you had been a little bit over 8 million the year before and consistently in that 7.5 million to 8 million type or range.","You have almost 8 million square feet expiring in \u201918. Can you talk sort about that actual pace and if you feel like there's going to be an increase in the opening pace or what may have held back some of the openings in terms of back selling the higher amount of bankruptcies this year?","David Simon","Well, let me first address in terms of our renewals. We are right on pace on our \u201918 renewals today as where we were in \u201917 with our renewals. And we as David indicated we're still seeing a relatively strong volume coming in. We have a large portfolio and as we work through we have to a degree a lumpier process because we deal with our tenants on all their expirations. So it's a little lumpier, but we do not expect that we're going to have any significant diminution in activity this year as compared to last year as we saw our average rents were up and our spreads were around.","Michael Bilerman","Going back to the same-store NOI David, on page 19 you lay out pretty clearly that components of that growth and so are you going to not provide that information now that you're not providing the guidance from comparable and a total perspective?","David Simon","No, no, no, that number will be the same. I mean that page will be the same and I've provided, somebody asked me the question I provided the same guidance we provided last year, so we've given you the guidance. And that page will continue to be the same and we'll continue to report both same-store and portfolio NOI we just are trying to explain to you we think one's better than the other. But you'll get both numbers and you'll be able to decide what's relevant.","Michael Bilerman","Right, and I guess the question is just trying to define slightly and people, different people may have different views the spread this year between comparable and total was 130 basis points. I don't know, if 130 that\u2019s again more\u2026","David Simon","All right well, okay, I mean we don't have to get into semantics too much, but it's fine Mike well our \u2013 we expected to be above 2% in same-store but it, but again our business is, it's a little bit more difficult to and again we thought we'd be at 3% last year and we beat it. We like to beat our numbers as you know. We have again another unrivaled history on that, you know, an unrivaled earnings growth, unrivaled dividend growth, unrivaled balance sheet, also unrivaled beating earnings expectations.","And obviously as you - and Tom and I spent a lot of time looking at comp NOI over a long, short periods of times, long period of time and it's safe to say we've outperformed that both from a complete real estate point of view as well as within the retail sector. So put all that aside, we would hope to continue to do that, but it's a little \u2013 you know our business is not as - it's a little bit more of an art and science just more levers, a little bit like the hotel business as opposed to say the office business or even the apartment business.","So that's why we always try to guide you towards this kind of range as opposed to that kind of range because there is all lot more moving pieces then some of those others. But it's expected to be about 2% and our portfolio NOI is expected to be about 3% and that's exactly what we told you last year and we'll provide the same. I think you'll find page 19 helpful, is it Michael.","Michael Bilerman","It is.","David Simon","We will continue to provide page 19.","Michael Bilerman","And then just a strategic question, as you think about running a company a lot of times status quo has more risk in it and pursuing some sort of transaction de-risks the company in some ways and you think about your history in terms of going into the outlet business, buying mills, expanding internationally, spinning off WPG in each of those the resulting entity was stronger, relative to the status quo.","And I'm just curious how you think about the status quo today in terms of your three divisions and your geographical exposure and you can translate a little bit of what Unibail is doing with Westfield right? They have a status quo of being a predominately European, French focused company may have had more risk and diversifying their entity into the U.S. small business to them was the attractiveness wealth of the status quo. So how do you think about the go forward as Simon sit here today in terms of having those three divisions in your geographical exposure?","David Simon","Well, I would say we are without question in my opinion perfectly positioned to continue the success that we've had over the last 20 plus years. So there is absolutely nothing that I think we are not appropriately position for future opportunities. We don't, I don't feel - the only thing I feel compelled to do is to make our existing real estate better. That I feel with a complete unmitigated, unrestrained passion.","I also think we need to without question work our tails off to figure out how to connect with the consumer in lots of different ways. But I certainly don't feel that we need to be better positioned or that I'm losing out on the M&A activity. I just don't, I don't beat to that drum and I don't think we need to and in fact I think most people are catching up with what we've already done, so I don't get out that I don't worry about.","I worry about absolutely making our existing real estate better and I worry about how we continue to want to connect with the consumer and we'll always find interesting things to do. I mean, the market Michael, you know we gloss over what we do, but we did open an outlet in Kuala Lumpur okay? We do have a great presence and I don't think anybody other than tab and I guess has a presence in China.","We do have an international business. We do have diversity in product type. We do have a great balance sheet. Our people are good at what they do. I'm not that shabby. So I don't know, I think we're okay, but the passion here is how do we make our existing real estate better and if there's external deal to do that we think is opportunistic for our shareholders then we'll take advantage of it.","But I don't, I really, really, don't feel compelled that we have to do that to continue our leadership position. That's right, I don\u2019t feel that all that. I will say this, I mean I think these folks are catching up with us. We'll see if they are successful. I've lived and breathed this. It isn't that easy, it not - it doesn't happen, well you're going from a piece of paper to cash flow is a different leap of faith and so we'll see.","Michael Bilerman","And how do you feel just about your appeal, you obviously have the stake in [indiscernible] to [indiscernible] a number of years ago. There's been some M&A activity in that marketplace. How do you sort of feel about owning a 20% stake in the public security, you're chairman of the supervisory board with a lot of control, but just, how do you sort of think about Europe in that context with activity going on there as well and what you could do?","David Simon","Well, listen I think we bought opportunistically as you know that it's interesting Europe. They're all excited about the growth there that's finally catching up with the U.S. I am very comfortable with our investment there. And what the job, they're doing we've done a lot with that company. We'll continue to make it better, but again I don't feel from that standpoint that they are missing out some of these M&A activities the shareholders of the acquirer you know are pretty much beyond if not puke and it's somewhere in between. Right?","So we at Klepierre have a lot - I think a lot to continue to do to improve the company and they're doing a very good job of it and I feel very comfortable with that investment and I'm pleased to see that there's, that there's green shoots in France and their starting to growth and the entrepreneurial spirit is coming back to an area that truly needs and deserves it.","Michael Bilerman","Great, well I appreciate all the color and keep growing cash flow.","David Simon","Yes, that\u2019s what we do.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Haendel St. Juste","Hi, good morning.","David Simon","Good morning.","Haendel St. Juste","Thank you. I wanted to follow up on an earlier question about sales. Curious about actually the 2% sales growth to the fourth quarter, is there anything positive I think the fourth consecutive quarter of sales just were include growth. But most are a bit surprised that sales per square foot worked up a little bit higher. After all you had pretty easy comps given to on '16 week holiday season last year and the fourth quarter I think you did -1%.","So adding that plus all the hype around how great to see holiday season was from the media. May be you can reconcile that and add a bit more color on which categories maybe weighed down your growth and maybe some of the out performers?","David Simon","Well, this is, I mean the number is, the number is that the retailers report to us. They're in the retail business there's always winners and losers every quarter. There's no extraordinary insights that I have that will help you, help me answer that question. And I don\u2019t know Rick if you, the numbers to number is all I could tell you, but Rick if you have some insights.","Richard Sokolov","The only thing I can tell you is that just in terms of categories the entertainment women's better and moderate and kids' shoes were better, regions of the mountain at Atlantic Pacific and Florida were stronger. I think again reflecting the point that David made earlier that tourism is back a little bit and I agree with David, our sales number is a derivative number from our retailers. We're certainly doing everything in our power to draw more people to our properties, but ultimately the retailers have to convert them once we get them there.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay, fair enough I appreciate that color Rick and perhaps do you guys also have a NOI weighted sales per square foot growth figure year-over-year? I'm trying to get a sense of\u2026?","David Simon","Whatever that number that we had last time, I don't know, and Tom can follow up.","Thomas Ward","Yes, it\u2019s in fact it's up a little higher than it was, it was up almost 2.4%.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay, thank you for that. And one more I guess on the transaction market, I\u2019m curious if you're maybe think few more assets in the marketplace, have you noticed that change in perhaps seller sentiment for the quality assets that you want, given the recent transaction marks provided. And I guess understanding not, that you're watching but not necessary intern participating in the M&A going on around you.","Is it fair to assume that you are interested in high assets should they become available? I guess what I'm trying to figure out you have as you outlined 8 billion-ish of liquidity, 2 billion of cash what you're planning to do with it? Thanks.","Richard Sokolov","Well, I mean I kind of, we work kind of hard to build that up, so I mean it's - I view it as an opportunity not and I said look, I think at the end of the day. We're going to be focused on good real estate in terms of our external activity. We're going to be focused on good real estate that we could add value to priced right and if we can't find that, we won't buy it. And if you look at our track record, we've done that. So let me repeat, good real estate one, two is where we can add value and three is appropriately priced for us and somebody may have pricing view that's different than ours and we may be right or we may be wrong.","The only thing I can point you to is our track record and I will assure you that every time that we did an M&A deal, we were wildly criticized from CPI to when the Barlow was so long ago and I mean people remember, right? I barely remember it. I mean\u2026","David Simon","And suddenly Rick showed up at the office one day and I go, how did you get here?","Richard Sokolov","But you know, CPI to buying Chelsea to buying Chelsea to buying the Mills, I mean that was not one deal that the market said, boy, you guys got a good chance. So now that the concern is we're not buying anything, it is what it is. We find those three metrics we'll do something. If we don't, we won't.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay, I appreciate the thoughts, but disconnecting the dots it sounds like there isn't anything more incremental in the marketplace that perhaps you're noticing a shift in sentiment or perhaps a change in the quantity of quality assets available?","David Simon","Well, look I think the good news for you are a market participant and the good news for you is that you've had a couple of companies that are obviously very thoughtful smart companies from Brookfield to Unibail that have given you a mark, Unibail has given you a great mark in terms of you want to value U.S. real estate. And I know the market really was dying for that and there it shows up. Yet, it's not enough. Okay? But I would say to you that's a pretty healthy mark, if you're looking at wanting to understand what existing pricing is today.","Thomas Ward","Okay, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Vincent Chao","Hey, good morning everyone. May be just a follow up question on this liquidity. You talked about firepower quite a bit and the strength of the balance sheet, but regardless of what the investment is whether share buybacks or M&A at some point in the future or developments, I guess how comfortable are you in taking up your leverage? It sounds like you think you're not getting the credit for your leverage, that some of your similarly rated peers are, so and then I guess would you be comfortable going to 6.5, 7?","David Simon","Well, I don't was to pick a number on, but I would encourage you to look at who is rated the same as us in the retail space and look at - it to me the most, nominal line guy, I'm so old that I ice go cold, private equity leverage buyouts okay, that's the pure definition of how old you are right, whether you say private equity or leveraged buyouts.","I\u2019d encourage you, Vincent to look at this in retail real estate really look at debt-to-EBITDA ours versus the peers rated in our category and you can see there's a wide really shockingly big spread. So we're trying to assess that, what does that mean for us or why is it that way we don't have really good answers and so it's a work in progress, but we're paying attention to it. There shouldn't be that big a spread.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thanks and then I think we've touched on this in the past, but of the $1.2 million square feet that you referenced from 2017 bankruptcies, how much of that is expected to come back on line in 2018?","David Simon","We\u2019ve already brought back on line almost 50% of it and we're making really good progress on the balance and the tenants that are coming in are frankly great productive growing tenants that are going to be more productive in the tenants that closed and they're paying higher rents. So it is a very productive process, but it certainly does have an impact while we're going through.","Vincent Chao","Got it and just one last one just in terms of your contractual rent bumps, what is that currently on average for the portfolio?","David Simon","In terms of what we're doing in our leases?","Vincent Chao","Right.","David Simon","Typically they are 3%","Vincent Chao","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Rich Hill","Hey good morning. I think this question is for David and Rick maybe together. From our perspective and I think probably yours as well, the retail narrative was really strong in 4Q with sales improving. So I was a little bit surprised to see overage rents, look to be down maybe around 13% year-over-year and I was wondering if there's anything that maybe drove that you had mentioned Puerto Rico being closed in the fourth quarter.","David Simon","So, yes the simple answer is yes. Puerto Rico we did have overage rent from Puerto Rico that we have to take out, but also remember that. And you see this in our average base rent going up, so it's our job to take that overage rent each and every year when leases rollover to put that in the minimum rent, right? So you know, as the lease rolls are over let's say they\u2019re paying $10 of base rent, $10 of overage rent it's our job to get that to 20 bucks at base rent, right so we can take out the volatility.","So part of our job is to always even do that and in a robust sales environment historically you've had folks that even though we've eaten into their overage with increases in base rent, there's a whole slew of others but since sales have been kind of flattish over the last couple years you're seeing the impact more of us converting the overage into the base rent and you're seeing that in the average base rent increase.","Rich Hill","Got it. That type of the numbers that's all I have. Thank you very much.","David Simon","Yes, no worries.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Your line is now open.","Nicholas Yulico","Hi everyone. Couple questions on occupancy, in the third quarter you mentioned you had a 30 basis point negative drag on total occupancy from new centers, what was that impact in the fourth quarter?","David Simon","Similar.","Nick Yulico","Okay, so I\u2019m just trying to understand why the year-over-year occupancy dropped more in the fourth quarter than third quarter?","David Simon","We processed a lot of bankruptcies in the fourth quarter. Again remember they tell you when they're going to close and just a function of the bankruptcy processing.","Nick Yulico","Okay and then just lastly on in terms of your occupancy I guess in the fourth quarter and over the past year, hoping to get a break down of long term versus short term tenants and how that trend has changed in the past year?","David Simon","It's the way, our definition is that it is hasn't changed, so the numbers are the numbers. Okay? We only include it if it\u2019s a year. And then if it's less and it is not in our numbers, so it's all in it's a year-over-year comparison is appropriate the number hasn't changed or the definition hasn\u2019t unchanged.","Nick Yulico","Okay, thanks.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum with Boenning. Your line is now open.","Floris van Dijkum","David, a quick question for you on, sort of touching upon fall off on other questions you've had as well, but with the Westfield comp out there at a relatively low cap rate compared to where consensus is for eight more guys there seems to be 75 basis points certainly relative to where you're trading at today, why aren't you more aggressive or will you become does that make you become more aggressive about share buybacks heading into \u201918?","David Simon","Well, first of all you can't buy stock back in a blackout period unless you have a - what's the word I\u2019m looking for? 10B5 okay. So and you said guidelines on the 10B5, so unless those guidelines are met we can't buy it, but the reality is, I think I intimated that yes it's something we're thinking more and more about.","Floris van Dijkum","Okay, another question I had regarding your 12 Sears boxes that you now control. Presumably there not in your redevelopment pipeline as you mentioned earlier.","David Simon","Well, that presumably they\u2019re not, they're not, you can take out the word presumably.","Floris van Dijkum","Right, there not, no but I\u2019ll ask as but presumably the returns on those 12 boxes would be in excess of your overall portfolio and based on what certainly what [indiscernible] has been able to achieve on their space right now. Any ideas of or any advance thoughts on any of them that you can share in terms of maybe turning some of the space into enter small shop space or is it mostly going to be doing your anchors, how you\u2026?","David Simon","Yes, it's a legitimate question. It's all over the board. As these transactions are permitted and approved internally, then you'll see exactly and it will be some are just box for box. A lot of them are torn down and redo like what we did in Macau and Texas. And like what we're going to do with King of Prussia with Penny or like what we're going to do with the bulk [ph] department store at Phipps. So it's really all over the board and we'll obviously, for us as we get all of that done permitted, priced out, approved, that will flow into our 8K and you\u2019ll see exactly specifically what we're going to do there.","Floris van Dijkum","Okay, great thanks. Last question I guess is, maybe if you can make a comment broadly on TIs. I think one of the concerns that people have its TI packages certainly in some of the script companies but also in some of the other mall companies has been raising a little bit. Are you seeing any sort of trends there in terms of what you're having to offer your tenants?","David Simon","If you go back over our TIs over the last five or six years, they've been in a very tight range. So I think it's important we very rarely give any TIs on renewals it's only for new leasing activities when we have a slightly elevated TIs because we've been able to do more restaurants or design your tenants, but it's been in a very tight range and we're not seeing any material increase in what we need to give tenants in that area.","Floris van Dijkum","Great thanks. That\u2019s it from me.","David Simon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Linda Tsai","Thanks. Good morning. Following up on Floris\u2019s question on the future Sears redevelopments are you thinking about these spaces any differently as in would you be less interested in letting apparel tenants fill the boxes, just given how competitive the space remains even if some brands had a better holiday?","Richard Sokolov","We are focused on making our properties better. As David said we've got very defined plans for all 12 of these. We are far down the road in our approval and leasing process. We have apparel tenants, we have restaurants, we have mixed used elements. We've got boxes, health clubs, theaters all over the board, but in every instance there is one thing each of these projects has been common and that is when we're done our project is going to be substantially stronger, higher NOI, higher total sales and more attractive marketplace serving its trade area.","Linda Tsai","Thanks. This probably sounds minor, but the occupancy cost ratio increased to 13.2% where as it's been it was it's been in the 13% to 13.1% range for the past several quarters is there anything to highlight here?","David Simon","No.","Linda Tsai","Okay.","David Simon","No, it's immaterial really.","Linda Tsai","All right and then what was traffic like in the quarter at the Mills versus the Malls, versus the Premium Outlets.","David Simon","All generally positive enough and I think traffic and sales are painting a more robust picture than the narrative out there is suggesting.","Linda Tsai","Have you seen some of that traffic follow through in January?","David Simon","Yes, I think January has been a very well it's anecdotal, we don't have January sales, yet it's we get from the retailers 20 days after the month but anecdotally we hear January is very strong across the board. So again, I mean I wouldn't bank on that, but that's at least from a anecdotal point of view we're hearing that.","Linda Tsai","Thanks.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeremy Metz","Hey guys question for Rick, I just wonder if you could talk about the pace of activity or momentum kind of in the junior box space some of the fashion retirees that have been a huge focus here in recent years. It seems to be losing a little bit of steam, so just wondering what the pipeline looks like on that front relative to maybe a year ago?","Richard Sokolov","Yes, it's in fact very strong ironically if you look at 12, 31, 16 we indicated we were going to have 34 boxes that could open in \u201917 and beyond and in fact in \u201917 we opened 34 and we now have 40 additional ones on the schedule for 18 and beyond. So there is still a very robust market out there for our properties and as we have said in the past, you're seeing that in our portfolio.","Tenants that are operating in the mall contacts and than have operated in the power center contact which we can provide better sales, better traffic, so robust pipeline that is continuing to grow.","Jeremy Metz","All right, I appreciate that and then just one quick point of clarity here in Puerto Rico and I know it\u2019s not hugely material impact nearly $12 of earnings this sounds like guidance includes no insurance recovery, but the continuation of that call it $0.03 quarter we had from loss income, so is that the right way to look at it, so $0.12 drag in 2018 more or less?","David Simon","Well, it\u2019s I don't want to really point to that because we've got actually collected, so we're still projecting kind of a tough environment in Puerto Rico, so not completely the end of the world there, but we've got the properties are slowly opening, so it's I would say the drag is in the $0.03, $0.04, range somewhere in that range, but there's still a drag but where in fact Puerto Rico outlets just open that's further along and then the mall is it's getting closer to getting up to where it was.","I mean it's open as well, but there's still a number of tenants lagging, so we still have some drag there and then we can't really book that be until we get it so it's dilutive to where we would be if we didn't have the hurricane but that's kind of the number in that range that's hurting us absent that. ","Jeremy Metz","Okay, thanks guys.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. So you guys talked about better traffic sales and maybe overall better mood across the industry. When you think about your guidance for next year are . Are to better malls in your portfolio improving versus last year or is a bottom picking back up, I was wondering if you can provide a little more color on that?","David Simon","It is across the board, but obviously our stronger properties are getting incrementally stronger and growing a little better and that hasn't changed in 50 years.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay and what is the average vintage of leases that are coming due in 2018? And how you describe you know what happens after the value of vintage starts to wear off going forward, and what is that kind of your\u2026?","David Simon","I don't know the reference damage. I mean we provide you the expiring rents and I think that gives you a pretty good road map when you compare our average base rent of leases that are expiring with our opening rents that we use in our spreads, so it shows you we still have for the next seven or eight years considerable runway to be able to roll our rent based on what we're doing to that.","Ki Bin Kim","Yes, I mean there's a little bit of discrepancy and understanding that because I believe the expiring are exclusive of cam, so it's not exactly comparable, versus what you're signing, but if you compare the average base renI personally are signing but\u2026?","David Simon","No, but if you compare the average base rent expiring and our average base rent today that has all of the lower rents, we're still our average base rent today is still an excess of our expiring rents.","Ki Bin Kim","All right, thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session.","David Simon","Okay, thank you ma'am. Oh thank you and again we apologize for the length of our calls, but we want to have everybody given the opportunity to ask whatever questions that they do. So I do apologize and also later than people want, but that's why we're here happy to answer questions, so thank you.

Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Presenting on today\u2019s call is David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also on the call are Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; Andy Juster, Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Broadwater, Chief Accounting Officer.","Before we begin, a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com. For our prepared remarks, I am pleased to introduce David Simon.","David Simon","Good morning, we had a productive quarter. We opened started and completed several new projects and closed our joint venture with HBC including the acquisition of certain cop-op department store which will serve as another avenue of growth for us. And most importantly we continue to produce strong operating and financial performance. Results in the quarter were highlighted by FFO of $2.54 per share which exceeded the first call consensus by $0.07. These results were achieved even with the negative impact of $0.04 in the quarter compared to the prior year quarter due to the strong dollar. On a comparable basis excluding the loss on the extinguishment of debt in the prior year period FFO per diluted share increased 12.9% or $0.29 year-over-year.","Key metrics, occupancy was 96.1%. Leasing activity remains healthy. The malls and outlets recorded releasing spreads of $11 per square foot, an increase of 18.4%. Comp NOI increased 4.3% in the third quarter of 2015, an increase 3.8% year-to-date keeping us on track for full year guidance of 4% comp NOI growth. This is on top of our industry leading growth of more than 5% in 2014. As a reminder we do not include lease settlement income in comp NOI disclosure or new transaction. We also do not include the impact of recently redeveloped or expanded centers.","Total sales across the portfolio increased 1.8% for the trailing 12 months even with the loss of bankrupt tenants. On a comparable basis the sales per square foot increased for the 12 months ended September 30 was 2.7% positive. They were strong in the mall, but effective in the outlet business due to the strong dollar as had on sales activity from the international tourist in property zone; the Canadian, Mexican borders as well as traditional tourist markets.","At the end of the third quarter redevelopment and expansion projects are ongoing at thirty properties across all three of our platforms with a total committed spend of $1.7 billion. During the quarter we opened significant expansion at two of the country's most productive outlet centers, San Francisco premium outlet centers and Chicago Premium Outlets. Following the expansion the outlets in Chicago and San Francisco are the largest respectively. In Illinois and California we have recently opened the Fashion Wing at Del Amo. The Wing includes a new Nordstrom, and more than a hundred exceptional brands, many of them exclusive to the trade area. With this transformation we have completed Del Amo is just another example how we continue invest in our proven assets to enrich the shoppers experience and enhance the value of our real estate.","We have started construction on several new strategic projects during the quarter including significant redevelopments at the shops of Riverside, the Westchester and our progress is excellent with our Sears boxes at Seritage. As we move forward, construction continues on major redevelopment expansion projects. Some of our most productive properties including Roosevelt Field, The Galleria and Houston Stanford Shopping Center, the King of Prussia Mall, Sawgrass Mills and Woodbury Commons; all of these projects we expect to be completed over the next 12 months.","In terms of new development, we opened two new in the quarter, Vancouver and Gloucester. We also opened Tucson Premium Outlets on October 01. And we are opening Tampa on Thursday of this week.","During the quarter we started construction on a new premium outlet center in Clarksburg which is projected to open in October 2016. We are also with our partner McArthurGlen. We started construction on a new outlet and Provouge Spranz which is scheduled to open in March of 2017 which will be the only designer outlet in the south of France. And our share of investment at new outlets in full price is currently 725 million not including the recently completed Gloucester and Vancouver.","And let's talk quickly about the balance sheet activities. We issued $1.1 billion of new notes with the weighted average duration of 7.8 years and an average coupon of 3.05%. We completed several secured placements during the quarter as well as the U.S. and German loan facility financings for a joint venture with HBC. Our current liquidity between the revolvers and cash on hand is approximately 6 billion. Our industry leading balance sheet continues to differentiate us in a very positive manner. We exercised caution during the third quarter with respect to our common stock repurchase program and did not repurchase any stock during the period due to the increased market volatility and the dislocation in the debt markets. We remain committed to our buyback efforts, of course subject to marking into conditions.","In addition, we announced our dividend of $1.60 per share for this quarter. That's an increase of 23% year-over-year and in fact that's the fourth consecutive quarter that we've increased our dividend. We will pay $6.05 in 2015 and that's an increase of 17.5% compared to $5.15 of last year. So with all that said, no one is as active as we are in terms of redevelopment and new development. And I'm pleased, based upon the performance to date. Once again we raise our guidance of 2015 of $10.10 to $10.15 per share. This compares to our original FFO guidance of 9.60 to 9.70 per share or approximately $0.48 higher from the respective midpoints.","We are now ready for question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi. Please go ahead sir. You are live into the call.","Michael Bilerman","It's Michael Bilerman here with Christine Kilroy. David, your comment about the stock buyback, being I guess it's a volatile stock market and some uncertainties in the debt markets; isn't that exactly the time where you should be exercising your fortress balance sheet and significant cash proceeds to be able to buy the stock. I know high insight is 2020, watching the stock go up $27 but I'm just curious about the mentality at that point in time about not being aggressive at that point.","David Simon","Well, Michael I think stock buybacks, in terms of the marketplace reaction to the may be overstated. What I'm most interested in at this company is growing our earnings and our dividend and maintaining our balance sheet, improving our properties and enhancing our relationship. So I don\u2019t look at it quarter by quarter basis. We are more focused on growing our earnings per share and our dividend. And the fact is that in August the market was very volatile as you know the debt markets gapped pretty significantly. We chose for one quarter to be cautious. I have no regrets about that because our number one priority is to grow our earnings and our dividends. And that to me is more important and I think that's what the market should value more importantly than what one's buyback activity may be from one quarter to the next. We remain committed to it while we're going to be opportunistic about that because we continue to believe. I'm terrible at reading from the script. I can barely get the words out. But as you know our activity in redevelopment and new development is not hypothetical. It is ongoing and I think prudence in that category of the buyback is appropriate. And again I think our number one priority is earnings growth and therefore dividend growth. And then buy stock back when we feel like it's a real opportunistic time.","Michael Bilerman","And that Christine has a question as well.","David Simon","Sure.","Christine Kilroy","Hey David, just thinking about the Simon venture Group stuff and we appreciate the in-depth look at that business earlier this month, beyond just sort of the small financial investment you've made, what do you view as the primary benefit of this business to Simon, over the longer term as consumers shopping habits continue to evolve and maybe you can sort of give us a sense of how big you think that your investment in this business could reach over time?","David Simon","Well, let me just talk about what I think the goal is, ultimately it's to help connect with the consumer. The mall business is historically as always felt like the, our job was to get the box reach to the right retailers and let the retailers do most of the connecting and driving most of the traffic but I think the industry has a evolved, where we've got to become the driver of traffic and we've got to connect with the consumers. So what I'm looking for in that, those investments and that connection with technology is, how do I connect with the consumer to drive traffic and make their shopping trip more enjoyable or more effective, two: how do I help the retailer do that as well and then maybe third, is there some new concept or new retailer that ultimately can proliferate our portfolio through these kind of connections.","And if we can accomplish those two or three goals then I think we will have succeeded. And it's all about trying to take the mall box making a smart connected box to help our retailers and the property owner connect with the consumer so that their trip is better, more efficient and more productive which we think will lead to sales growth. So that's the goal.","We may do a little bit here and there that's a little far afield like funding the new retail or restaurant concept because we think maybe that has potential down the road and in terms of size, we're not going to get carried away but it's really hard to pinpoint right now exactly how big that can be but we have a sense where we're kind of, will ultimately be in the mid-20s by the end of this year, maybe we'll do another type of investment like that next year.","So it wouldn't shock me if we are in there 50+ range by the end of next year but that's just a swag.","Operator","Thank you for your question. We do have another question and it comes from the line of Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Please go ahead sir, you are live into the call.","Jeff Spector","Great, thank you, good morning. I guess, just thinking about the bumps throughout the year, David what exceeded your expectations and how were you thinking about the budgeting process for 2016? I guess can you compare year-over-year, your mindset?","David Simon","Well, I think what's interesting before the end perspective, first of all is that as you look at our earnings growth we have had an increase in lease settlement income but we've also had the negative of the currency negative from our foreign operations. If you put the two together over \u201914 we've actually had a negative $0.05 variance. So, the increase in the lease settlement income from \u201915 to \u201914 offset against the reduction in earnings that we've taken from our foreign investments due to the strong dollar, net-net year-to-date has been a negative $0.05. So you have to put that in perspective.","We've had good rental growth, good leasing spreads. We are obviously had a lot more bankruptcies in \u201915 than we did in \u201914 and the other impact we've had on the negative side is that we've lost certain amount of percentage rent from the outlet business because of the fact that the strong dollar has also heard tourism shopping and we've seen that impacted more in the outlet business, the outlet tourists centers then we had in the mall business.","The mall comp sales have been a better than our expectations and our leading portfolio in terms of that. So the fact is we always though year in and year out, that's what makes us a little bit unique, we always had some positives, we always had some negatives and we somehow manage to hit our numbers, exceed our numbers, produce very strong industry leading results.","I'd also say to you as we look into next year, I mean the key focus for us frankly is we have anniversary the stronger dollar. So that will not be, the negative it was this year and the big focus obviously is going to be leasing up the bankrupt tenants were probably 60% to 70% on our way there, a total loss score footage is the [million three]. So we've got our work cut out but we've seen this movie before. The good news is we have quality real estate that allows us to do it and we have other leverages to continue to have industry leading comp growth.","And I think the big exciting thing that we've got in \u201916 which won't show up in our numbers, is all of the major redevelopment that we've done between King of Prussia, Roosevelt Field, Stanford, I want Craig to go see Del Amo, it's unbelievable what we've started there, of course we're still finishing it. It's a big complicated projects but we've got Woodbury Common coming on board, we've got the extension of Sawgrass colonnade, new development et cetera is going to be really terrific to open up in the latter half of \u201916 which positions us \u201917.","The model is reinvest, generate excess cash flow, pay high dividends and I should, of course remind you that our dividend [indiscernible] was $3 and actually $2.70, it\u2019s $6.05 today , we'll have significant growth in next year as well but we've got to show up and we've got to go work every day.","Jeff Spector","Thank you, that's helpful. Good timing on the, yes?","David Simon","I hope it answered your question but I'm not, but we've got work to do and we have one thing about comp and alike, if you look at nine, I'm sorry, if you look at \u201913, I don't know 5%, what we have guys 5%, \u201914 we had 5%, this year we are going to have 4%. So we are building it up a pretty strong base and we didn't have any down years of non-performance to build it off, right. So it's great to build also base if you had non-performance but we haven't had that frankly and in the great recession our comp and ally was relatively flat which was industry leading as well.","Jeff Spector","No, it's very helpful, thank you and good timing on the Del Amo because I know Craig has put in a request to visit it.","David Simon","Come on down.","Jeff Spector","Great. And then my only, my one other question was just on your previous comments on the redevelopment pipeline. We believe you've mentioned through \u201917 or you at the point where you think that pipeline could continue a billion plus beyond \u201917? Are we correct on that?","David Simon","Yes. I feel pretty good about that. Yes.","Jeff Spector","Beyond \u201917 or not yet?","David Simon","Yes, no, no.","Jeff Spector","Oh beyond? Okay.","David Simon","No rest for [indiscernible], so this morning, we're going through our budget cycle now which is a lot of fun but this morning we were going through our capital plan through \u201916 and \u201917 and \u201918. And we don't see it abating, it\u2019s actually in\u201917 it will be higher probably around $1.5 billion, and in\u201918 in that range. And the big unknown is how fast the Seritage things happen.","We are not, it\u2019s a joint venture. So it's not just the question of how fast we can go but also how fast Seritage can goes and how fast Sears can go which is clearly we're trying to influence but we don't have complete control in that but we certainly have a lot on the drawing board to do there.","Jeff Spector","Great thank you.","Operator","Thank you feel question. We do have another question it comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead you are live into the call.","Caitlin Burrows","Hi, good morning. Earlier this year, mall REITs were of course impacted across the board by retailer bankruptcies but your same-center occupancy was down 80 basis points this quarter which is actually more than the first and second which seems surprising. So, I was just wondering if you could talk about what drove that year-over-year decline in occupancy to remain in the third quarter and how you expect it turn going forward.","David Simon","We had more bankruptcies in the third quarter. So, Jones went out, just more bankruptcies and then we've also opened up a few centers which had some decrease. We just saw people understand, we don't, in our statistics we put in new centers. The minute the rent in terms of occupancy or new expanded centers. They're not in our comps, NOI growth but they are in our sales per square foot and they're in our occupancy. So part of that decrease was also that we added some new centers and some new expanded centers which actually drove our occupancy down, [flat plenty depth] as well.","Caitlin Burrows","Got it and then like you're mentioning before, you guys have had consistent pretty strong same store NOI growth but do you think that this creates some easy occupancy comp for 2016 and that should be able to help you even more?","David Simon","Nothing is easy, if you see my grade here recently. Nothing is easy. Well, I won't say anything about gold but we did read this retail report; we found your list of 100 malls curious, so I assume the real estate folks didn't have much to do with that but we're happy to help you.","Caitlin Burrows","It will. Our retail team that put it together.","David Simon","Right and you quoted traffic statistics which I would encourage you read the footnotes from your source.","Caitlin Burrows","We will do. Thank you.","David Simon","Thank you. Happy to help.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan from Canaccord, please go ahead.","Paul Morgan","Good morning. Just on the sales trends, I mean could you talk a little bit about it, I mean whether and to what extent the tourist markets were drag due to the dollar or maybe looking at any differences between the Mall and the premium outlet portfolio.","David Simon","We're not going to run from this. We're just going to tell you reality. We have unbelievable tourist centers. In our outlet business, Orlando, Woodberry, throughout Las Vegas and those generate a lot of tourism dollars and the tourists because of the strong dollar, you know was quiet. The high end luxury retail market in say New York City and Miami has been hurt as well and we saw that have an usually, it has very little impact but we saw that a little bit more in the outlet business and very little in the mall business.","We think it's more or less temporary these are great assets, has no impact on retail demand and we've seen a space that comp NOI growth but that\u2019s why the sales metrics are a bigger reaction from you than they are from me, but we tell like it is. So they had an impact on our retail sales per square foot but we don't think it's going to have an impact on our ability to continue to grow comp NOI growth.","Paul Morgan","Okay that give some other question I guess which is just, if you look at the public retailers a lot of them or at least stocks have gotten hit pretty hard over the past several months and as we head into the holidays I mean as you talk to them engage with them about, they're open to buys for next year. I mean how is their sentiment? Is it been shifting at all? Is this just kind of sort of the shift in market share between different retailers or is there anything more kind of systematic in terms of, maybe how they're approaching their growth over the next year or two?","David Simon","I'd say this, it\u2019s retail dependent but they are better retailers who are dealing with the stronger dollar which has it short term impact on them and second, the fact is our GDP growth is anemic I mean we are growing our general economy 2% below, I think retail can\u2019t avoid that fact. The good news is we outperform not because we cater to generally the better consumer and what I think we've seen from the better consumer this year is a little bit move toward which happens in cycles, a little bit more toward durable goods than non-durable goods which has the impact of making kind of a flattish comp sales growth increase but like I said the mall business, we had very strong comp NOI, I'm sorry comp sales, retail sales growth this year and which was offset as I said only by the tourist centers in the outlet business.","So net-net we are up 2.7 but if I isolated just the mall, we'd be up much higher than that and that is a testament even though in the anemic GDP growth the better consumer is spending even though there's been a significant increase in durable goods purchases but retail right now is generally a challenge but we're producing results and we intend to continue to do that.","Paul Morgan","I mean would you Would you say it kind of hasn't translated into a meaningful shift in the appetite for space in your centers as people talk about next year?","David Simon","Not really. I think the opportunity to growth their business in good real estate for better retailers is strong and I don't see the current environment affecting that.","Paul Morgan","Great. Thanks.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question comes from Ross Nussbaum from UBS. Please go ahead.","Ross Nussbaum","I am here with Jeremy Metz. Hey David, when we met the other day, you talked a little bit about the amount of money that consumers are spending in your mall for every minute they are there saying there's like a one-to-one ratio, I am curious if you've done any work to think about spending of millennials and teens versus say their parents to sort of further dig into whether the impact of the internet and technology is going to be a growing problem just from a generational perspective?","David Simon","I don't have in front of me but yes we've looked at, you know the typical generational gaps, that you would see Baby Boomers Generation X and so on, yes I don't have that in front of me but those numbers are-- it's not it's not what you think it. I mean in other words, there was not a big differential between Generation X and millennials.","The one thing we're starting to see is the Baby Boomers probably more of a trend on their decreased expenditures than anything else. Again, I think the millennials offer great opportunity for us because they're looking for, they are generally going through their increased income opportunity over the next decade. It's a huge population base, greater than even the Baby Boomers. These folks will get married. They will have children. They will move out of urban environments, especially with, the more difficult living conditions that's going on a lot of urban environments. They are, we believe loyal mall shopping consumers.","And we're making the mall generally a better experience for them to be at. So I don't think there's a big differential. I don't have the numbers in front of me. It did grew up in the mall environment. They're comfortable with the mall environment.","And as their income grows and as they aged and have kids, I think they'll be loyal mall shoppers, especially given the environment we're creating.","Ross Nussbaum","I appreciate that. I think Jeremy has got a question as well.","David Simon","Sure.","Jeremy Metz","Just two quick ones. In terms of the lease cancellation income, it was the high suspend long time. David, earlier you mentioned Jones. I was just wondering if there is any other tenants in particular to maybe drove, I think Forever 21 was in a few supersized locations. They were looking to downsize, not sure if they were a part of it this quarter?","David Simon","No Forever 21. It\u2019s basically, the big one was Jones. There were couple of others that year to date that we dealt with but I hate going through retail. Retailers on that it's somewhat confidential. The good news is lease settlement income does have been slow, the good news is that it's not any time we do that we still have this space.","So if I get three years of rent and then I get the chance to lease the space back again, I mean that\u2019s a good business, there is nothing wrong with that and to put the earnings in perspective I mean may not have caught the original response to the earlier question, net-net when I look at the stronger dollar from our foreign investments versus the increase in a lease settlement income from \u201914 to \u201915. I'm in the whole $0.05 year to date. So please keep that mind as you think about our business.","Jeremy Metz","And then just switching gears quickly, Highwoods recently announced they were looking to sell Country Club Plaza. I was just wondering is that something Simon would be interested in or any thoughts on where that process is at?","David Simon","I understand that there is a process. I think it's a good real estate. It's got a good position and it's marketplace. But beyond that I am not informed in terms of numbers or anything else or profit but I understand there's a process and it's always been very good real estate, good market.","Jeremy Metz","Okay, thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jeff Donnelly","Good morning. Just may be sticking with leasing, I'm just curious, David, do you think the increase in lease settlement income you are getting foreshadows potentially more space coming back to you guys after the holiday season through bankruptcy?","David Simon","I actually think it\u2019s tailing down. As I look at what generated the list it\u2019s a couple of odd things and our watch-list is actually the guys that we were worried about is kind of happened and done that.","So it's out there it's possible but I actually think next year it will be less, it will be less impacted by bankruptcies than we were this year.","Jeff Donnelly","Okay and switching gears, I'm just curious for your take is Macerich has taken to joint venturing some assets at a low to mid four cap rate that we've been told are fairly middle of the pack for them. Does that pricing in the market maybe lead you to feel there might be pockets of your portfolio where you are open to JVs or even selling out of some assets entirely to expand your repurchase initiatives?","David Simon","I don\u2019t really, I want to rephrase it. I only want to comment on what may switch did so.","Jeff Donnelly","I'm just curious as a comp for transactions in the market, does something in the 4s compel you to say, gee, maybe you'd look at selling your assets to fuel repurchases?","David Simon","I don't know. I mean the fact to the matter is where we are very comfortable with what we're doing. We sell our assets, there generally is complexity when you go to joint ventures. We like to do joint ventures when there's new opportunities because there is, it's easier to justify.","So for instance, just to take a few with that, we're pleased to be part of a new joint ventures on a couple of the new developments, like Brickell and Clearfork, very good partners. Great real estate. That was the only way we could do that. I like those kind of joint ventures where it's more new opportunity than otherwise we sell assets, we sold a bunch of assets, don't forget we did a significant spin off of our strip centers in our smaller malls.","I don't I don't rule it out. I don't think we necessarily, it's not our priority to do. The priority for us is to grow our innings, grow our dividend, execute our redevelopment development pipeline. And we have the buyback and I don't think we necessarily need the capital from existing properties in terms of a joint venture that execute on the buyback.","Jeff Donnelly","Speaking of JVs, I guess you teamed up with Hudson Bay to acquire, was it Galeria Kaufhof Stores? What can you tell us about those properties and just maybe what are your plans of those locations down the road?","David Simon","Well, it's great. Mostly city center real estate in Germany, which is a very strong market, very little retail space per capita as compared to the U.S. as an example. It's got built in growth even if it just stays kind of the credit lease that it is but we think there is some ability to redevelop some of the stores take back some of the front edge, much like we are doing with some of the department stores here in the U.S.","And it's a strong cash flow business appropriately valued with some redevelopment upside.","Operator","Thank you for your question. We do have another question and it comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. Just going back to your retailer watch list comments, last year when we had RadioShack, Wet Seal and Deb Shops and Delia's and some others, how early did you have a read into that they would go BK overall?","David Simon","Those particular ones?","Ki Bin Kim","In general. I was just curious how much of an early warning sign does the watch list provide to you?","David Simon","Pretty early.","Richard Sokolov","We certainly can see this coming a long way away based on the trends of what their leasing activity is or sales activity, when they probably reported they are looking for new equity, so none of these are surprises but as David said the ones that want to away, they had been on the ropes for years and years and they just ultimately ran out of the incremental equity sources and out of file.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. Maybe if you could put it in an easily digestible number. You mentioned 1.3 million square feet that was impacted this year. In broad numbers, what does that look like next year?","Richard Sokolov","It\u2019s hard to predict what next year is going to be but as David said we anticipate that the next year will certainly not be as large year on bankruptcies as we had this year.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao","I know we spent quite a bit of time on the impact of the dollar and tourism sales, but just curious if you could maybe give some more specific color about Miami and then specifically Brickell Center.","David Simon","Well, Miami is feeling some of the heat from obviously Latin America but actually the leasings at Brickell.","Richard Sokolov","Brickell is doing very well. It's opening fall of next year. We've been announcing periodically the tenants that are starting up with the wonderful mix of designer tenants and restaurants and it is anchored by Saks with the Cinema. And if you have been down there, it's a very incredible project with two condo towers, the East Hotel and two office buildings in addition to the retail in a market that is really the financial center of that market. So we're very excited about it going forward.","Vincent Chao","Okay, so safe to say no impact on demand despite some of the maybe tourism impacts in the near-term, so similar to your comments for the other overall.","David Simon","I think what I said earlier is consistent with that retailers. Now look, that's going to attract the better long term thinking retailers. So the fact that tourism is a little soft right now; doesn't detract the better retailer. When I say better, I'm not just talking mix, but just they're better retailers. So I was just trying to explain to you, what's been reported in our sales per square foot but I also made the comment to you, I don't think that is going to detract from the demand of our real estate and our ability to drive comp NOI because we're going after the better retailers. And the better retailers will work through a quarter or two of sales volatility for whatever reason. And that's the point I've been trying to make to a lot of folks a lot of time over retail sales. Retail sales is interesting, but not a predictor comp NOI growth and we've done all sorts of regression analysis. I've talked about this ad nauseam, but we report the facts for you to have, but it doesn't detract from the ability to generate increased cash flow, because that's more supply and demand oriented and what the market rent of our space rolling over is, and what that particular location is, and we got a good space and a good mall, you're going to be there to generate, given that rent will lower, that rent has been there for seven years. You go look at where that rent was rolling over seven years ago. So and that's why we are re-leasing spreads of 11 bucks a foot. That's the focus. The volatility of retail sales is more interesting from a retailer point of view less from the landlord. So, take New York City street retail. There is volatility in that retail sales there but has the market value of that real estate changed. Probably if you talk to a lot of people, they would probably tell you, no. ","Operator","We have another question from the line of Mike Muller from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Mueller","A couple of questions here. One, you may have indirectly answered before but what was your share of the lease term that you booked this quarter?","David Simon","It\u2019s in our supplemental.","Michael Mueller","The share of it is because I thought that was the consolidated amount?","David Simon","Well, if it is consolidated, that's our share. We may have a little minority interest in that. But if it is consolidated, it's our share, right?","Michael Mueller","And then secondly on the outlet development side, can you talk a little bit about the returns you are seeing when you compare Europe starts to US to Asia and how you think about the pecking order of opportunities?","David Simon","I would say that the due development in Europe tends to be a little lower than -- our developments here around a 11% return on cost generally. In Europe they may be a touch lower, say 8 or 9 to start with. And in Asia we really don\u2019t do unless they are double digits because you got tax impact and we want a better risk adjusted return. I would say they are probably around the 12% or 13% range.","Michael Mueller","Got it. Okay. And I guess as you are thinking about opportunities going forward, is it more skewed towards the US for new starts at this point or do you think you're going to see a little bit more pickup in Europe?","David Simon","Europe, like I said, we're really excited on the Provence deal, 90% of it's -- it's a big project and a big market that hasn\u2019t seen a quality outlet like that. So that's good news. There are two or three others through McArthurGlen that were making good progress, and one in Spain that we hope to start construction in '16, as we go through the permitting. So that's up there as well. Another one in the western part of Paris that we are making good progress on, other one in Belgium where we are making good progress on. And in Asia, we've got two or three others that are a little more difficult to predict but we've got our second one in Malaysia that we\u2019re confident that we will get started as well as Mexico. In Mexico we expect to start one next year as well. So we're making progress.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Carol Kemple from Hilliard Lyons. Please go ahead.","Carol Kemple","How does your volume of temporary and pop-up tenants for this holiday season compare to the recent past? And then historically do you know what rate of those tenants convert to a longer-term lease once their temporary lease expires?","David Simon","The pop-up, generally, they don\u2019t convert -- the main pop-ups to decide whether they want to do a longer term deal. But I would say, generally there is an increase this year, primarily because we have a little bit more space from the bankruptcies that we've had this year. But Carol, just to remind you, we don\u2019t include that in our occupancy. It's got to be a year in that, but there will be more activity in pop-up stores for the season just because now we have got a little bit more vacancy due to some of the bankruptcies.","Carol Kemple","And I was thinking of your American Girl Store that's open in Castleton, I've seen where they are basically doing that to test the Indianapolis market. Are you seeing more retailers not just doing a pop-up store for the season but more so to actually test the market?","David Simon","You are starting to see a little bit more of that. I think that's safe to say.","Operator","We do have another question that comes from the line of Ryan Peterson from Sandler O'Neill, please go ahead.","Ryan Peterson","I just wanted to ask about the Houston Galleria and the Houston market and if you guys have seen any change in the shopper demographics there or the retail sales trends more generally and what your expectations are going forward?","David Simon","In what sense?","Ryan Peterson","Just whether you think that Houston will be hit, whether retail is kind of the second impact of oil prices there?","David Simon","Our Galleria is such a great asset. It tends to -- it's kind of the unambiguous number one. For market of that size, it's kind of unambiguous number one shopping center. So it tends to whether any economic downturn generally, but I will say this. Our retailers are not immune to a little bit of a down economy and Houston is also a big tourist market for the Mexican nationals. So there might be some slight sales, retail sales impact. But it will have no impact to the long term great asset that Houston Galleria is as well as we're doing a significant amount of transformation of that asset with the new Saks store, the new Saks Wing, the new Webster's which is going to open in the next thirty days or so. We have a lot of phenomenal stuff going on there, but sure because retail sales be marginally impacted there. Sure, but Houston Galleria tends to continue to way outperform just because it's such a great asset. Rick I don't know if you want to add anything.","Richard Sokolov","I think it is very well positioned and as David said, it's got the unique mix of anchors, restaurants and small shops in that market and it's been very enduring over cycles in the energy belt for decades. And if anything, well I think Houston generally has become less of a -- I would certainly say twenty plus years ago, was more boom bust. But with the medical, it's with the universities, the medical facilities there, it's much more diversified economy than just oil and gas.","Operator","We do have another question that comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","Steve Sakwa","Just two quick questions. I know you've talked a bit about the weakness in the US and all that business. But just what about stuff north of the border, south of the border? Just how kind of are the international assets performing?","David Simon","I'm sorry I didn't hear your first part.","Steve Sakwa","Sorry, is that better?","David Simon","Yes that's better thanks.","Steve Sakwa","I know you've talked about the weakness in the tourism markets for the outlet business here in the US. I'm just curious how the assets in Canada, Mexico, over in Japan, the few that you have over in Europe, how are the non-US ones performing from a sales and leasing Perspective?","David Simon","Again I don't want to overreact. I mean there is a little bit of softness due to the strong dollar U.S. tourism. You're seeing that in all sorts of businesses, hotel business whatever, maybe we are dealing with it. But the fact is the international properties are actually performing very-very well. Europe retail sales is actually relatively impressive, in the Klepierre portfolio, the outlet sales that we have with McArthurGlen are very impressive. Japan, you see that's in our 8-K. They are very impressive, up about 7%. Korea, a little bit soft, I think the only market that's a little soft is Korea, a little bit because they are not the stars, but whatever the last version was. Mars whatever and the Chinese consumer they're probably going a little bit less to Korea for the time being. But I would say Mexico sales are, we've go one asset. Canada is great. Toronto is terrific. Montreal is finding its market increasing. So generally those centers are very-very, we've been very pleased with those results.","Steve Sakwa","And I guess the second question, you sort of briefly touched on Klepierre. I didn't really hear much on the call but just how has the integration gone? If you had to kind of rank on a scale of 1 to 10 of just all the things you want to do, where are you guys in the process of transforming the combined company? ","David Simon","You mean with respect to Corio?","Steve Sakwa","Yes Klepierre Corio and just kind of overall business [multiple speakers].","David Simon","I just want to -- look, they brought Corio, we don\u2019t know and then so we are not integrating with them. I just wanted to distinguish. I would say, look, they've gone, over the three years we've owned it, they have done a lot of transformation, selling a bunch of stuff, buying a bunch of stuff. That's pretty much packed them. The big focus next year is really operationally which they through osmosis or improving their capabilities of doing that, and that's been the big focus, I'd say in '16. Now that the integration with Corio was pretty much done. The sale of the big Carrefour portfolio was done and so I think it's going to be an operational story. But we are not operating the business, we're providing strategic input and I think they've done a very good job of gleaming whatever nuggets of strategy we are able to impart and ignoring the ones that have no value. What, sometimes we don\u2019t have the right strategy. So they are doing a good job. But I think operationally there is, I would say they are the first to admit, they can continue to improve just like we can. And I think that's a big focus for them in the upcoming years. But we are not integrating. I they are running their business.","Steve Sakwa","No-no, I understand that. I'm just saying sitting as Chairman you kind of can sit at the top and look at what they are executing strategically and just trying to figure out how much of the playbook has been done and how much is left to do?","David Simon","Well, there is always a gap in terms of how we might do things versus how they do things there. I still think there is room where they could be operationally better and that will take longer for them to achieve, but I am confident that they will get better. And we will help out as much as we can. They are pretty good and they are doing a good job.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of DJ Busch from Green Street Advisors , please go ahead.","DJ Busch","Just a quick follow-up on the Hudson Bay partnership. Is the opportunity set to do deals like a Kaufhof greater abroad versus here in the States? I guess how do you see that investment growing from a geographic perspective?","David Simon","I do think perhaps the international business may offer a few more opportunities, but they are very creative folks along with our resources dedicated to it, so I wouldn\u2019t rule out domestic opportunities but I would say maybe marginally more opportunities internationally than here. But I wouldn\u2019t rule out domestic opportunities as well.","DJ Busch","And then is the joint venture open to kind of retail leaseback opportunities outside of the traditional department stores as well?","David Simon","Yes.","DJ Busch","Okay. And not to belabor the point on international, the softness in international tourism, but the mills operating metrics were pretty impressive again. I think those are obviously greatly influenced by Sawgrass. Is that similar to your comments on the Galleria? Is Sawgrass one of those assets that kind of bucks the trend?","David Simon","Yes. But we did feel a little bit of softness there as well. So all of these asset is about to trend, but they might have again the retail sales, not the cash flow may have some short term impact. But Sawgrass had a little bit of softness as well. It is not immune.","Operator","Thank you for that. We have no further questions at this time. So I would like to turn the call over to David Simon, Chief Executive Officer for closing remarks.","David Simon","Thank you so much and we will talk to you soon.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes your presentation. You may now disconnect."],"19252":["Simon Property Group, Inc.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Tom Ward, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Thomas Ward - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you, Terrance. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Presenting on today's call is David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also on the call are Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; Andy Juster, Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Broadwater, Chief Accounting Officer.","Before we begin, a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com.","For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you, Tom. Good morning. We got a great start to the year, we continue to achieve strong financial results that exceeded our expectations. We opened two new international outlets in April. We amended and extended our $4 billion revolving credit facility, further enhancing our strong financial flexibility. Results in the quarter were highlighted by FFO of $2.74 per share, an increase of 4.2% compared to the prior year. As a reminder, the prior-year period included a net benefit of $0.08 in FFO per share from a gain on the sale of two residential assets. Normalizing the FFO per share growth rate for the gain in the prior-year period, FFO per share increased approximately 7.5%.","We believe the FFO per share consensus for the first quarter did not include an estimate of our share of the losses from A\u00e9ropostale, which is typical for a retailer in the first quarter. Our share of those operating losses in the first quarter was $0.03. Even though on an annual basis, we measure ourselves versus our plan, and not first-call estimates, let's put in perspective that we have beaten first-call estimates 42 out of the last 44 quarters. The only two misses were one-time write-offs, in 2009, which was the year of The Great Recession. This is an unprecedented performance for the REIT industry, and the S&P 500.","Now, let's go to operating metrics and cash flow. We continue to see strong demand for our space across the portfolio, as evidenced by our mall and premium outlets occupancy end of the quarter at 95.6%, which was flat year-over-year. Leasing activity remains solid, average base minimum rent was $51.87, up 4.4% compared to last year, reflecting strong retailer demand and pricing power for our locations, the malls and the premium outlets recorded leasing spreads of $8.31 per square foot an increase of 13%.","Reported retailer sales per square foot for the malls and outlets was $615 per foot compared to $613 per foot in the prior year period, an increase of 30 basis points. We are pleased to see retail sales increased from the prior year as well as the seasonally strong fourth quarter, also please keep in mind that Easter was in April this year compared to March of last year, which has a real impact on our many leading tourist oriented properties.","Total portfolio NOI increased a very strong 5.6%, or over $80 million for the first quarter and comp increased a strong 3.8% for the quarter. Our best properties are industry-leading assets and large markets and drive the cash flow, growth and profitability of our business. We understand that many of you believe that standard operating metrics just mentioned are of most interest. However, it is important to remember that each of those metrics reflecting equal weighting of each of the properties across our portfolio.","We believe it is important to understand our operating metrics on an NOI weighted basis, which more truly reflects the performance of the portfolio. With that said, if we had done that, reported retailer sales on an NOI weighted basis would be $765 compared to the $615, the average base minimum rent would be $67.60 compared to $51.87.","Leasing spreads would increase to 16.4% compared to the 13%. We have the largest portfolio of the highest quality retail real estate in our industry. These high quality properties drive the growth and cash flow of our business, and what and where retailers want to be located and consumers want to shop and create memorable experience. These weighted metrics clearly demonstrate the highly \u2013 higher quality nature and more accurately reflect the health of our portfolio.","At the end of the first quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were ongoing at 25 properties across all three platforms with our share of net cost at approximately $1.1 billion. Construction continues on several major ones, which we've mentioned before, including the Galleria in Houston, La Plaza Mall, Woodbury Common, and Allen Premium Outlets, most of these projects will be completed in the next 12 months.","Subsequent to the quarter end, we opened two new international outlets with our partner Shinsegae Group, we opened Siheung Premium Outlets in Seoul, South Korea, this center is our fourth premium outlet and build upon its tremendous success we've enjoyed in the region. And with our partner McArthurGlen, we opened Provence Designer Outlet, the first luxury designer outlet in the South of France, construction continues on another full-price development at Fort Worth at The Shops at Clearfork, Neiman Marcus recently opened and the mall will open in the fall of this year.","And we have three new outlets under construction, one in Norfolk, Virginia, two in international markets including Malaysia and Canada. Our share of those four is approximately $300 million. Last week with our partner McArthurGlen, we also acquired Rosada Designer Outlet, a leading outlet center in Netherlands with significant growth opportunity. Just turning quickly to our capital markets, we are very busy as usual, we refinanced our $4 billion revolving credit with the 2022 maturity date our fortress balance sheet with access to many forms of capital continues to differentiate us among our peer group.","Our liquidity stands at more than $7 billion. During the quarter, we also extended our $2 billion share repurchase, and we repurchased 870,000 shares of our common stock. And today we announced a dividend of $1.75 for the quarter, which again is an increase of 9.4% year-over-year.","Finally, we are reaffirming our 2017 guidance in the range of $11.45 to $11.55 per share, which is approximately 6% growth compared to our comparable FFO per share growth, which we believe will lead our retail real estate industry peers. This expected growth is a testament to the strength of our company and our ability to actively manage our portfolio to provide industry-leading returns to our shareholders, even in the current choppy retail environment. We now welcome your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning. Good morning out there.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey, how are you?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I'm doing great. I'm doing great.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","We can hear that. We can hear that in your voice. So, quickly David, first, you guys have a long track record of beating and raising guidance, but you've equally been upfront about the challenges out there in the market. So, just very curious, the no-raise in full-year guidance this year is that because, yeah, there is more A\u00e9ro post-out losses that potentially come up this year as you run that business? Or is it just general caution or you're seeing some things out there as your leasing folks come back or operations people come back that give you a little bit of pause?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, look, I would say, the entire \u2013 again, 42 out of 44, that's 11 years, is that 11 years guys?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","That's 11 years.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","That's 11 years, okay. So, the missed from first call consists was entirely A\u00e9ro, which is very typical for a retailer to have operating losses in the first quarter. So, I would \u2013 in answer to your question simply, it's a little bit of both. I mean A\u00e9ro is a fourth quarter business for \u2013 like most retailers. And there is a range of outcomes there, we're still very comfortable with our investment but there is a range of outcomes that's a little harder to predict. So we're being a little more cautious in that front.","And then obviously on the retail front, I mean, we've got some retailers that were trying to navigate exactly what might happen and so we're being a little more cautious on that front. We're not backing off our comp NOI number even with that uncertainty in the retail world and we'll see. But, I mean, we're not backing off on it, and I'm optimistic that we'll continue to perform very well.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And then the second question is, you guys made the lifetime fitness announcement, but just curious, in general, yeah, you spoke in the past about a lot of apparel brands in the malls and the need to diversify, but at the same time there is also a consumer that's much more fickle they don't, yeah, I mean, there was a Neiman Marcus article, but the shopper is much more conscientious about where they are.","Overall, one, the ability for you guys to really diversify out of apparel into other uses of the mall, how is that going; and two, are you seeing the brands themselves get more serious about understanding that the consumer has changed and therefore full price as full price may not just work anymore, they need to invest more, are you seeing the retailers themselves adapt?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I'm hopeful that the retailers will focus on improving their in-store experience and that could be a lot of different ways, that could be through technology, that could be through a better look and feel, that could be through better merchandise et cetera. Now, I will tell you, I mean, this is the great narrative that is being absolutely ignored by the national media. And I continue to tour properties each and every week as does Rick, as does our team, the traffic is there. It's so funny when all the malls go out of business, what are these poor people going to do instead of going to the mall. I don't know, I mean, I just think the narrative is a way ahead of itself, the traffic is strong, it was up throughout our portfolio were we measure it, but you know at the end of the day, we've all got to have a better experience for the consumer, because they're tough nut to crack. We also need a growing economy. I mean our GDP growth is going to be anybody's guess, what's your guess, Alex?","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","GDP something probably in the 2%, a little over 2%.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, what is it for this first \u2013 what is that for this first quarter?","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","It's subdued. It's subdued, but if we get anything out of DC, it should be better.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I mean, I have been waiting a lot of stuff for DC, I'm still waiting for the internet sales taxation fairness to kick-in. So, the reality is people are going to the good centers, traffic is up, our sales even with Easter being in April are up. Our NOI is up, our comp NOI is 3.8%, we've certainly got some retailers that have not performed the way they wanted to or should have, a lot of that was driven by the private equity leveraging up. These businesses more than just the common theme, which is the internet. I'm hopeful that they're going to reinvest in their stores, improve their inventory mix, and service their customer better.","And, by the way, we've got to have the same pressure on us to do that. So, it's a two-way street. We are up for the challenge. We have the conviction in our business to do that as you know if you go through our properties by and large, they look they feel great. We're going to redevelop a lot of opportunities. I think any department stores, if and when we get back, are great opportunity for the company. King of Prussia is a great example, Penney's announced closing. We could have saved that deal, we decided absolutely unequivocally not. We're going to make that a mixed-use development, won't be apparel-oriented. So again, we're frustrated only by the narrative, but not by what's happening in our business.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Thanks, David.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Spector from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, thank you. I'm here with Craig Schmidt. David, Rick, to be a little bit more specific on the retailers, there have been many more plans announced for spending in bricks-and-mortar for closings. I guess, can we be a little bit more specific and help us, provide your latest view, are you happy with the current announcements, is it enough because the last couple of years you have been asking for this?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, we don't \u2013 we really do not comment \u2013 I'm not sure I understand your question. But we really don't \u2013 we don't think this is a good form to comment on retail specific issues. As I said, there are things I'm happy to comment on like, we are \u2013 apparel has been in the doldrums, we are moving our mix away from that, I think we've done that already, we've lowered it Rick by...","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","That was 5% or 6%.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. We've lower that already. We do think private equity has been more of a detriment to our and by the way most of these guys are my buddies, okay. But I mean, when you lever up, you lever up any business, whether it's the mall business, the retail business, and you can't invest in your product, then you got a problem. We've seen a lot of that. I'm happy to talk to you about that trend, but I'm not sure \u2013 I'm not going to sit here and comment on specific retailers, I'm not really sure Jeff what you're after, explain it?","Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess, are you feeling better now that the retailers are finally talking about specific investments in the stores pruning some of their portfolios, it feels like finally they are taking some action before, or Craig and I said, it is a little confusing to figure out, are these winning formulas or not?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I think my concern about how they overspent in the Internet versus the store fleet continues to be a concern for me. But I do think they're starting given that the returns in the online between free shipping and free returns is no man's land form and the price transparency and no service add, value add, I hopefully, they'll recognize that they should pivot toward the in-store experience.","And I think that's beginning to happen. I also think as I've mentioned to you in the past that there is a number of Internet \u2013 pure Internet retailers that will not be able to really sustain their business model and my humble opinion unless they have a physical presence. So, they're still cleaning out to do and we will suffer from that like anybody else, but at the end of the day, if there is less retail space in the United States and I expect there to be, so I'm not suggesting that it won't be, we will be the net beneficiary of that because of the vastness of our portfolio and scale helps and a big balance sheet helps.","So we've got $7 billion of capital ready to go to work in whatever form we can do to increase our profitability. And so we'll weather the storm like we have in the past, we've done some of our best work when it's the most foggiest and that's what we do, and that's why we're making $11.50, that's why that's the REIT's highest per share number and that's why dividends grow more than anybody else, and I don't know what else to tell you, that's what we do.","I'm not \u2013 we haven't backed off our comp NOI. Do we have to work to get to the 3%? You're darn right, but we put that pressure on us each and every year and yeah, sometimes we don't get to the finish line, but we get pretty damn close most of the time. So again, I have no idea if I'm answering your question, but that's what we do.","Jeffrey A. Spector - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That helps, thanks. And Craig has just one quick question.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, great. Thanks. Just given the strength and shift to some of the value and discount retailers. I'm wondering if we may see the introduction of more value off price like Marshalls at Del Amo and T.J. HomeGoods at Prien Lake Mall.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I think there'll be a little bit more of that for sure. They do a great job, a lot of the discounters. And I think there is a great opportunity for us to bring them in into the mall environment. Not \u2013 you wouldn't want to do it in every mall environment, but certainly there is a handful of malls that make sense to do that and I do think that will continue. And look, reality is \u2013 the mall \u2013 and again, this is what frustrates us is that the traffic that we see in the malls is good. So yeah, we can always point out to a mall that's gone out of business or the mall that's done, that's got no traffic, like we can at hotel, like we can \u2013 movie company that makes movies and they have a flop, doesn't mean all movies are a flop. It just means that one movie they have is a flop.","We could talk about network TV and talk about the lineup that all they have and they have a new show that's a flop. Well, it's conceivable that in our portfolio we have a couple of flops, but it's immaterial. That's why we gave you those weighted NOI statistics to reinforce that. But the reality is that we do think that in some of these properties, we will be able to bring in some of that \u2013 because I think some of these centers that they're in and the strip center will might suffer a little bit, and they're going to go where the traffic is. And in most cases it's the mall environment, not everyone, but in most cases.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Christy McElroy from Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, it's Michael Bilerman. The good news is Mall Cop and this is not a flop.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","The Mall Cop, the number two wasn't that great, but I think the first one was pretty good.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. So, David, strategically over the years, you've been able to adapt to different cycles, right. You're very early on in the consolidation wave, focusing on these big major market malls. You got into the outlet business, when you bought Chelsea, you bought Mills, enhancing sort of all the value retail. You sold off or spun-off certain lower-quality weaker malls, lower productivity smaller assets. You expanded globally and you had a rock-solid balance sheet.","So as we think about adapting to the cycle, where is your main focus? Is it adapting and putting more mixed use at your properties? Is it may be going further global? Do you want to focus on other forms of retail, and I don't know maybe get back into the strip center business? Is it really focusing on this whole model of the future and the consumer experience in taking ownership of the consumer at your mall? I guess \u2013 or is it something completely else? How should we be thinking about your next adaptation to the cycle?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well it's very, very good question. So, let's just talk about our businesses in those segments. Our European and Asian business is actually very strong. So that's good news. Our outlet business and mills business continues to prosper, continues to have very good comp NOI growth. And the mall business generally is dealing with a lot of the retailers that we generally understand and know that are out there in the public. However, the great opportunity I think in that business will continue to be reclaiming the department stores and our opportunity to redevelop them that will further expand the mix, whether it's mixed use, whether it's lifetime, whether it's some community-oriented activity. But I think that's going to be a big focus for us is, how do we take advantage of the department store, we do and I think Sandeep has done a very good job explaining this, we do probably have too many department stores in each, in the mall business.","And so, but instead of looking that as a concern, given that they pay no rent, we actually think that's a great opportunity for our redeveloping the mall to the next level. And again, I don't think there is any cookie-cutter answer, but since they don't provide any income, there is nothing but upside in how we redevelop and redevelop those assuming we get the appropriate return on cost.","So, I would certainly say that's a very important phase what we've got to focus on. And I'd say the next very important phase is we do continue to bring technology into the mall environment, just like many retailers are bringing technology hopefully to their in-store environment. And I think what that will do is make the shopping trip more convenient, more productive, and they'll gain more knowledge by going through the mall. And we've right now under development in a pretty significant way to deliver product, probably realistically a year from now that might facilitate that with also collecting the data, that's important to be able to communicate directly with the consumer. So I would say, those are two areas.","And then obviously, we're going to be opportunistic, that's just the way we are. There are no current plans to be opportunistic, but that's just part of our core culture here is to try and be opportunistic when we can.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. My second question is, you talked about the narrative that effectively every models did despite the traffic in sales that are going on in your assets. And I'm curious, if you can share with us some of the tone of your leasing discussions with both the bricks-and-mortar retailers that are expanding and want to open stores and how those discussions or negotiations are going with the overarching negative narrative that's out there. But also discuss how those discussions are going with the pure e-tailers that are expanding their bricks-and-mortar presence? And whether there's a difference, clearly the narrative is only on one-sided with all these tenants that are shrinking their store base or going bankrupt. Clearly there has to be some positive to produce the sales of a traffic that you're talking about?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. And I want Rick to answer that. But again, the ones that essentially, if you really cut through it all, the ones that aren't surviving in a tough REIT apparel environment or the ones that were highly levered and had the imprint of private equity on it, okay. And again, I'm going to get a lot of criticism from all my buddies, but that's the truth. So if you look at kind of where that pressure point has been, it's more than just our apparel business is bad, it's because, well, they couldn't survive with leverage on it. They paid a special dividend, they bought stock back, they did some financial maneuvering that increased the pressure that wouldn't allow them to deal with a kind of non-robust meddling environment.","With that said, I'd like Rick to comment on the rest of it.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I would tell you Michael, the key as in all of these things is the person with the most compelling properties is going to win and all you have to do is, visit some of our properties like King of Prussia, ,like Galleria, like Sawgrass Mills, like Woodbury across the four platforms and you will see new retailers, both the e-tailers and the international retailers and our existing brands and new designer brands that all wanted to take advantage of the space that is becoming available either because we created it, because we took back space from underproductive retailers or we consolidated those on productive retailers into more productive space to free up space. There is still very compelling demand out there across each of the ones that you talked about. Are we fighting about rent? Sure. But we've been fighting with our tenants about rent for 40 years, that doesn't change.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you, guys.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. I've just a couple of questions. Maybe Rick and David, just to kind of follow that theme on leasing. I know occupancy was flat year-over-year, but you had a little bit of a bigger decline sequentially. I know that there is always a decline sequentially, but it seems to be a little bit bigger and probably stems from some of the bankruptcies. Can you maybe just talk or help quantify, how much of that space has been released and do you have any kind of occupancy goals that you can share with us for the end of the year?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Steve, I would just simply say the metrics are the metrics we focus more on comp NOI growth. And I mean, obviously, if you go back in a little bit of 2015 we had more bankruptcies than 2016. This year, we'll probably have more in 2017 and certainly 2016. And some of these are still in a state of flux. So, I would not want to like tell you where our occupancy is, other than to say we haven't backed off the comp NOI number of three.","Like I said, we're got a lot of work to continue to do, but that comment I would say first quarter in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, I mean that's just the way we look at our business. So, that's the number that we're more focused on than sales per square foot, rents spreads, and occupancy, it's all manifest itself. You put it all in a blender and it all manifests itself into one number and that's the number that I care about.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC","Right, I think \u2013 well, now I understand that, I think just to the extent that there was maybe a step or step-and-a-half back and people just want to see the progress moving forward, which obviously will manifest itself in NOI growth. I think if there was just a way to help quantify how much of that's maybe already been put to better lease, might just give some clarity that leasing remains strong, but...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, look we're making deals, I mean and we're moving the pile. If we worth-making deals given the bankruptcies and the store closures that we're dealing with, we couldn't produce the 3% comp NOI number, that we weren't doing new business. So that's how I would answer that. I mean, again, I don't \u2013 we don't look at occupancy the way you might and I'm not disrespecting how you might look at it. I'm just telling you, the way we run our businesses for comp NOI or cash flow growth and we're not \u2013 if we didn't have any new lease up given the bankruptcy and store closures that exist in our industry, we wouldn't be able to get to that 3%. So I hope that gives you at least some trend as to how we feel about leasing up some of that space.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah. Okay. I guess, secondly, you've mentioned traffic strong and it's upwards measured and you said it's good. Do you have any sort of stats you could share and if you've done anything sort of technology-wise in the malls to help quantify this and if you have, is that data that you'll be sharing with us over time to perhaps comment (34:43)","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, you know how I feel. I think we have given you plenty of data, okay. So the odds of us giving you more data are not great, but I will tell you that in the \u2013 we don't have traffic counters in every mall, but we have in a good percentage of our malls and I standby that traffic comment, we have parking counters in our outlet business and when you factor in through April and I had it somewhere but I can't find it. If we have it through April, our traffic overall in \u2013 because it's important to remember, March had Easter of last year. The traffic \u2013 the parking counters in our outlet business is up one or, I'm sorry, Rick now has the number in front of me, 2%. So that gives you a barometer when you look at, if it was through March in the outlet business, it would be essentially \u2013 we look at it by region, be essentially flat. But it's up 2% given the \u2013 if you go all the way through Easter in April.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thanks. And I guess just last question. As you think about sort of CapEx and what you need to spend to kind of maintain malls or to keep the cash flow growing, do you get a sense that there may be a higher level of CapEx that's needed to generate that 3% compounded CapEx. And do you sense that the returns on the boxes that you may recapture might change possibly to the downside as you take these stores back?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I don't think so at all because we're up against very little income against those boxes. So it's a function of what you pay for them and what the income is and the last thing we'll do is hold. I mean, that's not to say we don't make silly decisions here. But we know we can back into what the right number is to buy that box. Like King of Prussia, we get it for free. It's a lease. The lease ends, I think, in 2020. And they're going to pay the rent all the way through it, which is great, we get to redo our plans, maybe we'll get the mat early, but that's all given that lease payment, I mean that's a lot of upside. So, I think it's possible a deal here or there, it might be, but that's always been the case, and Steve as you know, we spent a lot of capital in the portfolio to upgrade the look and feel.","We're going to continue to do that, the worst thing that we can do and this is a comment for everyone. And the whole \u2013 is not invest in our business, that's the worst thing you can do. And I've seen it, and I don't care if it's a hotel, an office building, a movie business, the network business, the internet business, if you don't invest in your product, you can't continue to produce returns, that's the nature of Corporate America.","And so, we're going to continue to invest, I think the returns will be there, and I don't think the dynamics of today's current environment have changed that. So, that's what we see, but again if something changes, I think it's a fair question and if we feel a trend there we'll start to set expectations differently.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thanks. That's it from me.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Morgan from Canaccord. Your line is open.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Just on the buyback, we've talked in the past about kind of how the role you see stock buybacks and how you used in the past with around specific catalyst. And maybe you could just comment on the buyback in the first quarter and given where your evaluation is, how you think about that as a use of your free cash flow relative to redevelopments and other uses?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, the good news is, we'll not crowd out our investment in our product. That's the most important thing you cannot do. And we've seen it as an example at the department store level where stock buybacks have crowded out store investment. We will not let that happen. On the other hand, we have spent a lot of capital on our portfolio. You know kind of what we expect there. And other than \u2013 I think the first quarter should continue to give you an expectations of what we'll continue to do. Obviously, the price is lower. And you do come into a blackout period that you're all familiar with. That has almost gone. And we think, I mean, you can do the math, we believe in our business, we believe in our product, we can do both and we will do both.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. So, this is sort of \u2013 you see right now at least at kind of these levels, there is sort of a recurring role to play for the buyback alongside your other CapEx initiatives? That's fair?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I think that's a fair assessment.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. And then just kind of secondly, a lot of people kind of have concerns about the outlet industry just because of what seems to be a disproportionate share of the apparel and accessories retailers, which has been a tough segment more broadly, and I was wondering, because you lump them together, broadly \u2013 although, I appreciate the traffic comment, if you could talk about maybe, whether there is much of a disparity in terms of kind of the momentum there from, I think, same-store NOI perspective? And then maybe, if Rick is able to provide some of the retailers who are sort of kind of taking space that, it might be coming back from other segments that are liquidating investment like that...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. I'm glad you brought that up, because we've heard this like, chatter. Absolutely, unequivocally the business is strong. It's so far from the chatter, I don't really know how to react other than we can start breaking out statistics again and my goodness, we'd like to be viewed in totality about our entity as opposed to a bunch of statistics, but the reality is absolutely not, it's that chatter is inaccurate, the only pressure that we've seen in the outlet business, which we've been consistent in describing, is we have a number of tourist-oriented centers, and given the strong dollar, we continue to see muted spending because the tourism and all of the psychology of coming to America is different than it was maybe a few months ago. We're dealing with that, but if you isolate those, it's absolutely au contraire, I wanted to show people, if all my years of going to Paris, I can speak French, and no, that chatter is just wildly false. So, I don't know, what else to tell you.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","I was just wondering if Rick can maybe talk about something that were (43:20) growing in that segment in particular?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I mean you garble there.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Oh, sorry, I was just seeing if Rick could maybe talk about any of the retailers that are sort of taking space like he's done in the past, but particularly focused on the outlet side?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","The answer is I could, in fact I have a list here of them, I could take up the rest of the call with the names, but because David always makes fun of me when I rattle off names, I'll be very limited. But things to bear in mind with our outlet business, we have some of the greatest outlet centers in the world. So literally we're getting international designer tenants that are opening their first, second or third outlet store in the world at our properties. But we're having the more people that are in bulk; ASICS, Citizen, Scotch & Soda, (44:10) I could go on and on, I literally have a paper in front of me of probably 150 names, and one of the reasons it's so strong is because the occupancy has been so high, this is the first time we've had even a little inventory that we can accommodate all the people that want to grow. So it is just not an issue whatsoever with demand.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. And I think an important point is that the value oriented, I mean, you can get discounted goods a lot of places and it certainly proliferated, but to the consumer having them all together in a nice pretty coherent layout is why consumers will travel to our outlet centers and shop and I will tell you this. The comp NOI growth in our outlet business exceeded the mall business, okay. So, I've heard this chatter, I don't know where it's coming from but I'm here to officially refute it.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning. You and your retail peers don't report same-store revenue and expense growth, just NOI. So, I was just wondering if you could comment on those two pieces of revenue versus expenses? How they've been trending? It seems like some of your NOI growth maybe more attributable to the expense savings side versus revenue growth?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","That's incorrect. You see our P&L. You can analyze it. That I thought that's your job.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Then on the same-store NOI, you guys did have a strong first quarter which is above your full-year guidance of 3%. So, I was just wondering, if we should expect a slowdown later in the year or if you're more just sticking to the previously laid-out guidance of 3%?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I think I already answered that question a couple of times. And we've affirmed our guidance, that's really all that I need to answer on that front.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Then just last one on the development pipeline, mall redevelopments and the grand of (46:46) outlets have been a traditional good growth drivers? So I was just wondering what your outlook is for new outlet supply and to what extent also separate from your (46:57) JV, you might be able to be proactive with some of your Sears stores?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, on the outlet side, we've got a very interesting pipe. I think in Asia, we've got a very interesting pipe with McArthurGlen. We're hopeful to start a new project in Spain here in the next couple of months and I think the investment community should realize, we have a really strong business outside of the U.S. and it's worth much more than what it's on our books, okay? But, put that aside. So, there is a nice pipe through McArthurGlen. And by the way, we just open a new center in Provence, which is \u2013 which we own 90% of and that's no small feat to accomplish in France, and we have our partner McArthurGlen to thank for that.","We have a very nice pipe in Asia, very nice pipe in France. We will have one project that we'll probably start construction in the next couple of months in the U.S., which we'll announce shortly. And then, we've got a couple of more that are in the works that will probably won't start till 2017 \u2013 I'm sorry, 2018 for 2019 delivery.","So, we continue to look for opportunities on this \u2013 there is nothing more than what we do is plan for potential department store redevelopments. And we're working both on sourcing the demand and then ultimately, trying to get the boxes back and that's an ongoing process that will continue to be. But we think that will be beneficial to the company in the long run.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Someone has to go back to that CapEx question. And you have a lot of great information on your supplemental. But one thing that isn't very clear is how much CapEx, quarter-to-quarter you're having to payout to get that 3% or 3.8% same-store NOI or those leasing spreads? So, I was curious, how has that trended over time, and he (49:27) was talking about retailers investment in their stores, but are you incrementally having to find that maybe you help \u2013 you have to help them out with that part of process?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah, this is Rick. Frankly, though the thing I think you're probably referring to is our tenant allowances and if you look, they've been relatively consistent over a very long period of time, we give virtually no allowance on our renewals. We tell you the allowances that we do on a per square foot basis for our new leases and happily this quarter it happened to be a little higher, because we're able to do a lot of great leasing for some very high impact tenants, and so it's a little more allowance, but as David has said consistently all that is built into our NOI growth, and it is consistent with where we've been over a long period of time.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. So nothing on the margin, that's changing at all?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","No, I mean, it moves from quarter-to-quarter, but no, we don't \u2013 we \u2013 here's you got to put companies in \u2013 you got to think a little bit broad, Kim. There if we were loosey-goosey with our capital, we wouldn't have the best balance sheet in the business with the most fire power. So we don't buy upper end, we don't throw capital after tenants that may fail, that doesn't mean we don't make mistakes but we \u2013 there is just no change in our approach to that, and it will never change, and that's why see these things are related, right. That's why you have \u2013 that's why we have the balance sheet here as because, you're right, it is all about capital allocation. It is all about not putting good money in the rabbit hole. And we are not perfect there. We make mistakes. We do take chances every once in a while. But there's just no trend there, it's just not what we do as a company and I'm \u2013 would have hoped that seeing us operate for this long period of time, you would understand that.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And just a second question, going back to your comments about technology. From a consumer standpoint, when I go into a \u2013 you might not like this, but when I go into a Westfield mall or a Simon mall, I think, from a consumers perspective, it doesn't \u2013 you can't really tell a difference, right? And why I say that because, some of the technology improvements you're trying to make, at the end of the day, do you think the mall companies have to be more collaborative to really make a big change? And what they're offering at the malls?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, first of all, I view that as a complement. I think, Westfield is a very good operator. So, that's number one. Number two is, look, we do \u2013 it is potential, we could collaborate. We do that currently for instance Deliv is a consortium of three or four mall owners. We talk to \u2013 the mall owners talk on technology front all the time. We talk to Westfield, we talk to General Growth, we talk to Macerich, Taubman, et cetera. When there's a new product that we think and that we can \u2013 because at the end of the day, we really don't compete all that much locally. I mean, if you are really fascinating about our businesses, yeah, we have skirmishers here and there. But we don't have a lot of overlap with our top operatives in markets of all that significance. So, there is the potential to collaborate, we're more than happy to. And I do think there is potential to do that and we have done it, and there'll certainly be more potential as we move forward.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to ask questions. It seems like the bankruptcies that have been filed so far have come fairly late in the quarter. So, I just curious, if you had relative to the 120 basis points or 130 basis points quarter-over-quarter decline in the ending occupancy, do you have a sense of what the average occupancy was for the first quarter?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","No.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No. Okay. Is it fair to say that there would be some lingering impact from what's already happened now in the second quarter?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I mean, yeah, I mean we can, again we'll look at it. It's just not, we're not obsess with it, okay. We'll look at it and maybe Tom will give you the number, maybe he won't, I don't know, okay.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And then earlier, you had mentioned that the department stores are a big opportunity that you're looking at. And just curious in the near term, you got three anchor expiries, I think they're all \u2013 just looking at the average size, looks like department stores. Curious, if there's an opportunity with those three or how those discussions are going?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Basically, those were all subject to option. So we expect them to be exercised.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then last question. Just in terms of the comments you've made today and in the past about retailers investing in their stores more maybe than the omni-channel or the e-commerce side of their businesses, can you just maybe share a little bit, I know we've asked this question in the past too, but just in terms A\u00e9ropostale in-store investments, some of what you're doing on that front?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah, they did a clean up to restart the brand during when it went from the liquidator to the new owners. It wasn't really material, but it was a good beginning to reintroduce the brand to the consumer. And centrally most of the stores were touched, some more than others.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And I guess, are there further plans for other in-store investments that sort of improve the...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah, look, I think that's probably not this year, but we'll \u2013 we evaluate it all the time, we're not afraid to invest in it, but it's \u2013 to go through bankruptcy is somewhat traumatic, okay. So, and again, we weren't in-charge of liquidating it in the periods. So, again, I don't want to get into all the technicalities of it, but we just took it over January, I don't know, 1 or 2 or 6, whatever the date was. So, this year is just to stabilize it, we did clean up to reintroduce it. We are sourcing new product. We are going through all that, but it's the first year.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Your line is open.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Good morning, thanks for taking my question.","So, first question, can you share what the average price of the stock you repurchased during the first quarter was?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","It will be in our Q.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","But I think it was around $1.74.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Got it. Okay. We've seen you do a few non-retail developments to some of your top urban properties. The hotel at Phipps Plaza, hotel in Luxury Tower at Galleria. So, I guess my question is, what's your appetite for more of these office apartment or hotel type of projects. What role do you envision in playing in platform going forward and can you give us a broad sense of what type of returns you look for?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, we're going to do returns that create value for our shareholders, that's number one. Number two, I don't think we'll do much office frankly other than we have built office on top of the few of our new developments like at Domain and Clearfork, just to name a few. We think that's nice mix, but I don't think \u2013 I sell the land or do something probably before I built an office tower and I think we have a very nice pipeline for hotels and multi-family throughout the portfolio. We're talking to a lot of people. We got some great plans and I think that will be a growth vehicle for the company going forward.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","So it sounds like you are bringing some partners for that.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, yes and no, we might. We'll certainly bring in operators, but we could bring another developers that just \u2013 it depends on the market and there is \u2013 again there is no one set answer, but the reality is we could do both and we have done both.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. One if you more on readout please. So, first, can you talk about the lease up and early feel for some of your recent readouts and expansions like at Roosevelt Field, Del Amo, King of Prussia. I know, it's a bit early in some of these cases and you have a strong track record. But I'm wondering how pleased are you with the early read and trends from these projects and have your return expectations changed at all versus your underwriting?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Not really. I mean, the \u2013 it always takes time to lease up new expanded space. Most good developments do not have a 100% lease to start, you always kind of want to calibrate or you want to wait for the retailer. I'd say we're pretty much on plan on those.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. And then, your upcoming projects, Norfolk, some of the others any change in readout expectations there \u2013 return expectations? Are we still thinking similarly 7%, 8%?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Norfolk will do better than that. But now it's all in our 8-K and you can see nothing really changed, in terms of our returns.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Mueller from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. I was wondering, can you talk a little bit about the 2017 leasing plan and how far through you are? And also, on the development and redevelopment spend front, are you still expecting about $1 billion a year in 2017 and 2018?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yes, on $1 billion a year. And Rick, you want to...","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. On the renewals in 2017, we're probably about 10 basis \u2013 100 basis points ahead of where we were last year at this time and we're already starting on 2018. And we're probably about 20% due our 2018 renewals, which is ahead of where we were in 2017 this time last year. So, we're very focused on that and making good progress against it.","Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. That was it. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from Carol Kemple from Hilliard Lyons. Your line is open.","Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L.

Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Loved the French earlier, David, though I think the pronunciation could do some work.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Among other things...","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I can't talk...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I can barely speak English (61:43) French","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Few questions. I guess, just first I was curious, I mean, earlier this month, David Contis announced his plans to leave, I was just curious how his departure affected succession planning for leadership roles at Simon, does that cause you to rethink some things?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","No, I mean, David left for family reason. Yes, there is no impact on succession planning there. And it gives \u2013 we have a great strength in our bench and our development team; Kathy Shields, John Phipps, we just hired a real quality veteran that was in Luxottica running that real estate, Mike Nevins. So we have a very good bench and so really not much to say beyond that. So no worries on that front.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And maybe for Rick, I recognize maybe it's early for some of those, but in situations where you guys have ether had anchor closures or even a competing mall in the market that you compete with has closed, do you guys have any harder anecdotal data and I guess I would call the sales transfer that you might have ticked up either the other anchors in the same mall or your mall relative to a close competing mall, I'm just curious how that shift might have happened because usually retail sales aren't destroyed, they sort of move elsewhere.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Anecdotally, what we have heard from our department stores is that they do gain market share both when they close their stores in the market and frankly that was the point that David alluded to earlier when he said in the long run, this retail consolidation is going to benefit us because those sales that are in the market, we're going to get our share of them. Also, we have heard from our department stores that when a store closes in the mall, those shoppers for the most part stay in the mall and those sales do get redistributed among the other department stores that are in the property.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","The most interesting thing on that front is that when they \u2013 if they do close a store or they leave a market, those Internet sales that are in that market go bye-bye. So that's really the \u2013 just to broaden your question in terms of the answer, I mean that's what's interesting when they leave a market, those Internet sales in that market tend to go bye-bye.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And what's your take on concept of grocers returning to the mall. One of your competitors has paid a little bit of lip service to that and I'm just curious what do you guys that think about that dynamics since it's been frankly a very long time since the mall industry has had grocers, I think I last saw them in like The Blues Brothers movie or something?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, you hit like anything else. There is certainly opportunities and when there are opportunities, we take advantage of them. We added Wegmans in Montgomery Mall. We've added Fresh Market in The Falls. We're literally in a process of adding a supermarket right now at College Mall where we demolished the Sears. So where it fits the market, there's certainly a great use. You got to be able to accommodate their physical constraints and it also has to make sense economically, but we're actively talking to them. And hopefully we'll have others that are going to find their way into our properties as we get space available.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah, I think it's a good move and we'll certainly pursue it. So, we think it's interesting and we have done in the past, we'll continue to do it.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just a last question, maybe a little involved, as it relates to occupancy costs, the last several years Apple has been and other retailers have been early pronounced influence on mall sales. Some people have estimated that adding an Apple to the mall or a Tesla, for example, can boost overall sales on average about $100 a square foot. But that 10%, 15%, 20% increase in mall sales sort of implies that the typical in-line retailers' occupancy costs might actually be 15% to 20% higher than the mall average that we can kind of see.","And I guess my concern is just, is it that the occupancy cost where a typical retailer might be at a big premium, but at a time when their margins are under a lot of pressure, I guess, the question here is, do you really think occupancy costs in the next few years can continue to hold steady or do you think we're doing to see some need for them to roll down just because maybe they've risen to a point where it's just very difficult for them to afford it, given where there profits are?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I think it's a retailer-by-retailer case. That's certainly the case for some retailers without question. So, it's a case-by-case. So one thing I would \u2013 with respect to your question, remember our sales, we have all the outlets in it. So the dramatic impact is from a highly productive tenant is not that \u2013 it's not dramatic, okay. That's not to say though. There aren't \u2013 certainly, there are some retailers that \u2013 because their productivity is so low that they have too high \u2013 they can't afford the rent, that's what makes our business. That's what's moved our number is that those guys go out and we find somebody else to replace them. If we could not replace retailers, then it would be an issue, but we can and we have to, and that's what we do.","In Europe as another example, I mean, the occupancy cost there are much greater for in line tenants, yet they have all find the ability to become more profitable. So, again, I think certainly that's the case for some retailers. When that happens, we tend to replace some and again when you think about the impact on some of those higher productivity tenants, just put in less than perspective because we meld in the outlet business, so that doesn't make it as \u2013 not that it doesn't have an impact, but it's not dramatic.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Understood. Thanks, guys.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. No worries.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS. Your line is open.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. I just want to go back to the redevelopment issue, in particular when you're redeveloping an anchor box. Can you give us some of the math behind your 7% target return? For example, is there a good rule of thumb on the cost to reposition, the space on a per square foot basis?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","There is really no rule of thumb, every one of these development opportunities is evaluated on its own and the returns are going to be a function of how you redeploy the space. If it's all small shops, the returns could be considerably higher. If you're substituting a single user into the existing box, the returns could be a little bit lower, but the capital expenditure will be lower. It's a case-by-case situation and frankly, as you can see, when you look at our reporting, we've been very active in bringing anchors to our property and that's been going on for years. And it's going to hopefully only accelerate as we get control of more of the space.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. I guess, if you're replacing an anchor with like Dick's for example. I mean, is there a \u2013 on a per square foot build, is it $200 a foot, is it $300 a foot, I mean any perspective you can give us on that?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","No. We don't go into the specifics. I mean, that's something we disclose our capital in our schedules, but we're not going to go into the specifics of an individual redevelopment project.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. I guess, the reason I ask is because there is obviously a lot of questions about where are rents going, where is occupancy going, I think one of the other concerns from investors is the amount of capital going to malls and how much of it is really a return on investment or rather just maintenance capital and so?","Andrew A. Juster - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Look, I encourage those inventors to look at our financial statements, okay? I mean, that's what instead of the rhetoric, instead of the narrative, just look at our financial statements, okay? Look at our return on equity. I don't know what else to tell you then. I know you're trying to get ahead of a trend. But I mean we disclosed a tremendous amount of information. And I would just encourage you to look at our financial statements.","Nick Yulico - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks. Appreciate it.","Andrew A. Juster - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, David. Just had a quick question about A\u00e9ropostale and sort of going back to the operating losses. Appreciate why 1Q is seasonally a low income quarter. But just thinking about A\u00e9ropostale specifically, the last time they publically reported, it looks like they posted operating losses in every quarter with first quarter and second quarter obviously being the worst. So, just in terms of modeling purposes, so wondering if you could maybe give any sort of frame of reference for how much the operating losses compare to 2015? And if we should think about that $0.03 as consistent for 2Q and then coming back down, how should we think about that from a modeling purpose?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah, we don't give quarterly guidance, number one. We think that's a waste of everybody's intellectual curiosity. There's just no way to compare it to 2015 and 2016 because the fleet was the 1,000 stores and now it's 500. We've done a dramatic job on sourcing, we've done a dramatic job on overhead. And again, we're just building the inventory back up because of the liquidation. So it's really an apple and an orange. And the reality is, just to put in perspective, $0.03 on $2.74 is what percent is that? Somebody do it, 1%. So it's not like it is what it is in our cash investment between OpCo and IPCo was in the $33 million. So again, let's just put all of this stuff in perspective. And again, it will probably continue to have generally \u2013 it will probably continue to have operating losses through the \u2013 until the fourth quarter, but I'm not going to give you per share stuff, because we just don't do that \u2013 per quarter stuff, I should say.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Good. Got it. And I wasn't looking for you to give guidance, I appreciate you don't give quarterly guidance. I was just looking for some frame of reference that...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. I...","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","...operating loss is 50%.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Rich, I know you're smart, but you can't go back to 2015 and 2016, because that company is completely different then it is today. So...","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, exactly. And that was sort of the \u2013 I guess, the point of my question, is it 50% of the losses that it was in 2015 or not. But okay...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well \u2013 and fact of the matter is, we're not \u2013 I don't even look at 2015 or 2016, I am looking at what they're doing going forward.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. My pleasure, my pleasure.","Operator","And our next question comes from Linda Tsai from Barclays. Your line is open.","Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for taking my call. Maybe to alleviate some of the fears here in terms of the store closures that have occurred since the 4Q call. Can you just give us a sense of a percentage of ABR those stores would represent collectively in your portfolio?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","The \u2013 let me \u2013 I don't understand it. Can you restate the question, please?","Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure. In terms of the store closures that have occurred since the 4Q call, the incremental ones, what percentage of ABR does that represent in your portfolio?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","It's not how we would look at it, so what percent of the average base rent would we \u2013 I don't \u2013 the answer is I don't know.","Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Something like annualized rent.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We put in \u2013 look, the way we look at it is, we've got our total revenues for our properties, not our share, but our total is over $6 billion, right? So, it's very \u2013 it's immaterial when you look at it on that perspective.","Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then you've touched on this topic already, but maybe just to ask a little differently. When an anchor goes dark, what's your thought process that goes on to decide the best and highest use of that space? To the extent that you're getting these anchors back faster and sooner than you expected, are you thinking about these redevelopments differently in aggregate, maybe from a merchandizing perspective than when they were fewer happening across the retail landscape?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, we're always thinking about things differently, I would say. In this case, the reality is, we don't have any empty boxes, okay? Now, I guess King of Prussia is going to be empty and that will be our one and only empty box. And I guess, it's fair to say that we are thinking about that a little bit differently and that given the dramatic changes that the malls had in that particular area of the wing, with Sears going out and Primark and DICK's taking that over. And the interest in mixed use, we'll probably go more mixed use, more big box, and since we added all the small shops connecting the two malls, yeah, you could say maybe, our thinking is different, but I would tell you that I \u2013 hopefully it evolves every day, so maybe on the margin.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","But I would also say to you that we are analyzing virtually every box that we have and we keep a running strategic assessment of who is not in each of our properties that would be appropriate to be added to that property including the other mixed use potential because it's a market specific analysis. So we are anticipating potential opportunities to recover these boxes, and so we are not going to be caught flat-footed when the opportunity present themselves.","Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum from Boenning. Your line is open.","Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood","Great. Thanks, guys. I have a question. And David, this sort of relates to your comments about your private equity friends employing leverage. What are your plans for your Hudson Bay joint venture? And what do you \u2013 how do you see that business evolving?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I don't know \u2013 Floris, I don't know why you would relate those two. I mean, those are \u2013 those guys are real operators, and I think they're going to \u2013 they're evolving to be best-in-breed, so in that, in the department store area. So look, I think that we've got so much optionality with that joint venture, it's \u2013 right now, it's business as usual, but those optionality to take it to another level is as the landscape changes, but right now, it's business as usual. We're looking at selective boxes to redevelop within the existing portfolio. They continue to improve upon their fleet putting money back into the physical real estate and I continue to be impressed with how they operate through stores.","Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood","Okay. And then a question, I guess, on the \u2013 your international properties, just \u2013 I know you talked, your leasing spreads you usually cite are for the U.S., but I am just curious with the 99.8% occupancy in your international portfolio, what kind of leasing spreads are you getting there, are you really able to push rent?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yes, very much so. A lot of it's new. So we don't have a lot of rollover yet, but the answer is yes. It's a good question. Again, we kind of look at the cash flow growth, but maybe there is some numbers there that we can get to you next time.","Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood","Great. Thanks.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Harris from Uniplan (79:38). Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Good morning. So I am 20 years plus working on my American, but hopefully you can understand my question, David.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Only too loudly and clearly, okay? We understand everything you say.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. So yesterday, the administration put forward plans to reduce the corporate taxes down to 15%. Now, this is not a new idea and who knows whether that ends up at that number. It does look though there is a move to lower corporate taxes. I mean, if you can give any thought to a level at which it might make sense to become a C-Corp.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Again, a very good question. I thought you're going to bring out the game yesterday. Tottenham, my \u2013 and we're on a good streak until yesterday.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah. I know. Well, yeah, I think you'll make it, so that's an aside.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","All right. So I \u2013 you sounded a little depressed on the call, but anyway it's a good question. The reality is, it's worthy, doubted we would change. But let's see what the number is and \u2013 I mean we do have a lot of depreciation in our business. So...","Unknown Speaker","But that might go away.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I don't think so. I mean \u2013 what I understand is bonus depreciation is part of the thing to go back and forth. I mean there is no reason to model it right now, because you know God knows what's going to happen. But it's interesting our taxable income is $7 thereabouts. So at 15% without accelerating depreciation, I'm not sure why I would suddenly want to pay that to Uncle Sam. But if they change something with the depreciation rules, maybe it's of interest. But I would rather give that 15% \u2013 I'd rather give that money to our shareholders as opposed to the government.","Unknown Speaker","No, I mean, I guess the flexibility that would come from being a C-Corp would be a potential in setting aside what rate it is...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I agree other than you know we do have taxable income of $7. So, which again, if our FFO per share is $11.50, the mid-range, $7 that's not too shabby.","Unknown Speaker","Right.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","...so, maybe they'd have to change the depreciation rules to really get us to think about it, I think.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Good luck for the rest of the season.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Unknown Speaker","Bye.","Operator","And we have a question from Christy McElroy from Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. It's Michael Bilerman again. David, I'm curious you've talked a lot about the narrative in the negative rhetoric that's out there in the popular press. I'm curious if you've opened \u2013 if you had an open invite to these journalists to come to something like King of Prussia or Del Amo or Aventura where, I don't know if they can find a parking spot at 2 o'clock in the Saturday, but bring them to those assets?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I don't know. I mean, I'd rather bring my shareholders there. So I mean, I think some have tried to paint the other side of the picture and it just doesn't seem to be working. So I'd rather \u2013 I think our folk \u2013 I'd rather bring shareholders wherever they like to go, we're happy to tour them, explain the business, we certainly do it with sell-side and so on. We're certainly \u2013 we communicate all the time with our investors and shareholders. I think that time better spent and time is better spent running our business than trying to get the narrative change, it just \u2013 I'm only expressing that point of view to try to anybody that's concerned about the narratives, see \u2013 that's on this call, at least sees the other side of the story, that's all I'm interested and expressing on this call. And importantly, that's evidenced by our numbers, but I'd rather spend more time with our shareholders and our teams, they're just \u2013 I just don't see as being successful and changing it right now.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","One of the things you talked about in your shareholders' letter, was it, we have too much retail per capita in the U.S.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yes.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Some of it becomes obsolete. I know we have little exposure to this industry will feel the pain and this feeds the overall narrative? I guess what is your expectation of retail that needs to come out? I mean, is there any \u2013 is that shifting at all?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, it's interesting. Look, I can't sit here and predict what per capita we should have. That's way above my ability to forecast or even have an opinion on. I will tell you this. Certain malls are actually that maybe shouldn't have been built or maybe in the right trade area or actually \u2013 they last a lot longer than people think. And so, I don't know, I have no idea. All I worry about is what our portfolio can produce in terms of cash flow and I don't really have an opinion on kind of what the right U.S. numbers should be. I just don't have an opinion.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. All right. David, thanks for the time.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you. All right. Thanks. Sorry, this ran a little longer and appreciate all your questions. We do like giving everybody a chance if interested to ask your question, and given there's no more, we can go on through the rest of our day.

We had a very busy productive quarter to end another successful year for our company. Our full year 2019 funds from operation per diluted share was $12.04, which includes a $0.33 charge for the early redemption of our four series of senior notes. Adjusting for the debt charge, our full-year FFO was $12.37 per share, at the upper end of our initial 2019 guidance. Comparable FFO per share for the year increased 4.4%.","It is a testament to our relentless focus on operations, cost structure, active portfolio management, commitment to our strategy that we achieved the upper end of our initial range, even with the number of headwinds we faced during the year, including retail bankruptcies, significant downtime due to major redevelopments at many of our properties and a reduced overage from tourism spending, including the negative impact from the continued U.S. strong dollar, as well as the continued trade tensions limiting visitors.","For the fourth quarter reported FFO was $1.045 billion, or $2.96 per share. Comparable FFO was $3.29 per share, an increase of 2.8% year-over-year. We continue to grow our cash flow and report solid key operating metrics, including our comp NOI, which grew with \u2013 our international properties grew at 1.7%. Our comp NOI for domestic properties increased 1.4% for the year. Retailer bankruptcies impacted our comp NOI by roughly 120 basis points and lower overage rent, due to reduced international tourism I mentioned earlier, increased \u2013 impacted our comp NOI growth by 30 basis points to 40 basis points.","We are pleased to report that retail sales momentum again accelerated in the fourth quarter, reported retail sales per square foot for our malls and premium outlets was $693 per foot, compared to $661 in the prior year period, an increase of 4.8%. Keep in mind this is on top of more than 5% increase for the prior year. We continue to believe reported retail sales are understated and are negatively impacted by Internet returns of retailer's process at our brick and mortar locations.","For the recent holiday period, some media reports quoted in-store sales growth of less than 1.5%, but contrary to our number, which was more than 3% and again, impacted by the Internet returns that occurred at our stores. These sales results further reinforce the benefits retailers experienced from operating in high-traffic, highly productive, well-located real estate. We generated a record of over $1 billion in gift card sales, which was an increase of more than 18% year-over-year.","Leasing activity remains solid. Average base rent, minimum rent was $54.59. The malls and premium outlets recorded leasing spreads of $7.83, which was an increase of 14.4%. Our malls and premium outlet occupancy at the fourth quarter was 95.1%, which was an increase of 40 basis points compared to the occupancy at the end of the quarter \u2013 third quarter, down 80 basis points compared to the prior year, which was impacted roughly by 200 basis points from the bankruptcies that we process through the year.","We have successfully re-leased approximately 60% of those bankruptcies already.","On an NOI-weighted basis, our operating metrics were as follows: retail sales on an NOI-weighted basis is $884 per foot compared to $693; occupancy would be 96% and average base minimum rent would be $73.","Now just to move to new developments. We opened one new development in 2019 in Mexico. Construction continues on five new outlet developments in leading markets, including four international destinations and one in the U.S.; Malaga, Spain which will open this month; Bangkok, Thailand; West Midlands, England; and in 2021 Normandy, France and Tulsa, Oklahoma. Very few companies that I know of could open in Thailand and in Tulsa and throw in France for fun.","We completed a number of redevelopments and expansions across our portfolio in 2019, including four redevelopments of former department store spaces. We had a very busy year on the expansion of several high-performing international outlets, adding approximately 400,000 square feet in aggregate to centers in Seoul, Korea; Kent, England and Vancouver, Canada.","We currently have 15 former department store redevelopment projects under construction. Our share of those costs are roughly $815 million. We have 20 more in our pipeline. And at the end of the fourth quarter, redevelopment expansion densification projects were ongoing at more than 30 properties across all of our platforms in the U.S. and internationally with our share of that net cost of approximately $1.3 billion.","As a reminder, we fund these accretive projects through our internally generated cash flow. And just to give you a sense of the magnitude of some of the downtime, we are dealing with respect to our redevelopment. The projects that we have under construction that will open in 2020 will contribute approximately $70 million of incremental NOI in 2021 as they are stabilized.","So again Thailand, France, Tulsa 30 projects under development $1.3 billion. $70 million of NOI that will be generated in 2021. Good comp NOI given a few headwinds. And just to put it in. I know it's a lot of numbers and a lot of going on, but it's important for everybody to understand it.","Now let's talk about Aeropostale and ABG, because again we see a lot of misinformation out there and I just -- I think it's important just to give you a sense of our smart capital allocation decisions that continue to differentiate our company. We completed our third full year of owning Aeropostale, so I would like to take some perspective on that investment.","I'm going to simplify this. I know it's a lot of information. I'm going to -- and focus on our cash investment our cash investment in Aero OpCo was approximately $25 million. We have already received $13 million of distributions, so I have $12 million of cash invested in Aero OpCo. At the time we bought it, it was producing a negative EBITDA of $100 million and had over 500 stores. Today, today, we expect Aero OpCo to produce EBITDA pre-royalty from 575 stores of approximately $80 million of EBITDA.","We believe Aero is approximately, if you put a market multiple on it $350 million today and our ownership is 50%. 12 to three -- to 50% of $350 million. That's the math.","Now with respect to ABG we invested -- we made a recent investment in it. So we have a total of 600 -- or sorry $67 million in ABG, Authentic Brands Group. At the time of our original investment, which was roughly $33 million, ABG produced EBITDA of approximately $150 million. Today our value is worth $190 million of our $67 million and ABG is expected to produce EBITDA well north of $350 million and the value is growing every day. Which leads me to Forever 21.","As you've read recently, we have recently participated with Brookfield and Authentic Brands Group on behalf of the NewCo, SPAR Group, F21, LLC in a stocking horse bid for certain assets and liabilities in a going concern transaction under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. Our Group's successful turnaround of Aero after climbing out of bankruptcy in 2016 gives us confidence with our ability to do the same with Forever 21.","Forever 21 is a storied and well -- widely recognized brand with over $2 billion in global sales. We believe F21 similar to Aero presents a very interesting repositioning opportunity. If the transaction is consummated the newco contemplates the continued operations of many of Forever 21 stores and e-commerce business and maintaining many jobs.","Our interest in the new venture will be approximately 50%. The aggregate purchase price -- acquisition price is approximately $81 million, plus the assumption of certain ongoing operating liabilities. The process is subject to a go-shop period. The auction is expected to be completed in mid-February with closing shortly thereafter.","Now we're not done, sorry. We have balance sheet. So as you know we were very active in 2019. We completed 3-tranche senior notes of $3.5 billion with an average weighted coupon of 2.61% 15.9 years. We retired $2.6 billion of senior debt and our liquidity stands at $7.1 billion. We continue to have the strongest credit profile in the REIT industry.","Our net debt-to-NOI is 5.2 times, our interest coverage is 5.3 times and our long-term issuer rating of A2 continues to be the highest in the REIT sector. We paid a record dividend in 2019 of $8.30, a 5.1% increase over 2018. We paid approximately $3 billion in dividends in 2019.","And we have paid more than $31 billion in total dividends as a public company. We'll be well over $33 billion this year. And today we announced a dividend of $2.10 per share for the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 2.4% for the first quarter.","Now let me turn to our outlook for 2020. Let me just briefly summarize 2019. We posted another record year of results. Revenues, cash flow, FFO per share dividends all records.","We continue to strengthen our company through innovative disciplined investment activities that will allow us to continue to deliver long-term cash flow growth FFO and dividend growth. As a reminder, our 2019 results also included $0.19 per share in income related to insurance settlement at our Opry Mills.","Moving on to 2020, our guidance range is $12.25 to $12.40 per share. This range represents approximately 1.7% to 3% compared to our FFO of $12.04. Our range is based on the following assumptions: major redevelopments occurring in many properties resulting in significant downtime; the impact from a continued strong U.S. dollar versus the euro and yen compared to 2019 levels; comparable NOI growth from our combined malls, outlets, mills and international platforms of 1% -- approximately 1%; no planned or acquisition -- no planned acquisition or disposition activity; and a diluted share count of 354 million shares.","To conclude, we had another very busy and successful year. Our company and portfolio is as well positioned as ever and that will only improve with our ongoing investments.","Given our track record of earnings growth, NOI and cash flow generation and increasing dividends, we continue to be curious to see the yield of our stock 500 basis points higher than the 10-year treasury. This is an ongoing overreaction to the negative sentiment.","However, regardless we remain undaunted. Throughout our history, we have zigged when others have zagged and those moves have served us well. I'm extremely confident of where our business is and about the growth prospects of our company ahead. And we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Craig Schmidt","Thank you. I wonder if you could characterize the outlet results. Did -- they seemed obviously that to have an impact from the lower traffic, but it also seemed like there were a number of store closings that impact the outlet. If you could just tell us, where the outlet relates to the mall business?","David Simon","Well the outlet business had a very good year. I mean the only -- I mean it was affected by certain bankruptcies, but we had significant comp NOI growth. It was higher than the mall business. And the only real shortfall occurred like I said in the overage rent and that was primarily at our bigger centers due to the strong dollar and tourism. So the outlet business we're projecting again for our comp NOI to be higher than the mall business. Again, Craig, don't get caught up in this narrative. We're seeing really good results in the outlet. We'd like a little weaker dollar more tourism. I believe that's temporary.","It's good to see that -- obviously we've got a bigger picture going on with the coronavirus and tourism. I assume that will be temporary. However, it's great to see that China and the U.S. completed their trade discussions. And assuming we get through this coronavirus scenario. We expect our overage to continue to be dominant or at the growth in our outlet business. And we have no worries or concerns at all about our outlet business. Tulsa's leasing, Normandy is leasing, Bangkok is leasing, West Midlands and even with Brexit Mexit whatever you want it's leasing. Ashford's leasing. Vancouver is leasing. So I hope that gives you a flavor. So don't believe the narrative. You'll understand what we're doing.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. And then on the 1% comparable NOI guidance is lower than you achieved in 2019. What would you say are the major drivers of that number?","David Simon","Well if I would say primarily because of the downtime. If you -- again, we're a big company so it's a little harder for everybody to understand all that's going on. But if you see the significant redevelopment that we have, we have downtime. And the reality of that is we think in 2021 that we could sit here and we don't have throw away years. You know our philosophy, but we do have significant downtime. That NOI that we've got that takes a decrease. And these are big malls like at Burlington and North Shore and all that stuff. A lot of that stuff is coming on in late 2020.","We expect $70 million as I mentioned just from those redevelopments to come on into 2021. Obviously, we're projecting a stronger dollar, so we're muted on our overage rent calculations with our outlet business. And those are the primary. And then obviously we've got some retailer restructurings that are occurring. Some of that's related to the newer rent and that's likely to occur with the F21 stabilization some other restructuring. So you put it all in and that's 1%. I'm not overly worried about that number. I'd like it to be higher, but we've got some things to deal with and we're dealing with them.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. And then just -- do you have what the leasing spread was just for the fourth quarter in 2019? And was that result somewhat timing-related?","David Simon","We don't. We just do it on a rolling 12.","Craig Schmidt","Okay.","David Simon","That's a number we post. It is what it is. We don't say too much grace over it. Just like sales. I mean we had this discussion on sales and it was the most important thing. Now I understand it's the least important thing. So again, you kind of know our view which is that sales are interesting. They're not determinative because again we can replace retailers that aren't performing. And then we do think our sales per foot are muted by the returns, okay?","Craig Schmidt","Okay. Thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Michael Bilerman","Hey. It's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. David, I wanted to go through some of the investments you're making in retailers and other sort of tech platform initiatives. And the numbers you gave out on Aero surprised you didn't quote out Adam Sandler given we're not too shabby, right? A 15 times multiple on Aero is highly impressive. When you step back, how do you think about all these investments whether it was Aero and potentially Forever 21? And then Life Time, Pinstripes, Allied, PARM, Soho House.","I know some of them may be varied. How do you think about the investment itself versus driving disproportionate leasing within Simon's assets relative to all the other retail landlords, right? So how much of it is a benefit not only potentially of turning these retailers around like you did with Aero versus how much of it's incremental leasing that you're going to get out of your assets or protection of stores relative to everybody else?","David Simon","Well, first of all let me just talk about the retailer investments. We would not have done Aero and we're -- and we would not be attempting to do Forever 21 for the sole purpose of maintaining our rent. And that's the biggest misnomer out there when I read various publications and analyst notes and media notes. We do it -- we make these investments for the sole purpose of we think there's a return on investment.","Now the fact of the matter is we did all this that Aero and the reality is they kept paying us rent. So that's like -- that's obviously beneficial and I don't want to understate that but that's not why we do it. At the same time with F21, we do think there is a business there, but it's got to be turned around. And I'm not going to project today to you what those numbers are, but we've got our work ahead of us.","But if we are successful in turning around, we will make money at F21 and we'll get paid our rent. But again the sole purpose is to make investment in our -- for the benefit of our company. Now the rest of them we're creating a flywheel of unique entrepreneurs that understand the benefits of physical space, understand the benefits of the new consumer today. And whether it's Pinstripes or e-gaming or the deal that we did with RGG Rue and Gilt and what's going on with shop Premium Outlets and the deal we did with PARM and Nazarian at the SBE this is a flywheel that no other company in our industry can do. We expect to get the benefit of -- return on those investments. But additionally the ability to make us a better operator and also bring those kind of ideas to our portfolio.","So we learn how to be a better operator, we make money on the investment and ultimately in some cases they bring their product to our -- to our physical portfolio. So I can't imagine a better scenario for us, but we're in early days on all of this stuff. But we expect to prosper from these kind of investments.","Underlying though is we want them to add value to how we operate as well as to our portfolio and we're doing that. I mean, if you've seen as an example I mean go add chapter verse on this stuff but if you see what Life Time brings with their new concept to our portfolio, you'd say, I get it. Would I rather have that than a moderate underinvested department store and the answer is, come on. It's a no-brainer.","Michael Bilerman","Right. Second question I had was if you think about where your NOI breakdown is today between the malls outlets mills and international, which is the pie chart you have on slide 17 and you sort of marry it up with the pie chart of where you're spending your capital, which is slide 28, and then you add in a lot of these other types of investments that you're making where does -- let's say three years out or maybe five years out, where does the composition of your income and asset base shift to from effectively non-retail uses, resi, hotels, office, the totality of all these investments that you're making and then the traditional retail business? What do you think the split would be?","David Simon","I mean, it's really -- it's -- we benefit you could argue it either way, but we benefit from the -- I think we really benefit from being a large company. And it's obvious that we're able to make investments and pay our dividend without having to finance our dividend et cetera. So when I look at it we -- even when we look at just our nonretail real estate I mean to get to the NOI of over 5% is going to take a lot of work. But we do like the diversity of our geography, our product-type mills, outlets, malls, our mall business is under 50% of our NOI today. We love the international business. That's been highly profitable. And I think we've got a pretty interesting company because it's so diverse and so big and so well financed. Like I said at the end, I mean we can zig when others zag. Or is it zag with zig I always get confused\u2026","Brian McDade","Either way. Either way.","David Simon","Oh, either way. So we can zig when others are zagging and we can zag when others are zigging. Maybe that's the answer. And then we have our whole additional portfolio of other investments that maybe one day we have a spin-off of that. Maybe one day we're not a REIT. Maybe one day, we're just this diversified, interesting company that people will finally think, hey it's not a bad company, not too shabby.","Christy McElroy","Hey, David. It's Christy.","David Simon","We did -- we did have, not too shabby, in the conference. But we took it out, but if we can use...","Christy McElroy","Hey, David. It's Christy. If I could just add a follow-up on Craig's question on comp NOI. So realizing that you're now including international and I assume that's on a constant currency basis. I'm wondering if you could provide sort of an apples-to-apples comparison with the 1.4% growth in 2019 just for North America. And then just a clarification, your comp NOI growth excludes those larger redevelopment projects, is that correct?","David Simon","Only a few of those. So not all of them. It depends on the size of a \u2013 we have a definition of that. We have a size of it. And so that's not all of them. It just depends on some of that. So it doesn't really \u2013 international marginally helped. It's not a big deal.","I would suggest to you that the biggest thing affecting our comp, as I said to you earlier, is that we do have a lot of redevelopments that are affecting our cash flow. I don't \u2013 and that's when they come on, we'll be $70 million in 2021. There is downtime.","I don't think people appreciate that because you're used to dealing with smaller companies, frankly. And you know if they are leasing it out to X, Y, Z, it moves the needle. We're a little bit different and what we \u2013 there is no denying, we've got some leasing to do. Our occupancy is down a little bit.","By the way, if you believe the narrative, you think our occupancy year-over-year will be down 500 basis points. It's down 80. We've already leased 60% of it. So, I'm not \u2013 we look at ourselves a little bit different. We give you a year-by-year number. We don't have throwaway years. Our 1%, I think is going to be fine. And if we get a little uptick in overage rent, it will be better. If we don't, it won't and we'll \u2013 life will go on.","Christy McElroy","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jeremy Metz","Thanks. Good morning. David, just one quick one. Go back on Forever 21, just given that, obviously, there is still a process being run here and there are some different outcomes that could come out of this. Just interested, is your current guide, is it built around all stores staying open and just operating at a reduced occupancy costs? Or was that the base that's built in here?","David Simon","We don't \u2013 again, given our size and given our historical results, we don't get into specific retailer rents or restructurings. That's for other folks. That's not for us.","Jeremy Metz","That's fair. And then we \u2013 as we think about sort of the add inflow of closings and bankruptcies we've seen, 2019, obviously a pretty big year. 2018 was down from 2017 though. So as you look at the landscape today, you look specifically at your outlet and mall portfolio.","Obviously, what happened last year and what could be in the pipeline is sucked into the 1% comp outlook. But more high level, how do you feel about the landscape here today, given there is still, obviously, plenty of over-levered retailers out there?","Brian McDade","Yeah, I think \u2013 look, I think we're projecting it to be lower than last year, for sure. But it's our \u2013 our point of view and there are no certainties. But I would certainly \u2013 my best judgment call would certainly be to be dramatically less than last year. Last year was a very difficult year when it came to that if you look at. Historically, 2017 was a high year. 2018 was a low year. 2019 was a high year. So, we're anticipating a lower \u2013 certainly a lower amount, but that's our best estimate of what we see today.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. And last one for me. As we look at where the stock is, as you mentioned, the misperceptions out there, the big dividend yield spread to cash you've been able to generate. How are you thinking about further stock buybacks at this point, just given the redevelopment pipeline and opportunity there that you outlined?","David Simon","Maybe we should go private. It's really what we should do. The reality is, look, it's in our \u2013 we do have the opportunity to do that. We're obviously waiting to see kind of what transpires in the global world right now, but it's something that we'll obviously continue. We do think our company is undervalued. And I would expect this to continue to play into that. It's not in our numbers and we'll see how the next \u2013 know how the next period of time evolves.","Jeremy Metz","Thanks for the time.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning.","David Simon","Good morning.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning. I'll change up the answer because you called me out on the \u2013 out there last time. But I will say to Bilerman's thing, he mentioned that you didn't do not too shabby. I would point out that you brought Mexit in which may be the first in REIT-land to mention Mexit.","David Simon","That's why I keep saying we're a little bit different than the rest of the folks, okay? Mexit -- by the way, I think it will uptick sales in Vancouver though. So, there'll be a benefit from Mexit.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Well, if you could be a little less different if you go back to the 7 A.M. release time that would be appreciated.","David Simon","No problem. We had a technical difficulty. So, it wasn't as bad as the Iowa Caucus, but it was a little bit of a technical difficulty.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. So, two questions David. I appreciate that you're not going to comment specifically on individual tenants. But we did notice that Forever 21 dropped out of our top 10 in the fourth quarter. But third quarter obviously -- NOI in the fourth quarter was a lot weaker than previously. So maybe you can just in aggregate talk about what -- to the extent you could talk about the impact in the fourth quarter?","And then what your bad debt credit is for 2020 and versus what the actual was in 2019 just to get a sense for how much the 1% is impacted by maybe a change in bad credit versus historical versus other things?","David Simon","Well, look we are -- we certainly -- it's not surprising to you. And again I -- you're very kind and you're very smart and that's why you want me to answer these F21 questions. But -- and I don't really want to answer them but I will answer this.","Our fourth quarter was clearly impacted by the reductions that us and others provided to F21 to help stabilize their business, okay? And that was -- and that is -- that new scenario is one of the reasons why they dropped out of our top 10. So, it wasn't like we wanted it to drop out of our top 10, but that's just the math.","Two is and I -- again, I have to impress upon everyone out there. We do a -- overage rent is an art, not a complete science and it is back-end weighted for the fourth quarter in the outlet business. We actually -- we're way behind an overage rent and all the way up and we made some of it back, but we didn't make what we had originally budgeted.","So, when you put the two together that's why we were a little short domestically to get to our 2% original budget. I mean there's no hiding that, there's no denying that, but that is an art and a science. Now, that's why we've been extra conservative I'd say on the overage and the outlet business. But there's a lot going on. I mean right now tourism is way down in the United States. I don't control that. Usually, we're a beneficiary of that, but sometimes we run into a headwind.","But that has nothing to do with the long-term viability of this great real estate and these great properties and that's what we have to as investors and as you as analysts and us as operators all have to kind of overlook these temporary things.","So, we did -- so in summary, I hope I answered the question. In summary, our fourth -- our Q4 was impacted by what we did with F21. It was impacted the shortfall in the overage rent with the outlets. We're projecting a similar scenario next year so hopefully we'll be conservative on that but time will tell. And obviously that does the restructure of F21 because it was a big, big retailer does have -- it does flow through 2020 as well.","I hope that answers -- on the bad debt, it's basically pretty flat from 2019 which was a pretty decent-sized year. So, that -- but again, there's no longer bad debt. It's just you don't get the income you thought you'd do, okay?","And from an accounting point of view being an old GAAP accountant I still scratch my head on that. But the reality is it's no longer a bad debt, you just don't get all the income you thought you were going to get revenue.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then the second question goes to the dividend. You obviously highlighted where your yield is relative to the tenure. You guys always point out your sort of mid-single-digit dividend increases over the years. But maybe that mirrors your taxable dividend increase in which case it will -- it won't be lower.","But just given it seems like your comments that the market is not appreciating your dividend and the guidance coming in a little short of where The Street is, should we brace ourselves that maybe you don't increase the dividend this year or maybe the increase is nominal maybe 1%? Or your view is to continue growing it in the sort of mid-single-digits even if the market doesn't appreciate it in the stock price?","David Simon","Well, look, I think we'll continue to grow our dividend. We have earnings growth next year -- or this year I should say, 2020. We grew 2.4% Q-over-Q. So, that's certainly a signal to you that we are not backing off our dividend growth. I mean, will it be as high as 8% or 10%, like it's been over the last five years or six years? It may -- probably not.","But again, I don't think -- I look at it -- I guess, if you were in my shoes, when I hear the word bracing, I just want to explain to you, we're not bracing here, my friend. We're on the offense. We actually feel good about our company. We feel great about our dividend. We feel great about our balance sheet. We feel great about these other investments we're going to make. We're going to hopefully turnaround F21 and make money.","So the last thing -- the last word you will never see in our -- hopefully, I shouldn't say never, but we don't -- we're not bracing here. Okay. Yes, we have some leasing to do, given the high amount of bankruptcies. We've already leased 60%. Yes, I'd like to see tourism come in. Strong dollar does limit spend. I mean, you will see that from other retailers, the retailers that have an important exposure to tourism. We have all that redevelopment in 2020 that's ongoing, that takes properties down.","I mean, at a mall, at Northgate that did $18 million of NOI, it does zero, zero today. I mean, zero. And we accelerated it and we have development rights that could make that property worth $1 billion. Again, we don't have throwaway years, Alex, as you know. And so, yes, this year will be not as robust growth as maybe some of the years in the past. That doesn't mean we're bracing, no bracing here, not in our vocabulary.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, David.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Rich Hill","Hey, David. Good morning.","David Simon","Good morning.","Rich Hill","Just one quick clarification. I think what you said was F21 is still in the pool. It's just a lower tenant and therefore, should we assume F21 as a tenant, is included in the 2020 FFO guide?","David Simon","Yes, yes. We and others adjusted the rent for the fourth quarter. And because of the base rent, it's number 11 or 12. What is it?","Brian McDade","Number 12.","David Simon","12. They're 12. Forever 21 is in our top 12. Okay.","Rich Hill","Got it. That's helpful. That\u2019s why I promised you that's the last question. I'm going to ask about Forever 21.","David Simon","No problem. We have no problem with any questions anybody wants to ask.","Rich Hill","Sure. And so, actually just staying along this line of your investments in retailers and I appreciate why they've been really attractive investments for you. So two questions. First of all, are these held in the TRS? I think they are. And then number two, do you have a sense for how high you could go with your retail investments before you got up your non-REIT limit in the TRS?","David Simon","Yes, they are in our TRS. And there's a lot going on, technically, about this that the NAREIT's working on. And I'll just defer that, because it's a little arcane. But we've got plenty of room and given that it's in our TRS, we've got plenty of room that we're not going to -- there's no issue about maintaining REIT status about income or gross asset test and all this -- all of it, all of the various REIT tests that you have to meet. So, we've got plenty of room to run.","Rich Hill","Yes. And I was really saying that not from -- are you hitting the limit, but it seems like this is an attractive investment pool that might warrant some further consideration in the future.","David Simon","Yes, look, I think, we -- I guess, Rich, what I'd say to you, we're grounded in real estate, but we have over time found that we can do other things reasonably well and that is our goal to do that. We've had success, we haven't been perfect. And if we do end up buying with Brookfield and Authentic Brands Group, Forever 21, I mean, obviously, that's going to be a lot of work. That is a big restructure ahead of us and that we'll want to make sure that that's done right, and there are no guarantees on that.","So don't expect another retailer that will pop up until we get that stabilized. But at the same time, we're always looking at additional investments. I mean, we're very excited about the long-term prospects that we have with our -- basically, our merger with RGG. And we're just starting that whole process and that's a whole another avenue for this company in terms of e-commerce and tenant relationships and retailer loyalty, and all the other stuff that comes with that. And we're just -- that we literally just closed in November.","And we merged our operations into those and they're just starting to improve our shop premium marketplace. So, I mean, there is a lot of growth ahead of that as well. And then you've got all of the mixed-use stuff that we're doing, whether it's Northgate, whether it's Phipps. You go down the list. I mean, there is a lot going on and that's why we feel good about where we're positioned.","Rich Hill","Got it. And just two final things for me on Forever 21. I know I told you I wouldn't ask about it again, but I can't help myself. Your 50% investment, should we think about that as 50% on top of your 25% investment and top of your 50% investment in ABG? Would that 50% include the look-through on ABG?","David Simon","No, no, no. It's just \u2013 it's actually a little under 50% to be technical, it's approximately 50%. No, that's a separate standalone entity. It has nothing to do with our investment. And we \u2013 our \u2013 we only own around a little over 6% of ABG. Okay.","Rich Hill","Okay. Got it. And then, you didn't buy back any shares this quarter, despite what the stock price has done. Is that just a simple capital allocation decision given your discussions you are having on F2021?","David Simon","No. I just think, we got busy and no real good reason. Obviously \u2013 unfortunately, we made the right choice not to buy it back, right. But I just think we were busy in the fourth quarter and everything else.","Rich Hill","Got it. Touche. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","David Simon","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is now open.","Nick Yulico","Thanks. Just going back to the guidance. Can we get what the total NOI growth embedded is? And as well, are there any one-time charges that are dragging down the FFO number?","David Simon","No, not that \u2013 nothing material, no.","Nick Yulico","And what about the total NOI growth number?","David Simon","We \u2013 this is what we gave. It is consistent with our past practice.","Nick Yulico","Okay. I guess, I'm just wondering if there was anything else that's \u2013 if the number is going to be similar to your comp NOI number like it's been or?","David Simon","Yeah. I mean, look, I think, on some of these that are in our non-comp pool, we have this downtime that I've alluded to. I mean, I \u2013 we can quantify it for you, but we all kind of put it in the blender. And that's where our guidance is. I mean, we had significant \u2013 put it this way, we expect in 2021 to generate around $70 million of additional NOI and most of that is still dealing with our downtime. Now, we've got expansions that are opening up worldwide, which usually come in. The strategy there is a little bit different. Lease-up is not 95%, tends to be a little bit lower.","So, we just have one of these years that because of all the activity you're not \u2013 it's not manifesting itself in the growth, but we don't have a throwaway, yet we're still going to grow our earnings. We're still going to grow our dividend. We're still going to have the best balance sheet. We are still going to make these fund investments. We're still going to keep moving the portfolio. And it's just \u2013 I mean, the people do have a year that doesn't necessarily have terrific growth, because we're making all these investments. It's \u2013 you see it elsewhere. We were a static company, I get it, but we're not. We're really busy. Does that help?","Nick Yulico","Yeah. And then, David, it is helpful to get that $70 million benefit to NOI in 2021 from the redevelopments coming online later this year. I guess, what we don't know is what this ongoing drag from redevelopment could be? Meaning that, is that going to be purely a benefit in 2021, or are there still some of this redevelopment downtime to deal with? And I guess, I'm wondering at some point, would you think about maybe providing some sort of NOI bridge? I mean, it's something the office REITs have done to deal with lumpiness and tenant move-outs and tenants being refilled. And I think it would be pretty helpful to understand what that, how that plays out to get to the growth of the company over the next couple of years.","David Simon","Yeah. I mean, it's possible. We don't we \u2013 like people just have seen, what we're doing and then the results of it manifests itself. But this is an active year of investment and redevelopment and the growth will have some impact to do that. We've also had a history of outperforming our guidance. And I mean, let's face it, we're being conservative. There is a lot of noise around the world from an economic. And obviously, it's an election year. We've got this terrible situation on the virus, and we don't know what that means. So, there is a lot \u2013 there is a lot going on. But I'll go back to \u2013 I think Alex had phrased. I mean, we're investing in the future and we feel really good about kind of all the stuff that we're doing and it will manifest itself in 2021 and beyond. But like Phipps \u2013 I mean, Phipps is a great example. I mean, the malls torn up and that stuff is going to come on late 2021. So that's not even in that number.","So, but your point is valid. We've never wanted to do that because we've never wanted to have people think we're having a throwaway year, but this will be somewhat of a year of investment. And that happens with, I mean, it's happened with them, nothing compares to Amazon, but it's happened with the big companies that say, yeah, they are investment, I mean. So that's what we're doing. We'll see where it shakes out. Not unusual.","Nick Yulico","All right. Thanks, David.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Michael Mueller","Yeah. Hi. Just a quick one. Were the rent spread trends in the fourth quarter outside of Forever 21 stable? Would you characterizing this?","David Simon ","Yeah. We had a very -- we had a -- like I said, we underperformed in our overage all year with the outlet business and they had a really good fourth quarter. It just didn't -- if you understand how overage works, you've got to get over the break point and you've got to do it. So we caught up on that.","We actually were underperforming all the way through the fourth quarter. They had a very good fourth quarter. We didn't see any real retailer changes too much, and I think sales were pretty good and we leased up space. We didn't think we would get to 95. We got a little over 95 once. So, I think we had a pretty good fourth quarter, all things considered. I mean, again, I don't do your models, but I look at -- I know my business pretty well. And the reality is that I think we had a pretty good fourth quarter.","Michael Mueller","Got it. And then I think you mentioned you could quantify the redevelopment drag on that 1% same-store outlook. Can you do that?","David Simon ","Yeah. We will do that at some point.","Michael Mueller","Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Linda Tsai","Hi. Could you share with us some very broad steps you took to get Aero EBITDA positive and how these processes might translate to getting Forever 21 in a similar place? I mean in your opinion, is retail distress somewhat formulaic and what's holding back retailers from fixing themselves?","David Simon ","Well, every retailer has its own particular sort of issues. I think Forever 21, really the biggest issue that it had historically was that it took its eye off the ball, primarily because of the international growth. And then it created another brand that took its eye off the ball and then, obviously, the store size got too big.","So, we are really good at sourcing and that's where Authentic Brands Group is fantastic at sourcing product. We think in Forever 21's case, it was fast-fashion and the time that we got for delivery of goods would shock you in terms of how long it took. So, we kind of took the fast-fashion out of fashion. And obviously, Forever 21 -- or I'm sorry, ABG's graded branding.","I mean if you look at -- we're an investor in Sports Illustrated. They bought the Sports Illustrated IP. If you have seen kind of how they've already created all the buzz around Sports Illustrated, it's a great example of what they do. You look at how they branded Shaquille O'Neal as an example. That's what they do.","So, they bring all that marketing and the brand awareness expertise to bear. We did the same thing with Aero. So each year -- you have to diagnose the problem. There is a lot to restructure at F21. On the other hand, it is a brand that does close to $2 billion of volume, even with the -- all that's going on. So, I mean that was what we looked at Aero.","When Aero -- when we took it over $900 million, we are talking about $50 million business. So that gives us -- it gives us a comfort and it's sourcing, marketing, it's better efficient, more organizations, better technology. And it's just common sense being better operator and between the -- our and it's also being an owner that can withstand just -- withstand stock, right.","So, you don't panic. And you just -- you keep your head down and you keep plowing. We did that with Aero. We told Aero we don't care about comp NOI, comp sales. What we care about is building the business for the future, focus on EBITDA margins, focus on gross margins, focus on increasing the quality of the product and we don't care about comp sales.","Now, it's a little bit like our business. There is a too much of a focus on quarter-to-quarter comp NOI growth. We get it. We focus on it because we love cash flow. But at the same time, we've got to make investments for the future that will accelerate that comp. There is no difference. The only difference is that we don't panic and others do. And that's why we're here calm about it.","Linda Tsai","Do you think the timeframe for getting Forever 21 EBITDA positive will be similar to that of Aero?","David Simon","I would say that -- it's a good question. And I would say, it's a little more complicated in a little bigger business. And it depends on whether one or two of my guys are going to spend all this time in Los Angeles. So, I'm negotiating it right now, Linda. Stay tuned.","Linda Tsai","Then just one other follow-up, given this environment of closures, how are you thinking about the credit worthiness of the new tenants you're signing on? What sort of process do you go through to get comfort around their brand relevance and stability and liquidity?","David Simon","Well historically, we've been very focused on that. We're very \u2013 we are very -- look, that's not to say, we don't take flyers here and there. But we're probably -- if you asked around, we're probably as thoughtful on that as anybody in our industry. And it's very important to us, especially if we make any kind of tenant improvements. We're very focused on payback and credit worthiness. We don't bet a thousand there, but we are -- it's extremely important to us.","Linda Tsai","Thanks.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Simon","Hello? Okay. Let's go to next.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Haendel St. Juste","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So first one is on redevelopment. Looking ahead to 2021, and what appears to be a positive inflection in your earnings growth, helped by the expansion of the redevelopment last year up to, I think was $1.8 billion well above the one point, the lower ones if you via graph couple of years. And hopefully, some of that incremental NOI growth can help change that narrative around the stock.","So, I guess my question is on the sizing of the pipeline beyond this year. Your intention to keep the redevelopment pipeline size around where it is, you know that $1.8 billion where it's been over the past year. Are you more inclined on reducing that back to the level that you've run over the past few years in the low $1 billion and maybe preserving more cash flow for other uses and potentially unanticipated other tenant events or even opportunistic investments?","David Simon","Well, again, a good question. I would say to you, just wonder because of our diversity in product type, geography, etcetera every incremental investment can and will stand on its own. So, we don't feel compelled to save an asset because we're worried about the -- hitting our numbers or anything else. So, we're making all of these investments with an eye toward incremental return.","And we do expect, as we said, historically, yeah, we're going to be busy because we're going to get the ability to get a lot of great real estate back hopefully at reasonable prices that we can add accretive returns to.","So, I don't view it as a zero-sum game. And I also don't think that it's -- that we don't have the -- firepower to make this additional investments outside of our, what I'd say, our core businesses.","So -- but the important thing is, I don't feel compelled to say, oh, this small, if I don't do this, I got to do a low return deal. Just to say that, I mean the reality is, if it ain't worth, then we don't invest and it's not going to -- it's not going to -- it's not going to really cause too much of a debt from it.","So -- and we are looking at other investments that are outside of kind of the traditional bricks and mortar and I think we'll continue to do that. But we'll also continue to make investments in brick and mortar because there's -- nothing has changed about it. It's a good business.","It's just -- yeah, it's -- we are running through a cycle here that's not as robust as what it's been in the past. But you've got to remember, we've been doing this for a long time and we've weathered the different storms.","Haendel St. Juste","Got it. Got it. Thank you for that. Second question is on the 2020 guide. For another income, is there anything contemplated in the guide for other income, anything that could materially move that FFO guide this year one way or the other? And G&A, it looks like it was down $10 million last year. What's embedded in the guide for G&A this year? Thank you.","David Simon","Sure. G&A is similar to what fourth quarter is. So right guidance, yeah. And I -- we don't have anything real extraordinary in other income in 2021 that's quite unusual. As you know, we had the big settlement from the insurance company of Opry in 2019 in the first quarter.","So that will \u2013 our first quarter compare to first quarter of Q1, 2020, will look different than Q1 of 2019 because that's when we got the settlement from Opry Mills. It only took us seven years, eight years. Okay. That's another story.","Haendel St. Juste","All right. Thank you.","David Simon","No worries.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks a lot. Good morning out there. When I look at your lease expirations for 2020, it doesn't seem like you made much headway. It's just one quarter from -- going from 3Q to 4Q. But it went down 30 basis points. When I look at last year, you made much more headwind or headway closer towards 100 basis points. Like I said, I know it's just one quarter, but I was just curious if there's anything to read into that or are you kind of just making decision a little bit later?","David Simon","No, it's just process and there is absolutely nothing to read into that. It's all process, no issue.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And just going back to Forever 21. You talked about the flywheel and I think we all get it. But that's why it was also very different for a Simon owned store versus if it was owned by a different landlord. So, how do you balance those things?","David Simon","We -- look, I think the only history we really have on that is Aero. And I think if you ask the other landlord, they said, we were great partners. So no issue there. Interesting question. But we really -- I mean, every store at Aero basically stood on its own. We were not really involved in it. That was all delegated to the team, the operating team at Aero. So, we did not get involved in that. I think at F21, to the extent that we get it, we'll adopt a similar thing. And we, in fact, at Aero -- at Forever 21 because of the need to move probably a little quicker than at Aero and the case is moving a little bit quicker. We'll probably hire a third-party just to go do it.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open.","Vince Tibone","Good morning. You mentioned earlier you have 15 former department store redevelopment projects underway with the total expected spend about $850 million, so that equates to about $55 million per box. I'm just thinking about longer term CapEx need, is $55 million per department store box a fair assumption?","David Simon","No. And you can't get out of it. That math you really can't do. And I think that it's not -- Vince, I would say to you, it's not necessarily CapEx. It's incremental opportunity. So -- and I've said this before. But just to put it in perspective, if we don't own the department store and that department store owns 10 acres, then we just now have 10 new acres that we -- that we can develop. It's not like, when we take CapEx, people think new roof, new tile, new this, new that. It's incremental opportunity because we don't necessarily control that space. And even if we were on a long-term lease, to the extent that we've got that lease, we now control their space. So it's new incremental space that we did, in other words, so -- ","Vince Tibone","Right. But I'm just trying to get a sense of -- so that includes probably a lot of other non-retail uses. So, what would be a fair run rate of just trying to think about longer term if we're expecting more department stores to close? I mean just from a -- maybe not from a CapEx burden perspective, but just how much capital you're going to have to spend every year to keep -- to unlock these opportunities? That's what I'm trying to get at more than anything.","David Simon","Well, look, I think what you should do, we can give you order of magnitude. I mean, I can do a check in personnel, but I might bore you. You can call up -- you can call up Tom. And yes, what would be in order of magnitude? Like, take an example of Phipps. Phipps is $300 plus million. Okay. Midland Park, Texas was $5 million. So it's all over the place. But if you want -- the best thing for you to do, Vince, to get a handle on it is that, Northgate, we could spend $600 million, $700 million at Northgate. So certain boxes are $10 million. Just take a box over, re-lease it, that kind of thing.","So really, really is real estate specific. But maybe you go through our 8-K and Tom could give you order of magnitude. But Phipps is a great example. It's a former department store that was on lease, where we let them terminate the lease for payment and then we're spending literally $300 million in -- little over $300 million to build a hotel, office and Life Time and additional retail, all in that same spot. And so that can skew numbers pretty significantly.","Vince Tibone","No, that makes sense. That's really helpful. Can you just discuss quickly how the overage rent thresholds are reset each year? Just trying to get a sense of like the lower percentage rents paid in 2019, creates an easier comp for 2020 or that's not the case, they kind of increase by a fixed amount each year?","David Simon","It usually kind of balances out. So, there's not a lot of volatility. Other than the outlet business, a number of our bigger retailers, they are basically on percentage rent with a very low base. So that's the one that tends to have a little more volatility. In the mall business, we tend to mark the real estate. If they're in overage, we tend to get that as it renews and then others come in. So it's relatively traffic consistent.","So, you have overage and then they go -- their leases expire. You go to basically overage, plus the base rent to get to the total rent and then whole another slew of retailers will go into overage. The outlets tend to be a little longer leases, a little lower base. And therefore, they don't have as much turn. So therefore, the overage rent tends to be a little more volatile in terms of what the math ends up in.","Vince Tibone","Great. Thank you.","David Simon","Yeah. No worries.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Christy McElroy","Hey. Thanks for the follow-up. Just a follow-up on Forever 21. Sorry. Just in terms of the approach to making these retailers profitable again and sort of solidifying the business, there's a going concern. You answered Linda's question. But how does your approach differ and is perhaps much healthier for retailing longer term than the traditional private equity approach to retailer turnarounds?","And in addition to store closures and the efficiency, and technology, and marketing and operations that you discussed, do you look to convert rents to sort of percentage sales for a period of time to get landlords more in partnership with these retailers?","David Simon","I would say it depends on the scenario. I think, F21, to stabilize it, we might have to do that for a period of time. At Aero, we -- they did a lot of the work on the landlords free during the bankruptcy process. Aero was a little quicker. So, we don't have a lot of time to do it. They did initial things. So it depends on -- it really depends on the scenario. And it's certainly a tool that's available to us.","And there's ways to handle it, I think, the landlord community will support us to the extent that we're successful in the auction.","Christy McElroy","Okay. And then, just a follow-up on Vince's CapEx question to you. You had about $192 million of TIs at share in 2019, close to $1 billion of redevelopment and development spend. How should we think about that capital outlay in 2020, as we look at use of free cash flow, especially as the turnover is elevated and could push up TIs, and with everything that you have in the value creation pipeline coming on later this year and into 2021?","David Simon","Yeah. I mean, look, I think the TIs went up by $20 million. So, yes, to me that's not going to really change. We're doing more restaurants, a little more entertainment, so you see. The other thing that really spikes that number was we did a number of, kind of, best of brands luxury retailers and I don't want to name names. But they tend to have great build out.","It's great for the properties, but you -- kind of the uber luxury folks, their investment in their stores tends to be a little bit higher. So, I think you get -- we did some great work last year on that. So, we're seeing a little bit of a spike, but the TIs not really much of an issue and the development, again I don't know what else to tell you other than that we are going to have these opportunities from department stores. We think they are, net-net, it's going to be beneficial to our company and to the existing real estate.","And the role that we play in the community is unbelievable. So, give you an example, between sales tax and real estate taxes at a place like Roosevelt Field, we pay $135 million and the warehouse down the street pays basically nothing. We did a study that said warehouse and distributions pay less than one-tenth of what we pay in real estate taxes.","So, that's what's interesting. We're making these places better for the community, better for the taxpayers. We have a -- we're doing -- believe it or not, we're doing specific duties that others aren't in terms of what -- as you know, we do believe strongly and we refute others that suggest otherwise. But we do think we provide a greener atmosphere for commerce and there's just so much we're doing that that it's maybe not necessarily appreciated. But we know what we're doing for these communities. We know what we're doing for the taxes for sales and real estate taxes. And we're also making our real estate better and that's fine. We'll take that responsibility on.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, David. It's Michael Bilerman speaking. Earlier in the call, you talked about buying real estate that bricks and mortar, obviously, still has a great future. And that's -- you're not going to deviate from that. And when buying makes sense, you would do it, sort of paraphrasing a comment you made. There was a headline that came across on Bloomberg during the call that you potentially had merger talk with Taubman and that eventually broke off given the market volatility. Can you comment on that, please?","David Simon","What would you -- you know we don't comment. But -- we don't comment on those market rumors. I haven't seen it. We've been busy on this call. So, I'm not sure what you're referring to but we'll check it out.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. Yeah. It's always just helpful to get the views on whether something could happen or not. And I know the stock buyback wasn't happening during the fourth quarter. So, I assumed whether there were something else going on that would have done that.","Brian McDade","No, we, obviously made the right trade. The stock went down. So, we can buy it cheaper now.","Michael Bilerman","Thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Sorry about the earlier technical difficulties. I guess, David, just to maybe piggyback or ask Michael's question a little differently. Just in terms of like acquisition opportunities. Obviously, there is really a lack of capital that's devoted to the mall space today. Everybody is kind of fleet on the institutional side. Are there opportunities that you see to potentially deploy capital outside of your existing portfolio?","David Simon","Well, I would say you, generally, yes. I mean, we've intended -- we would tend to -- I mean, I think they're worldwide. I mean retail real estate is way out of favor worldwide, not just in the U.S.","And as you know, we've built our company to do this. We don't have to do that. We've got lots of -- if anything on this call, I know it's dragged on here; it's like a college football game. But we -- I feel really good about where we're at. So, we don't have to -- on the other hand, as I said earlier, we zig when others zag or we zag when others zig. And sometimes, we usually land on our feet, not always.","But we -- our industry is way out of favor worldwide, that's interesting to note. But we know what these properties generally mean to the community, and to the consumer, and to the retailer. Bricks-and-mortar are important. This real estate is greatly located. So -- and then we have kind of all the other stuff that we're doing in conjunction with our core business and it's a unique time for us to think what we want to do in the future.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And then, not to beat the dead horse on the earnings guidance in the lost income. But I do think it would be helpful to the extent that you have intentionally take properties offline, similar to what you did in Northgate last year.","I think it would just be helpful to kind of know what that drag is within your guidance number this year. Is it a couple of pennies? Is it a nickel? Is it a dime? I think, just kind of frame out kind of why -- when you look apples-to-apples at the midpoint, guidance is down a little bit.","Brian McDade","Yeah. Look, I think that's a good point. We try to do that, maybe not as artfully as we should have, but we try to do it by showing to you that we're going to have a $70 million pick up next year when the stuff comes online. But I guess, what we didn't do is give you a sense of the decrease that we have this year.","But I'd just tell you that Northgate certainly -- it's a good example. That was a property doing 15, 16, 17, 18 in that range and it's basically going to be zero for the next future. That won't pick up in 2021 because it's a long-term project, but will be great in the future.","And it is also paid. So, we've got a property here that we could add to uses incrementally depending on demand. So it's not like, we did over our fees, the best of all worlds.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. That's it for me. Thanks.","David Simon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Michael Mueller","Hey, I'm going to try to get out of the queue.","David Simon","Hope, we didn't offend you. Take care.","Michael Mueller","That's okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. You line is now open.","David Simon","I think Rich stopped, too. Okay. I think that's it. Thank you for your time and interest. And we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Please proceed.","Liz Zale","Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to Simon Property Group's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Presenting on today's call is David Simon, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Sokolov, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Steve Sterrett, our Chief Financial Officer, and we are also joined by Tom Ward, our new Vice President of Investor Relations.","Before we begin, just a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available online at investors.simon.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce David Simon.","David Simon","Good morning. We had strong start to the year. Results in the quarter were led by FFO $2.38 per share, up 16.1% from the first quarter of 2013. Once again our FFO significantly exceeded the first call consensus estimate. Our growth strategy continues to generate significant value for our business. Overall business conditions are positive. Demand for space in our portfolio remain strong. Leasing activity is helping. We had occupancy growth of 80 basis points compared to Q1 2013 in the quarter is 95.5%, accelerating releasing spreads to $9.90 per square foot. Our comp NOI growth for malls and outlets was 3.7% despite higher cost from utilities and snow removal. If we normalize this, this affected our comp by roughly 90 basis points and as a point of reference comp NOI including The Mills and excluding the malls to be spun-off as part of WP was 5.3% for the quarter including the high cost of snow and utility removal.","Now as reported, our retail sales were essentially flat and I would encourage you to look at our revenues as opposed to our retailer sales. As you know, if we had underperforming retailers we have the ability to replace them with better retailers at generally higher rents which generates higher SPG revenues and as I have said repeatedly current retail sales does not correlate to our ability to grow our cash flow and as a reminder, our consolidated revenues, the revenues that I focus on, grew by 8.2% for the year. These results are testament to the strength of our assets and the desirability of our locations.","Now development construction continues on new premium outlets in Charlotte, Minneapolis, Montr\u00e9al and Vancouver, all high quality major markets and that remains our only focus in new development is in those kind of markets. Other new outlet projects in our development pipeline are moving forward. We have up to six additional new outlets expected to start construction in 2014 and 2015. Redevelopment and expansion projects are ongoing at 29 properties in the U.S., Asia and Mexico.","We started construction on two important redevelopment projects in our portfolio. They include the relocation of Bloomingdale's at Stanford Mall in Palo Alto and the redevelopment of its former location to add 120,000 new square feet of space for small shops and restaurants and the relocation of Saks Fifth Avenue at Houston Galleria to a new prototype store plus the redevelopment of that existing of Saks and an expansion adding the 105000 square feet of luxury retail and restaurants. We also started construction on the expansion of Yeoju premium outlets in Seoul, Korea. That will add approximately 259,000 square feet and we have a healthy pipeline of other premium outlet expansion projects in the works.","Desert Hills premium outlets in celebrating the opening of its expansion beginning this Thursday, adding 147,000 square feet and it is fully an example. As an example, the annualized NOI from this expansion will add $17 million to SPG's NOI, as it's a wholly-owned asset. Construction is ongoing to expand and enhance some of our most productive properties including Roosevelt Field, Woodbury Common, Lenox Square and Del Amo to name a few. Overall we continue to expect redevelopment investments of at least $1 billion annually through 2016 that will contribute incremental growth in NOI and strengthen the position of our assets in the respective geographic areas.","On Kl\u00e9pierre, the transformative Carrefour deal selling 126 smaller assets for nearly \u20ac2 billion closed last week. McArthurGlen, our new investment in the outlet business in Europe is performing well. Our deal signed transactions during the first quarter included our acquisition of the remaining interest in Kravco Simon which held interest in a portfolio of 10 assets including King of Prussia Mall which we now own 100% and the acquisition of Arizona Mills bringing our interest to that center of 100% as well as development land in Oyster Bay, Long Island from the Taubman Centers.","Just an update on Washington Prime Group. WP spin-off of 98 assets including our strip center business is expected to be completed in the second quarter. Recent activities include announced members of senior management team, an independent Board of Directors including Mark Orban as CEO. We are pleased also today to announce that Mark Richards will be joining WP as CFO. He is well respected and has worked with Mark successfully at Sunrise Senior Living.","We received indicative investment grade range from three major credit agencies as follows, S&P BBB, Moody's BAA2, Fitch BBB. All three agencies provided a stable outlook. Very strong ratings out-of-the-box and comparable to many REITs that have been rated for a long time. The balance sheet will be ready to enable the company in its pursuit of cash flow growth. Completed financing activities on WP. Nine mortgages were closed in unsecured facility comprised of a $900 million revolving credit facility and a $500 million term loan were completed.","Now let me turn to the SPG capital markets update. We completed a $1.2 billion senior unsecured notes offering in January with a weighted average duration of 7.5 years at an average coupon rate of 2.975%. The 65 basis point spread over treasuries for the five-year tranche is the tightest five years spread ever for a REIT. On March 14 Fitch upgraded our credit ratings to A. We are now at the mid-A level with all three of the agencies leading the REIT industry. We closed or locked rates on four new secured loans in the quarter totaling $860 million of which our share was $491 million and we expect to generate $1 billion of cash proceeds from the WP spin upon its completion.","Early in April, we amended and extended our $4 billion unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility to a June 2019 final maturity and we are able to reduce the interest rate to LIBOR plus 80 basis points on LIBOR plus 95 basis points, again the best in the market. We raised the dividend again this quarter to a $1.30 per share. That's an increase of $0.05 per share from last quarter and a year-over-year increase of 13%. We will pay at SPG at least $5.15 per common share in 2014 not including the WP expected dividend. As we said to you originally the WP expected dividend will create an overall effective dividend of $5.65 or another at least $0.50 on a one-for-one basis for WP spin.","Now let's go to guidance. We revised our 2014 guidance upwards to $9.60 to $9.70 of FFO per share. This incorporates our strong performance in the first quarter. It raises both the top and the bottom by $0.10. It's based upon an annual comp NOI growth of at least 4% for combined mall and outlet portfolio. This FFO guidance is comparable basis with our 2013 results and ignores any potentially impact of the WP spin. Once the spin-off is completed, we will provide updated guidance through a press release reflecting what the impact of SPG will be for the balance of the year.","So overall, we had a strong start to the year. We are absolutely focused on creating value for our properties and for our tenants and for our shareholders and now we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group","Thanks. Good morning.","David Simon","Good morning.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group","Hi, David. I can appreciate your comment about tenant sales, how that doesn't directly impact your business short-term, but I was wondering if you guys could maybe try and isolate what the weather impact was and if you or Rick could maybe talk about regional sales performance and did you see any differences in places like Florida, Texas and California versus the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest?","David Simon","I would refute your first statement, Steve, and I would suggest to you that the most important thing in terms of growing our cash flow is in fact what the market rents of our space are which are not determined by what current retailers are producing out of that space and what our rollover schedule looks like. And in fact if you see our rent spreads of nearly $10 per foot, that would indicate exactly, sure we do have some risk to overage rent as sales ebb and flow, but the fact of the matter is recurrent retail sales generally don't have an impact.","And take an example, there are a number of the retailers that are really not performing that well for each one have a variety of reasons. That's in our sales numbers for our retailers, yet that has nothing to do with what the market value of that space can be. And so again, you should be obsessed with our sales. I am obsessed with our revenues, the SPG revenues. Retailers come and go.","If we were worried about retail sales, this company was originally built, we had Kmart as our anchors. And if we had looked at Kmart sales, we would have suggested that our sales or our revenues could never grow, but in fact what we do here is we are able to replace underperforming retailers with better retailers and we are able to garner the market rent of what our space should be and that continues to go up. So this is not a short-term issue. This is an issue that's existed for the balance of this 50 year history of this company.","So now Rick can mention regional, fact of the matter is, sure the weather, this company will never use weather as an excuse. It certainly affected our comp NOI by 90 basis points because of high utility snow. We often talk about the winter. That's in our rearview mirror. It certainly had an impact on our retailers that exist in our buildings, but it doesn't change the fundamentals of the fact that our business is solid. It has the ability to grow its cash flow. We have a long demonstrated track record of being able to do that and we will continue to do that but the markets that didn't have snow, et cetera, they were not as effective in terms of those retailers are reporting.","I do remind you that the like to remind that the strip center which don't even report tenant sales, but Rick, I don't know if you want to add anything to it.","Rick Sokolov","I do. One thing, not only do we not use weather as an excuse with you. We do not allow our operating teams in any of our platforms to use weather as an excuse and we expect those results to be delivered. You will not be surprised to hear that the better markets where the Pacific, Florida, the Southwest and Las Vegas. And the markets that were most impacted by the weather were the Plains, the Great Lakes and the Mid-Atlantic. No great insights there, but as David said, we are managing through.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group","Okay, thanks, and then just on the leasing front. I know most of the leasing is done for this year, but Rick can you give us some insight as to what kind of leasing is done for next year?","Rick Sokolov","We are right on track with our leasing renewals and leasing the space this year and as we sit here today we are right where we were last year this time for this year, but there is increasing demand. As David said, our job is to curate our properties and bring in the most productive and the growing tenants and eliminate or downsize the tenants that are least provocative. And that's what we do on an ongoing basis.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman - Citi","Yes, actually this is Michael Bilerman, Citi. David, I just had one question just in terms of global expansion. I wasn't sure if your British conference call coordinator was on purpose or not. We are sort of yellow this business is clearly global. You have moved that global on all the regions. How do you feel about traditional retail and where are your thoughts are about that side of the business and pursuing more global expansion?","David Simon","Well, look, we have a great outlet platform in Asia. In fact, Stanley is over in Asia, I guess, tomorrow. It's tomorrow, right? So technically, here today ahead of our self. So we are looking at other Southeast Asia markets to expand our platform. We have been really successful everywhere in Asia in the outlet business. Japan, Korea, Malaysia. There is a number of Southeastern markets, not China, that are that are very interesting to us. So I would expect Michael to hopefully be able to build some new centers there.","We have a good outlet potential in Mexico where we got a couple of new sites that we are pursuing aggressively, including the expansion of our one outlet there. The Brazilian outlet opportunity is somewhat dormant at this point. I couldn't find the right sites in the market know. We were fortuitous in that the market obviously is correcting there. So we have no capital at risk and we have nothing unnecessarily planned there.","And then we have got McArthurGlen which we are very excited about not just the assets that we have interest in but also the development and management platform as well as some of their new expansion opportunities and new development. I was over there a couple weeks ago looking at one of their opportunities. So we think that that business will become more important to us over time. Turning to the full price, I think our model will continue to be opportunistic.","We love in retrospect what happened at Kl\u00e9pierre. We went in there before anybody thought about investing in European real estate based upon two fundamental beliefs. One is that the cash flow is very sticky. So far so good, ex-Spain, which in fact was not very sticky but it means less and less to us now that we have sold this huge portfolio the Carrefour. We can help the company from a strategic point of view and get them retail focused and all the other things that we have been doing. Help them become better operators. All of which have, in fact, scarily have gone according to plan.","So we want to be opportunistic. There is a lot of capital now in Europe. The U.K. is not a real focus for us. Prices are not necessarily cheap and they are not opportunistic and we had a disappointing experience there in retrospect to shareholders and the Board should have thought, the shareholders technically never get an opportunity but the Board should probably thought about it's response a little bit more thoroughly than it did. But that said, we are going to continue to be opportunistic. This is not glamorous and it's primarily the focus is if we can add and export our ability and the number one goal is to make money. I have no interest in building monuments.","Christy McElroy - Citi","Hi, David, it's Christy here. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your new Simon Venture Group. Are you spending any time on this personally? How much capital what you anticipate investing over time? What sort of returns are you looking at? Can you give us some examples of the types of companies you are looking at?","David Simon","Well, sure. We have just hired Skyler Fernandes, who has early stage VC experience. We have made a couple of small investments before Skyler's involvement, with Jifiti and shopkick, I am sorry, I almost said Shop and Trick, which have been small investments and it's really the primary focus is in areas where we think it's going to apply the investment or the business model will apply to our physical environment. It could be a new retailer. It could be a new restaurant. It can be a new technology that is important to our consumers and our retailer. I think over time we could invest anywhere from $25 million to $50 million. We are going to do it very small. We don't want to have a big staff.","If Skyler is listening, Skyler, you are going to have to do most of this on your own. I am involved. I met a couple of hours yesterday. We have got a couple of, these are $1 million up to $5 million investments a piece, but it's really trying to of focus on bettering our product, and we can do that through new retailers, restaurants. We can do that through new technology. We can do with through new services and we can do it in a way that can help our retailers who like the live which in fact is on the forefront of ultimately providing same-day delivery services to our consumers which seems to resonate with a number of our consumer.","So that's the theory. It's going to morph. The good news is we only have really two investment mistakes over time that I called material, not material but, in China we only have got $0.75 on $1, but we learned that in China you have to be very careful. We also investment in technology in the late 90s. We learned a lot from that. The whole model has changed now because that actually had great ideas there but investing in building the stuff, this was before the cloud. We had to buy the routers, the servers. You had to build everything. Now you can essentially rent it all out. The economics is such that you are never going to have that kind of capital at risk to see whether or not a new idea or a new technology can germinate to something that's meaningful to our portfolio.","Christy McElroy - Citi","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Dan Oppenheim - Credit Suisse","Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can talk about the issue with the tenant sales talking about previously that the tenant sales doesn't matter but it's really the cash flow. Presumably the cost of occupancy overtime does matter. Its highlight of the team retailers. Should we assume that, given the comments on team retailers that ex that you are feeling quite good and confident about cost of occupancy overall?","David Simon","Well, yes, look, our business has, over its 50 year history, and 20 years as a public company where we produced unbelievable results, but we ask retailers that get hot, get cold, new concept, old concept. It's just the nature of our business. And again, occupancy costs are determined at a particular point in time, but it doesn't necessarily equate to what the market value of that rent is or that space is, because again that sale that's being generated out of that space is that particular retailer and that particular retailer could not be generating the sales that that particular space should be generating, That's where it relies on us to either relocate them or replace them with a newer better retailer.","So again, if you looked at our top 10 tenants 20 years ago versus today and if you looked at our cash flow growth 20 years ago to today, despite all of the noise about particular retailers here in near, there is such strong evidence to support my statement. So occupancy costs is interesting but it's not a factor in what our ability to generate cash flow growth is. You have to look at the rollover schedule and how that equates to market rents, and market rents are determined based upon supply and demand.","So in the office sector, you do the same thing. In the strip center sector, you do the same thing. In the industrial sector, you do the same thing. But here, for whatever reason, the mall industry has gotten away from cash flow growth as the important determinant in what the value of our company is and more what are the existing retailer sales. I don't buy that and I have never run this company based upon that and our track record is evidence of that. I don't know what else to tell you.","Dan Oppenheim - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","Rick Sokolov","The only thing I would add is, that the underlying David's point about supply and demand, there is virtually no new supply. If you look over the last six years, supply has been growing 50 bips a year lower than the rate of our population growth. So we are in a very good supply dynamic for the foreseeable future.","David Simon","And again, retailers, it ebbs and it flows. Sometimes there is more retailers that are under pressure than sometimes not but you cannot replicate our buildings. You cannot build it. There is no new supply. And supply and demand is in our favor. Otherwise we couldn't grow our cash flow. It's that simple. And I encourage everybody. I hope this doesn't sound defensive but I encourage everybody to understand how we run the business, where we run it over a long period of time. We are always replacing retailers. Some of toughest calls that Rick and I get are the ones when we move an underperforming retailer out for a better performing retailer and the retailers that are underperforming, the fact that they could be there for five, 10 years and their rents are way under market. And it may look bad in their sales, but the fact is, it's welcome from us because we can replace them with a better tenants.","Let's take lease settlement income as part of that discussion. The fact is that if somebody, like we had some recent settlement income. Sony is exiting the mall business. Sony is in A malls. If they pay me the present value of being in that space and I get that space back and I can lease it for current market value, you and me, you are not made of shareholders and analysts but you in a sense represent shareholders. You and me, have just done a good deed. We now get the present value of that space obligation. I get the space back. I can lease it for market rent. That's a win for us.","And again, you have seen that over a period of time with retailers and the lease settlement income is being generated by our top centers. For whatever reason, certain retailers are not wanting to get out of the business or not performing well at this center has nothing to do with that center.","Dan Oppenheim - Credit Suisse","Thank you, and I guess one question in terms of the cash flow. There is a comment in terms of the NOI growth, ex-WP being 5.3%. Should we compare that 5.3% to 3.7%? And it would seem then that WP had much lower NOI growth but presumably a lot of the assets being in the Midwest and some in Mid-Atlantic would have some impact there.","David Simon","Well the real important thing we did was we put in The Mills there, which generated -- one of the things we are thinking about comments are welcome, is that we have not historically put The Mills comp NOI growth in our overall comp NOI but once the spin is done it's likely, we are happy to give input on this, it is likely that we will then put that in our comp NOI because these are big cash flow generating assets and it's probably they are the bigger assets which is consistent with what SPG is doing going forward focused on the bigger assets and it will probably be on our comp NOI pool. So we wanted to give you a flavor of what that comp NOI growth would be including The Mills. And there is some marginal benefit of the fact that if you were taking out the WP assets but it's marginal and you are correct in saying that because of the snow and utility costs and a lot of those centers are located in the areas the got whacked in the first quarter, you are correct in saying that that had some impact on that comp NOI as it did for SPG as a whole.","Dan Oppenheim - Credit Suisse","Thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan of MLV. Please proceed.","Paul Morgan - MLV","Hi. Good morning. David, I think your comment about market rent for space not being related to what the existing retailer is doing and I think maybe one of those, a great example might be just replacing department store space with small shops, any upside you see there, kind of like what you are doing at Stanford, but give us any sense of how many of those opportunities are in your pipeline? You announced a couple projects. The Phipps and the Pentagon City but is this something you are having discussions with department stores increasingly where they can you maybe downsize and you can recapture space at much higher rents? Any color?","David Simon","We are always looking for that and I will let Rick comment on it. It's interesting though while that neither one of those guys are leaving. They are actually getting new stores in that process but we are able to make the economics work because of the supply and demand of those particular assets. They are both antiquated physical plans. So we are able to make a win-win out of it in that we reclaim REIT demise their existing space, turn over to small shops. They get a brand new prototype store and it's a win-win but part of the lease settlement income that we generate in the first quarter was the full present value of the fact obligation for the mall where they paid us. They are leaving shortly.","Rick Sokolov","They are under construction.","David Simon","And we are going to reclaim that for small shops that's a mall that's close to $1,000 a foot, something like that. But thee is a handful of those. Rick you want to add? There are a handful of those kind of opportunities.","Rick Sokolov","And we are constantly mining the portfolio. We just announced literally an expansion at Pentagon. We have announced, David just talked about Florida mall. And both of those are just in addition to all of the things we completed over the last year and obviously we are always talking with our department stores about where they got space that we believe could be better deployed and we are in constant conversations about whether we can put it to better use. And sometimes it happens independent of us. A great example of that is DICK'S that is being added in one levels Sears in King of Prussia that we have basically done inside the Sears store but that's going to make that property substantially more productive by having DICK'S anchor around one level in Sears consolidating in a more productive box on one level.","Paul Morgan - MLV","My other question is related, but I think there has obviously been a lot of headlines about not just sales but mall traffic and then we have had a tick up in bankruptcies and store closing announcements and so but what you don't hear as much about is the retailers who are looking to backfill that space. Maybe I don't know, Rick, if you have some color about people who, for example, would be looking to take the Coldwater Creek stores that are liquidating or folks like that who have upped their store opening targets?","Rick Sokolov","David always makes fun of me when I rattle of the list of the tenants but the good news is that there is a very vibrant of group of tenants that are looking to expand. Lego, Athleta, H&M, Zara, Uniqlo, just a few, and Topshop, we are adding Topshop's in three places in the portfolio. There are, to David's point, historically there have always been tenant that are looking to do business in productive properties and to the extent the space we are getting back is in productive properties and happily that's the vast majority of our portfolio. We have users and we have demand at better rents and the opportunity to rightsize the space.","Paul Morgan - MLV","Great. Thanks.","David Simon","Yes, and just a comment on traffic. I would suggest to you that when a retailer talks about traffic, that may be their particular stores and may not be endemic of the mall's traffic and I would also caution, throw significant caution to the wind that there are a couple of, one company in particular that holds themselves out as the barometer of traffic in the mall industry and there data does not include any common area or inference data from the Simon Property Group and many other mall owners of a quality real estate and we don't know how and in fact what that traffic is that they report. So I just want to throw caution to the wind when you hear these general statements about traffic. Was traffic affected by the winter? And the fact is that malls, we have some statistic, which I don't even remember but how many days our malls were closed compared to last year was 10x of what it was. So that can happen. It happened. I just want you to throw caution to the wind when the media quotes traffic numbers, understand the source of that and its accuracy.","Paul Morgan - MLV","So you are saying your portfolio is doing better than what they are saying for the industry?","David Simon","I am saying, our traffic was affected by the weather and I am saying you look at our results and that gives you an indication of what's going on our portfolio.","Paul Morgan - MLV","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of David Harris of Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","Good morning, everybody. The Carrefour sale by Kl\u00e9pierre, does that prompt any consideration for special dividend under the French REIT rules, David?","David Simon","No. The answer is no, because they have the ability to straddle years a little bit like this as well and they are also unwinding some hedges as part of that because they were over hedged. So there is some losses associate with that. The fact is, it will not end up in a situation where there is an unusual dividend spike. Dividend has been growing. Expect that to probably continue but there won't be something extraordinary associated with that sale.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","So the proceeds will be essentially used to delever the company, at least the initial thought?","David Simon","Correct. That's correct.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","Okay. Does that leave you looking for acquisitions in that company now as we go forward? Or are you happy with a lower level of leverage?","David Simon","No, I think the company is now in a position that it can look for opportunities, whether new development, expansions, some acquisitions here and there but they are clearly focused on, given the significant change they are very focused on growing the business now which two years ago when we got there, I would say it was a different scenario. So thankfully they have executed extremely well and they are looking for growth similar to what all major retail owners do. Do some developments, some expansion, some potential acquisitions here and there.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","Now your estimable CFO has not yet been given a speaking part, but I just wondered if there is any update on his replacement.","David Simon","Well, unfortunately, you have asked a question where he can't respond to that either.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","Well, I don't give great quarter, guys, but I wanted to throw in a compliment.","Steve Sterrett","Thank you.","David Simon","A pat on the back never hurts from anybody. So in any event, as you know we have been, it's very interesting, this company again, there is lot that gets lost in sauce. On one hand this week, we were going to open Desert Hills. It's going to be 100% leased and it's going to add $70 million of cash flow the company. At the same time, we hired a new venture guy. Europe is doing well. You got all the redevelopment. We are doing the WP deal, right and then obviously I have got the focus on Steve's replacement. So just from a, my point of view here, and this is probably, I am telling the people here, they are probably looking for me to say what I am going to say.","So I have been thinking long and hard about this and as you know, the biggest focus we had over the last two or three months has been WP. That management team is basically set, done, which is very good news and it's a great team. They are young, energetic. It's got a mix of Simon trained folks. It's got our strip center entrepreneurial group and then it's got the outsider and a couple of his colleagues that I think ultimately will create their unique dynamic company that's really going to be hustling for growth.","Now that that's said and it looks like the spin is, again subject to Board approval, winding around the last corner. I have been thinking more and more about this and I will probably have an opinion in a month or two but right now I am seriously considering internal candidates as the first line of defense. The good news is, we have got a great bench. We got guys that are savvy veterans, younger people that want to move up. We have a great culture here, and I think we can do it internally but I don't want to rush to judgment. I want WP to get done and then I think once that gets done, something could happen in the next four to eight weeks.","That's probably news to everybody in this room but therein lies my thinking. So I hope you appreciate the honesty of my response.","David Harris - Imperial Capital","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ki Bin of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin - SunTrust","Thanks. I had just a couple of follow-ups. In terms of traffic data and your tenant replacement commentary, could you just talk a little bit, we are midway through April, almost May now and I wouldn't say it has been very warm, but have you seen some kind of catch up in the past couple months in terms of tenant traffic or sales or anything like that that might be a better indicator going forward?","Rick Sokolov","I think we can say that April is off to a much better start. We obviously had Easter moving from March into April. March was better than February. February was better than January and that trend is continuing in to April and we certainly anticipate that we will have some catch up.","Ki Bin - SunTrust","Okay and the second question. I am sure you guys get this all the time, but if you had to estimate, how many more outlets do you think in the U.S. that we absolutely could use? And how does that number compare to some of your, like in Europe where you are trying to expand?","David Simon","Well, again, if you look at some of the general industry publications, there is a pipeline of 50 and I would just say I don't believe that that whole pipeline will be built. I do think last year, 2013 and 2014 was going to be an active year. So I think you will see five or six or so in the next two, three, four, five years. So if I had to guess I think you are going to see probably 20 or so added over the next three, four, five years. I don't think it's going to be quite as frenzied as everybody thinks. I think we have a really good handle, as you might imagine, on this industry. So that's my own personal view, but I don't control. Developers are always pushing the limit. Whether four or five or six that outlets get built, it doesn't impact our outlet business and what we do. And as you know we are looking to only build in major markets where there really is unquestionable demand for the premium outlet product. If it's a marginal market, we are just going to pass and we have passed on a number of sites. Rick, you can add anything?","Rick Sokolov","The one thing that I would emphasize and David talked about in the context of Desert Hills, we are spending as much time and money expanding our existing great premium outlet as we are trying to build new ones. Desert Hills opens Thursday. We opened an expansion in Orlando. We opened an expansion at Seattle. We are under construction on Las Vegas North Downtown 147,000 feet. We are expanding Woodbury. We are expanding Chicago. And these are all among the best outlets in the United States. We are expanding Livermore and all of those expansions taken together are probably two or three new projects but they will be dramatically more productive, dramatically better returns and they have the benefit of enhancing what we already have.","Ki Bin - SunTrust","Okay, and a similar question, but how about for Europe? Do you see that potential of it being just a lot bigger?","David Simon","Yes, I think Europe, the right to build there is much more difficult but there is a pipeline that we have at MGE that we are going to pursue but it's lot tougher. It's a lot harder to get done. There is a lot more restrictions in terms of how outlets get viewed in Europe in terms of laws there. But if you do get the right to build, it's a terrific, terrific opportunity. So it will be more but I think it will be measured and we will have our share of that, but there is definitely part of what we want to do with MGE. It was in fact build some new centers in Europe.","Ki Bin - SunTrust","Okay. Thank you guys.","David Simon","Sure","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Hi, it's Craig Schmidt for Jeff Spector. I was just wondering if we could spend a little time talking about The Mills. It seems like it has the highest return on redevelopments. Its minimum rents are growing well and it's also seemed to have done the best in terms of sales per square foot productivity since 4Q 2009, in terms of its lift. I know you were doing a lot of things at a lot of different Mills, but what's meeting with the biggest success to sort of drive this?","Rick Sokolov","Craig, it's Rick. I think that The Mills have been performing great and I think that some of it, hopefully a lot of it is attributable to us being able to broaden their appeal. What we have been able to do through our relationships is bring tenants that have been successful in premium outlet in The Mills operate off price concepts, and bring tenants into The Mills from the mall business to operate full price concepts. And that combination has been very compelling. So tenants like Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works are operating full price concepts and tenants like Michael Kors, Coach, Express are operating off price concepts. That combination has created, as David said, properties that are 1.5 to 2 million square feet doing hundreds of million of dollars of sales and providing unique franchise in each of the markets where they operate. So we have been very pleased with it and we are growing and we have got expansions underway at Sawgrass. We are working on redevelopments at Great Mall. We are working on expansion at Orange and there's a lot of growth runway to open that platform.","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Is there any potential for a ground-up development of a Mills project at this point?","Rick Sokolov","I think that's going to be more difficult. Frankly there are not many markets left in the United States that can support a 2 million square feet ground up development that does $500 million and $700 million from day one. So I would not look for that.","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay, and then the Yeoju expansion, the premium outlet. Is there any direction that you want to take the new tenants that you are bringing into that project?","David Simon","It will continue to be the high-end tenants there. The existing center has a great tenant mix. So there will continue to be of all the American as well as European brands and the international companies. It is a international retail mix. There are some Korean retailers, but by and large its all the brands that you are familiar with.","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay, and then hopefully this is the Steve Sterrett question. The pickup in other income, will we see that going forward? Will we have as active a land sales and\/or the lease settlement? Or should we assume that that starts to resemble 2013?","Steve Sterrett","Craig, Rick and David talked a lot about the lease settlement income of and I think we did have a fair bit of that activity in the first quarter. I wouldn't expect that level of activity to go through the rest of the year and land sales, as you know, are pretty lumpy but I certainly wouldn't expect that level of activity for the rest of the year.","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","David Simon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Hello, good morning. Just two questions here. First up, on the line of credit, you guys now have I think almost $7 billion if you include the accordions of capacity, which seems like an awful lot just given that if you guys wanted to do anything I would assume that you would have a line of bankers outside of Indy and 399 Park in less than an hour. Is more of this insurance? Like as you guys pay the facility fee, is more of this just the comfort of knowing that you have that? Or is there something else, like just preparing for the next credit crisis or something, just to know that, God forbid, you had to put on major mortgages or refinancings that you just had that available?","Steve Sterrett","Well, Alex, it's Steve. I do think if you look at our debt maturity schedule, we do have $2 billion to $3 billion of debt maturing a year. We are a large company. We did have, people tend to forget, that we did have an instance, not all that long ago, in this country where the capital markets were pretty dysfunctional for an extended period of time. So we have been operating under a philosophy that we want $5 billion to $6 billion of liquidity at all times. Call it insurance. Call it what you want. But I think that's prudent for a company our size.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Okay, and then just a second question is, what are the next steps or what else needs to be done before the Board can declare Washington Prime good to go?","David Simon","Well, we just have to become effective with the SEC, which we are getting closer and closer. The Board has got to review all the final things and then we make an announcement. So its moving quickly and so it's just a process, essentially just becoming effective with the SEC and then Board approval and we are off to the races.","Steve Sterrett","And you saw, Alex, we filed another amendment to the Form 10 yesterday, the amendment number 3. So we are, as David mentioned, getting down to the short strokes.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Okay, so this is just all the back and forth where they give you comments and hopefully that list of comments is getting smaller and smaller and then it's good?","David Simon","Yes.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","Okay, perfect.","Steve Sterrett","If you are excited, you can read the 600 pages of total documents if you have nothing to do this weekend.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill","You know, my kids were saying, Daddy, we like you doing boring Daddy work. We don't like playing with you. So I will do that. Listen, thanks.","David Simon","All right. No worries. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Daniel Busch of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Daniel Busch - Green Street Advisors","Thank you. David, following the WP spin off of the smaller SPG malls and strip centers, will there be any other remaining malls in the portfolio that you would consider non-core and could be potential candidates for disposition?","David Simon","Well, we will always going to be portfolio manage our asset. So the answer to that is sure. We have partners in some assets. Partners may want to sell. We may agree with them. So yes, sure. We are always going to portfolio manage our asset base.","Daniel Busch - Green Street Advisors","Okay, and it appears like there's a growing number of B and C malls coming to the market. Do you have a sense of what the demand is for that type of quality? Is it similar to the quality that WP is?","David Simon","Well, I don't want to -- again, WP's malls are all sorts of the references from the analytic community. My view of WP's malls are there is the one overriding point is that they are smaller. They are just not big malls. I will let you decide whether that's a B-mall or C-mall, an A-mall. I don't think about it like that. I look at the cash flow what's the sustainability of the cash flow. Is that a market where you can grow the cash flow and the one thing that I will bring with is that they are smaller than our average mall. We think those assets because as we have gotten bigger over time and focused on the bigger assets, they tend to lose the day in and day out focus that they deserve. So with that preamble said, look there is a lot of capital in the real estate industry generally for all sorts of assets and money wants to be put to work in the top quality assets in redevelopment assets, in new development across the specter in hotels, retail, office et cetera and I think WP will be able to take advantage of whatever strategy ultimately they put together. But there are buyers for everything right now in any assets. I look at your NAV analysis and I can tell you, our partner is selling a mall and the cap rate is blowing me away in terms of how low it is. So there is a lot of capital for retail real estate in every bucket and to some extent there is product available and to some extent there is less product available but I expect a lot of trades to happen.","Daniel Busch - Green Street Advisors","Great, thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Hi. Good morning or afternoon to you guys. I just want to go back to the releasing spreads. On a percentage basis, they have been improving for quite a few quarters here now in a row. I am just curious if you could break that down between sort of what's driving that? Is it more market rent increases? Or is it just the base of the malls that are on spaces that are closing? Is it maybe not growing or is going the other way?","Rick Sokolov","Fundamentally, we just have a very good supply and demand dynamic. I would tell you that when you look at our spread calculations, they include almost eight million square feet of space. So it is less susceptible but specific project influences are much more representative of the overall trends throughout our business and we are just able to lease our product at higher rents because frankly I do believe our properties are taking market share and we are having a more desirable portfolio for the retailers to want to operate in.","David Simon","But simply put, the expiring rent is just lower than the market rent. So there is a lot of reasons for that. But that's the simple answer. So if you look at our expiring rent schedule and you see where our market rents are, therein lies why we have the spread which therein lies why we have the ability to increase our cash flow year after year after year. Again you may notice I believe Q1 comp last year was 5%, something like that.","Steve Sterrett","Yes.","David Simon","So our 3.7% was off of a base of 5% that 3.7%, as I mentioned was hurt 90 basis points by extraordinary costs associated with the harsh winter. So you can normalize and do whatever you want with it but that's just how we would look at it and but its that simple. Now notice I didn't talk about retail sales. I talked about market rent.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Right, and that's what I am trying to get at. I guess maybe asking another way is, how (inaudible) market rents for your portfolio have gone up, say, over the last year or so as opposed to the spread, which --?","David Simon","The good news is that its clearly gone up because you have seen the spread accelerate.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay, and maybe just another topic. I know its early days in your ownership there on the Oyster Bay development, but is there any update on how the development planning process is going over there?","David Simon","It's very early days. So really nothing to add there other than we are excited about the opportunity. Our partners are excited about the opportunity. We very much look forward to working with the town to fine a win-win. So we think it's a great opportunity for us and it will be a high priority for us over the next year or so as we go through the process.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay, thanks.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Yes, good afternoon. Going back to development and redevelopment yields, also noticed that you took up the yield on the outlet development to 10% from 9% last quarter. Just wondering what was driving that?","Steve Sterrett","Two things. One, we been able to bring in our cost at a little below budget. Two, we have got a lot of demand and we been able to lease it at higher rents. Hence we got higher returns.","David Simon","I would say it differently. I would say typically they sandbag us on the rent they charge but we let it get approved in any event. So it's all about setting expectations. Isn't it?","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Very much so. Were there any particular assets that kind of drove the average up? Or is this kind of happening across the entire development portfolio?","David Simon","Pretty much across the board, we are seeing those trends.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Okay, that's helpful, and then just staying on the outlet side, again there was some news out there a few days ago about Charlotte, North Carolina and the whole process of your development there, some pushback from local residents. Just kind of curious if you could opine on that?","David Simon","It's opening on July 31 of this year and it's very well leased and we are in very good shape there.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Okay, that is helpful, and then last one from me. This one to Steve. Credit provisioning levels also went up during the quarter. Just kind of curious what you are seeing from that perspective and what we should be modeling going forward.","Steve Sterrett","Tayo, we talked a lot over the last few years about that expense being really low. I think what you saw this quarter is just a bit of a reversion to the mean. If you look in the context of $5 billion plus of consolidated revenues, I think we billed north of $7 billion a year to the tenants. Having $5 million of bad debt expense a quarter is still pretty de minimis, but I think that's probably more reflective of the run rate that we are going to see this year.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Is that reflective, you are just updating your estimates or are you actually seeing more issues with the tenants themselves that's actually causing an actual increase in that number?","David Simon","No, it's a bit of a combination of both. Our overall receivable level is still pretty well but interestingly enough our bad debt reserve is pretty much formulate driven and because you have had more tenant either announce store closings or in a couple of cases go into bankruptcy, we reserve a higher percentage of outstandings against the types of tenants and it generated a slightly higher bad debt expense this quarter.","Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies","Great. Thank you very much.","David Simon","Tayo, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ben Yang of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Ben Yang - Evercore","Yes, hi, thanks. Maybe just building on the earlier lease spread question, I believe your spreads are based on openings and closings. So I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about spreads based on signed leases? Maybe what that trend has been? And also maybe how that compares with that 19.5% that you report in your supplemental.","Steve Sterrett","Ben, you are right in that the spread is based on cash closing rent compared to cash opening rent, but because the population, as Rick mentioned, is still large, I mean it's eight million square feet at any one point in time. Looking at it on a signed basis relative to the actual opening isn't going to move the number up a lot, but I will echo what Rick said earlier that demand for space is good, deal quality continues to improve overall. We have been pleased to see the continued acceleration in the leasing spreads but looking at it from a signed basis to an actual opening basis isn't going to materially move the number.","Ben Yang - Evercore","Okay, got it, that's helpful, and then also you talked a little bit about the lease termination income. Was that all Sony? Or were there other retailers in that mix? And maybe also, since it's a lot higher, can you also offer what your guidance is for the full year on that line item?","David Simon","Yes, we don't like to do that but we have the Sony and then I mentioned about the other department store scenario. So that gives you the bulk of it more or less.","Steve Sterrett","In commenting, Ben, on the volume of it, if you look back over our last several years, we have averaged $20 million to $25 million a year of lease settlement income. We just happen to have a larger chunk of that in the first quarter. Could it be more f significant in 2014 than it has been in n the last of couple years? Well, we are certainly off to start, and as David and Rick mentioned, because a couple of the lumpy things that have occurred in the first quarter, it could trend a little higher but it's certainly not going to trend at the same level we saw in the first quarter.","David Simon","Yes, and again, I want to emphasize this is a --","Steve Sterrett","It's a good thing.","David Simon","It's a good thing because again I don't lose the space. I just get at present value the lease obligation or very close to it. Then I have the ability to lease the space out. So it is not something, we have got to get the right values. We do lots of analysis, as you might imagine. We are very sophisticated on this front.","Steve Sterrett","Or typically we don't execute it until we have got our replacement in place.","David Simon","But this is not a bad thing at all.","Ben Yang - Evercore","All right, I totally get it, it's not bad, but could it tick higher to that $20 million to $25 million that you have historically reported in the past?","David Simon","It has a chance this year primarily because we did the one big deal with the department store which I would say is somewhat out of the ordinary.","Ben Yang - Evercore","I mean, was that big deal, was that kind of baked into your earlier guidance? I am just kind of wondering if that was?","David Simon","Yes.","Ben Yang - Evercore","Okay, got it.,","David Simon","Absolutely. That's been in the works for two, three years.","Ben Yang - Evercore","Okay, helpful, maybe final question. You talked a little bit about the other income in your consolidated. Why exactly did the other income in your joint venture also go higher?","David Simon","Its part of the big lease settlement that I mentioned was in its of JV property.","Steve Sterrett","Yes, the biggest drivers of the movement in that number though, Ben, is the nature of some of the income that flows through from McArthurGlen. A lot of it service related income. As you know, we own half of the economics of the development and management business. So that's the primary driver of that.","Ben Yang - Evercore","Got it. Thank you.","David Simon","Sure. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Mueller - JPMorgan","Yes, hi, thanks. Just following up on that real quick. So the $11 million is consolidated. What is the overall pro rata number for lease term this quarter? And when you talked about $20 million to $25 million normally, is that a consolidated number or is that the pro rata number?","Steve Sterrett","The $20 million to $25 million would be the annual run rate, kind of on a pro rata basis, Michael.","Michael Mueller - JPMorgan","Got it, and what was the full pro rata in Q1 then?","Steve Sterrett","It was high-teens.","Michael Mueller - JPMorgan","Got it, okay, and then last question. I guess historically you have talked about development spend having a bit at least about $1 billion a year for the next few years. As you look out from this standpoint, how many years out does that generally account for at this point?","David Simon","Well, we have said through 2016, but it is not set in stone.","Michael Mueller - JPMorgan","Got it, okay, great. Thanks.","David Simon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan of Cowen Group. Please go ahead.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group","Yes, thank you. Just one quick question, I guess for David and Rick. The so-called fast retailing tenants have been growing pretty dramatically in your properties for a number of years now and I think it shows up with Forever 21 being now a top 10 tenant and an average store size, just looking at the metrics and the setup of more than 10,000 square feet. Historically, of course, you have excluded stores of more than 10,000 square feet in the sales productivity number. I just wonder if, given the ambitious plans of cohorts like H&M and Uniqlo, whether you have given any consideration to perhaps including the fast retailing productivity and the reported productivity, given how important they seem to be and look like it's going to increase in importance.","David Simon","Well, Jim, if you had listened to my --","Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group","I heard every word.","David Simon","Yes, if you listened to my discussion on tenant sales, I would suggest to you, it's an interesting derivative, there's no correlation and the fact is there's no other industry that I know that's focused on retail sales. Therefore this is what's going on with your property. I before saying look at our cash flow and measure us on that basis. And I think somehow the industry is gotten off track here by being the most important metric. I look at the analyst report that came out that even though we beat consensus by $0.14 or something like that, we had unbelievable historical growth. Our comp NOI has grown year after year. It was up marginally in the great recession. The balance sheet is AAA. We are adding all this new development. The one constant dialogue I got was the tenant sales, right. So you want more of that. So I can read more of that. So somehow I am happy have this we discussed with you and other shareholders but somehow we are losing track that retailers come and go. This company was built based upon Kmart leases, okay?","Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group","No, I understand all that. I just think the point is that fast retailing, as a format, does seem to be, in terms of its size, Forever 21 is an in-line tenant and I have no idea, by the way, what their productivity is. It's simply that they are now a top 10 tenant and H&M and Uniqlo have pretty ambitious expansion plans as well. And I was just, all I am doing is suggesting that the original reason for excluding tenants of over 10,000 square feet, I just wonder if it still applies when we think about that type of retailer.","David Simon","I don't think as the mix has broadened in these centers, that metric is probably less and less important. What happens if we bring in service tenants or we take a department store down and put in an office building or an apartment complex. I think we are losing sight of, its real estate and it's about organic cash flow growth and it's not about what particular person is doing in a particular space because again we own the real estate, they don't perform we get it back and then the next question is what can we do with that real estate. So I will tell you what, I will put it in there if you talk about it on page 10 and not on page one. Okay.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group","Well, I will just say for my note, by the way, I stressed if people want more space and are willing to pay more for it, what's the key driver. So not guilty as charged here, at least in that respect.","And just one other question I had for you, and this maybe is a Rick question. The development activity number went up a little close to $300 million at the end of the first quarter versus the end of the year. Am I correct in assuming, Rick, that as far as the mall category, which is where it all took place, that that number didn't include your announcements on Pentagon and Phipps, number one?","Number two, that it would be virtually all the Simon post-spin malls that we are talking about there?","Rick Sokolov","Well, you shouldn't presume the latter because we are reporting everything in a combined basis so far. So in that regard, there is capital attributable to these post-spin assets we are doing things. Houston Galleria has started. We have also started on Florida Mall. So a number of new ones have come in to that mix but it is not a function of post-spin or pre-spin and it does not yet include Pentagon or Phipps. We just announced those will be starting construction this quarter.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group","So the -- sorry.","David Simon","Go ahead, Jim.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group","Sorry, go ahead. Yes, I was just going to say post-spin, and I just want to make sure I understood the comments you made earlier regarding the level of development activity that we should expect from Simon post-spin. Obviously, it sounds like it's going to be the same kind of number as we have been thinking about historically for the company. Obviously the contribution should be relatively greater given that the post-spin company base is going to be a little bit smaller. But is there an opportunity in these malls that there could be an accelerated, an increased level of major expansion spending, given that where you are spending the money and the big money seems to be on the biggest, strongest assets where the demand is really very strong?","Rick Sokolov","Certainly that is going to come about and where we got some of the other projects that we are working on that we hope to announce. We have already talked about connection to King of Prussia. So there are other nine bigger projects coming down the road including Copley that are going to certainly continue that level of spend in the post-spin side.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group","Okay, very good. Thank you, guys.","David Simon","And I was just going to add, Jim, just to make sure everyone that's still on the call, all of our numbers that we reported all include the WP assets, occupancy sales, comp NOI, all of the 8-K step is all including the WP all of that. Just to make sure everybody understands that.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to management for closing remarks.","David Simon","Okay, thank you. Before we conclude today's call for our stockholders that maybe on this call, our annual meeting is May 15 and hopefully you are seeing our proxy statement that we filed on April 10.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the call over to the Vice President Investor of Relations, Tom Ward.","Tom Ward","Thank you, Lauren. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Presenting on today\u2019s call is David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also on the call are Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; Andy Juster, Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Broadwater, Chief Accounting Officer.","Before we begin, a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. We refer you to today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements.","Please note that this call includes information that maybe accurate only as of today\u2019s date. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the press release and the supplemental information in today\u2019s Form 8-K filing. Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com. For our prepared remarks, I\u2019m pleased to introduce David Simon.","David Simon","Good morning. We had a productive quarter we completed several significant redevelopment projects, started construction on others, announced even more that will further enhance the value of our real estate. We identified additional avenues for growth through our two new retail partner joint ventures. And most importantly, we continue to produce strong operating and financial performance.","Results in the quarter were highlighted by FFO of $2.63 per share, which included a $0.22 gain on a sale of marketable securities. Excluding the investment gain, FFO per share was $2.41, which exceeded First Call consensus again by $0.06. These results were achieved even with the negative impact of $0.04 for the quarter compared to the prior year quarter due to a strong dollar against the Euro and Yen.","On a comparable basis excluding the contribution from WP properties in the prior year period and again the investment gain, our FFO per diluted share increased 14.2% or over $0.30 year-over-year. Occupancy was 96.1%, leasing activity remains healthy. We recorded spreads of $10.87 an increase of 18.4%.","Comp NOI for the quarter increase 3.6%, which was coming of a 5.6% comp increase in the second quarter of 2014 and for those of you that are interested, we do not include lease settlement income in our comp NOI or new deals such as Jersey Gardens or our recent joint venture activity and we also do not include the impact of recently developed or expanded centers.","And finally, we continue to produce strong comp NOI increases year after year as well as continue to operate at the highest margins in our industry. Total sales across the portfolio will increase 2.2% for the trailing 12 months even with the loss of bankrupt tenants. On a comparable basis, the sales per square foot increase for the 12 months ending June 30 was 4.2%. And as a reminder our sales per square foot metric is not adjusted to remove any tenants who have vacated their spaces and includes tenant sales activity for all months a tenant is open during the trailing 12-month period.","Redevelopment is ongoing to 28 properties across all three platforms for total spend of $1.7 billion. We opened significant expansion activities at Las Vegas North and Shisui Premium Outlets in Japan started construction on several new and strategic projects during the quarter. Construction continues on some iconic properties including Roosevelt Field, The Galleria in Houston, Stanford Shopping Center, King of Prussia, Del Amo, and our premium outlets are expanding in Chicago, San Francisco and Woodbury. This is my opportunity to develop my list, as opposed to Rick's.","Our Chicago and San Francisco outlets open \u2013 expansion open in August and the rest of those kind of expanding of those iconic centers open in the next 12 months. We also announced plans for further expansions in Sawgrass, The Mills at Jersey Gardens, La Plaza Mall, and the shops at Riverside. And we expect our redevelopment investment to be at least to $1 billion annually through 2017 substantially funded with our annual free cash flow, which will continue to contribute incremental growth in our NOI and reinforce the positions of those assets in the respective marketplaces.","Now, let\u2019s turn to new development, construction. It continues on three new outlets all in very major markets and they are scheduled to open in the next three months. Gloucester in Southern Jersey in Philadelphia in fact opens in two weeks, August 13.","Tampa and Tucson open in October. And finally we opened Vancouver on July 9, with traffic that exceeded expectations. Construction continued or in fact started in Columbus with our partner Tanger, and we are slated to begin construction in one new domestic premium outlet, which will be announced for year-end. We also started construction at the shops at Clearfork, our new full-price development in Fort Worth anchored by Neiman Marcus which will open in early 2017 and we are pleased to partner with Swire and the Whitman family on the retail component of Brickell City Centre, which will open in the fall of 2016.","We own 25% of its project and will manage this center upon completion. Kl\u00e9pierre continues to progress according to plan. Their integration of Corio is proceeding well, they continue to recycle their assets and in fact announced a deal to sell a portfolio of Netherlands assets for \u20ac770 million, and which will continue to delever their company.","We also purchased 2% of Kl\u00e9pierre from the BNP offering. We\u2019re now over 20 point \u2013 we\u2019re at 20.3%. We purchased those and the stock is obviously trading higher than where we purchase that additional 2%.","Balance sheet activity continues strong, we did several secured financings in the quarter, continue to lower our borrowing cost, increased our debt maturity. Our liquidity is $5.5 billion. Our industry-leading balance sheet continues to get reinforced and separates us from our peer group.","Our unencumbered cash flow is well over $2.5 billion as Andy shakes his head affirmatively. And finally on the balance sheet we, as you know, announced our $2 billion share repurchase we in fact in the quarter bought $505 million during the quarter of both common and units which is disclosed.","Now the dividend and let\u2019s not lose side of the dividend. We have announced yet another increase sequentially at 3% through $1.55 and the year-over-year increase of 19%. We will pay at least $6 in 2015, which is an increase of at least 17% from 2014 and well above where we were in the great recession at the height of $3.60 in 2008. So finally guidance has been increased again up to $10.02 to $10.07.","And we are now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will be coming from the line of Ross Nussbaum. Your line is open.","Ross Nussbaum","Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. Here with Jeremy Metz. Hey, David with the repurchase from the OP unitholders, who were the sellers of those units? Did you approach them? Did they approach you? How did that work?","David Simon","A little bit of both, it was associated with the prime transaction loss that we completed in 2010 and they were the sellers.","Ross Nussbaum","Okay, so no members of the Simon family sold\u2026","David Simon","That's correct.","Ross Nussbaum","Okay. Okay, and then on the buyback as well, how should we think about it from a balance sheet perspective? If I look at your funding needs against your after-dividend free cash flow, my math is basically you can fund your entire development program with, call it $1 billion of free cash flow a year. So if you continue to buyback stock at this rate, obviously, the leverage of the company would tick higher. So how should we all think about continued buyback versus balance sheet?","David Simon","Well, it\u2019s a very good question. I think the first \u2013 we want that in our arsenal. We are sensitive to \u2013 it\u2019s part of our capital allocation strategy. I think you should look at this first step is a trade from one, from our other marketable securities that we had held with no reason to hold those we basically took that capital and reinvested in our business as we wanted to signal the market that we believe and the continual growth of our enterprise.","I think it should also signal, we are out of the big deal business. So I think no ones picked that up, but we don't see any big deals on the horizon for us. So we are obviously very focused on the development, redevelopment as you know I mean I stumble I\u2019m not a very good reader of a text, but you look at our activity in the redevelopment and new development it\u2019s astronomical, it\u2019s industry-leading lots of great stuff going on and I think that's the way to look at it.","We are price-sensitive, we wanted there. REIT stocks have been very volatile, but I think if the signal that we took one investment and reinforced that we\u2019re out of the big deal business. That's not to say we might find a deal here or there, but the balance sheet is sacrosanct to us, we haven't worked 22 years to do it, we survived the last great recession with flying colors, we quadrupled our dividend and earning per share and all the other stuff that I won\u2019t go through it all, but I think it's a more of a signal and the belief in our business and also signal the market that were out of the big deal business.","Operator","Our next question will be coming from the line of Michael Bilerman. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman","Great. Hey, David, good morning. Just continuing in terms of the buyback, you talk about your business and having confidence in your business. You didn't talk a little bit about discount to NAV and the arbitrage that exists between public and private. I take your comment exactly in terms of flipping out of Macerich that $450 million, putting it into your own stock, which I think has great prospects. But would you think about accelerating or selling interest in any assets to go further into your stock and narrow that discount that exists between public and private?","David Simon","Well, look, I think the reason - it's more than just NAV. It\u2019s what your enterprise can do in terms of growing your earnings and cash flow, and then ultimately increasing your dividend. I mean as you know I mean, if you strip out the gain in that WPR, our quarter-over-quarter growth was 14.3% which as you know, a lot of people have criticized our size yet we continue to be industry-leading earnings growth.","So you\u2019ve got to look at, whenever you invest in something, what's that yield going to get you? And as our earnings grows you know that\u2019s not a bad investment. So it\u2019s more than just the NAV analysis. We also - we will continue to sell what I call lower quality non-important assets to us. We don't publicize it until after it's done, but we\u2019ll continue to prune the portfolio. But we\u2019re not a big believer in selling our top assets to reinforce the value of our company for external purposes I mean we know what we\u2019re worth and we operate - I mean, that\u2019s why we are in this job. We\u2019ll operate accordingly.","But selling the top assets at the end of the day those top assets tend to grow the most. And I'd rather have our shareholders own more of it than less of it. We have the free cash flow to take advantage of the arb that may exist between private and public values, and it\u2019s just another tool that we have available to us to take advantage as we look for investment opportunities.","Michael Bilerman","Great. Just one quick one for Rick. The popular press wants to focus a lot on shrinking retailers and closing stores. Can you just give us an update in terms of who are the fastest-growing retailers, the most exciting retailers that you're seeing pick up stores? And maybe just break it up between a larger format and a smaller format store base.","Richard Sokolov","Well, thank you for the opportunity to talk about my list. I think there\u2019s four categories of retailers that we\u2019re really seeing a lot of business with. International retailers, the e-tailers that are looking for a presence in our properties. We recently just announced and have opened Blue Nile and Bauble Bar, and we\u2019re working with a number of others that want to come into the properties.","Our existing retailers that are looking to grow through brand extension. Maybe you just saw Dick\u2019s announce the Chelsea Collective this fall. L Brands is rolling out White Barn Candle. And the last are just the new retailers that are coming online and just to - we\u2019ve done deals recently with Mont Blanc, Frye Boots, Jo Malone's, Suitsupply, [Aritskina]. All of these are really exciting concepts that are relatively unique in the number of stores, and that\u2019s going to separate our properties.","Michael Bilerman","Great thank you.","David Simon","And I would just say this, Michael, what\u2019s exciting \u2013 yes, we have had bankruptcies this year, it does take time to replace them. But the amount of new concepts and new entrepreneurs coming into our environment, whether it\u2019s restaurants, the e-commerce going to physical brand expansion is really at a \u2013 is that high and our leasing folks. If you seen what we\u2019re going to do at Roosevelt Field with some of the new food operators as well as some of the e-commerce with physical, I mean its good stuff. So I mean in that sense it\u2019s comforting to see that there is whole host of new entrepreneurs they want to be in our own environments.","Michael Bilerman","Yes, thanks.","David Simon","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Morgan. Your line is open.","Paul Morgan","Hi, good morning.","David Simon","Good morning.","Paul Morgan","You talked about how your same-store numbers don't include your redevelopments. I'm just wondering. At this point right now it seems like you have a very large share of some of your top centers in redevelopments. Is that a drag, having that excluded, given the strength of some of those?","David Simon","First of all, we don\u2019t consider to drag, you have to put comp numbers in a \u2013 Paul you have to put comp numbers in a historical perspective. And you can\u2019t look it one quarter over quarter, you\u2019ve got to look at it over three to five-year period upon. And if you look at our comp NOI increases over that three to five-year period of time, there clearly you would conclude that we have significant outperformance. And I don't look as much as everyone wants to focus on a quarter here and quarter there.","I want to reinforce we do have the highest operating margins in the business. We also have the lowest overhead in terms of however you want do it enterprise value \u2013 percent of EBITDA, percent of revenues in the business. And that\u2019s why we have the best balance sheet in the business and that\u2019s why we\u2019re able to grow our dividend 15% to 20% a year. So again certainly there are \u2013 yes, we\u2019re remerchandising Houston Galleria, and Copley, and Stanford, and Roosevelt Field, and King of Prussia and we\u2019re moving tenants left and right.","We encourage everybody to go see the properties and yes, from a quarter perspective it's going to \u2013 it's not going to impress some, but I\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019re doing I\u2019m really impressed with internally. But I would encourage you and others to look at comp NOI over a more of an extended period of times than comp quarter-to-quarter.","Paul Morgan","So I mean if I do that\u2026","David Simon","But again long story short, yes, we are having some impact on all the remerchandising going on in our portfolio.","Paul Morgan","So I mean if I take that longer view and look back over the past, say, two or three years in your numbers, is there any reason to think as I look forward two or three years that you wouldn't be able to do kind of the same type of numbers, I guess deeper into the economic cycle?","David Simon","Well, listen history is a good indicator of what you might be able to do in the future, but we would hope that all the stuff that we\u2019re doing will accelerate the growth profile of those assets. We have to execute, believe me, we are not out of the execution phase, but I would think Paul at the end of the day that these assets are going to grow very, very nicely and we\u2019ll increase our comp NOI growth and meet our historical growth.","Now the fact is we\u2019re subject to economic cycles, we\u2019re subject to tenants going bankrupt, we are subject to downtime, we\u2019re subject to sales of our retailers, volatility. So we don't control everything, but we\u2019ve had a pretty good track record. I would hope that would continue, but it's not you don\u2019t follow-up a lot for this stuff. You got to do it each and everyday and our team was pretty good at it.","Paul Morgan","Thanks. And then just my follow-up on the Sears joint venture. How far you into the process of going through and saying: well, here's what we're going to do near-term, here we\u2019d like to do longer-term. And kind of how \u2013 the size of the potential redevelopment and the timing and when we might get some of those details?","Richard Sokolov","Hi, it\u2019s Rick. We are very far along in that process, we\u2019ve already had multiple meetings with Seritage. We have developed, redevelopment plans for each of the assets they are in the process right now of being priced and as they become mature, we will announce them and proceed forward, but they include the addition of specialty stores, mall expansion, adding restaurants, adding boxes and appropriately sizing Sears. Bear in mind in our venture it\u2019s almost 850,000 square feet of additional space if you are going to be able to redeploy along with those TBA auto centers. So it\u2019s a great opportunity and we are well into it.","Paul Morgan","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector.","Jeffrey Spector","I just wanted to focus a little bit more on the redevelopment pipeline. David, I believe you said that $1 billion through 2017, and I know it's been going on for a number of years now. I mean what are your thoughts I guess at this point beyond 2017? Is that \u2013 by 2017 you are really at this point touching those top-producing assets? Or do you think you can expand that program beyond?","David Simon","Well, I think as Rick mentioned I mean I do think Sears gives us whole host additional redevelopment opportunities. We are closer and closer to starting \u2013 in fact we are actually starting the Southwest Corridor and Copley, which is not in those numbers yet. We are absent something really out of the expected, we are going to start Copley very, very shortly, we've got fail safes in that investment, but we are moving with speed to deliver that, we think that's great Sears presents a lot of opportunities. We've got outlets that we've done the big ones, we\u2019re doing a bunch of small ones that we need to look at. Rick, you want to add to it.","Richard Sokolov","I would also tell you, we\u2019ve already announced the expansion in Jersey Gardens that\u2019s going to be a major redevelopment, we have announced the expansion of Sawgrass. Right now we're finalizing an expansion of Colonnade, redeveloping the Oasis. And I can tell we are continuing the mine this portfolio and I believe we\u2019ll have a continuing series of pretty substantial value add opportunities across all three of our platforms.","Jeffrey Spector","Okay, thanks. And then one of the other focuses that Craig and I have been paying attention to, of course, on the technology front, the winners in the Simon Launch and in particular the SKU IQ. So from where we sit I guess it's just been hard over the last year to really keep track of exactly what's going on here on these different initiatives. Can you discuss either the winners or SKU IQ in particular and where you think this may go?","David Simon","Yes, look I don't get mad at me Jeff, but I believe we are happy to do \u2013 I think we are close to putting together with Skyler and Michael and investor, I don\u2019t know what you call them investor, not roadshow but investor meeting to kind of layout all the investment we made and maybe with not exactly you maybe with somebody else, but well-respected peer of yours and we\u2019ll lay it out for the investment community all that different investments we've made and why.","So I think we\u2019re shooting for sometime in October but there's a lot of neat stuff here. These are little - in the scheme of things, little investments, but they run from creating energy efficiency with all of our LED lighting to helping retailers to actually new e-commerce ideas that may go to the mall. So it\u2019s a lot of different categories, different levels of investment, in the kind of the A, B, C rounds. We\u2019re happy to share that data. It\u2019s a lot, though, to do it on a call like this. But we will be sharing a lot of that stuff with our investors.","Jeffrey Spector","Okay, thanks.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim.","Ki Bin Kim","Thank you. A quick follow-up first. Have you bought any more shares post the quarter end?","David Simon","We operated - if you are familiar, you have to operate under a 10(b) 15 rule once your quarter is completed. We gave guidelines because you can't be in the market during that period of time and the guidelines that we gave to the broker were not met. So the answer is we have not purchased any further.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. The second question, is there any incremental change in trends you're noticing in the outlet business? Maybe not the premium, at more infill outlets, but maybe more secondary, where maybe the pricing gap between full-line mall retailers and outlet businesses or retailers are maybe narrowing? You've seen like T.J. Maxx and Ross doing better. Have the secondary type of outlets - do you notice any less importance or less traffic or any kind of incremental trends?","David Simon","Not really, I mean I think not really at all. I mean I think our outlet retailers are very focused on finding the right balance between full price in outlet that\u2019s why they are very focused on not overexposing the brand. There have been certain retailers that have had disappointing sales both in full price and in outlet. Outlet\u2019s no different than full price in that if a retailer is not hitting it, it will affect their sales in full-price and in outlet. But no trend in that at all. We have outlets in Cincinnati, Columbus, Indiana, St. Louis, that are all doing just fine. They are affected by retailers that may not be doing as well as they were a year ago, but that's similar to the full price small business as well.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, good morning out there.","David Simon","Good morning.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, how are you? Just a few questions here David, first just going back to the dividend and stock buyback, certainly as you guys outlined where you want put your money, redevelopment and development seems to be the first and foremost. And then when you move down from there, once you've solved for paying out appropriate with the taxable income, it sounds like your bias is still towards increasing the dividend versus buyback. So I just want to see if that\u2019s the proper interpretation from your comments or if you are thinking that any excess cash may now go more towards buyback versus the strong dividend growth.","David Simon","Well, the dividend - listen, this sounds weird, but we're highly profitable, right? So as our earnings increase you know our taxable income increases and therefore our dividend increases. Very simple that\u2019s the REIT model. We\u2019re great believers in the REIT model that\u2019s why we are all here. And so our dividend is going to increase.","There is just no two ways about it, because we have created a very nice earnings machines as long as we don\u2019t make mistakes about where we invest capital, we\u2019ll be in good shape. So I always like increasing the dividend more than stock buybacks, we had this unusual situation where we basically took one investment and felt the most immediate interesting return would be buying our stock back.","I think having the flexibility to buy it in a volatile market, when there is a big disconnect is what will be focused on. But I would continue to expect knock on wood that our earnings continue to move up, we\u2019re going to be focused on increasing our dividend. And it\u2019s under appreciated in the REIT sector, but if you look at our dividend yield compared to our peer group and you look at our dividend growth in the expectations of a higher dividend growth. We look like a cheap stock, so I mean do what you want with that. I guess I don\u2019t know.","Alexander Goldfarb","Well, which as an analyst we can't do anything with it because we can't own it. But obviously it's good to cash dividend checks. Moving over to Europe, you guys announced the JV with HBC in Germany, and it involves a lot of High Street retail. In the U.S. you've shied away from doing High Street retail. You've stuck to the malls and outlets.","So just sort of curious, do you have a different view with High Street retail in Europe that you don't share in U.S. or it\u2019s really again just a pure credit play in focusing on retailers, and you're not trying to do something as far as potential to get at High Street retail in Europe.","David Simon","Look I think the market in the U.S. with respect to High Street retail is sophisticated expenses, there are lot of guys that have been added for a long-time. We think Europe is a little bit different in that maybe there is more opportunity for us to do that just like the opportunity that we saw with Kl\u00e9pierre at the outset a few years ago.","So that\u2019s not to say the HBC thing is a little bit of credit play, it's a little bit accretive to grow vehicle, it\u2019s betting on. I think extremely talented CEO and team in HBC. These guys are entrepreneurs, they are smart, they are sophisticated, they want to grow their business.","We are happy and pleased to be their partner and I think that entity ultimately will look to create a broader portfolio. High Street Europe is a little more interesting maybe from evaluation point of view. U.S. is a little more pricey, got a lot more sophisticated players, but we\u2019ll see how it evolves, but we are making I think a good bet where we\u2019ve got very strong partner, strong assets, strong credit and between the two of us that have the nose and instinct for good deals we should find some opportunities.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Listen, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Chao.","Vincent Chao","Hey, good morning, everyone. Just want to go back to the Sears JV. Just curious in the context of investment opportunities, there's a lot of chatter about different retailers doing something with their real estate. Just curious if you are having more conversations with others on structures like the Sears or the HBC deals that you have.","David Simon","Well, I think there's got to be more than just marking or financing retailers real estate. So for instance I can just contrast \u2013 the reason we did Sears is because partnered with them is because it\u2019s all about redeveloping over time those boxes. Sears\u2019 store of the future may be part of it, they may not be, but that\u2019s basically a redevelopment play.","HBC that contrast it was, yes, they got a mark out with real estate, but to me we created \u2013 if HBC only wanted to just mark the real estate and do credit we wouldn\u2019t have played, we saw an opportunity to bet on a very accomplished entrepreneur great brands and low and behold we did the deal and they are buying the German department store, but we are entering in German real estate in a big way.","If it's just marketing real estate or just a credit that\u2019s not really exciting for us. So we\u2019re happy to talk strategically with our retailers about it, but there's got to be more to it than just that. And so I think this world will present opportunities, but there's got to be more than just marketing the real estate whether it's redevelopment or creating a growth vehicle to go do something there's got to be more to it than what is just said.","Vincent Chao","That makes sense. But I guess I would just \u2013 it seems like there would be plenty of redevelopment opportunities beyond just Sears, although Sears offers plenty of opportunity in itself, I guess. But maybe just thinking about other areas I mean can you just comment on the McArthurGlen pipeline? I think there's one project that you were expecting to start here this year. But how does the rest of the pipeline look like for potential additional developments there?","David Simon","Sure, there is \u2013 in Provence, we are in fact we just bought the land, we are starting construction in September after the growing season, believe it or not, is finished and that\u2019s an all systems go deal, we are in the final throes of expand \u2013 about to start the expansion in Roermond, which we'll be a partner in with other partners in that project.","We have pipeline in Normandy, in Spain with \u2013 we are partnering with [Sonali] and we got \u2013 we are looking, we are not quite there, but we\u2019re looking seriously expanding Venice. So I would say it's a very active type in terms of new development and obviously to be able to build starting in September in South of France is very, very exciting, very pleasing.","Vincent Chao","Okay. Just one last, one cleanup question in terms of the guidance. Assuming that does not include any future buybacks, just what's closed already?","Richard Sokolov","Well, Tom and I had this philosophical discussion today. We are a pretty large company, we are going to earn $10 a share this year thereabouts. We have so many ins and outs, we\u2019re just not a portfolio we\u2019ve got so many things going on. That\u2019s our best guess, we put it all on the blender, we give it you and it\u2019s all subject to change quarter-over-quarter. The good news is we hit our numbers, knock on wood. Hopefully we'll continue. We don\u2019t isolate one particular thing over another and we\u2019ll see where it shakes out.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carol Kemple.","Carol Kemple","Good morning.","Richard Sokolov","Good morning.","Carol Kemple","At this point with your other department store tenants are you seeing any of them want to right-size space like Sears?","David Simon","Not really, we are constantly in conversations with them and we are doing a number of other potential things involving relocating department stores. For example at Stamford we had a Bloomingdale's that was oversized, we worked with them they built a brand new store, and now we\u2019re redeveloping the old Bloomingdale's into small shops. Did the same thing with Saks at Houston Galleria. So it\u2019s a very dynamic process. We\u2019re constantly in conversation with them, and we\u2019re doing a lot of things as a result of that. But there is not another store out there that has the kind of focused, programmatic approach to decreasing their footprint size.","Carol Kemple","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Mueller.","Michael Mueller","Yes, hi. Just going back to Sears again, what's a rough idea of the dollars that could be invested in those 10 or 11 boxes over time?","Richard Sokolov","I think we\u2019re going to use that on a project by project basis but obviously as we\u2019ve articulated, it\u2019s a substantial opportunity and it would certainly be in a larger amount as opposed to a lesser amount. But it depends on the scope of the individual projects, but that is to come.","Michael Mueller","Got it. Okay. So it sounds like it could be in the couple - in the hundreds of millions of dollars.","Richard Sokolov","Potentially, yes.","Michael Mueller","Got it. Then I guess, how does it work? If you demolish a Sears box and do a major expansion well beyond the footprint, do they participate in that? Or is it just to the scope of the footprint?","Richard Sokolov","Each project is differently. But in the Sears venture, they own a part of the Seritage, our venture owns a parcel of land. So the venture would be focusing its redevelopment efforts on the parcel of land that is owned in the venture. And that would be the extent of the activity in the venture.","Michael Mueller","Got it. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows.","Caitlin Burrows","Hi, good morning. Just quick question on occupancy and the impact of bankruptcies from earlier in the year. I think we were pretty happily surprised to see that your second-quarter occupancy and same-store NOI were actually somewhat stronger than the first quarter. I was just wondering if you could go through some of the progress on re-leasing that space and when you expect to have made up for the lost occupancy and NOI.","David Simon","I will just say our goal we are going to \u2013 we still think we will come close to our year end occupancy of last year, but its going to be - its not a no-brainer. It could slip what I\u2019d say immaterially, but others may have a different view of that, so I respect that. But we\u2019re trending up we are making progress, and I think we\u2019ve got momentum but it takes time. So our goal is still try to get back to last year. But we lost, what Rick?","Richard Sokolov","940,000","David Simon","Yes, 940,000 feet, so that\u2019s a lot of work. So we are little bit on the treadmill, but we're a fit athlete and we're running...","Richard Sokolov","David is speaking for himself.","David Simon","I wish.","Richard Sokolov","I would just add one thing that we are making very good progress going through it and it is an opportunity its hard work it has the short-term impact but the tenants that we are brining in are certainly higher productivity tenants from the sales perspective and so far the rents that we\u2019ve been able to generate or in excess of the rents that we are being paid by the former tenants that when bankrupt.","Caitlin Burrows","Got it. Then just also is there anything you could say on the difference you're seeing in re-leasing the space at, say, your trophy properties versus whatever you would call the next tier, and the next tier of your properties?","Richard Sokolov","Look, it's axiomatic that the higher-productivity properties have a broader band of interest, but that\u2019s what we do and happily we're also blessed with a portfolio that is predominantly those strong properties.","Caitlin Burrows","Great. Okay, thank you.","David Simon","You are welcome.","Operator","Our next comes from Linda Tsai.","Linda Tsai","Hi. I'm not sure if this is something you could comment on deeply, but when you look at your redevelopment plans for Sears, do you think you're approaching your plans any differently from GGP or Macerich? Or is it relatively straightforward in terms of figuring out what the property is missing and splitting boxes and adding entertainment?","David Simon","Look, I think they\u2019re very \u2013 they are both very confident developers, redevelopers. So at the end of the day my guess is it\u2019s not going to be all that crazily different. But it\u2019s so much of that dependent upon the location and the local market, but they\u2019re both confident developers. I would probably venture to say it will be similar, but if they are better than us we intend to copy immediately, okay.","Linda Tsai","Then retail is cyclical and while there's been a recent wave of closures you also noted that there's also a lot of entrepreneurial concepts popping up. Do you think there's anything different about the cycle time around as it relates to maybe omnichannel selling or bifurcation amongst brands catering to high-end or low-end consumers?","David Simon","Well, look would you say generally there is obviously the whole movement towards value on one hand and luxury on the other continues. The general \u2013 the good news about that is we\u2019re positioned in both of those barbells extremely well. But that\u2019s not to say people lose sight of that, that's not to say the middle American mall isn't doing well.","Its part of the community, it\u2019s ignored from a media point of view, there's assumptions made about those assets, there is extrapolation because one mall went out of business that all malls are going out of business. But I would say to you that the solid middle malls throughout America continue to do well, serve their purpose. But you\u2019ll clearly see a movement in a lot of retailers from either aspirational higher end goods or value. There is no question about that.","Richard Sokolov","One comment I would make to you on the new retailers we are dealing with is that they are substantially more sophisticated than the crop of new retailers we dealt with say 10 years ago, better financed, much more focused on their niche and it\u2019s been much easier to deal this new crop of entrepreneurs than might have been the case.","David Simon","Look in today's world we\u2019ll have to be better, we\u2019ll have to be on our game better. So that comes with \u2013 okay what industry it\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s say I mean everybody, the rapid changes in the world is putting pressure on every industry, every operator and that\u2019s why you got a strong, people, strong assets and strong balance sheet to deal with it all.","Linda Tsai","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Just a couple quick questions. Rick, if you look at kind of the sales and leasing trends, is there anything that you can talk about regionally? Any big differences that you see?","Richard Sokolov","Look, there are a couple of differences across the thing in our business. The Great Lakes, Southeast and Pacific are stronger; mountain and New England were a little weaker. The better categories were home furniture, food, personal care, jewelry, and athletic shoes.","Steve Sakwa","Okay.","David Simon","I mean, I say Steve you clearly \u2013 the stronger dollar and the economic upheavals in growing markets, but with wealthy people Brazil, what's going on with China and their focus on obviously Europe with the stronger dollar. I mean it has impacted sales in the high tourist centers and we\u2019ve got them. I mean there is no question. We've got them in South Florida. We've got them in Orlando.","We don't have New York City, we have Woodbury which is been relatively flat and that's usually a center that grows every year I think that\u2019s more of all the stuff going on with the center and the tourism, but the tourism centers have had a little softness you see in the hotel industry. So we are not immune to that.","Steve Sakwa","I presume that's not having much of an impact on leasing, just given their long-term nature. Or do you actually think it's impacting leasing at all?","Richard Sokolov","I would say it had no impact on leasing.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And then, David, any just update kind of the Copley kind of residential project?","David Simon","Well, I mentioned it briefly earlier which is look we\u2019re doing the Southwest Corridor. We\u2019re finalizing the permit and there which is more administrator. So it is all shaping up to, we start to dig down to support the foundation going up that's all moving should start the Southwest Corridor should start in the next month.","So we have certain fail safe, the way that building is being constructed we have fail safes so for instance we are going to do the Southwest Corridor first which is because we\u2019ve got to create a new entrants to create the way to build. We have to go down into the Turnpike so we have to create new entrance first. That\u2019s happening, that\u2019s been approved by us then we go down into the Turnpike then we go up to support this field going up. So we will be making that incremental decision, but once we do the Southwest, we will do that.","And then building the podium is where it's really guts poker that\u2019s a year decision from now, but all systems are go and we are cranking, we don\u2019t see any reason to stop. So we \u2013 the kind of nice thing about this is that we can stop looking this for the market a year from now and yes we would have an investment in it, but we\u2019ll always be able to go up. I don't see any reason why we wouldn't go up, but we are certainly going to go down and build our way up to create the platform to build the power.","Steve Sakwa","Okay and then just last question. Anything on Deliv? That kind of system just seems to have taken a backseat. Haven't heard much about it. Any thoughts about that or how it's working or\u2026?","David Simon","I would comment on Deliv that Macy's just recently announced that they are expanding the footprint of stores in which Deliv is going to be working with them. So that is certainly a positive sign and we continue to believe that there is a significant role for all of our properties to play in the fulfillment aspect of an omnichannel retail business, and it's moving a pace.","Steve Sakwa","So Rick, do you think it\u2019s more a function of just consumers not really realizing it exists to kind of get more critical mass?","Richard Sokolov","I think it\u2019s just the function of getting the systems right, getting the retail so the point were they are ready to fulfill from their store that there is a big systems upgrade it\u2019s going on right now across the entire industry. And ultimately there is going to be a seamless integrated experience for our consumers and certainly fulfilling from the store to their home has going to be part of that and Deliv can be part of that solution.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from DJ Busch.","DJ Busch","Thank you. Just one quick follow-up on Sears. Given the potential size of the capital spend for some of the Sears projects that you were talking about earlier, if Seritage can't meet its share of the capital requirements, is there an opportunity for you to put up a disproportionate amount of the capital to potentially grow your interest in the joint venture?","David Simon","Well, that have to be a negotiated \u2013 that would have to be a negotiated part of the deal, but it seems to me they have got the balance sheet to be able to do that, but I\u2019m sure we could figure it out as they didn\u2019t.","DJ Busch","But is it correct to assume you guys are controlling kind of the process and the strategies at each of the center?","Richard Sokolov","We\u2019re joint venture partners, it\u2019s both \u2013 it\u2019s approval on both sides. I\u2019d say we are taking the lead on coming up with the plans and the redevelopment and the different uses. But they are riding copilot with us.","David Simon","And I would also say to you that we have significant another number of Sears stores that are not in our venture that are in Seritage. And when we meet with Seritage, we\u2019re actively working with them, as we have done in the past to help them redeploy those phases in a productive way and an example of that is King of Prussia, where Dick's now opened and Primark is opening this fall. And between the two of them they will 100% occupy the former Sears store.","DJ Busch","And just a follow up on that, Rick. With Seritage kind of taking control of the Sears space and the talks of other department stores potentially monetizing the real estate, do you see any difference in the operations? I know it's early, but do you see any potential impact to the way you negotiate or lease or deal with the anchors if the landlord is no longer the retailer?","Richard Sokolov","No.","DJ Busch","Okay. Thank you.","David Simon","Yes, they don\u2019t have the infrastructure to get stuff done like we do. So I don't see the dynamics changing.","DJ Busch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim.","Ki Bin Kim","Thank you. Just a quick follow-up. I know most of the conversations are always circling around upgrading quality and reinvesting in your better assets. But given that you do have some of your walls tied into WPG and the history there, and just because the stock price has gotten cheaper over the past year, is there a certain point where a lower-quality portfolio might look interesting just because it's so cheap? Or should we just basically consider this like a permanent divorce?","David Simon","I don't know even how to interpret your question. We spun off WPG well over a year ago. They are separate independent company, they are focused on the strip center and the B mall business. You can hear that directly from them, we do services for them that ultimately will go away mid next year and their growth opportunities are better discussed with them.","I think our focus as you seen over the years, is to buy the bigger assets or assets that we feel we can improve upon, but the primary focus is on our redevelopment or finding different vehicles for growth, whether its Europe, whether its HBC et cetera and continue to grow our business. I said the amount of the big deal business we are not going to buy B assets I think that\u2019s better for others to do given what\u2019s on our plate, but I\u2019m not sure I answered the question, but I tried.","Ki Bin Kim","Yes, you kind of did. I was just basically asking if there's a certain price where something like that would be interesting again?","David Simon","I think that this is better for others to do, but that\u2019s not up to me to.","Ki Bin Kim","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Moore.","Rich Moore","Hey, guys. Good morning. My question, David, was kind of on the flip side of that. You have 200 assets. If you rank them all, does it make sense to get rid of 190 through 200? That kind of thing?","David Simon","Well, we are always doing that, we just do it \u2013 we don\u2019t do it ahead of that so we have a deal that\u2019s closing mid-August that was a lot work and we just didn\u2019t want to deal with it. We are closed on another deal so we do that all. Rich, I know if you looked at our history sold a bunch of stuff so what we get, we\u2019ll always sell assets, always part of\u2026","Rich Moore","Okay, so are you marketing things actively, or is it just sort of an opportunistic? Yes? Okay.","David Simon","Yes. We market. We've marketed - the two that I am referring to were marketed, yes.","Rich Moore","Got it. Okay. Then on the lease term income you guys got this quarter, it was kind of big. I'm curious; I know you can't tell each quarter what's going to happen. But is that something that's going to pick up here you think in the last two quarters of the year? Are there more discussions you're having on this kind of thing?","David Simon","There could be a few deals here or there. But if you look at it year-over-year, year-to-date it\u2019s not all that different 2014. So it\u2019s lumpy towards lumpy but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be all that different, Steve right? From","Steven Broadwater","But the same as 2014.","David Simon","Same as 2014 that\u2019s the business that\u2019s lumpy in terms of quarter-to-quarter it actually relatively consistent year-over-year.","Rich Moore","Okay great. Thanks guys.","End of Q&A","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to David for closing remarks.","David Simon","Okay thank you. Have a wonderful last few weeks to summer. Sorry to have ruined your Friday on a summer Friday. Enjoy.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference Mr. Tom Ward, Senior Vice President-Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Tom Ward","Thank you, Lauren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Presenting on today's call is David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also on the call are Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; Brian McDade, Chief Financial Officer; and Adam Reuille, Chief Accounting Officer.","Before we begin, a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

We are pleased to report another year of record results, which marks our 25th year as a public company. Our full 2018 FFO per diluted share to be $12.13 an increase of 8.2% year-over-year, which will be at the high-end of our peer group and we beat the top end of our initial 2018 guidance by an impressive $0.11.","Over the last four years, we've grown our FFO per share on a compound annual basis of 8%. And to provide perspective on our FFO generation, we produced approximately $165 million in our first full year as a public company, $165 million. And in 2018, we produced $4.3 billion. Through the commitment to our strategy, active portfolio management, disciplined investment, relentless focus on operations and cost structure, we have increased our annual FFO generation by more than 25 times since our IPO.","For the fourth quarter, FFO was $1.15 billion or $3.23 per share, an increase of 3.5% year-over-year. We continue to grow our cash flow and report solid key operating metrics. Total portfolio increased 3.7%, more than $230 million for the year. Our top NOI increased 2.3% for the year and 2.1% for the fourth quarter.","Leasing activity remains solid. Average base rent was $54.18. The malls and the Premium Outlets recorded leasing spreads of $7.75 per square foot, an increase of 14.3%. We are pleased that retail sales momentum continued in the fourth quarter. Reported retail sales per square foot for the mall and outlet was a record $661 compared to $628 in the prior year period, an increase of 5.3%.","Retail sales were strong across the portfolio, with growth in consecutive months throughout the year. And each platform ended the year at record retail sale levels. Our mall and premium outlet occupancy ended the quarter at 95.9%, an increase of 40 basis points from the third quarter, an increase of 30 basis points compared to the year prior. And leasing activity accelerated throughout the year, with occupancy for the combined malls and Premium Outlets increasing 130 basis points from the end of the first quarter through the year-end.","We opened two new outlets in 2018: the Premium Outlet Collection in Edmonton, Canada; Denver Premium Outlets. Construction continues on three new outlets in leading international markets, two of which will open this year: Queretaro, Mexico will open in the summer, and Malaga, Spain will open in the fall.","We're also under construction on a new outlet in Cannock, United Kingdom, which will open in the spring of 2020. We expect to break ground on a new outlet in Bangkok, Thailand in the next few weeks. And our new development and projects and extensive pipeline of development opportunities across all of our platforms reinforce our industry-leading position.","Important to know, our diversified income generation by geography and product type, with 48% of our NOI from domestic malls, 42% from our value platform, which is the Premium Outlets and mills; and 10% internationally, distinguishes Simon from all other retail real estate companies that are trading publicly. We completed a number of redevelopment expansion opportunities across our portfolio during 2018.","Again, the expansions include Aventura; Toronto Premium Outlets; Shisui, Japan; Johor Premium in Singapore, where reclaiming department store spaces continue to be a focus and significant opportunity for the company. We currently have 10 anchor redevelopment projects under construction, with a gross cost of approximately $725 million.","And we have an additional 25 opportunities we're actively working on that are in various stages of development. We continue to fund these redevelopment projects through our internally generated cash flow.","Quickly turning to the balance sheet. Continues to lead our industry. Our liquidity ended the year at $7.5 billion. We have the strongest credit profile metrics in the REIT industry. Net debt-to-EBITDA of 5.1 times, lowest in our sector. Our interest coverage ratio was 5.1. Our long-term issue rating of A\/A2 continues to be the highest in the REIT sector. Our balance sheet continues to be a distinct advantage that should not be overlooked.","During the quarter, we\u2019ve repurchased approximately 287,000 shares of common, for approximately $47 million. We also redeemed 405,000 limited partnership units for $74 million. Going to the dividend. We paid a record dividend in 2018 of $7.90 per share. We have achieved the compound annual dividend growth rate of more than 11% over the last four years. We have paid more than $28 billion in dividends over our 25-year history as a public company.","Today, we announced the dividend of $2.05 per share for this quarter, a year-over-year increase of 5.1%. At this current rate, we will have paid more than $100 in dividends per share by the second quarter this year.","Before I turn to our outlook for 2019, let me summarize our 2018 results. We posted another year of industry-leading, record results, including revenues, cash flows, FFO per share and dividends. Our reported FFO diluted share \u2013 per share for 2018 was $12.13, which beat the midpoint of our initial guidance for the year by $0.17.","Moving on to 2019. Our FFO guidance is $12.30 to $12.40 per share. When analyzing our 2019 range in context of our 2018 results, it is important to note the following. We expect the impact from FASB\u2019s ASU 2016-02 the new lease accounting standard to reduce FFO per share by approximately $0.13.","There were some items included in our 2018 FFO per share. They are not expected to recur in 2019, including our gain of $0.10 per share related to the contribution of our investment in the Aeropostale licensing business for an increased ownership interest in ABG.","Higher income related to distributions from an international investments of approximately $0.05 per share. These non-recurring items are approximately $0.15 per share in FFO for 2018 when you then adjust 18 for those factors you get to $11.85 with our new guidance for 2019, we will have approximately 4% to 4.5% growth compared to this adjusted number for 2018.","We expect our 2000 growth rate will be at the high end of our peer group. Also keep in mind when we are looking at our 2019 number, we are expecting lower lease settlement income in 2019 compared to the prior year.","We will have lost rents in 2019 due to closed department store spaces and the downtime related to redevelopment of those spaces. This impact to our NOI this year is temporary, as these investments will yield healthy returns and accelerate our NOI growth in 2020 and 2021.","We expect the impact of rising interest rates and a stronger dollar to affect our results for 2019 compared to 2018 and we also had the loss of our share of the FFO from the German operations of our HBS joint venture, which was sold at the end of 2018 for a gain of $91 million. So, therefore lot there, hope you are fast studied like I am.","Additional assumptions supporting our 2019 outlook include the following. Comparable NOI growth for combined Mall and Premium Outlets and Mills platform of 2%. No planned acquisition activity or retail disposition activity, assuming no launch of our consumer-oriented platform and a diluted share count of approximately 356 million shares.","To conclude, we had another excellent year, capping a solid first quarter century as a public company. We have consistently posted industry-leading returns along the way through hard work, innovation, great people, and great assets as in any industry is more important than ever that we drive change, focus on delivering, exceptional experience for our tenants and consumers, and we are now ready for questions.","Thank you for listening.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Craig Schmidt","Thank you. First just wanted to congratulate Rick given the changes that are going to come later in 2019.","RickSokolov","Thank you.","Craig Schmidt","My questions, I guess, you touched on it in your opening comments, but maybe you could talk about some of the other possible impacts from the repurposing of the Sears anchors you know like sales disruption or any kind of competition you might have to give tenants while you're working on the Sears space and especially with the densification efforts?","David Simon","Well, you know, Craig again, I think, I'd implore you and other people that covers just, you got to look at it differently. We are in \u2013 some of the numbers that I gave you need to be factored in. So, we started, our enterprise in a $165 million of funds from operation. Today, we have 4.3 billion. We have 48% of our business in the Mall business and when we started it was 90% through 95%.","So, there's always disruption in our industry, department store spaces that we reclaim either through lease termination or acquisition, we think will be beneficial in the long run. There are down-times associated with that and like I said, well \u2013 that's all kind of manageable for a company like ours, and we give you the best sense of our guidance, and it is kind of all factored in there within this range that we hope to produce.","We have obviously a history unrivaled frankly, I think, about beating expectations. We'll see this year. We've got a lot going on. So I don't \u2013 we're not going to zeroing about one particular property, one particular tenant, one particular issue because you got to look at us on a broader basis. We're a little bit different.","Craig Schmidt","Okay, thanks. And then I just wondered, if you've been having any discussions with JCPenney about potential store closings?","DavidSimon","No.","Craig Schmidt","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is now open.","Michael Bilerman","Yeah, good morning. It's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. So, David \u2026","David Simon","From the hip I'm like happy, but I don't know, Rick. I think Rick is squarer down here. What do you think?","Michael Bilerman","I just hope that Rick is still going to be on these calls to go through the laundry list of retailers that are coming into your malls. So, David, you are pretty quick to deny the speculation of Simon trying to buy Macerich, which I can understand, if you are buying them. But, I guess, if I step back, why wouldn't you buy them because every deal that you've done in the past 25 years has worked out pretty well for shareholders. Great cost of capital. You talked about your under leveraged balance sheet being a distinct advantage that shouldn't be overlooked. You have an unbelievable platform that can produce synergies, you've proven out your redevelopment and densification efforts. You can probably access as much third-party capital as you wanted. You've consistently raised your cash flow and your earnings, which has led to dividend growth, which is pretty much contrary to every one of your peers by the way. So with those set of facts and the performance, why wouldn't you be more aggressive on the acquisition front?","David Simon","Well, first of all, Michael thank you for recognizing some of our achievements. Over the last 25 years I mean we do \u2013 we try to explain the company maybe we're not very good at it, to our best of our abilities we're a little bit different because of some of those factors. But obviously, Michael, I'm not going to comment on any specific company. We tried to do a deal with Macerich long time ago that's, as I've said before yesterday's news. We're glad to partner with them in Carson, which is moving forward and but I'm not going to comment on any deal we may or may not do or any particular company.","We have no plans currently to do kind of M&A activity and we're very focused on what we've got in front of us. We're excited about the continuation of the evolution of the mall industry the way it's been evolving for 60 plus years. We are excited about our outlet business in the international, breadth and depth that it has. And as I mentioned in my calls you know we had leading sales per square foot in every platform.","So we've got plenty to do and we have no plans at all to think about anything and we're focused on executing the vast amount of activity that we have.","Christy McElroy","Hi David, it's Christy. Good morning.","David Simon","Good morning.","Christy McElroy","You're coming off of a year of positive sales growth from a tenant perspective. You've been able to gain occupancy and maintain pricing power. Just from where you sit today and what you're seeing in terms of the health and store performance among your shop tenants. Would you expect that 2019 would be a little bit of a tougher year from a tenant sellout and leasing perspective? And then just sort of related to that, as you've been building your fifth platform and announcing more consumer-focused initiatives, maybe you can talk about what you see coming down the pipe in 2019?","David Simon","Well, maybe I'll just start and Rick can chime in. Look, I do think on the retail front, the strong are getting stronger. It's \u2013 as you've seen by numbers throughout the retail community, the days of a rising economic boat don't lift \u2013 or tide don't lift all retail boats. And you've had a lot of over \u2013 outperformance and a lot of underperformance. The underperformance, I can talk off-line on a theory of why that is, but I don't want to bore you. And there are some retailers out there that were nervous about. I mean, so far in the first quarter, bankruptcies are trending lower than they were in 2017 and 2018.","However, there's some rumored names out there that could ultimately end up being a similar 2017 and 2018. 2018, as we said and as we look and anticipated 2018, we thought it would be less than 2017. We were ended up being right there. But I do think there will be more bankruptcies to come in 2019. And that's why we're relatively conservative as we look at our comp NOI.","Because, look, it takes time to \u2013 it's a little bit out of our control when we get the space, and then to do a lease takes time. And even though as much as we anticipate it, we \u2013 would just take time to lease the space. So I mean, we have our work cut out. We are concerned about a few retailers. That should shake out in Q1. But I think the retailers that are investing in their product, in their store experience, in their branding were having decent results.","So physical retail can produce good results, but it can't be distracted with a lot of other activities. And obviously, as you know, we've had a number of retailers. The list is long, the landscape is littered of leveraged buyouts in our industry that we continue to sort through. So that, I hope, answered the first question.","On the second one, look, we're very close to launching this platform. And if these things always \u2013 it's a little bit like building something, but it's not quite as certain, it's more like to building internationally, where you think you're going to open in Q3, it goes to Q4, then goes to Q1. We've had a couple of those in maybe Spain and Mexico, where it happens, delay a quarter there.","So it \u2013 I would expect us to launch. It will affect, I mean, again, I mean, we're going to \u2013 you see our numbers, it will be \u2013 the earnings impact to it will be, I think, completely on the margin. I hope the market appreciates that. But because we don't have a set date yet on when that might happen, we're not going to put it in our numbers. And then if we launch it, we'll show it to you. We will say, oh, boy, that's worth a shot. It's not a big deal. It's a couple of cents here and there. And it's an unbelievable investment in our future, and we'll see where it goes.","So we expect that to happen, but a little bit \u2013 we just don't know exactly when we'll launch, so we've been hesitant to say, it's a Q1 or Q2 or Q3 debut. So again, in summary, with the retailers are focused on product, brand, service, they're doing better, that they're leveraged. We have an investment in their business, overinvested in e-commerce, struggling.","Leveraged buyouts were not ultimately beneficial, by and large, to our business. That's kind of working its way out of the system. And we are excited about our fifth platform. We expect it to debut, but when and how is a little bit up in the air, so we'll just keep it at that. We'll keep it off the table for now. But when we do, we'll share it with you. Again, I think we're pretty transparent. I mean, the reason \u2013 I guess, when you take a step back and think about our company, we're not \u2013 we got all these assets.","We got all these business. It's all international. It's outlets. So if we got as granular as you wanted, it would waste your time and waste our time. So again, just \u2013 you've got to kind of think of us a little bit differently that we're not these handful of assets here and there yet. And that's why we tried to give you a broader, bigger picture of what we're all about and what we expect during next year or this year.","Christy McElroy","Great, thank you, David.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks, good morning. David, I don't know, you or Rick, maybe just talk about some of the newer tenants and some of the more online tenants, kind of your experience and success bringing some of these folks into the mall. And sort of your outlook for their growth into 2019 and 2020?","Rick Sokolov","Hi, it's Rick. Just to step back, in all of these discussions, the single-best thing we have going for us are incredibly strong properties across all three of our platforms. So in any dynamic any of you talk about, the key is do we have places where retailers want to be, and happily, we do, and they're getting better by the day as we invest our capital and enhance them. In terms of the retailers, e-retailers are certainly one aspect of it.","And there, we're working with probably 40 different ones. We've rolled out Untuckit. You've heard out all the names, and they want to be not unlike any other retailer in the best properties. And so we are doing deals with Warby Parker, Fabletics, Indochino and Untuckit, and I could go on. And they are finding success. And you don't have to take our word for it. You can take what they're saying. A lot of them are expressly raising money to roll out more stores. So that has been an interesting and important part of diversifying our tenant mix and keeping our properties current.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And then, David, I just wanted to circle back. You talked through about the anchor redevelopment. And you said you're actively working on another 25. Just in terms of sort of the mix between retail and hotels and office and multifamily, how are those sort of projects sort of breaking out in terms of the alternative uses?","David Simon","Actually, I think we've never been busier on the alternative uses. We got a list in the 8-K that shows you what's been approved, but that doesn't \u2013 I think, essentially, that pales in comparison to the future activity. I'll just \u2013 three off the top of my head, Steve, that are massive mixed-use projects, include Northgate, which we have made a deal with the NHL franchise in Seattle, to do their corporate office as well as their practice facility and ice facilities for the general public. We have Brea, which we have a reclaimed department store space that is in the process of permitting to do a massive amount of residential.","Same thing with Stonebridge in California, so those aren't even on our list. We, obviously, had a significant redevelopment. We're feeling the pressure what we're going through in our portfolio. So I would say by and large, when we're looking at these spaces, they're much more focused on changing the mix, adding additional elements.","And then adding the wellness, fitness, restaurants, resi, hotels to kind of make it kind of a standard statement of live, work, play, et cetera. So rarely is it just small shops. And I would say, by and large, the vast majority has all those elements that I just mentioned. Do you, Rick, want to\u2026","Rick Sokolov","The one other thing I would say to you, to echo David's point, this trend is accelerating. This time last year in our K, we listed 11 projects for 2018 and beyond. This year, we have 19. And as David said, we have many more that are in the pipeline that are going to be coming in here. So we have a dedicated team. We have demand because our properties are located in great places. And that is going to be an accelerating portion of our development activity.","Steve Sakwa","And maybe just to follow up. Just on the cost and kind of yield when you sort of look at these future projects, just given what we've seen in construction cost increases, how would you sort of, I guess, estimate the returns on the future projects versus the ones that are \u2013 either recently completed or currently underway?","David Simon","Well, I mean, look, it's not redevelopment. I mean, it's not new development returns but I think our redevelopment efforts will be consistent in terms of return that we have over the last several years. I mean, it's certainly accretive to the value of the asset, otherwise, we wouldn't do it. And 6 to 10 is kind of the range, and a lot goes into that, Steve. But accretive to the value of the asset, otherwise, we're just not going to invest. I mean, the \u2013 we don't feel like we have to, because of the size and scope of the portfolio, we don't feel like we have to invest in an asset just to maintain it. That's not to say that we don't do appropriate maintenance investments, like a typical renovation and that kind of stuff.","But we don't feel compelled to do it. We do it with the lens of what the consumer expects, what the retailer wants and what the value of that asset is in our minds. And that's when we pull the trigger. Our investment returns \u2013 and we haven't batted 1,000, as my favorite \u2013 I don't want to attribute because you may get mad at me. But I think our returns on investment have not been too shabby over our career.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, thanks. That\u2019s it from me.","David Simon","Sure. Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning out there.","David Simon","Good morning, out there is right, it\u2019s \u2013 I want people to know it\u2019s cold and snowing. But we are here.","Alexander Goldfarb","Well, at least the malls are heated. So they have somewhere to warm up.","David Simon","You bet.","Alexander Goldfarb","So Rick, congratulations and David, I think you said $25 billion in dividends over the time, which is pretty remarkable.","David Simon","Alex, you've never been great at math, not as good as we are, but its $28 billion, $28 billion.","Alexander Goldfarb","$28 billion. Okay. So, I was a little off.","David Simon","I'm just kidding, it was a joke. Okay, just \u2013 you are very good at math actually.","Alexander Goldfarb","Your time. Just following up on Christy's question on the consumer platform that you're talking about, I mean, you're \u2013 is this something like Simon brand ventures that will interplay with \u2013 throughout the company or this truly is something totally separate and apart from your existing malls, mills, outlets et cetera.","David Simon","Well, it is, put it this way, we would not be doing what we're doing, if we didn't own the assets that we own then had the branding that we do and had the consumer touch point as well as the retailer touch points. So, it is absolutely unequivocally related, and we hope it will be synergistic between what we do today, and what we want to do in the future. So, we would not be doing it, if we didn't have the business that we're currently obviously involved in day to day. So, it is complementary and where it goes will be a function of our commitment to invest, our courage to invest, conviction and our ability to execute what we think might be a real interest.","Alexander Goldfarb","But this is something that would add like where SBV adds NOI or adds income to the overall company. This would be something commensurate, correct?","David Simon","Well, there will be an investment period, but the reality is, yes, we think it will have a financial return associated with it, but it is a little bit, there isn't a serious investment period before we get to that point.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the next question is on retailers, you said, you're expecting more shake out. Clearly minimum wage increases and just strong economy, low unemployment is pressuring on the wage front. Across your tenants, are you seeing all of them absorbing the higher wage or are the rising incomes allowing them to offset by raising their prices because their consumers are having more income. Just sort of curious how the wage and operating expense dynamic is occurring with your retailers, and if you think that's going to be a growing pressure point among your tenants?","David Simon","Well, I do think the category that seems to be most sensitive to that today is clearly in the restaurant category. So, I do think those pressures are affecting decision-making. Now we haven't and I think that \u2013 it's interesting because they're very \u2013 those folks are very sensitive to location and to the extent that states have enacted minimum wage laws were higher than federal mandated numbers.","It's got to be a really unique opportunity for the restaurant toward to do it, and thankfully we have most of those, but is it affecting the marginal deal in some of those states. I would have to say, yes, I don't necessarily see it on the, what I'd call, the soft goods apparel side. I haven't seen it in the wellness other side, but I think it's something to pay attention to and where we see it initially is in certain states and primarily when it comes to restaurants.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Caitlin Burrows","Hi. Good morning.","David Simon","Good Morning.","Caitlin Burrows","I was just wondering, if you could go through the decision to do buybacks during the quarter and then generally how that compares to your other uses of capital?","David Simon","Well, on the units, it was just \u2013 we have the right. So, by and large we believe in the growth of our business units. We have the ability when they want to convert to buy the cash. So, it's a pretty easy simple trade and we'll continue to do that as that happens. And there was a period of time in December, obviously, where the world was changing, I mean, obviously equities were being whipsawed around and we took advantage slightly, but we took advantage of that whipsawing.","Caitlin Burrows","Okay. And then on the balance sheet side also which obviously is a great differentiator for Simon. You previously had $600 million that was actually maturing today. So, I guess, I was just wondering what were the sources there and especially considering the development spend this year. Do you plan to issue new unsecured debt?","Brian McDade","Hi, Caitlin. This is Brian. You're absolutely right. We had $600 million maturity today. As David mentioned in his remarks, we ended the year with 7.5 billion of liquidity. So we use existing liquidity to retire those notes this morning.","David Simon","Good news is we paid it off.","Caitlin Burrows","Great.","David Simon","That's not always the case in the real estate industry, okay, that we pay it off. Caitlin Burrows","Caitlin Burrows","And then maybe one more if I could. Could you discuss maybe market rent trends? And where they're stronger versus less so, for example, by U.S. quality or outlet versus mills or open air versus enclosed?","Rick Sokolov","It's Rick. Frankly, we are having pricing power across our portfolios. And again, that is the function of quality of the properties. It all starts there. And as we continue to improve them, we're able to drive our rents. And I think your \u2013 that's demonstrated in the spreads that we've reported.","David Simon","Look, I would only add to that. Look, the reality of how leasing works is that it does take time to lease space, right? It's not like we make a deal, we negotiate the lease, the retailer builds the store, blah-blah-blah. So with \u2013 and if you look the NOI growth, I mean, it's only \u2013 the comp NOI growth, it's only \u2013 it's being affected by some of these retailers that are going through this significant change. And we tend to work with them because at the end of the day, we tend to do it on a shorter-term basis. Because we know, ultimately, we have to re-lease the space to someone.","So there is a little bit of supply and demand that we are working our way through, and that's \u2013 I think it's been manifesting itself in the numbers over the last year or so. We expect it to manifest itself in 2019 as well. But when it comes to a good property and a good space with a good retailer, we're making strides. But we're working with some of the ones that are going through their various restructurings, and that ultimately has some impact, certainly, in the short run.","Caitlin Burrows","Okay. Thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeremy Metz","Hey, good morning.","David Simon","Good morning.","Jeremy Metz","You guys \u2013 good morning. You mentioned the 10 anchor positions you have underway, the additional 25 you're working on. Just given some of the other development and the redevelopment opportunities you obviously have on your plate as well, are you comfortable taking leverage up some from here as you kick off more of these projects? And is there anything kind of holding you back on starting more of these other than just getting those right plans in place? Basically, would you be comfortable taking the pipeline up another billion when they're ready to go?","David Simon","Well, look, unfortunately, in a lot of these areas that I mentioned earlier when Steve asked the question, there is real process about permitting. I mean, we could show you our permitting file, and you wonder whether it's \u2013 I'll refrain. But it is a process where you scratch your head sometimes, because all you're doing is making the asset better for the community and for everybody that lives there. But municipalities are, in a lot of areas, are \u2013 you got to go through a real process. We see it all the time. And we still see it in Long Island, as an example, on our project that we have to land and sign off it. I mean, we see it everywhere to go through. It's just a process.","I would say to you, Jeremy, that holds us back more than anything, because if I had approvals in, like Brea, we would start and the King of Prussia, we will start. If we had approvals in Oyster Bay, we would start, but we don't. Stoneridge we would start. That to us is governor more than the balance sheet, though, I will say we respect our balance sheet, and we are very focused on it. I'd also say that \u2013 but I'd say the permitting is the biggest constraint.","The second is, I mean, human resource constraint is not to be underappreciated, because everybody here is really hustling, very active. And pressure is intense here. And that comes as no surprise to most. I mean, that's more of a constraint as opposed to, boy, we can't make this investment, because we're too levered or we're worried about our cash flow generation or our maturities that are coming up. I mean, we don't do that. But I say that with all due respect, because the fact of the matter is if we didn't take that into account, we wouldn't be in the spot that we are in today. So we do take it into account. We just it by \u2013 it's just ingrained in the culture that we do it by osmosis.","Jeremy Metz","That\u2019s helpful. Appreciate that color. And then you did mention in your outlook for 2019 your expectations for comp NOI of 2%. You've been more focused on portfolio NOI growth though in most of your commentary, so I know that's what matters more to you. So any color on where the expectations are for that to trend?","David Simon","We didn't \u2013 I don't think we're giving guidance there. We don't have a big portfolio NOI because a lot of the new developments that generate that are acquisitions we're not planning on. And we had some delays in a couple of our international deals that I mentioned earlier. We have a reduction in that, because the German sale of HBS. So it's not going to be \u2013 it won't be the growth that we had, obviously, in 2018 were we had a more external activity. So part of \u2013 it will add incrementally, but it's not going to be like the spread between what we had in 2018, primarily because our developments, as I mentioned to you, have been delayed, and our new developments have been delayed. And again, we sold our HBS German business.","Jeremy Metz","Got it. That make sense. And last one for me. You've had some really solid sales results here, obviously, in the past few quarters. Your lease spreads have been solidly in that double-digit range. I assume you're still obviously pushing your standard kind of 3% rent escalators through. So I guess I'm just wondering if some of that have been translated into higher ADR growth necessarily. Is there anything we are missing there? Or should the ADR growth really start to follow suit here?","David Simon","Well, look, I think that the pressure \u2013 I mentioned it earlier. I mean, the pressure that we have is that we are still dealing with a handful of retailers that, for whatever reason, have to go through their various restructurings. Because we can't lease every space, every minute, we tend to work with them, and that does put pressure on our ADR. But it's moving in the right direction. I do think the cycle of the levered retailers is working its way through the system. And I think, Jeremy, at the end of the day, we to just like cleanse, I mean, we\u2019re suffering the pain. I mean, 2% comp NOI is not \u2013 we're not ecstatic about it, but the primary factor in that is the retailers that are going through the various restructurings that we had.","So I think, though, as that's cleansed, we'll get to that number. But retailers are very focused on their cost and their operating model. Stores continue to be their best investment and their best return. Obviously, there's a lot to talk about how profitable the Internet is and e-commerce and who's bearing the brunt of the investment and all that. I don't want to get into the psycho babble talk about that, but the reality is, because of a lot of investments they're making, they're looking at every expense category. And they're \u2013 we are having those discussions. They're not easy.","Jeremy Metz","Thanks for the time, David.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Haendel St. Juste","Hey, good morning.","David Simon","Good morning.","Haendel St. Juste","So David, as have been discussed, you have one of the best balance sheet, platforms, track records in the REIT sector. And yet you trade an implied cap rate about mid 5, which seems to be in line with the overall REIT sector. So curious why you think that's the case. If it's fair, and what levers to you consider pulling to address that?","David Simon","Well, I'm not worried. Look, I think you \u2013 I think what we focus on is trying to make our product better as opposed to what levers we can pull to where we think we ought to trade at a better number than the next guy. I mean, if I took that philosophy, we'd be more levered. We'd be this. We'd be that. I don't look at it like that. I look at it, how do we make this company better day in and day out? So that's the focus.","Why do I personally think that? I have no idea. You guys know better than I do. I always think, why aren't we, given our cash flow generation and our ability to make appropriate, strategic investments and our ability to withstand the restructuring that's been going on in the retail industry better than most, I don't know. If I had to tell you one thing, it's probably because people think we're going to buy something. And then when we tell people we not, they ask, why aren't you going to buy something? So I don't know.","I don't sit here and obsess over it. We are focused on making this product better. People that get obsessed with where their stock price is, I think, end up making blunders. That's not a REIT statement. That's a corporate America statement. And that's the philosophy. I hope shareholders appreciate it. Maybe they don't, but that's how we operate the business. That's how, I think, our board thinks about it. How do we make our products better and our business better? When we do that, it tends to manifest itself in the earnings, and then we go from there. But I don't know. I mean, if I didn't answer your question, but I'm happy to hear what you \u2013 do you have any ideas, you tell me.","Haendel St. Juste","Well, look, I think, perhaps the sector is one variable to consider. It is a tougher business these days, but I think what you guys have built certainly merits value and should be acknowledged though. I'll just leave it there.","My second question is on the rising cost of Labor, which has been well documented. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the labor cost inflation built into your 2019 guide, maybe from a R&M and corporate G&A perspective. The corporate G&A has been trending down the past couple of years. I'm curious if you think that could continue as well.","David Simon","I think we're budgeting pretty consistent numbers for our G&A next year. We don't see any major changes in that. I mean, I think we \u2013 the area that we're going to end up beefing up is in the area of mixed-use development. So we're going to be adding some bodies over time. But again it's \u2013 that's the other nice thing about the company. We still have the lowest overhead ratio by a large margin. I don't \u2013 I can't remember the numbers. It's 2, 2.5, right, to 10, 10 and 11 to other companies, basically your G&A to NOI roughly, right. So I mean, it's a staggering difference, okay. It's not like 100 basis points. It's like 700, 800 basis points.","So I mean, that's not going to be anything out of the ordinary for us. But we are going to add some people in certain areas that we need to, to execute our vision on some of these redevelopments.","Haendel St. Juste","And last one, was there any reason that you can perhaps share with us on the sale of the German outlet, I think the designer outlet, Ochtrup.","David Simon","I'm not \u2013 I'm sorry, I don't \u2013 I don't think that's accurate. What was your question again?","Haendel St. Juste","I was just curious on the rationale for the sale of the German thing you're selling, the outlet.","David Simon","We did not sell the outlet. Actually, Ochtrup, we actually bought a few years ago. What we sold was our \u2013 we're partners with Hudson Bay, among others, in addition to other institutional investors. We had the Kaufhof real estate investment that, because of the merger with Kaufhof and Karstadt, they wanted to also own the real estate. So they bought out the real estate interest in the department stores that Karstadt leased. And that's what triggered our $91 million gain. But it's not \u2013 we didn't sell an outlet.","Haendel St. Juste","Got it. Got it. Okay. Thank you for that.","David Simon","Yes, of course.","Operator","Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Barclays. Your line is open.","Linda Tsai","Hi, good morning.","David Simon","Good morning.","Linda Tsai","In 2018, you guided SS NOI to above 2% and came in at 2.3%. And now you're looking for 2% growth in 2019, implying slight deceleration, but understanding that this also reflects what's happening with more closures and the Sears redevelopment. Do you view 2% as a trough? Or is this sort of a steady-state, long-term growth rate for high-quality outlets and mall?","David Simon","Well, we do not think it's our steady state, but we are \u2013 because of the redevelopment, we are \u2013 there is a significant amount of reduction in 2019 due to income that we received from certain department stores. And then it takes a year or two to build, and we're going to \u2013 we're suffering from that in 2019. So that's certainly part of it.","And then the other part is, just what I mentioned earlier, just dealing with some of the retailers that have been continuing to go through a more difficult time. But no, we don't \u2013 I don't view 2%. No, 2% makes me \u2013 I mean, we try to give you a sense of where we're at, we hope to do better, but I do not under any circumstance think 2% is our steady-state.","Linda Tsai","Thanks. And then through your Simon Ventures Fund when you look at some of these nascent brands you're nurturing for this platform. What are some of the business models or concepts you're seeing that make them more successful versus what's happening with some of the struggling legacy retailers. Are these concepts more niche like in nature or could be grown, scaled and replicated across larger physical base?","David Simon","Well, I don't think you can go from that point to the next point, I mean, I think the retailers that have struggled by and large have had and again we have a list that, and I don't know, if I should, well, put it this way. We have a long list of retailers that have struggled, 80% to 90% of that list have been over levered, so they couldn't turn left or right.","And you just can't have too much leverage in any industry and any business when things are \u2013 you run into an economic difficulty or you need to make investments, you just got \u2013 you have nowhere to go, and if I read you the list, you would, it might \u2013 it comforts me in one sense because we would stood this pretty successfully. On the other hand, I might scare you. So, I prefer not to scare you at this point, okay. But it's something that we've been able to withstand.","And so, I think, that whole \u2013 that's where and the retailers have a vision and whether they're starting from the internet or just been around, but they've invested in their business and their product. We're seeing pretty good results. Let's look at the higher end luxury category, they don't have a lot of internet sales, they invest unbelievably in the store experience and then the product and whoops guess what they had great results.","So, not overly complicated, the technology and some of the new concepts that we've seen out there that have been successful, usually it's a visionary leader. It's a visionary group that's dedicated to the business. They may have a little bit different angle on something that exist today. And they just execute it better than the next person. I mean, as an example, we're an investor in FabFitFun, which just raised $80 million from Kleiner Perkins and that's and that's basically a subscription business, which has been done before, but they just know how to do it better and more creatively and with better focus than maybe the next person. And that's always been the case in industries, right. There's somebody \u2013 there may be another idea, but the group takes that idea and then just does it a little better than the next person.","So \u2013 I think the power of our industry is that we can withstand the ups and downs of a retailer \u2013 or retailers. There are points in time where it's painful as we go through that with them. But ultimately, whether they turn it around or not, if we get the space back, historically, we've been able to lease it to a better person. So that's what we've done. Now will give you a number that I probably shouldn't, but we tend to be on most retailers' unsecured creditors committees. We have somebody internally that's \u2013 he's been around as long as me, Rick, so he's \u2013 been through his time.","He has \u2013 and this is \u2013 I think this is actually a great, positive statement about our industry and our business. But he is currently on his 200th, 200th unsecured creditors committee. Now okay, yes, that might say \u2013 holy cow, that makes you a little nervous. On the other hand, I mean, we did earn $4.3 billion. And my colleagues that's been on this committee, leasing committee, is on his 200th. So I think more importantly, it speaks to the resilience of our industry, our product and what the consumer really wants.","Linda Tsai","Thanks.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Mueller","Thanks. Just have a quick one. For the 2019 outlook, are there any significant onetime, either expenses or benefits, that we should be aware of? I guess, for example, like the Puerto Rico insurance recovery, anything like that?","David Simon","Well, actually. Puerto Rico came in lower than we thought in 2018. So as a company of this size, we're always going to have some of that stuff. We don't really get into that level of detail. I mentioned some of the other items that we think will be lower this year, like resettlement income. We do think rates rising will have some impact negatively as well as the stronger dollar. Now some of that stuff is moving around. I mean, who knows how it all shakes out. So we'll \u2013 we are always going to have \u2013 I think that's another interesting thing about this company, is that we're able to create other income opportunities. We have some, but We don't really get into that level of detail. It's all kind of factored into our numbers.","Michael Mueller","Got it. Okay. And then last thing, the sales of $661, Do you have that number on a weighted \u2013 NOI-weighted basis?","David Simon","We do, and the number is $832. So we took \u2013 I asked, Tom, do people care about that NOI-rated number? And he said no, no one's ever called me or asked me, so we took it out. But the number is $832 a foot.","Michael Mueller","Yes, it just seems like if you're doing in any of the buildup, you should apply a weighted average cap rate.","David Simon","Yes, we don't disagree. If people really like it, we are happy to put it back in, and they can call Tom.","Michael Mueller","Got it. Okay. That\u2019s it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open.","Nick Yulico","Good morning. Just a question on your tenant reimbursements. You had an unusual situation last year where the reimbursements declined about 1% for the year. Same impact in the fourth quarter. So what's driving that?","David Simon","That's usually just the quarterly spread of how things go. Nothing's driving it. I mean, again, you need to look at the totality of the year and not quarter-by-quarter.","Nick Yulico","Yes, that's what I'm saying. If you look the year, your reimbursements declined 1%, and so that's what I'm trying to figure out. What was usual? I mean, your occupancy is going up. Your expenses are going up. How come your tenant reimbursements are going down?","David Simon","Those are the numbers.","Nick Yulico","I mean, is that something, David, when you're talking about earlier when you're working with some retailers, is low reimbursements one of the tools you're offering to challenge retailers?","David Simon","No. I think we had a significant rise in utility cost and other items. So we're not just \u2013 you had some disposals that factored in there. I don't think it's anything material.","Nick Yulico","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim","Good morning all there. When you think about your \u2013 the capital you're allocating to redevelopment deal, newer development, what do you think about the risk profile of that newer deals you're doing, like the Sears repositioning or densification deals? Is the risk profile for those deals similar to what you've done in the past in terms of redevelopment? Or it's a little bit different?","David Simon","I mean, that's what we do. I don't \u2013 there's no \u2013 I'd say the risk is \u2013 we don't feel like we are at \u2013 on the higher-risk plank than redeveloping a department store space than anything else.","Rick Sokolov","We're applying the same discipline to decide whether were going to build a multifamily or an office or a hotel that we apply when we're doing a retail redevelopment. We do our market studies. We assess market rents, and we make sure that we're doing a good capital allocation decision as we decide to put in these incremental elements to our properties. So the risk is, frankly, the same because we're doing the same underwriting","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. Just going back to the same store NOI. Can you provide a little bit more detail around what type of cushion that you're building in, and specifically, the temporary retailer that you're having to recover your position? How much of an impact is that making to that 2% same store NOI growth?","David Simon","Look, we don't do that. I encourage you to think about our company a little bit differently, look at our history and realize that we're a very large company with a very \u2013 we don't get into that granular level of detail, and we would encourage you just to look at our history. And the fact that this is the number that we roll up, and we don't really get into that kind of detail.","Ki Bin Kim","All right. Thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Wes Golladay","Hey, good morning everyone. You mentioned there's some tenants that may be a little less relevant these days, and some of them don't have balance sheet issues. Have you seen any changes in tenant retention at lease expiration? And how much of a headwind is this for same store NOI, due to the 10 basis point headwind each year, or 50 basis points. Any context around that would be great.","Rick Sokolov","We have had pretty much the same percentage of renewals that we've had historically. So that has not been manifesting or seen itself as an issue.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then maybe for a given year, is it typically about a 20 basis point impact? Does that seem about right?","Rick Sokolov","In what context? I mean, we're renewing about the same percentage of the tenants. We have tenants that we are intentionally not renewing, because we want to bring in more productive tenants that are better operators. And we have tenants, as David has referenced, that through own issues, have to be falling out. So that hasn't changed over all the years we've been operating. It's just the same constant dynamic.","Wes Golladay","Okay. Thanks a lot.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is reopened.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it's Michael Bilerman. I just had two quick follow-ups. David, at the end of your opening comments, you talked about all the changes 2018 relative to 2019, you rattled off the FASB change, the Aero gain, the loss of FFO, the sale of the German operations, lower Houston fees. The impact of rising rates and the rising dollar on your international operations, and then you talked about, and you mentioned it a couple of times was this impact of the lower department store NOI, as you take those boxes back and you redevelop them.","Are you able to at least recognize your large company, we should think about you differently, but are you able just to identify the impact of that item you produced $5.7 billion of same-store NOI. I'm just trying to get a sense of how big that piece is, impact of that 2% growth rate?","David Simon","Well, I guess, if material enough to mention it, okay. But again I \u2013 we are not \u2013 we don't get into this \u2013 the granularity of these debates. We ask that you look at our track record and our ability to generate cash flow, I mean, as we did say\u2026","Michael Bilerman","And I do that, right?","David Simon","Again, so, I guess, and I answered it exactly how I would answer. In other words, we would mention it, if it was $12, okay, but we also wouldn't mention it, we would mention it, if it's material, but we don't \u2013 we're not going to, we don't give that number, it all goes into our buildup and, but we also don't want to make, I mean, and the purpose of not disclosing it is because we don't want to make excuses, a lot of companies say, next year is a throwaway year because I'm investing this that and the other, and we don't do that here.","And that's \u2013 so the reality is, yes, we're going to have the best growth, I think, in the retail real estate industry. I don't know, if anybody is going to be better, but if there is maybe one or two, we're going to have the best dividend growth probably in the industry. We had the best balance sheet in the industry. And, yes, we've got some setbacks and you know what, we're not going to have a throwaway year, we're just going to keep doing what we do, and we don't want to use that as an excuse and that's the facts.","Michael Bilerman","Listen, I always take when company say. Well, if you exclude this \u2013 and then as we produced 10% like well shareholders don't have that choice, shareholders will know the whole damn thing, right. I was just trying to focusing on you brought it up and I was just trying to figure out what sort of headwind it was creating on that 2% number?","David Simon","It is, again, I'll answer it exactly how I should, which is the..","Michael Bilerman","You don't need to answer the same way.","David Simon","Okay. Again I just think, we got \u2013 we all want to, let me micromanage, I will micromanage with my team, you guys look big picture, okay And when you look big picture, you're going to say, hey, we paid $28 billion in 25 years, that's not too shabby, and again tenant reimbursements, okay. Well, the real, look, let's talk about tenant reimbursements, real estate taxes go up because the municipalities want to attack the golden goose, they don't want to attack the internet sales, yes, they are like figuring it out. So, let's just see how it all evolves, we know what \u2013 we know how to \u2013 we know how to deal with the stuff, and we will continue to produce, I think, industry-leading results, if we don't do it in one year, call us where you want to call us.","Michael Bilerman","And then just a clarification on this whole consumer initiative when you and I spoke about this a bunch after you put it out in your shareholders letter last year. You sort of said there is a few cents potentially as a cost. I'm just trying to understand, is that a cost to capital cost or let's say you go out and you put $500 million or it's $1 billion investment, the impact is the cost of carry before the initiative starts to produce results?","David Simon","Again, it's \u2013 we pointed out because it's an investment. It's not going to be, let's assume, we earned $12.35. We're not going to be at $12 because of that, okay. We are not, I would appreciate, just the understanding that we're thoughtful folks but, yet, we do need to make investments for the future. And we have the track record that allows us to think about that a little bit that warrants our thoughtfulness. So, it's going to be a number and it's not going to be a big deal and we'll figure it out going forward.","Michael Bilerman","And I have no qualms with the company making investments. There was just more or so I was trying to understand if that was \u2013 the cost was making the dollar investment, which is very small, right. A few pennies 10, 12, 13 million bucks or does that represent the cost of carry on a much larger investment is, thinking about it of, look, I'll out go and I'll put $500 million to something in the effective opportunity cost of that capital?","David Simon","You are dealing with the guys who knows accounting. So, the reality is both, right because you have to depreciate the stuff, you don't add it back for FFO, sums investments, sums and operating expenses. So, it's actually, it would be both, okay. It's not \u2013 you don't add the FFO back from \u2013 for depreciation because it's not real property. So, it's a little bit of both, the amortized certain cost, it's IT spend. So, sums and amortized, we can sit down and go through the P&L, if you're really interested.","Michael Bilerman","It would be scintillating.","David Simon","It will be scintillating.","Michael Bilerman","Okay. I appreciate it, David. Thank you. Have a good rest of the year.","David Simon","No worries.","Operator","The next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Derek Johnston","Good morning.","David Simon","Good morning.","Derek Johnston","Could you help us understand the retail leasing environment today versus six or 12 months ago. Any category standout from a lease term or store closure versus store opening perspective and has rising sales per square foot over the past year plus translated into higher demand for space?","David Simon","Well, I would say, as we discussed that by and large demand is better, better sales produce for the retailer produce more interest in opening up. There's new and more retailers coming into the market all the time and the only offsetting of this is, certain retailers that are in the process of dealing with not recent problems, but legacy financial issues that have never been properly addressed.","Derek Johnston","Okay. And then just to continue on the ten-anchor redev projects and the pipeline of 25 others. So, beyond the large-scale mixed use transformative redevelopment, which trust me, we think is the future. However, it's likely not justified for most reclaim Sears or other returned large boxes. So, where is that demand coming from to release this space. We've seen like lifetime athletic and some co-working facilities. Can you share any other demand you're seeing?","David Simon","I don't, what do you mean, I'm not sure I understand, mode, not justified. Could you restate that please?","Derek Johnston","What I mean it for all 25 projects, it's a large densification effort, maybe not justified for all markets, right. So you might be looking at a box where maybe you just want to bring in another tenant to fill it. And I'm wondering where that demand is coming from, I've seen lifetime and some co-working. Just wondering who else is kind of out there?","David Simon","There is a great deal of retail demand. Frankly, we are dealing with, I call them, fitness centers, but they are frankly closed country clubs, theaters, entertainment uses. A number of the larger format retailers in many of these instances, we are adding small shop, specialty store space, because as I said prior, if we have a great property, there is demand for that property and the spaces we're getting back are spaces that are in great properties that have demand. So, there is substantial retail demand in addition just the densification efforts that we've talked about previously.","Derek Johnston","Okay, thanks.","David Simon","Sure. All right. Well, thanks for your questions, and we're available if you like to talk further. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. And thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. And you may all disconnect.

My name is Cathy, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today's call to Ms. Shelly Doran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Shelly J. Doran","Good morning, and welcome to Simon Property Group's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to our filings with the SEC for detailed discussion. Acknowledging the fact that this call may be webcast for some time to come, we believe it is important to note that our call includes time sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today's date, February 3, 2012.","During today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the earnings release or the company's supplemental information package that was included in this morning's form 8-K. This package is also available on the Simon website, in the Investors section.","Participating in today's call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.","David E. Simon","Good morning. We reported FFO of $1.91 per diluted share for the quarter, which represents an increase of 6.1% over FFO in the fourth quarter of 2010. FFO for the fourth quarter was $0.065 higher than the midpoint of our increased guidance range provided in October of 2011 with our third quarter results. These results exceeded the First Call consensus by $0.01 per share, and we have now met or exceeded expectations for 30 of the past 32 quarters, which is an 8-year run. This quarter capped off a great 2011 for SPG, our FFO growth per share was 14% for the year, expected to be amongst the highest of all the REITs. Our FFO of $6.89 per share was $0.365 higher than the midpoint of our original guidance provided in February of 2011.","For our malls and outlets, total sales on a rolling 12-month basis were $536 per square foot, up 10.7% from $484 as of December 31, 2010. Occupancy was 94.8%, which was 30 basis points higher than the year-earlier period and 90 basis points higher than the end of the third quarter. The releasing spread for the rolling 12 months was $5.20 per square foot, a positive of 10.5%. Our releasing spread continues to  grow at a steady pace as deal quality continues to improve. Resulting -- the following resulted in our comparable property net operating income growth of 4.5% for the quarter, which had a positive impact from overage rent and our year comp NOI growth came in at 3.4%.","During the fourth quarter and subsequent to year end, we completed several property transactions. We dissolved our joint venture with the Macerich Company and exchanged our 15% ownership interest in 6 malls and 1 community center with them for their ownership interest in 5 malls and 1 community center. No cash was exchanged other than customary net working capital adjustments. We disposed of our interest in 3 properties; Gwinnett Place, Factory Merchants Branson and Crystal River Mall, and this transaction led to a reported gain as disclosed in the financial statements.","For the full year 2011, we invested approximately $1.8 billion in acquisition activities with the acquisition of one property and the acquisition of initial ownership interest or increases in ownership interest in 12 properties. For the full year, we disposed of our interest in 10 malls, 3 outlets and one community center for a total value of $550 million. And during January 2012, we acquired an additional 25% ownership interest in Del Amo fashion center, which now increases our ownership interest to 50%. We're extremely excited about the upside potential from this transaction given the redevelopment opportunities that exist there. And also in January, we sold our 49% interest in GCI, which is our Italian interest investment. As a result of this transaction, we no longer own any interest or any assets in Italy. We received aggregate proceeds of $378 million for our equity interest, and we will report a gain in the first quarter of 2012 associated with this transaction.","On development, we opened one new development in the fourth quarter. Johor Premium Outlets in Malaysia, it's 100% leased. Initial sales are very good, and we plan on working on Phase 2 of that transaction -- that development. We also have, as you know, 2 new outlet projects under construction in Merrimack, New Hampshire and Southeast Houston, Texas. Both will open later this year. We currently have 23 renovation and expansion projects under construction in the U.S. with completion dates scheduled for 2012 and 2013, including which is the major restoration of Opry Mills, which is scheduled to open March 29 of this year. We are very excited about that. That event has been a long tough road to get that mall back to where it will be a very productive asset for us. ","In 2011, we spent approximately $400 million in new development, redevelopment and renovation activities. We have identified 20 new development, expansion and renovations where we expect to begin construction in 2012. Three that I want to highlight, importantly, in our Premium Outlets projects. First, today in fact, or maybe yesterday, depending on how you're thinking about Korea's time zone, but we marked the groundbreaking of a 240,000 square-foot outlet center in Busan in Korea, which is scheduled to open in the fall of 2013. It will be our third project in Korea. We also will begin construction in April of our 360,000 square-foot Phoenix Premium Outlet Center, which will open in the spring of 2013. Additionally, we plan to begin construction of our 360,000 square-foot premium outlet in Toronto this spring with our partner Callaway, and that will open in summer of 2013.","We're seeing very good value creation opportunities in these new developments and redevelopment projects, and we are anticipating spending $1 billion in 2012 with all the activity that's going on. That estimated rate, at this point, we anticipate being approximately $1 billion in 2013 and $1 billion in 2014. As always, as construction commences, we'll detail all the cost returns and timing for these projects in our supplemental reporting package. ","Let me turn to the capital markets. As you know, in October, the fourth quarter, we closed on our new unsecured revolving credit facility that increased our revolving borrowing capacity to $4 billion. This facility can be increased to $5 billion during its term and can be extended to October 30, 2016, at our sole option. The base interest rate is LIBOR plus 100 basis points. On November 10, 2011, we completed a $1.2 billion senior note offering, which resulted in historically low coupon rates and effective yields with an average weighted all-in yield of 3.6% interest for 8 years, which we are very pleased to do. ","And let me turn to our dividends. In the fourth quarter, as you know, we increased our -- fourth quarter 2011, we increased the quarterly dividend of our common stock from $0.80 to $0.90. I'm pleased to announce another increase in the dividend today from $0.90 to $0.95. Our quarterly dividend now has increased 18.8% since the third quarter of 2011. This puts us on a trajectory to pay dividends of at least $3.80 per share in 2012. This morning, we also released guidance for 2012 of $7.20 to $7.30 per share. This guidance includes the near-term dilution resulting from our sale of our GCI business, the proceeds of which have been utilized to pay down short-term floating rate debt currently until that capital is more permanently redeployed. It also reflects downtime with some of our better assets that are undergoing major redevelopments in 2012, including, but not limited to, the Fashion Mall at Keystone here in Indianapolis, South Dale Center, Dadeland, Quaker Bridge and Walt Whitman malls to name a few. And it also reflects the impact of expenses we will incur in connection with the development of our proprietary consumer marketing initiative.","In the fourth quarter of last year, I recall that my conclusion addressed concerns voiced by some about our ability to grow in light of our size. We generated funds from operation of an aggregate of $2.4 billion in 2011, a record for us and the industry. This represents an increase of nearly $320 million over our 2010 FFO. By comparison -- by our standards, we have only researched 15 U.S. REITs that in fact have an FFO greater than $320 million in 2011. We will continue to grow our company and deliver excellent results. Our common stock once again outperformed in 2011, generating a total return to our stockholders of 33.6% as compared to the RMS return of 8.7%, and an S&P return of 2.1%. We have now outperformed the RMS for the last 11 consecutive years and have outperformed the S&P 500 in 10 of the last 11 years as well. We're very well-positioned for 2012 with a strong portfolio, irreplaceable assets and a very attractive pipeline of new and redevelopment projects. We look forward to another strong year, and our focus remains on enhancing long-term shareholder value. With that, we're ready for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley of Citi.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'm here with Michael Bilerman as well. My first question is maybe for Rick. Just in terms of J.C. Penney's announcement of the main street concept in the 80 to 100 branded shops that they're thinking of introducing into their department store boxes, Rick, I'm just keen for your thoughts on what you think the overall impact might be on the mall?","Richard S. Sokolov","Well, let me just take a step back. We obviously are very excited about anything that'll make our properties better, and we want all of our tenants to be as good as they can be. And certainly, Ron Johnson and his new management team have energized all the constituencies based on the introduction of the strategy. And we hope they can implement it. As to your specific question, the concept of having the in-store shops is certainly not a new one. And if you walk our mall and walk the existing vendor matrixes of our department stores, you're going to find dozens of retailers that have wholesale presence in the department stores along with very robust in-line, full-priced specialty stores in our malls. Just an example: Nike, Skechers, Coach, Sephora, Bare Essentials, Kiel's, Art of Shaving, I could go on and on. So the answer is that we don't think it's going to be a particularly negative impact, and we hope it's going to be a lot stronger to enhance the market share of our properties.","David E. Simon","Let me just make it even simpler than that. He's a great retailer, we think it will be great for the mall environment. We look forward to working with Ron who we know well during his -- both his Target days and his Apple days.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And, David, just regarding  your capital shopping center stake. There were some related party transactions announced regarding a plant in Glasgow and an option on land in Spain. I understand that you're sort of now a passive investor in that REIT. But I'm just keen for your thoughts on those transactions, and whether or not that changes the way you view earning the stock?","David E. Simon","Well, that's a very good question. Needless to say, I think we're in -- we were disappointed in the Spain transaction. I think the company needs to focus on improving the U.K. shopping center environment and its centers. And even though the transaction is not overly material, I think it's a bad use of management's focus to go ahead and spend time in Spain. Needless to say, we all know what's going on in Spain in terms of unemployment retail sales. And certainly, as a large real estate owner, we understand that we want to look at things on the long-term basis. But in my humble opinion, this management team has no business being and pursuing projects outside of its native territory in the U.K. And it is -- puts doubt into me the strategy that the company is undertaking. Obviously, I don't have to reiterate how they viewed our offer and whether or not they acted in the best interest of shareholders. At this point, I think we have the better argument in that case, and I'm waiting for an explanation as to why. In fact, they're pursuing, looks to me like just the divergence of focus. Whether or not it'll impact our stake, it's too early to tell, but I am waiting for some kind of explanation from the management team.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","David, it's Michael Bilerman. Just one quick question, you talked about cost relating to proprietary customer marketing initiatives, and it sounds like that's all the Simon Groupon-type stuff that a lot of the customer data and technology stuff that you've been doing. Can you just elaborate a little bit more about sort of what you intend to spend and sort of timing of when things will come to fruition?","David E. Simon","Yes, look, the spend -- we have allocated in our budget a spend that I don't want to get too specific, but there will be an investment that we will spend. We'll have some, obviously, we're going to be expensing all of these so there's no capitalization of it. It's not going to change the materiality of the company. And given the prospects of a successful creation of a product, we think it's worthy of the investment. Now our goal right now, Michael, is to debut this product in the Northeast for the fourth quarter of this year. And there is not complete certainty that we'll do that just because it is complicated, and we want certainly a handful of important retailers to join in our effort, but that's what we're anticipating to be. We would prototype this and debut it in up to 5 properties in the Northeast, and look to see what kind of adoption or what kind of product acceptance we get and then tweak it from there. But that's the goal. The materiality of it -- materiality is in the eyes of the beholder. I will just say it's not going to detract overly. It's certainly more than a rounding error, but it's something that we want to invest in. Connecting with the consumer, understanding the consumer, is I think critical to the future of mall ownership, so this is where we're going to embark. We'll see where it goes from there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann of Goldman Sachs.","Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just focusing on the anchor stores for a moment and maybe just back to sort of Quentin's question on J.C. Penney. As you think about sort of leaders in the category, and I guess you could put Macy's, Nordstrom and certainly the positive news on J.C. Penney, how are you thinking about potential closings over the next couple of years, and perhaps capital that might need to be invested as some of the sales or market share erosions for others that are declining -- or accelerating sorry?","Richard S. Sokolov","If you look at our capital that have been spent, and we show you every quarter all the activity we have, this is really an ongoing process. Over the years, we replaced probably over 60 anchors from all the different consolidations. And in virtually every case, the property ends up stronger, and we've been able to generate good returns as a result of that process. We don't envision that this time period is going to be any different.","Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So you're not concerned about the number of closings accelerating in the near-term?","Richard S. Sokolov","We, frankly, based on all the announcements from Sears, that included none of our properties. And Ron Johnson and his presentation reiterated his strong belief in malls and the significant opportunity that his stores have in malls.","Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe just switching gears a moment, I mean, David, you mentioned the very strong performance over the last decade. And clearly U.S. sales have recovered and more than some since the last downturn and your stock now at an all-time high. How do you think about sort of the best opportunities for growth or new investment over the intermediate term, say, the next 3 years or so, and specifically you've talked about Brazil, you've talked about China and obviously Europe's been in the cards as well?","David E. Simon","Well look, Jay, it's absolutely clear to us that the best thing that we can do and why we added to the executive range here is redevelopment in our core business. And we anticipate, again, things can change, and I think I am pleased that we got confidence coming out of the economic upheaval sooner than a lot of folks that this year we're going to spend, I mean, always, things take longer than you want and things flop from one year to the next and redevelopment -- development. But this year, we're budgeting $1 billion. And it looks like we're going to spend $1 billion next year, and these are all very high return on investment activities. So to me, that the absolute #1 priority, we've got 2 new outlet that are going to open this year. Let's not lose sight of that. We've got the restoration of Opry, which has been closed for I don't know how long, but too long, 2.5-plus years. And we're starting construction in 2 outlets, Phoenix and Toronto, in the next 60 days as just example. And then we've got all sorts of expansions on the outlet side and the mall side, so to me, that's the focus. I think you'll see something from us in Brazil, something from us in China, but it won't be a big grand, huge, unique, big investment on either one. But I think you'll see us enter those markets thoughtfully. And we're out of Europe right now, and I have -- at this point, I have no regrets from that decision. So Europe is a different animal.","Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You timed it well. Just in terms of the starts on the premium outlet side, can you talk about the pre-leasing at this point? And maybe, Rick, just sort of where you are on '12 lease rolls?","Richard S. Sokolov","Well, on the outlet side, Galveston is frankly substantially leased. We expect to open that thing almost 90% with a great collection of tenants. And Merrimack is opening this year. And we're frankly almost -- we're 95% leased there. In terms of our rollovers, we're about halfway through our '12 and with very good momentum in that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Harris of Imperial Capital.","David Harris","Can you just elaborate a little bit more on the dividend? I for one was a little surprised that your board chose to increase it again -- I mean, having increased it last quarter?","David E. Simon","Well, David, it really boils down to simple calculus, which is we are chasing our taxable income. And it is likely that we're going to have to chase our taxable income all year. So we're trying to do it in the most thoughtful way. We did listen to the marketplace about the special dividend, the world was less than excited about it. To me, $0.20 of cash is still $0.20 of cash, but we listened. And we're looking to chase our taxable income the rest of this year and then in the future. So -- I mean it really just boils down to that simple calculus.","David Harris","So it's reasonable to expect there could be another review subsequently this year?","David E. Simon","We're -- I think it's reasonable to assume that every quarter it's going to go under -- taxable income for any entity, any big company, is complicated. It's certainly, in our case, complicated because not only do you have taxable income from just a normal business, but you've got acquisitions, sales, obviously we're going to get future depreciation from all the investment we're in, et cetera, but the fact of the matter is it's going to have to be under intense scrutiny each quarter from here on out the rest of this year. And it's likely we're going to have to chase it a little bit this year. And the good news, it ain't going down.","David Harris","And with regard to Europe, your comments, do they include or exclude the U.K.?","David E. Simon","I would say they -- I would include -- I've been more impressed frankly with the U.K. government's actions. So I think just from a macro point of view, I almost feel little bit better about kind of what they're trying to do macro there. But put that aside because I'm certainly no expert, I would throw them in the same bucket.","David Harris","One final question, I think it was on this call a year ago that you talked about the biggest decision you were going to be looking to make this year, i.e. in '12 -- I'm sorry, '11, would be whether to really tap the capital markets. I know you raised the $1.2 billion of unsecured and you looked to your revolver. But it didn't really -- the market didn't really kind of force that decision, I mean, how do you look at the world today particularly in the light of Bernanke suggesting that -- or telling us that the Fed is going to remain on hold through the end of '14?","David E. Simon","Well, I think we have the ability to be extraordinarily thoughtful and patient there. I mean we have no capital needs. Really, '12 and '13, if you look at our balance sheet other than typical refinancing of mortgages, which the market has gotten somewhat better at. And look, if there's a transaction out there is when we'll factor something like that, but right now, even though the capital markets are attractive, at this point we don't see any reason to warehouse capital.","Stephen E. Sterrett","Dave, it's Steve. I'll just add one thing to what David said, which is, we do as as ordinary course of business, rollover a lot of secured debt, and we've been very active with extending duration and locking in rates given the environment that we're in. And in fact, I just happened to look at this, this morning, our weighted average borrowing cost over the course of the last 12 months went down 20 basis points, and on $24 billion of debt, that's a pretty meaningful move. So while the headline, \"large raise of bond proceeds\" we did just once in '11. We were doing a lot of nicking and nacking it around -- rolling over our debt, and it did affect the profile of the balance sheet.","David Harris","And while -- just while I've got you, Steve, and I'm sorry to take up so much time. I know there's a lot of other people waiting. I mean today is the company kind of where you want to be in terms of leverage? Or do you consider yourself to be under-levered or whatever metric you want to use to think of your debt to equity?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Well, it's certainly a broad question. I will say this. If you look at our coverages today, which are 3x, and you look at the stability of the cash flow that was demonstrated during '08, '09, I think the strength of the balance sheet is pretty evident and the stability of the cash flow has been demonstrated that. I mean typically, we're going to naturally de-lever because of the cash flow we generate, absent the transaction. And as David said, we have the opportunity given the transaction to be very aggressive in the capital markets with the way the financing environment is right now.","David E. Simon","And I would just say I like de-levering.","Stephen E. Sterrett","It's not a bad thing.","David E. Simon","So I have -- again, I mean, we're good at doing deals and making money from doing deals. The spot that we're in right now where we can de-lever, invest in our good real estate is a good spot to be in, and I like that position.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy from UBS.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","In the process with Macerich of dissolving the JV, as you came to an agreement on the value of those assets in determining the appropriate split? Can you just talk about the range of the cap rates that were used to value the malls and what was the median cap rate of the portfolio?","David E. Simon","Look, I don't have those numbers right in front of me, but these assets were appraised a while ago, and we basically use those appraisals as the basis, but it's much more simpler than that. The fact is, Macerich expressed an interest in unwinding the deal. We said fine, suggest to us how you would do it. They came back and said, well, you can choose between the 2 pools of assets. The one that they manage and the one we manage. We looked at the real estate, we looked at the relative values, and we chose the pool that they were managing, and it was really -- since the appraisals were done, I don't know, a year-plus ago when we were -- we had a discussion about the same kind of topic. At that point, it was just what -- whether or not we wanted to proceed on the basis that they suggested, and we did. And it's as simple as that and it wasn't a -- we didn't sit there and negotiate values. They gave us an option A and an option B, and we chose option A. And they were left to decide whether what they offered was good, and we were left to decide whether or not what they offered was good for us. And we're pleased with the outcome.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just with regards to the sale of the GCI portfolio, I'm wondering if you could disclose the cap rate? And can you talk about your -- sort of IRR over the life of that investment, so what was your undepreciated cost basis in GCI?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Well, we'll -- you'll see the gain in the first quarter. It was an okay deal. It was not a great deal. The cap rates sale based upon '12 is around a 6.5 cap rate. We learned a lot. It was good experience. Ocean was a good partner. The reason we got out, we were more worried about the macro environment than they were. The redevelopment that was offered was less returns than what we wanted. And we had a mutually agreeable way to unwind, very similar to Macerich. That's what happens sometimes. And the cap rate was 6.5. It was an highly levered entity. That's why will have dilution this year. I think Steve, $0.06, $0.07 in our numbers. So had we not sold it, we would have had guidance higher. But we think in the long run, it was the right thing to do. It was an okay deal, not a great deal. I don't know what our IRR was, but the gain you'll see in the first quarter.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then just lastly, regarding the debt coming due on Mills this year. You have the $655 million senior facility and then another I think $1 billion of mortgage that's coming due. Can you talk about plans for refinancing all that, are you having preliminary discussions on the facility? And would you expect any resulting changes to the partnership this year?","David E. Simon","The mortgage refinancing is all in process, so we anticipate that happening again. You've got to remember some of those deals Mills is TMLP, our partnership with Fairlawn is a small partner in some of those assets. So the gross number sounds bigger than what the actual TMLP's responsibility is. And if you then look at our responsibility as half the owner of TMLP, it's even smaller. The senior and the net debt, we are just starting discussions with the senior lenders. No issue there. We expect -- we built up a significant amount of cash in TMLP to deal with any refinancing requirements, that's in process. We'll spend the next couple of months doing that. And the last one, look, you never know, partnerships sometimes are built to last a long, long time. And sometimes, they unwind in a very positive way. And I would expect that we'll have a positive outcome. It's been a good partnership, and it will either continue on, on a very good basis or we'll figure something else out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of ISI group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Steve, I had just a couple of technical questions as it relates to Page 15. I guess the interest and other interest and dividend income went down. And I guess, we were under the impression that you were due a dividend from CSC, and I'm just wondering if that's the case, whether there was a timing or something else is going on in that line item?","Stephen E. Sterrett","There's something else going on it, Steve. If you look at the balance sheet, you'll also see a decrease in our deferred cost and other assets. I think we had mentioned on prior calls that we held some mortgages as investments on other shopping centers. And those mortgages were paid back at their maturity date.","David E. Simon","We were really bummed on that front.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Secondly, I just noticed that down on the other expense line item, the other figure jumped quite a bit for the quarter and is up pretty significantly for the year. Is there anything you can sort of talk about, does that relate to any of these projects, David, that you talked about in terms of this consumer marketing initiative? Or is there something else in that line item?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Steve, it's really a function and you'll see the line right above it on Page 15 as well, the professional expenses was up quite a bit in the quarter. We've got a lot of transaction activity going on, some of which materialized in the fourth quarter, some of which David alluded to, it's potential activity in '12, and it's just a combination of costs related to those. Some are professional expenses, some are related expenses, but they are all driven by transaction or potential transaction equity that we've got in the hopper right now.","David E. Simon","But it didn't -- we have been using BCG to help us work, scope out, work on this initiative that we hope to prototype and debut in the fourth quarter. And so some of those expenses are also rolling through that number.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So it's fair to assume that the 12-month number's maybe inflated, or you do you think those are good run rates?","Stephen E. Sterrett","No, I think the '12 -- I think the fourth quarter number, Steve, is higher than what you would see on a run-rate basis.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Maybe I missed it, did you guys -- I know you gave guidance, but did you give the same store guidance for the year?","David E. Simon","No, Steve, we really decided to change the -- we've decided in '10, if you go back in '10, we decided not to do that any longer, just to give you kind of the gross number. And so the answer is no, we did not do that. And obviously, we feel confident it will be positive this year. But we decide -- we do not give that number out.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just in terms of leasing spreads, is there anything you could sort of talk about in terms of how it progressed throughout the year? I'm just trying to figure out if you kind of exited the year at a substantially stronger rate as you kind of go into '12, and does that kind of 10.5%, 11% number sort of have kind of upward bias to, as you look into '12?","Richard S. Sokolov","We did have positive progress throughout the year quarter-over-quarter in our spreads, and we are seeing better demand as we enter into '12. We've already made very good progress towards our '12 renewals in the mall business, so we anticipate a positive bias in that spread.","David E. Simon","And look, Steve, we -- I just wanted, the retail real estate business is still tough, okay. And we are grinding like no other time. And our results, our sales, our occupancy and our rents are all obviously very positive. But it is a grind, and there are retailers that continue to downsize and continue to -- we continue to have struggles on leasing some of that space up and getting the market rent on some of that space, so we still feel positive about it, but it -- there is still work to be done. And it is not -- it's a lot of work to produce these results.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. My last question, could you just circle back on the Toronto project? I mean you were pretty adamant when you were starting that project and I realized there's kind of been a head-to-head competition up there. What can you sort of tell us about leasing or kind of the state of the site, any more details about that project?","David E. Simon","Emphatically, we're going to start in the spring, so we're -- we feel we're permitted to go. We're finishing it up. Leasing, look, we're in a different spot than others in the outlet business. We have the -- we can rely on the experience and judgment of having 70 Premium Outlets, Mills assets throughout the world. We don't necessarily need to pre-lease. We're pros. We're experts in this business. The answer is, we've got real interest. We've got certain commitments, and barring something unforeseen, both of those that I mentioned, we will be starting construction. So we're a little different. We understand this business very well. We know the risks about starting construction whether you're fully leased or not. We've done it in the past in the outlet business, and we're good to go on both of these deals.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan of Morgan Stanley.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to go back to the dividend a little bit. I mean, you've got -- based on kind of where you are now, your FFO payout ratio is only 52-some percent. You got a big portfolio as you burn through your depreciation basis, you said you're kind of chasing taxable income. And I kind of wonder, I mean do you have a feel for, I mean your guidance for FFO is relatively narrow. Do you have a feel for kind of where -- how much you might have to grow the dividend, is dividend going to be growing at a materially-faster pace than FFO going forward short of the deal...","David E. Simon","Well look, Paul it's an entirely appropriate question and obviously this is a great dialogue at the board level. So it's hard for me to be really specific. But based upon what I know, it's -- we're going to have to, I would think, continue to raise our dividend the rest of the year. It doesn't give you a guidance on how much and when. But we want a little bit more data coming in with the first quarter ops. We want to understand what if any transactions transpire or happen, or what have you that may have some impact on that. But what I know today, obviously subject to counsel with the board, $0.95 will not be enough per quarter to pay out our -- 100% of our taxable income.","Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Does -- I mean, you generate a lot of free cash flow right now and kind of fought over the years to grow that half the dividend. Does -- I mean, does this make it any more -- make you anymore inclined to pursue deals? I mean, because obviously that's one side benefit of a large transaction?","David E. Simon","Only -- look, not at all really because -- and I mentioned it early, we've got so much going on with the existing portfolio and all of the redevelopment and new development. And again there is nothing wrong with generating the cash, increasing the dividend, de-levering and just keep doing what we're doing. So I feel absolutely no need or pressure to do any deal whatsoever. And I like kind of the model we've got, that's not to say we won't. If we think we like the real estate that we would get, at the end of the day, but I am -- I don't like parting with our cash right now. I like reinvesting it in our portfolio. So we're entirely pleased with what's going on here.","Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on that note, you've got $700 million or so in -- what your supplemental talks about as being kind of renovation and expansion. Doesn't really say much about, which kind of malls are being expanded, but it kind of implies $70 million of incremental NOIs essentially? Can you provide some color on kind of where that's coming from or any kind of big expansion to drive that, it's just looks like sort of renovation but...","David E. Simon","Yes, I mean for instance, in the outlet side we expect to start in Las Vegas and in Orlando and in Desert Hills and Seattle. Seattle is under construction, so those are 4 in that side. In the mall side, we're undergoing a massive extension and redevelopment of Walt Whitman, Quaker Bridge, we've got Opry Mills, we've got King of Prussia. We announced, as you know, at KLP that we're going to connect the 2 malls. We are in planning phase on that now, obviously working with the town on approvals. Those are just -- Nanuet is -- the mall has been shutdown. We're going to start construction there finally. La Plaza, we're going to add a second level on. We've got major redos, new department stores, new food courts, examples with Keystone, Dadeland and Southridge in Milwaukee. Plaza Carolina has been -- several boxes have been added. So those are just off the top of my head. When we start construction, we put it in the 8-K, and I think you'll see addition to that disclosure as the year progresses.","Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just my last question on occupancy. You ended the year I think maybe it's not your highest number ever and -- are you reaching a point at kind of 94A [ph], I know some of it is seasonally high, but where you're sort of at a frictional max? How much farther do you think you can drive portfolio, occupancy? And if it's not much farther, does that mean you can start pushing rents harder?","David E. Simon","Well, I think -- yes, you're right, there is the frictional number. This year will be a little bit interesting because we do have a lot of movement going on with the portfolio as you might imagine with all the development spending. So -- but put that aside, I think there are some improvement. But I think now the focus is on improving the quality of the 95% that were leased. And we didn't have that luxury obviously in '09, '10 and to some extent '11. We're still going to feel pressure in '12 with certain retailers, but I think the focus now, hopefully, is to marginally improve that occupancy. But it's really going to be taking the existing occupancy, maybe stabilizing that as it is, but really improving who's in the space.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I'm impressed you guys are in with all the stuff going out there in Indi.","David E. Simon","Well, we're so focused on what we do.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I figured you guys would be renting out the parking spots for additional FFO.","David E. Simon","That's true. We've got sponsorship on our building that may have a big impact on our fourth quarter -- first quarter. But we're so focused on what we do we have blinders on this -- for this week in any event. In fact, we are so focused on what we do that we forgot that the Super Bowl with this, so when I planned our board meeting and our earnings call. We could have probably picked a better week.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just quickly, it sounds like in Europe, obviously the macro situation didn't help any, but it sounds like the yields that you were seeing over there from your investments just were not meeting your expectation and the macro situation just sort of was the hair on the camel's back. As if you think about  Brazil and China, what are the returns or what are the return premiums over what you would invest at in the U.S.? What are you looking for in those different markets?","David E. Simon","Well, I think the development returns in Brazil are well-articulated. And I think in our view in Brazil, what we would do is develop, as opposed to buy there. And I think the development yields that they try to achieve the 15% kind of return on cost would be where our focus would be. And China is -- we've got opportunities. I was over there in December. We're working on a couple of outlet deals, but the numbers side of that equation, all that kind of the financial due diligence is still in a work in progress. But if it's not a premium to what we do here, we just -- there's just no reason do it. Even though you might argue that the NOI growth will offset that, I still want to invest at higher levels than I can here, that's the frustration, let's say going to Europe and doing a lot of redevelopment, but we do see, as we pencil out China and Brazil, just like we have in -- seen in Japan, seen in Korea, seen in Malaysia, all of those are higher development yields than we would gather here -- garner here I should say.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. So by implication then, when you were considering the capital shopping, then despite the low going in yield that the U.K. commands, from your underwriting, you were seeing returns that were in excess of the U.S., is that fair?","David E. Simon","I was really referring to new development, okay? I think what we saw there and again, recall that our deal was subject to due diligence. We saw at the end of the day, yields comparable to what we would pay here on acquisitions, yet once we got our hands on the fact that management operations could be improved, and so, I just -- I don't want to confuse development yields with acquisition yields, and we saw kind of comparable acquisition yields in the U.K., comparable to what we would pay here. With supply issues, they are a lot different than they were here. So on that basis, it was worthy of pursuing it to get to the point where we could validate that initial conclusion, but we weren't access to the books, and therefore, we did not make a formal full bid.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And just the second question, just going back to the dividend, EQR went to a policy where they paid a steady, first, second, third quarter dividend with a true-up in the the fourth. Is that -- as you guys contemplate the dividend, is that something that would be, that you think would be helpful or would investors be receptive.","David E. Simon","Well, look, that's what we did in '11 and the fact is, the more we talk to people, the less they liked it, so my view would be to try and not do that really create a dividend that equals taxable income, and that as that grows, your dividend grows. So, we would like to get away from the special dividend based, kind of, the true-up dividend, which in our case, was represented by a special dividend. We would like to get away from that, and make it more what I said. Now look, sometimes you never rule out, if you sold $5 billion of properties, and you had a big taxable income, you may -- there may be certain circumstances that you'd have to that, but the fact is, we would like to not do that, and that's what we're going try and achieve in '12, but certainly, as we catch up to our taxable income, we will get away from the special true-up dividend.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of Macquarie.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","Just a follow-up on Alex's previous questions about Brazil. From a levered return standpoint, would you be funding it locally, or is there some arm of opportunity using your cheap cost of corporate debt to fund development out there?","Richard S. Sokolov","Well, we would use our -- the cheapest capital we have is this cash on the balance sheet. What are we getting.","Stephen E. Sterrett","Billion dollars a year.","David E. Simon","No, but what are we...","Stephen E. Sterrett","Forecasting?","David E. Simon","Investing.","Stephen E. Sterrett","Oh, 20, 30 bits.","David E. Simon","20, 30 bits, so the fact of the matter is any development that we would undertake in Brazil, we're just going to cash-fund, so we wouldn't use any leverage.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","Okay. Is that typically -- would you by JV or by yourself?","David E. Simon","Right now, we're contemplating a JV.","Richard S. Sokolov","And that's probably likely what -- how we'll do that","David E. Simon","And in China as well if we get to that point in China.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","Okay. And last question, if I look at those sales per square foot increases in your portfolio consolidated versus unconsolidated, it seems like the -- your JV probably is a lot better, up 22% year-over-year versus your consolidated, which is up only 9%. Still good, but lording your JV assets. So how should we think about the opportunity for additional JV takeoff in terms of -- are all the JVs, at one point in time, are they all opportunities for you? And broadly speaking, if you could talk about cap rates, not deal-specifically, but for the best assets, where could we see cap rates for these assets and I guess kind of going down the spectrum of quality?","David E. Simon","I would just say part of the difference between the growth in a consolidated and unconsolidated -- we can get a better answer for you on that than just the quality because some of the mix change, and that we put more -- we add more outlets in there now, that we put prime in our numbers. But I think we restated 10 for that in any event. So -- but we can get you a better answer on that. So I think the mix -- our mix in our wholly-owned properties is great. And so there's no real issue between what's in our JV and what's in our consolidated, I mean, just -- in our consolidated, you have Roosevelt Field, King of Prussia, Forum Shops, Woodberry all of the outlet business. So put that aside, that's not to say we don't have some great JV assets, but the basis, much bigger in the consolidated than the JV. So don't read too much into that, now going to your question, cap rates on A assets is -- got to be -- there's not a lot being done in that whole area, but they continue to move lower given that the fact that investors believe in NOI growth for high-quality retail assets. So you tell me, I mean it's low -- it's lower than -- it's in the 4s, maybe. That helps?","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","Yes, it does help. And I guess, one part of that question is...","David E. Simon","...Assets, I got that we'll be buying in the 4s, so, because you know, but I think there are people out there that would clearly buy in the 4s.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","So, even for your A assets, that you're managing something in the 4s wouldn't be a price that would clear at or a takeout?","David E. Simon","Look, I don't know. I mean it would have to be something really, really unique to get to that. I mean King of Prussia we did not get to that number, there's nothing like that asset especially given its development. So look, it all depends on circumstances, but I do think there are institutional investors out there that would feel comfortable at those kind of iconic assets to be in that level. Whether we would or not, it would take an interesting set of circumstances.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Actually, can you just talk about the volume of move-outs that have happened subsequent to quarter end? Is that in line with prior years and then just on your guidance, where did you guys peg your year-end occupancy?","Richard S. Sokolov","Well, on the move-outs, we have basically been consistent historically. We didn't have anything out of the ordinary.","Stephen E. Sterrett","Well -- and this is Steve, Jeff. We've also, year-to-date, as you've seen very little bankruptcy activity as well so...","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And what did you say, within your guidance maybe for year-end occupancy as the target?","David E. Simon","Well we don't -- we're really getting away from those kind of specifics. We do it asset-by-asset to build up to our budget. It's -- in our own budget, it's a slight improvement, but we don't give specific numbers, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, just while I got you guys, and on Sears, just more obviously, more focus on Sears holdings. You're de minimis, I think direct exposure to base rent, but do you have an estimate of what your ultimate financial exposure is through cotenancy rights?","David E. Simon","We -- yes, I would just say, if we do give cotenancies with retailers, we do in some cases and not really happy about it, but we do, do it. It's rare that it's going to be tied to a Sears operating, usually it's 3 out of 4 and something like that. But I would say that particular issue would be de minimis.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just maybe you could talk a little bit about your exposure there. Is there a theme to it, if you will, maybe the majority of your exposures in single- or two-story stores or there in malls of a certain sales production, just curious?","Stephen E. Sterrett","If you look at our Sears portfolio, they are very well situated in our better properties. We have obviously significant numbers so throughout the portfolio. But again, this is nothing new. I mean, this is, we're working with Sears. We are strategizing if in fact the eventuality comes we want to deal with it, we're lining up demand. There is happily substantial demand. And we're just going to have to see how this unfolds. To date, none of our stores have been impacted. And we try to monitor their volumes, and our portfolio as a whole is above average both in terms of gross volumes and sales per foot.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just last 2 questions. One is on Del Amo, are you able to share maybe a cap rate or rough cap rate on that transaction? And then maybe, Steve, can you talk about what you've seen change in the financing market for, I guess, I'd say second-tier market malls, or those with below-average sales production, any movement there?","Stephen E. Sterrett","I can take the second part of the question first, Jeff. We continue to see really pretty robust demand on, call it for lack of a better term, the middle-quality malls. And interestingly enough, it's come from the banks in anticipation of a restart of the CMBS market in 2012 and the ability to syndicate some of these. Pricing has been pretty decent. And as I said, we've been out with 2 or 3 assets, and the demand has been very good.","David E. Simon","Look, Jeff, we don't do individual cap rate, things, malls, other than we really feel like we made a fair deal and one that we'll be able to add value with as we move very aggressively on our redevelopment plans there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carol Kemple of Hilliard Lyons.","Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","Are there any updates on the St. Louis potential outlet development?","David E. Simon","We're working it, but the short answer is, not really.","Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","Okay. And then, Steve, I know that G&A expense was up in the quarter. Was that something that's just this quarter, or is that a good run rate going forward?","Stephen E. Sterrett","It's a little bit of both, Carol. There's part of it where it's just the full year impact of compensation plans, but then there is -- a bit of it that is probably not going to repeat in 2012.","Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","Okay. And then I know you all talked about you feel no pressure to do acquisitions, and you think renovations are a better reinvestment of your capital at this point. If you decided you wanted to do acquisitions, is there anything out there on the market that you have any interest in?","David E. Simon","Do you have any ideas?","Carol L. Kemple - Hilliard Lyons, Research Division","No, I don't. I like the renovations at your old malls personally.","David E. Simon","The answer is, usually they come about when you least expect it. So again, we -- it's not a high priority, but we look at just about every and any alternative, and though the good news is, but you got to be really disciplined when you have this ability. The good news is we could look at basically any real estate company in the world and decide whether or not it makes sense for us. So -- but comes with that a burden not to screw up. So what's better, you could look at every deal or you're in a position where you can't. I'd rather be in the fact that we can look at every deal, but with that comes some discipline here that we better not make a mistake.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cedrik Lachance of Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","David, earlier you talked about some of the challenges that are still out there when it comes to leasing space in your properties or in the mall business in general. Can you quantify it for mall categories if you will, so what do you observe of A malls versus Bs and Cs?","David E. Simon","Well look, the risk in the A malls is really not a risk because if you do get that space back, you're going to -- you have plenty of demand to lease that up. But it is going to be in the kind of the -- however, you want to characterize, I hate listing malls A, B and C, but it's certainly going to -- the pressure that we have as an owner will be on what people call as the B mall category. And it's surfacing because of tenants like The Gap, the -- PacSun wearers of the world that are still and continuing to connect with the consumer. And again I don't like naming names and pointing retailers out, that's only representation of a couple of retailers that in fact themselves have said they're closing stores. But the fact is, that's where the pressure in the portfolio occurs and is occurring, and that's what we're working to offset. If we get the space back, and the fact of the matter a lot of A malls, retailers that are downsizing, we're taking the opportunity to help with that downsizing by not renewing them in the A malls.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Is it the same with the B malls, who are the replacement tenants when a Gap or a Paxon exit the property?","Richard S. Sokolov","Well, there are a lot of people that are very aggressively growing their footprint and that leads to David's point. We're doing deals throughout the quality spectrum with Loft, with Love Culture, Crazy 8, Izumi, Chiles, Cotton On, Francesca's, all of the -- Cabana, all of those tenants are -- H&M. So we're doing with a lot of these tenants throughout the portfolio. And one other point that I want to make is, this billion dollars that we're spending in our portfolio is certainly giving us more attractive properties in terms of the tenants wanting to be in them. It's no accident when we're adding over 35 anchors in our portfolio when we're renovating 20 properties, when we're getting substantially higher growth, that's making us have a better product for our leasing agents, and that's hopefully, going to bear fruit and enable us to deal with the space we get back from the tenants that are shrinking their footprint.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just to finish in terms of the Italian sales, are there any circumstances or tax circumstances associated with repatriating the capital to the U.S.?","Stephen E. Sterrett","None.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Yang of KBW.","Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","David, you talked earlier about how the joint venture with Macerich was carved up, but I don't think you mentioned, was there any consideration to selling those assets outright?","David E. Simon","Not really. The answer is, no. Look, Dave, we're off on our own with each other, so we never really talked about selling the whole portfolio.","Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And that's just why Steve's comments that the financing market for these mid-tier malls is coming back? I mean is it anticipated that you might end up selling them or selling more above and beyond what you just got from Macerich?","David E. Simon","Well, the fact of the matter is, the portfolio that we got we think there's upside. So we're pleased with the outcome. We think we can move the needle on those assets, and we have no intention at all of selling those assets. So look, we're going to still prune the portfolio. And I think, as Steve said, that the fact the financing market is getting better, I think that will help us. It's been, obviously, that's been a challenge to sell kind of the smaller malls. But with respect to specific -- respected IBM, there's absolutely no desire or interest to sell those assets.","Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just switching gears, you have made some comments also that you guys are different. You don't need to pre-lease to start the construction, which, to me, it sounds like, kind of a shot across the bar to the competition, so I was just curious, can you...","David E. Simon","I didn't say -- I said we take a different approach. You use the word different, so I don't think I said the word different, but I'd love to go back, I could be wrong.","Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","But I'm just wondering, can you talk about how retailers have been evaluating the multiple options in those markets that you identified where there is competition. I mean it is just the stalemate that kind of forces you to, what looks like go to do some spec development outlets.","David E. Simon","Well, I think every development is different. A lot of cases, the retailer is using the competitive scenario to drive down rents, and we're seeing that a lot. So the retailer is very adept, very skilled at using the leverage of competition to drive rents down. And in some cases, they're sitting on the sidelines saying, \"Well, I want to be -- I want to have an outlet in this marketplace, but you guys figure it out, they're on the sidelines.\" And in some cases, they have they faith in us, they want to go with us because we've got this knowledge base of all of these assets. And in some cases, they want to go with the other guy because of whatever other reason. So it's all over the board. The fact of the matter is, we don't really pre-lease, period. We're doing Nanuet, and we've got -- that's not an outlet -- and we've got certain commitments from very important retailers. But are we sitting there leasing up the small shop up to a certain percent to where we lease, the answer is, no. We should be able to use our judgment, our experience, whether or not we can get something leased, at what rent, and that's just the way we operate. Certainly not meant to be a shot across the bow for anybody. Everybody can do whatever they want. I have no influence on that at all, but that's how we operate.","Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful, but at what point do you end up actually buying the land. I mean is it satisfund [ph] that you've actually purchased the land in Phoenix, in Toronto, in St. Louis, is that...","David E. Simon","Phoenix, we have signed the ground lease. I was down there, I don't know, was it last week or 2 weeks ago. It's a ground lease. We're on Indian land, and by the Wildhorse Casino there. So that ground lease is signed. And Toronto, it's all documented and signed, land closing is forthcoming.","Benjamin Yang - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","What type of delta is that when you ground-lease something like that versus buying the land outright?","David E. Simon","It tends to have a better return in a lot of cases. Obviously, when we're on Indian land, you can't really buy the land, so that's how it works. And we thought -- we liked the site enough given that, that was -- that was a good outcome for us on that deal.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Desai of Credit Suisse.","Gautam Desai ","I will take another retailer example, Williams-Sonoma was amongst your larger tenants 5 years back. And now roughly 40% of their business is online, and about a quarter of their leases are expiring over the next 2 years. And what I'm hearing from multiple conferences is that they are planning to negotiate the rent in those expirations. And if they're not successful, they just plan to move more of their business online. I just wanted to get your thoughts on it, and if this is  like indicative of a changing trend in retail in general?","Richard S. Sokolov","I don't believe there's anything out of the ordinary with your example. Williams-Sonoma happens to have a great real estate and great properties. And if their business strategy is such and their productivity is such that they cannot afford to maintain the space that they currently have, they're going to come in and offer us a rent that enables them to maintain their occupancy. If we don't believe that rent is fair market value, they're going to move out and we're going to replace them with somebody that has got a productivity and a business strategy that will enable them to pay what we believe is fair market rent.","Gautam Desai ","Right. It makes sense. And another question, are there any acquisitions included in your 2012 guidance?","David E. Simon","Acquisitions?","Gautam Desai ","Yes.","David E. Simon","No, there are none.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan of Cowen and Company.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I just have a couple of questions on Del Amo. They obviously are very large asset, and I think David in your prepared comments, you talked about a redevelopment or an investment in that asset. Understood you have just recently increased your share in it. I'm just curious if you can tell us whether the $1 billion for this year and next year of redevelopment includes Del Amo, number one. And number two, if you could talk a little bit about your plans for that asset if you feel able to at this point.","David E. Simon","Well, the $1 billion does not include for this year, because we still think we are in a spot where we're going to use this year for '12 to plan what we're doing, and part of that depends on outcomes with certain discussions with certain stores, but it's a complicated asset. I'll turn it over to Rick to explain. We have a lots of different options. It's complicated, and it's probably better to show you physically than words, but I'll let Rick take it from there.","Richard S. Sokolov","Just very briefly, it's midway between Sentry City and South Coast Plaza. It's positioned to serve all of the great communities on the Pacific Ocean that have -- we have a trade here of 1 million people with $90,000 household income. So we believe there's an opportunity to add fashion anchors. We believe there's an opportunity to add some full-line anchors and completely redevelop the property. It's over 2.275 million square feet. So we've got a lot of FAR and a great market, and we're very focused on bringing that forward. And it's certainly going to be part of the capital spending that David talked about in 2013 and 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies & Company.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two questions. The first one is a Steve\/Rick combo. I just wanted to find out what occupancy cost of sales was in fourth quarter. And for new tenants signing leases, what the target is on that number?","Richard S. Sokolov","The occupancy cost in the fourth quarter for the malls and outlets was 11.8%. And really, the way we price our real estate is a function of who's the tenant, what's the productivity of that tenant, what's the mall, what's the space in the mall. So we have a very focused process and all of those factors feed into it.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Could you give a range?","Richard S. Sokolov","It's very hard to do. I think if you look at our -- the leases that we signed, I believe in the fourth quarter were $50 and change starting rent. So that gives you a pretty good barometer of the type of activity that's undergoing in the portfolio right now.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then in regards to guidance, you talked about the $0.07 dilution from GCI. Could you give us a sense on what the dilution is from the consumer marketing initiative, and as well as the downtime from the redevelopment?","Stephen E. Sterrett","We did -- we're not going to give specifics on that, but it's all in our numbers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Rick, can you give us a quick rundown of the new retailers and concepts entering the Simon portfolio?","Richard S. Sokolov","Well, the ones that are coming in, that we're working with -- are examples of drygoods that's a  division of Ron Mauer, Vince from Calwood, Sea Wonder, Running Company is a new concept that Finish Line is working with, Versona from Cato, but I certainly don't want to ignore like you look at a Limited Brands, and they had a great report and they're aggressively looking to get more space to take care of their pink concept, so the fact that a brand is mature doesn't mean that it still doesn't have a significant growth potential.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And one quick final question. Now that we're 5 years of the peak of the market, are you noticing any pressure from releasing the leases signed 5 years ago?","Richard S. Sokolov","No.","David E. Simon","No.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I know you don't like breaking up the portfolio in terms of performance, but can you talk generically about how the mall portfolio is performing versus the community center portfolio and maybe thinking about 2011 and 2012, is the gap any closer these days?","David E. Simon","They're both performing better than what we expected in '11. The outlet business continues to have higher comp NOI growth than the mall business. But I'll tell you, I think we're generally pleased with both segments. And the gap is certainly less -- certainly it's been reduced compared to '09 and '10 levels. I think that's safe to say that the outlet business was stronger in the height of the significant economic downturn. So that gap -- that growth rate gap has certainly narrowed.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And that's fair between a traditional mall and community center as well?","David E. Simon","In our community center, we don't, you mean the...","Richard S. Sokolov","The growth rate.","David E. Simon","The growth rate. Yes, the mall business grows much better than the community center business.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then going back to non-core asset sales. Could you just talk about generically about how big the potential pool of assets that you would like to sell over time is?","David E. Simon","Well, I think historically, this year we basically disposed of assets around $500 million. If we could continue to sell $200 million, to $300 million, to $400 million of assets a year in terms of pruning, I think that would be the level that would be desirable.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Spector, Bank of America.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Few questions. If we could just start off I guess with the big picture, Rick, just wanted to follow up from our ICSC dinner in December. Can you talk about your more recent conversations with tenants, the retail sales seem to be stronger than expected. What is their latest view on these new store openings or new concepts?","Richard S. Sokolov","I think that David alluded to earlier, it's very much a tenant-by-tenant analysis. Sales were better. There were some pressures on margins. We've detailed earlier in the call a number of tenants that have very aggressive growth profile and there are others that are retracing a little bit and reducing their footprint. Generally, however, the balance sheet remains strong. They are still generating cash flow, and we're still able to drive demand from the types of tenants that we'd like to have in our properties.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I guess, where do you stand on pricing power at this point? I know David said business is still tough. Is it still a tough negotiation, or you feel like pricing power is coming a little bit more back to your side?","Richard S. Sokolov","There is never a negotiation that is not tough. I mean, look, we're fighting over the same dollar. And that's been that way for 40 years, and it will continue that way. And ultimately, do we have some better power? Look, as the productivity of our properties get better, as we improve our properties, as our occupancy gets stronger, just fundamental supply and demand, there's virtually no new construction, that certainly plays into our strengths.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I guess, thinking about the budget and your guidance, I guess, David, your thoughts in the consumer or economist keeps saying that consumer spending is going to slow second half of the year. When you thought about -- I guess, when you finalized your budget, how were you thinking about the consumer?","David E. Simon","Well look, I think our budgeting is -- it reflects -- it's round-up, so it reflects the general nature of the fact that we are cautious in how we put our numbers together. So I think in a sense that reflects also that -- what's going on in the macro environment. The -- so I think we take that into account. There's no guarantees in anything, but I do think we take in the fact that it is generally still a very cautious environment. We would -- we have a lot of work to do to make our numbers. On the other hand, we always want to beat our numbers. And we're at the point now where we're giving you our view of kind of what it is, given what transpired with the GCI sale, et cetera. We always want to beat our numbers, but we're generally cautious. So -- and I think that reflects the consumer. This year, you do have a certain added uncertainty with the general election and all that crap that follows with it. And on the other hand, there are reasonable, I mean it's very confusing signs out there, but there are some reasonable ones. Jeff, you're aware obviously of what happened with jobs today. On the other hand, you see more layoffs that have been announced over the last week or 2. So it's -- my view it's still a very confounding, tough environment to kind of decipher through. I do know though that, the program that we have in our internal investments will pay rewards for our shareholders in the future. So that I'm not worried about. And we would like to see better income growth and job growth. That would give us a cushion that we haven't been able to really have over the last couple of years even though we produced terrific industry-leading results.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then I just want to clarify, David, you mentioned you're going to spend $1 billion this year in development, next year a $1 billion. And I think you also said 2014, is that strictly redevelopments, new Premium Outlet Centers and expansions at your existing Premium Outlet Centers?","David E. Simon","Correct idea. That's all in. That's new development and redevelopment.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But not -- just to clarify, not new malls?","David E. Simon","Yes, well -- unless you got a site you want to show us where the new malls, I still think are ways away. I think -- I still don't see a real demand for a lot of new malls. Now, Nanuet is a good example. You could consider that a new mall in a sense, but we put that in our redevelopment category.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then Brazil, should we be -- should we assume it's full price in China, Premium Outlet. Did you day that?","David E. Simon","I did not say that, and you should not necessarily assume that.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then with the Phoenix announcement...","David E. Simon","On both fronts, Jeff, on both fronts.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then last question on Phoenix, I guess with your announcement, have you heard anything from your competitors on their sites?","David E. Simon","I assume they're -- our assumption is they're going to go full steam ahead, and we are going forward, will have no impact on what they do.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Actually I'm sorry, one last question. Do you still have the ownership stake in value retail in the U.K. and Europe?","David E. Simon","We do.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You do. Okay. Anything with that at this point with the sale in Italy, or you like that small investment, keep it as is, or is there any chance to increase that or do anything more in the outlet front I guess?","David E. Simon","We like that investment. In fact, we have an investment at the holding company more or less. And then there's investors in various outlets that in some cases are different than the investors at the holding company. And in fact we just increased our ownership interest in 2 outlets at year end.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","In value retail?","David E. Simon","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to push a little more on Del Amo. Do you think that investment could be north of $200 million?","David E. Simon","Yes, it could be. It could be. And if you want to see all the options, we'll let you spend. It's at your own peril, but we'll let you spend time with David Contis. And he could -- we could actually use your help, Craig.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And it sounds like...","David E. Simon","That will be at your own peril and may take a long time, so reserve half the day.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's sound like you're talking to fashion anchors. Are they positively inclined at this point?","Richard S. Sokolov","Everyone acknowledges the importance of the market and the fact that it's not adequately penetrated under existing stores. Obviously, we're now in an environment where people are considering more capital investments, and we're optimistic.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, and then prior to my meeting with David Contis, is it still going to be done in phase, there was one time I thought you'd focus on the northern end first?","Richard S. Sokolov","It will still be done in phases based on when we can get the right critical mass. And right now, we're focusing on what and how we're going to start it. But it is, again, a very big project, so it is going to take a number of phases and a number of years to bring to fruition.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just shifting gears slightly, in terms of the outlet business, I'm wondering if, like the malls, are the higher-end ones doing better than the more moderately-priced ones? Or are outlets strong just throughout the price point spectrum?","David E. Simon","I would say they're generally strong. But the tourist outlets are the ones that are really kicking a**.","Operator","With no further questions in the queue at this time, I will now turn the call over to Mr. David Simon for closing remarks. Please proceed.","David E. Simon","Okay. Thank you, everybody, and thanks for your patience on the call, and have a good weekend.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day."],"18925":["Simon Property Group, Inc.

Sir, you may begin.","Thomas Ward - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you, Bridget. Good morning and thank you everyone for joining us today. Presenting on today's call is David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also on the call are Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; Andy Juster, Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Broadwater, Chief Accounting Officer.","Before we begin, a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com.","For prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Good morning. We had strong results to wrap up a very good year. We completed and opened several new developments and redevelopments. We successfully executed several capital market transactions, further increasing our liquidity, extending our average term, and reducing our average weighted \u2013 average interest cost, and we continued to achieve strong financial results.","Our full year 2016 FFO per diluted share was $10.49, which includes a $0.38 charge for the early redemption of our 10.35% notes. On a comparable basis, full-year FFO per share was $10.87, and increased 9% year-over-year. We once again delivered compelling FFO growth and we have achieved a compound annual FFO growth rate of more than 11% over the last three years and 13% over the last five years. The $10.87 exceeded our initial guidance range of $10.70 to $10.80, even after the impact to our FFO of the $0.08 charge we recorded in the fourth quarter due to our decision to postpone the construction of the Copley Residential Tower.","We are excellent project managers and had obtained 14 out of the 15 required approvals needed to proceed with the tower and expected to get the last one, but unfortunately, the goalpost kept moving. The change in the project approval dynamics and the uncertainty of receiving the last approval, combined with the rapidly rising construction cost and our heightened concern about supply in the Boston residential market, prompted us to postpone the project and take the charge. While write-offs of development costs can occur in the real estate business, it is rare for us to experience a charge of this size and we're not pleased about it.","For the fourth quarter, FFO of $2.53 per share includes the $0.38 per share loss on the extinguishment of debt. On a comparable basis, excluding the debt charge, but including the $0.08 charge of the Copley Residential write-off, FFO per diluted share increased 6.6% year-over-year and comparable FFO per share growth would have been 9.5% without the Copley charge.","Moving on from our results, now could be the time on the call where I could go into a lengthy philosophical discussion on the popular misconceptions about the mall business, created by the never-ending current public narrative. And I could counter that by pointing that we have 434 department stores in our portfolio, and only one is vacant, and how in the recently announced department store closing, we have only one closure in our portfolio, or how we have added more than 275 sit-down or quick-service restaurants, more than 20 entertainment concepts, and more than 80 big box tenants across our portfolio over the last four, five years, or how we've added mixed use components to our centers in the last several years, we have built 10 hotels and residents representing nearly 3,000 units, or how according to a recent survey a Generation Z members, a group that outsizes Millennials, 70% of those surveyed visit the mall at least once a month and visit more than four stores during the visit, or how the consumers still like to shop in stores, because they want to touch and feel the products before they make a final decision, or how online retail sales have grown to less than 10% of total retail sales, and that the retailers who occupy our centers represent approximately two-thirds of those total online sales, or how leading e-commerce retailers, like Warby Parker, Blue Nile, UNTUCKit, Shinola, among others, are opening physical stores, because the inherent advantage a physical location provides as well as being a natural extension to the digital world, or how basket sizes are higher, return rates are lower in stores compared to online purchases, and margins are much higher in the store than they are in the Internet, or how emerging brands like GUIDEBOAT, NIC+ZOE, Peloton, to name a few, continue to see the mall as the launch pad to build their brand awareness, as a result of the significant traffic they experience being at the mall, much like Apple or Microsoft did several years ago, or how we are making all these changes and enhancements to our center, even though Congress has tilted the scale towards e-commerce by not implementing the Marketplace Fairness Act, which not requiring the sales and use tax to be paid by consumers who buy products online, even though they are required to do so under existing laws.","But I could do that, but I won't, because we've talked about that all before, so I'd rather focus on what we do and how we do it, and that is we reinvest in our properties, making them the best centers in the respective markets. We grow our earnings, we generate excess cash flow, we pay higher dividends, and we achieve all of this while maintaining the industry's strongest balance sheet. That's our model and that's what we do for the benefit of our shareholders, our communities, and our retailers. We continue to record solid key operating metrics and grow our cash flow.","Over the last six years, we have doubled our dividend from $3.50 in 2011 to an expected payout of at least $7 this year and increased our annual cash flow after distribution by more than 20% from $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion even after having taken into the account the loss of cash flow from the spin-off of WPG.","We continue to see strong demand for space across our portfolio. Our malls and premium outlets occupancy ended the year at 96.8%, 70 basis points higher than year-end 2005 and near historic high levels. Leasing activity remains solid, the malls and premium outlet recorded leasing spreads of $7.82 per square foot, an increase of 12.7%.","In our supplement this morning, we have provided new information regarding our leasing spreads. Our new disclosure is based upon an open and closed methodology, excluding less than one year terms and captures a higher percentage of our leasing activities than our previous calculation with over 8 million square feet of annual leasing activity included.","Our base minimum rent was up to $51.59, which was up 5.4% compared to last year, reflecting strong retailer demand for our locations. Total portfolio NOI increased 6.7% or more than $380 million for the year. Comp NOI increased 3.8% for the quarter and 3.6% for the year.","Comp NOI growth was impacted by more than $30 million decline in overage rent for the year due to the lower sales volume at our tourist-oriented centers. This lower overage rent impacted our comp NOI growth by approximately 60 basis points for the year and to put this all in perspective, which we think is important. Over the last five years, our comp NOI has increased an average of 4.4% per year and our annual comp NOI has increased by $1.2 billion since 2012.","Now let's talk about reported retailer sales at our malls and outlets, were $614 per foot compared to $620 per foot in 2015. Sales per square foot for our combined malls and outlets increased in each successive months during the fourth quarter, reflecting consumers' strong interest in holiday shopping at our centers. Reported retailer sales continued to be impacted by the strong dollar at some of our tourist-oriented malls and outlets. Excluding the impact on those centers, sales per square foot was flat for the year. We are the industry leader in gift card offerings and productivity.","In 2016, we achieved record gift card sales with a 14% year-over-year comp growth. Consumer interest in our gift card program is a really good indicator of traffic to our centers. And these sales support our view that traffic was up in our centers for 2016.","Quickly on redevelopment, at the end of the fourth quarter redevelopment and expansion projects were ongoing at 29 properties across all three platforms, with our share of the net cost at approximately $1.1 billion. We completed a number of strategic developments in the fourth quarter and we'll complete a number of transformations throughout 2017, including The Galleria and La Plaza Mall, College Mall and a new development we opened two new projects in the fourth quarter, which promise to be great additions to our portfolio.","First of all, Clarksburg Premium Outlets had the strongest open of any premium outlet in a long time, shoppers swarmed the D.C. area's new premier home for outlet shopping and Brickell City Centre in Miami opened in the fourth quarter. We believe it's a landmark mixed-use development offering unparalleled shopping, dining and entertainment experience.","Construction continues on another full price development in Fort Worth at Shops at Clearfork, which is anchored by Neiman. We also have five new outlets under construction, one in Norfolk, Virginia; four in the international markets, France, South Korea, Malaysia and Canada, all scheduled to open this year. At the end of the fourth quarter, our share of investment at these six new development projects was $506 million.","Now let's talk about our fortress balance sheet, which continues to differentiate us compared to our peer group. 2016 was the first year that our annual fixed charge coverage was over 5 times.","We completed three senior note offerings during the year totaling $3.8 billion, with an average weighted coupon rate of 2.86% and weighted average term of 11.4 years. The $3.8 billion is a record amount of notes we have ever issued in a single year.","We also retired five series of senior notes comprising $1.9 billion at a weighted average coupon of 6.5%. We completed 27 mortgage loans with a weighted average interest of 3.67% and 9.4 years respectively.","Our share of these mortgages was $3 billion, another record amount in a single year for us and contrary to media reports about the inability or ability to finance malls. Our current liquidity stands at $7 billion. We also repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock for $255 million in the fourth quarter. Dividend, we have paid a record dividend in 2016 of $6.50 per share and have achieved the compound annual growth rate of 12% over the last three years. Today we announced a dividend of $1.75 per share for this quarter, a year-over-year increase of 9.4%.","As I mentioned previously, we expect to pay at least $7 per share in 2017, which will be an increase of 7.7% compared to 2016. Finally, guidance, our 2017 guidance range is $11.45 to $11.55. This range represents approximately 9% to 10% growth compared to our reported FFO per share of $10.49 in 2016 or 5.3% to 6.3% compared to our comparable FFO per share of $10.87, which, without question, will be the high end of our peer group.","Once again, our range is based on the following assumptions, comparable NOI growth for our combined mall, premium outlet and mills platform of (16:31) 3%, no plans or disposition activity, a rising interest rate environment, the impact from a continued strong U.S. dollar versus the euro and yen compared to 2016 levels, including the translation impact of our international operations and the impact on domestic spending by international tourist and a diluted share count of approximately 361 million shares.","And we're now ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I was wondering, your redevelopments, you have previously said, you think you can spend $1 billion through 2018? Does it look like if you go past that 2018 and still continue to spend that $1 billion a year?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Craig, I think the answer is most likely. Obviously, we do expect to redevelop a lot of the Seritage joint venture projects over time. And there may be other department stores. But I think, we feel reasonably good about that kind of number but we're going to also \u2013 look, I think, the most important thing that we've done for ourselves and probably I could say for the industry is we've invested in our product. We are in the physical real estate business. And by having a good product, well tenanted that looks and feels good, we think drives traffic and we think helps our retailers and our consumers. So we'll continue to invest in our projects because we know it does pay dividends literally and figuratively.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then you touched on the international shopper, I mean, is that shopper plateauing \u2013 not plateauing but leveling out, stabilizing? And should we think of 2017 increase in percentage rent relative to the amount collected in 2016?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, we're being relatively conservative. I mean it's impossible to project what's going to happen with tourism and the dollar vis-\u00e0-vis the yen or the euro or the real in terms of \u2013 down in South America, so we're taking our best estimate. Obviously, we've experienced a lot of volatility in that area. These are great assets that we want to own for the long run. But we are suffering a little bit of extra volatility. I think we did see a plateau in the fourth quarter, Craig, on that as evidenced by our sales increase in each and every month. It was below the 2015 levels, primarily because of that tourism spend, but it is starting to get a little bit better. I think you've seen a number of the luxury players announcing better results, but it's just a volatile world, volatile market and we do our very best at projecting what we think it is. And that's our number and we're kind of more cautious than anything at this point.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And our next question is from Paul Morgan with Canaccord. Your line is open.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Just on the lease spreads, you changed the reporting and I get your reason in terms of it being a bigger chunk of the activity. I mean, it still kind of shows a drop year-over-year. And I'm wondering, I mean, if you were to have reported it on a kind of the same basis, would it kind of have been comparable to the 10.9% you had last quarter and how should we think about next year?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. I figured it would \u2013 you would ask that and it would be a 11.7%. But let me take a step back, because I think this is really \u2013 so Paul, it would be a 11.7% spread, okay. That's the question to your first \u2013 that's the answer to your first question. But let me take a \u2013 let me explain to you how we think about our business. We run our business for cash flow growth, NOI growth. Okay. And the metrics spit out but we don't manage our business for metrics. So, when the market reacted to our leasing spreads, we said, well, we kind of have a feel for them, but that's not how we run the business, we run the business for cash flow growth. Obviously, that's been a pretty good strategy because we've grown our comp NOI by $1.2 billion over the last four years, five years, guys. So, that strategy that I've had about growing our cash flow and focusing on comp NOI has been pretty damn good because $1.2 billion is bigger than most REITs. I don't even know how many REITs have $1.2 billion of NOI. So, put that aside.","So, we were looking \u2013 boy, the market react to these spreads, what is it? So we did some research. And I'll give you a small example. So, we have a \u2013 because it's same space to same space is how we historically calculated our spreads. So, we're picking up, as an example, a \u2013 taking back a Forever 21 box in St. Johns mall, okay, which was, I don't know, 15,000 square feet thereabouts. We split it up into three rooms, Tesla, Apple, what was the third?","Unknown Speaker","Tory Burch.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Tory Burch. We had huge rent spreads, but because it wasn't same space to same space, for whatever strange reason, it wasn't in our numbers, okay. So we said, look, one of the goals that we're going to do to run our comp NOI is try to downsize as many of the retailers to increase their productivity and to put in as many tenants as we can and in these great malls because we'll get \u2013 we'll actually get more productivity, which could lead to higher rents. But because it wasn't same space to same space, it wasn't in our numbers. So we said, well, timeout. We've got to do this on a basis that gives you a better perspective of our strategy.","Again, we are not overwhelmed about lease spreads, and it's all about getting the best retailer in the best space at an appropriate rent. And we're going to be downsizing tenants where we can, upsizing them where we can. And if they're not that same space, it's not going to be in the spread. So we went back to 2015 and did it based on the new calculation.","We're going to be doing \u2013 we did it for 2016 in total. And I gave you the number for what it's been under the old methodology, but we think, this is better. And it will pick up the ability for us to do what we do best, which is grow our comp NOI. As I mentioned to you, that's what I focus on, that's what we \u2013 when we sit and go through the mall, we don't talk lease spreads, we talk about how we're growing the cash flow.","And we've had this discussion, we had this discussion on tenant sales one year, we had the discussion on occupancy one year, now, it's lease spreads. My friend, we focus on cash flow growth. Now that's allowed us to increase our comp NOI by $1.2 billion and increased our dividend from $3.50 to $7. I don't know, what else I can tell you.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","That was very helpful. And just a quick \u2013 a follow-up on Sears. You mentioned how you have almost no anchor vacancies in the portfolio and a little exposure to the closings that have taken place. Obviously, there is kind of speculation about maybe a larger volume at a faster pace coming back. Maybe you could just give a little bit of color on kind of how something like that might play out in terms of your portfolio even if it's maybe a longer-term positive, what would kind of be the short-term dislocation and kind of what do you think it would look like in terms of backfilling space?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, let me just \u2013 without \u2013 let me tell you why we've been able to grow our comp NOI is because we believe in our product and we invest in our product. And I think what we have seen from some in the retail world is, they're not investing in their physical stores and they're investing more online and the margins online are not what they are in the physical environment. And so, if they're not keeping up with our \u2013 the bargain that we're doing, we have \u2013 we'd love to get the space back and redevelop it. And so, we're prepared for any and all scenarios. Hopefully, they will invest in their stores, but if they don't we'd rather take them back and redevelop it. But Rick \u2013 I'll let Rick add to that as well.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","One of the things that we are doing, have been doing and will continue to do is we have a constantly updated grid on all the boxes that are interested in each of our properties and we know exactly where we can accommodate them based on the opportunities that present themselves. David mentioned in his comments, we've replaced over 80 of them in the last five years. We're ready, we've done it on a disciplined basis. All you have to do is look in our 8-K in every quarter, you're going to see all that activity, it's continuing and we are ready to do it. And in virtually every instance, where we have replaced an anchor, we've increased our sales, increased the number of reasons that people come to shop our properties and we've made good returns on our capital.","Paul Burton Morgan - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great, thanks.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","David, just related to your comments regarding managing the business for cash flow, in terms of your approach to the leasing environment today. On one of the last calls you talked about your experience with A\u00e9ro and PacSun and maybe not offering as much rent relief going forward as you did in 2016 and just letting stores closed. And so with a lot of retailers out there today talking about store closures, just wondering what your thoughts are on managing that process today and are you seeing more request for rent relief than you did a year and two years ago. Just trying to piece together the noise and versus what you're actually hearing.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. I think that it's \u2013 Christy, I think it's safe to say we're seeing more request for rent relief. And I wish there were like \u2013 we're certainly prepared to look at it as leases expire. However, we're not going to go into 2018s, 2019s and 2020s for retailer who wants to do that. And the fact of the matter is, our view of it is, a lot of times they ask and you certainly don't lose anything by asking.","So we do \u2013 we deal with it at, at least expiration and it really is a case-by-case basis. But I'll tell you a fascinating thing that I've learned at A\u00e9ro \u2013 with the A\u00e9ro investment. So and it's just the dynamic of Wall Street, retailers, chasing Internet sales, there is a whole philosophical discussion that will take too long on this call to do. But one thing at A\u00e9ro that I learned is that that management team could produce higher level of profitability, higher gross margins if they didn't have the Wall Street constraint on worrying about comp NOI or comp sales growth i.e. they could generate more cash flow because they're not worried about posting a comp sales number that's below market expectations.","Well, I'm a business guy, okay. And I kind of like cash flows. So we've got this A\u00e9ro and we're still in a turnaround and I don't really know, how it's all going to work out. But it's like the management team has been unleashed in terms of how to run their business for profitability because they have no concern about posting a comp sales number that Wall Street wants to see.","I'm not damning Wall Street, but the reality is sometimes it's okay, just to think about cash flow. And obviously, there is other metrics that people are more interested in. But we sat down and we focused on return on equity, cash flow growth, I mean, I think we'd see different dynamics from the retail community than what we have. But getting back to you, so the point is, if there is a lease action, i.e. a expiration, it's a case by case or more people are asking about it than in \u2013 than they were maybe a couple of years ago, the answer is yes. We did experience less store closures last year than we did in 2015, the way we had suggested we would, that's why our occupancy went up, but I'm not going to sugarcoat it, retail environment is not \u2013 it's not robust, it's doggy dog right now.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then, with percentage rent still trending down a lot year-over-year, I'm just wondering is that decline still only being driven by sort of the pressure from international tourist spend or is there another point of weakness there? And as you think about 2017 and your 3% store NOI growth, what impact are you expecting from any further decline in percentage rent, should we start to see that impact to be?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I'm hoping it would stabilize. The reality, it's only because of this \u2013 the strong dollar and the tourism spend. It's \u2013 we've studied it. Look, there could have been \u2013 we have \u2013 I think the other thing to keep \u2013 I mean, we have energy oriented assets, Oklahoma, Texas, we have the peso, so I mentioned the euro, I mentioned the yen, but you throw in the peso, you throw in the Canadian dollar, I love that all, again, the energy market, that all had an impact on overage. I'm hoping the energy market is a little more stable. Obviously, the dollar, the currency is going to be a volatile year. We did our best guess by \u2013 we estimate every tenant and whatever, we have a formula that does it. But I mean, it's more of an art, not a science, we'll see but that's the sole impact, it's only because of the dollar and tourism.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just one final point of clarification on the re-leasing spreads just because we get asked about it a lot. With the change in methodology, is the rent relief that you granted last year still in the calculation or no?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yes.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey, good morning.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning out there. Just a few questions here, David. First, obviously, we all read Internet, newspaper, whatever median it is and you hear all the retailers making noise. But in practicality, in your experience, you mentioned fewer store closings last year than 2015, how much sabre-rattling is there among the retailer to say hey, we're closing stores versus when you guys get in there, their talk is different?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well I think, it all depends upon what point are they in their financial equation. Look, I think \u2013 and again, this is more philosophical, but what we'd like to see from the retail community is a dedication back to improving the store environment.","We think a lot of the capital that has been put forward has been to chase Internet sales, a lot of that has been done through promotional efforts. And between that and the promotions required to get them to buy online between the cost of shipping and the returns, it's not a great model for them.","And we think it would be and we've done so much to drive traffic in our centers, we've got decks that all these retailers, we've sent out to them. We did a couple of tests in middle market malls about what we can do, we put an ice skating rink, we did concerts, we've done so much to drive traffic to the mall, to the store. We think, if they could pivot somewhat, it would do everybody a world of good.","And at the end of the day, it is more profitable for them by and large, I'm sure there is a retailer here or there that would argue this. But it is much more profitable for them to have that transaction happen at the store, okay. And I just think there needs to be a pivot back towards that. And then I think it would be better for everybody's business.","With that said, I mean there is a lot of noise, we're going to have to kind of go through the noise, I won't tell you though, Alex. I mean, the business is \u2013 we're growing now, we're pros at grinding, nobody does it better, nobody has ended up at the end of that grinding in a better spot than we have. We've done some of our best work in those grinding moments. We've got the group and the management team and the personnel. We don't have turnover, where Midwestern roll up your sleeves folks and it's not as much fun but we get the job done.","I mean look at our balance sheet, $7 billion of liquidity, a 5.0% no floating rate debt, we did the most financing ever last year, so we got to deal with it. Don't really know how it will all shake out while we've been relatively conservative on our comp NOI, but that's not to say we don't have work to do to achieve that. Because I don't want to sugarcoat anything here, I mean we're in a \u2013 the retailer have to pivot in my humble opinion, what do I know, but in my humble opinion, they need to pivot a little bit and we're trying to encourage them to do that, but we'll see if we have any success in that. You know what I'm saying, Alex?","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. No, absolutely, I don't think anyone would ever say that you sugarcoat stuff. So, no I think it's clear. More to that point, though, the department stores seem to get a lot of headlines when they announced \u2013 Macy's announced (38:45) et cetera. You guys mentioned 80 boxes backfilled and that you have plans for basically all of them.","Do you think that there is an ability to see just acceleration of conversion of department stores or based on supply and demand you actually don't want that many back at any one time, the pace that we're seeing right now, whether it be a Seritage or Macy's or whoever the department store chain is, the current pace that we're all seeing is actually the right pace to maximize supply and demand or do you think that you can increase that to get at more?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Alex, this is Rick. First, let me underline one point, which is we've analyzed all of our department stores. We know their sales, we know their occupancy cost, we know their market position. And these stores have \u2013 witness the fact that of all the closures that have taken place, virtually none have been in our portfolio and that's because the productivity of these stores in our portfolio and the profitability of these stores is in the higher quartiles of all of these operating fleets. That said, we are ready to take them back should the opportunity present itself, where we can make money and do it on a cost effective basis.","We know what we will do with these stores if we get the opportunity. We are, in fact, marketing them now and going ahead with redevelopment plan. So we know we've got tenants lined up and what we would to do stores if they become available.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay, Rick. Thank you. Thanks, David.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","And our next question is from Jeremy Metz with UBS. Your line is open.","Jeremy Metz - UBS","Hey. Good morning out there.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Good morning.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","It's out here. We are out here.","Jeremy Metz - UBS","As you've got more of these anchor boxes back, F&B has played an increasing role (40:53) in terms of some of the re-tenanting of those spaces. I was wondering can you talk strategically about your desire to add more F&B. How do you weigh the credit risk versus doing more traditional in line, maybe just framing out how much of the portfolio is F&B today versus where you see it growing?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well I would say \u2013 yeah, one of the best things that we've done, we \u2013 the industry has done is add a lot better restaurants over the last five years. And I think, we've added, what, 275 was the number over the last five years. So we think, that's a trend to continue. We think one of the best things that we've seen in terms of our entrepreneurial focus has been on the F&B side and not only that, but also on the entertainment side. Like what we're doing at Clearfork, what we've done with some of the mills boxes. I think, that's a trend, I don't have the exact percent that we've increased it from X to Y. We can get that for you, I don't have in front of me. But it's clearly been a meaningful increase. And we do think, as some of these like Seritage joint ventures and even if we get some of the other department store boxes back, part of that will be to add F&B, to add entertainment. But also and I said a lot in my remarks and I'm not very eloquent, so I stumble over most of my words, but I mean we did add 3,000 units. I actually had us double-check that because I said, let's add that in our text, between apartments and hotels keys, we added three units over the last few years.","So we do think, it's also, we know we failed at Copley and I'm not happy about that, is a mea culpa there. But the fact is we've added 3,000 units, which is not all profitable other than the Copley experience. And we think, a lot of that, that this stuff will be mixed use, as well. So it will be probably generally away from just pure apparel. If you see what we're doing in McAllen, when we took the Sears box down, we are adding like traditional retail, but the front of that will be five \u2013 is it four or five restaurants?","Unknown Speaker","Five restaurants.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Five restaurants kind of front of the mall there. So I think that's going to be an absolute \u2013 continue a trend and we're seeing more and more exciting concepts like \u2013 look, Shake Shack came out of nowhere four, five years ago, great operator, great company, great people to do business with. But we're seeing more and more of that creativity coming in that whole category.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","And, Jeremy, let me just say, it's not only just adding restaurants, but I encourage you to go out and visit the Westchester and Roosevelt Field and King of Prussia, and look how we are transforming the environment in which these food operators are conducting business in our properties; greatly enhanced seating areas, entertainment areas, play areas, you name it. So with a much more sophisticated environment, which we know will extend the stay of our shopper and attract a more affluent shopper, because they are more inclined to spend time in the environments we're creating.","Jeremy Metz - UBS","Appreciate it. And would that include adding grocery stores at any point?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure. I mean, we added Wegmans recently. We're under construction with 365, which is a Whole Foods product, and there is a bunch of other activities in that whole area. So we think that's a nice mix to add to.","Jeremy Metz - UBS","Appreciate that. And if I could ask one more. I mean, in the opening remarks you mentioned no dispositions in 2017. Just given some of the commentary about the increased pressure in retailers, there is a secular change we are seeing in shopping online. Does this alter your view at all on the appropriate size of the portfolio long-term and strategically make you think about possibly considering for any more assets from you?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Look, I think we've always shown that we've \u2013 we'll prune. So, it is very likely that we'll sell additional assets throughout the year. But we're not \u2013 I do not believe in selling. You have to understand, I'm maybe a little bit different. But I look at the present value of the cash flow stream first when I decide whether we should sell or not. Obviously, we think the mall or the asset's going away, then that present value, you can get a \u2013 if you can get it for \u2013 you can get a little premium to the present value of that stream, it can go away.","But we don't sell assets, because of my help or sales per square foot go up or down. I look at cash flow. That's worked for us, because \u2013 I mean, look at our balance sheet, look at our NOI growth, look at any metric you want to compare us against, nobody in this industry has done that. So that kind of strategy has worked, but we still have assets that probably don't fit in our long-term view point and if we can make a decent trade, we will. But we're not going to be \u2013 we're not going to give away stuff just because we think it might help our metrics.","Jeremy Metz - UBS","I appreciate the color. Thanks.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Just, David, I guess, I'm curious to build on your earlier remarks. What's the catalyst that you think is needed to allow retailers to make that pivot? Does it require more privatization of retailers, like you've done with A\u00e9ro? Is it we need e-commerce sales to slow, so that refocuses Wall Street maybe on profits? I'm just curious how that never-ending narrative converges maybe with the perspective of the mall owners, because it is a wide chasm and it \u2013 I'm curious what your perspective is.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I think it takes leadership and courage. And I think they have to believe in the product that they are selling, and if you believe in the product, then you should invest in the product. And if you are a physical retailer, then your product is stores. And if you believe in the store model, you should invest in the stores. Just like we're in the mall business, we believe in the malls, we're going to invest in the malls, and it takes leadership. It's contrary to what Wall Street wants, because they want Internet sales and, I don't know, maybe Wall Street is right. But I think it is very easy to shop on the Internet. So, if you don't have a good looking physical store and good looking service, quality service, and if you don't have inventory in the store and you're promoting more online than going to the store, in my humble opinion \u2013 I don't know a lot, but in my humble opinion, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. So I would like a little bit more conviction in what they do.","Let's talk about the casino business. You could say the gaming could all go online. But if you're Steve Wynn, you build the best product, you have the best service, and lo and behold, people show up, they gain, they participate, they stay there, and he gets great returns on equity. He has got unbelievable conviction and he puts his money where his mouth is. We need that in our business. What's hurt our business in retail, frankly, is that there has been too many leverage buyouts with too much debt, and we all know no matter how good a retailer you are, you're going to run into ebbs and flows. And lo and behold, when you run into that scenario, you've got a balance sheet that can't withstand it. I can't tell you how much pressure is because of that as opposed to because of the Internet. We can go chapter and verse, and what that also does means they don't invest in the stores.","So there needs to be a complete shift. I don't have any influence with how they think and how they operate, but we have conviction in our business. We're going to invest in our product and we're going to drive traffic to our malls. And that's everything that we do. So you're going to see that from our stand. We're not going to starve our malls. We're not going to starve our marketing. We're not going to starve our personnel. We're going to try to be as efficient. We're going to look for return on investment to be as high as possible. But at the end of the day, we believe in our product, we have conviction in it, and we're going to invest in. And that's not to say the internet doesn't play a very important role. And we've all talked about the omni-channel and the seamless and this, that and the other, but my friends, it's more profitable to get the consumer to shop in your store. That's what we'd like to see a little bit more of.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And when you talked to the leaders at other retailers and your tenants, I mean, do you find that there is broad conviction of what the end game looks like for them, that mix they want between online and store based or is that still being felt out and that's really kind of the root of this uncertainty, the never-ending narrative?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I think it's a lot more uncertainty than it should be.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And I'm just curious because you mentioned...","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","In a sense, we're at their mercy, but we've been at their mercy before, but we'll figure a way to deal with it. I mean, that's what we do.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Has the way you asses tenant risk changed at all? Because like you kind of referenced is that transition to maybe more of an e-commerce or omni-channel platform is putting a lot of stress on these guys. So you could have a great experience for the retailers in your properties, but chain-wide they could be having issues, because of debt or other issues. Have you guys changed how you assess tenant health for people you sort of select for your properties?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, we haven't \u2013 I mean, we're very \u2013 we're probably as conservative about tenant improvement or tenant allowance, given the balance sheet and for long-term than anybody. But I don't think that's changed. I mean, we have a great credit department. They do an analysis and we listen to them. That's not to say we won't experiment here or there, throw some spaghetti against the wall. But, no, I don't think that \u2013 I don't think, Jeff, that's changed at all in terms of how we'll underwrite that.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And I'm curious just on the share repurchase. Off-hand, do you know how much capacity you have remaining under your authorization? And, I guess, how are you thinking about future repurchases?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","$1.4 billion \u2013 look, I think we'll continue to do that, given kind of where the world is. Obviously, until you do our earnings, we -- there are some restrictions on that, I won't bore you with that. Look, we believe in that, but on the other hand, I think you've just got to be thoughtful about how you do this. I do think \u2013 I've seen retailers run into problems, because they brought stock back, because that's what they thought Wall Street wanted. And, again they did it. They did it because \u2013 and they did it \u2013 they didn't invest in their stores, because of that in some cases.","And again, I'm not trying to be overly critical. I'm just \u2013 we've got to \u2013 our industry has to invest in its product, just like Amazon. What a great company. But, are they making investments? You betcha, in more ways than I can even keep track of. If we don't have that same conviction, or any industry, -- look at the drug companies. They invest in R&D for this drug. It's not that complicated. We don't invest in the physical product. We got no shot, and so you got to be careful. You can't buy so much stock back, and we've seen a little bit on the retail side that at the end of the day take the capital away from investing in your product. And so, we'll do it kind of like \u2013 I think we -- what did I say, we had $1.4 billion left. So we'll continue to take advantage of market imperfections.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's great. Thanks, guys.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Yes, good morning, everyone. David, you guys have a track record of kind of consistently beating your initial guidance, and I was looking for signs in your commentary about if guidance could be conservative in any way. You did mention that you might possibly have conservative same store NOI guidance for 2017. And I was just kind of curious why the conservatism and where could the potential upside come from.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I think I outlined it in my talk, which was basically, first of all, Tayo, as you know, our FFO per share is higher than anybody in our peer group that I know of. If there is somebody in the retail that's \u2013 real estate that's got a better per share FFO growth, I would like to know it, but I've looked at all, everybody's numbers and I don't think anybody is out there. But put that aside, we are a large \u2013 and we are, obviously, the largest company in that space. So that puts even more pressure on a per share number than if you are a smaller company.","But put that aside, I mean it's basically translation. Why are we being conservative? Translation, the retail world is squishy. We have the potential on the stronger dollar based upon what all of the stuff that's going on out there. And we think we are projecting in our numbers the highest \u2013 higher. We have very \u2013 not a lot of floating rate debt, but we do have debt that matures and stuff that we refinance it, and then our floating rate debt is the lowest in the industry, again. Right, Andy?","Andrew A. Juster - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Right.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","So it's about 6%, less than that?","Andrew A. Juster - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Right, 5%.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","5%, see, I'm always more conservative. 6% \u2013 5%, so we're projecting a higher rate environment, we've got translation, strong dollar, we've got the impact on tourism, and a squishy retail world and that's our number. I mean, we've always beaten in the last \u2013 I don't even remember the last time we missed our numbers. I mean, does anybody here in this room know? It's a long time, it was \u2013 Rick was -","Andrew A. Juster - Simon Property Group, Inc.","In 42 of the last 44 quarters (58:39).","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Okay. All right. So it's been a long time. I mean, over 10 or 11 years, that's a pretty damn good streak. I think Rick was 35 back then. The number is the number.","Unknown Speaker","In diapers.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Got you. Then one more for me, if you could indulge me. Just in regards to the share repurchases, again, you guys have authorization for up to $2 billion. You've done about $600 million so far. Did a decent amount in fourth quarter, but doesn't seem like you have any share repurchases built into the 2017 guidance. Just kind of curious why not and kind of what decision process you go through to determine when it's best to kind of execute with the share repurchase program.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, we want to take advantage of any market volatility and we're going to be conservative on it as well, and I explained to you, I think the most important thing for us to do is invest in our product. But the simple way to look at is we were planning this big Copley investment. It doesn't look like it's going to be, so I'm kind of thinking like, okay, let's reallocate that within reason towards share repurchase, because now we are not going to need the capital to build this tower, but at the same time, I've been more philosophical than I normally want to be on these. We're going to invest in our product. So it \u2013 we expect to do it over a period of time. It's hard to pinpoint exactly the number, so we think it's better just to tell you what the reality of our guidance is at this particular moment.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Got you. All right. Thank you very much.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah, no worries. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Hey, good morning\/afternoon, everyone. Just wanted to ask a question. Sandeep on the GGP call earlier today talked about an increasing \u2013 tenants being more agnostic today about the type of retail that they're located in and more focused on just the overall quality. I am just curious if you guys share that sentiment and if so, how that is or may change the dynamic between your conversations with traditional mall guys that may be looking to go out of mall and vice versa, traditionally non-mall tenants that may be looking to get into the mall?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, certainly, I agree with that statement. But we've been a retail real estate company since we went public, as we've had a very diverse retail portfolio. We started with malls and community centers. We ended up participating in The Mills product. We ended up, obviously, participating in the outlet product. We spun-off the strip center business, the small mall business. So we think we have very deep relationships with all the retailers and we always have thought of our company as a retail real estate company, if you go back, from the get go. But I agree 100% with Sandeep's comments that \u2013 and that's why I do think the product, whether it's an outlet or a mall or a big power center, retailers are going to gravitate towards the best location with the most critical mass.","And we do think that that \u2013 if, in fact, we do get some of these department stores back, we're probably going to have the ability, we're probably going to have some supply that will allow us to bring \u2013 create more critical mass with more diverse uses, and I think that will very much compete effectively with other products around the mall environment. We all know how retail has evolved. I mean, the mall location has always more or less been the central hub of retail in that community. So the fact that we're going to get potentially some of these department stores back, I do think that \u2013 and the critical mass is already a real advantage to the mall, that should bode well to increase the uses.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","And I will tell you that we have already been in conversation with a number of retailers, whose predominant footprint is in power centers, and they are very anxious to come into our properties. The only constraint, as David has said, is being in a position to afford them enough square footage that meets their requirements with parking and visibility from the street, well, that's what all these department store boxes provide. And frankly, I alluded earlier to all of our conversations about redeploying these boxes. A lot of those conversations are being had with retailers that are now predominately in community and power centers.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We did an analysis, I won't name a name, but a well-known retailer, big retailer. I think we have 30 leases with them, and given where their rents are, we felt like we would only have to lease four boxes, four out of the thirty, to replicate the income stream. And I don't want to sit and name retailers and who knows whether we'll get those back.","But, I mean, that's the opportunity. So you've got 30 leases, but they were done a gazillion years ago, and the quick and dirty analysis that we had is we had to lease four boxes to replicate that income stream. So the rest of the 26 or thereabouts, don't hold me exactly to these numbers, but it gives you the order of magnitude, that's exactly kind of the potential upside that we have, and now if in fact we get those leases back, we're going to have more product available, but we're also going to have, I think, great opportunities to increase our income stream.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks for that, and maybe just going back to A\u00e9ro. You sounded pretty positive on the ability of the management team to unleash some additional cash flow now. I was just curious if you could share some of the things that they're doing differently today than they were prior to the bankruptcy in terms of sourcing or merchandising or branding or even the price points that they are targeting.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I mean, they're doing all of that. I'd just say the simple thing is they're focused on \u2013 it's a different mindset. It's a more efficient company. It's a smaller company. It's more focused on gross margin, and it's got better relationships with its suppliers and they don't have to chase, unless you guys make us report what their comp sales are. But since it's a completely immaterial investment from us, don't expect me to provide it to you. We're focused on cash flow, which is liberating to that team, and frankly, liberating to us and the partners and I mean, it's great. It's interesting. We're learning a lot. We've still got ways to go. It's never easy to take a company out of bankruptcy, but we've got a shot at doing it.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And just last question on the FX headwinds that you mentioned that are embedded in guidance. Is there any quantification you can provide in terms of FFO per share impact or maybe just what you're assuming for yen and euro for the year?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I mean, obviously, we have, but I would focus on $11.55 times 361 million shares, which gives you our total FFO close to \u2013 what?","Andrew A. Juster - Simon Property Group, Inc.","$4.2 billion.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","$4.2 billion. Within that $4.2 billion of earnings, there is always going to be $100 million, thereabouts. I mean, we are a big company. I mean, I could give it to you, I have it here, but it would bore you. You don't need it.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Well, thanks.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, don't worry about it, we'll do our best.","Operator","And our next question is from Carol Kemple with Hilliard, Lyons. Your line is open.","Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons LLC","Good afternoon. It sounds like your investment in A\u00e9ropostale has been a very educational and rewarding experience for you all. How is your appetite for doing a similar investment in the future?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, given how the market reacted to the A\u00e9ro deal, it's probably not high on the list. But I don't know, look, I think we've got to prove to ourselves that what we're doing there we're going to be able to accomplish. So, I would never rule anything in or out. It's not high on the list, so.","Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons LLC","Okay. It'd probably be several years down the road.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","It's just not high on the list.","Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons LLC","Okay. And then in the quarter, your G&A expense was up a little bit from last year and from the third quarter.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons LLC","Was there anything one-time?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yes, there was. Our General Counsel retired, as you're aware, and so basically the pop is also associated with that retirement.","Carol L. Kemple - J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. I know we're over an hour, so I'll just try to be quick with two here. The first was in terms of The Limited, there one of the retailers that we've heard are going to be closing stores and we counted about 75 in your portfolio back in December. So, I was wondering if you could comment on your plans and any progress so far in backfilling that space.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. Obviously, that has been on the horizon for a while. We have been actively leasing their spaces there across our platforms and we've already got a significant number of those spaces, where we are processing leases and our proposals out to a lot of tenants. And we will deal with it just like we've dealt with all the others that have come down the pike and the ones that will come down the pike tomorrow. The best defense to all of these things is having great properties. And as David's been articulating, we're spending the money to have great properties. And when you have great properties, you have demand, and the downside is just the downtime while we replace them.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And then in the prepared remarks earlier you guys touched on the gift card sales and traffic being generally up, and that being a good indicator. I'm just wondering since we get asked, is that how you judge traffic, by the gift card sales or is it by a number of things meshed together?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, we have traffic counters in a handful of malls that supports that statement. We also have parking counters in all of our outlet business, which I think was up 1.5%. Right, guys? So it's a combination of what we have invested in the mall \u2013 in the mall thing with basically our camera technology and then the traffic parking counters in our outlet business.","Unknown Speaker","And just a quick follow-up on that, up 1.5% in the outlet, was that for the year?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yes.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thanks.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And our next question is from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good afternoon. Just two quick questions here. First of all, on how you're classifying the same-store pool, I think it changed to comparable for the period compared to at the beginning of the period for past quarters. Is my understanding correct? And if so, is that so you can sort of better capture redevelopment, development projects that might be included in the same-store pool that come on during the course of the year, but might not have been there at the beginning of the year?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","No. It comes in the year that is after a year, so it comes in that quarter after a year, so it's not a change at all.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So no change in how you're reporting the same-store pool?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Correct. I mean, that pool changes, because if it's been open a year, it goes into that pool.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","No, no, no, I get that.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","But \u2013 yeah, no, no, no.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then just maybe more specifically Bangor Mall, I recognize that was a property with Macy's in it. I did notice it was classified under other properties, whereas previously it was malls. Any sort of thoughts as to if that's meaningful or how we should think about that?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Extremely immaterial. Our FFO contribution from Bangor Mall is $1 million out of $4.2 billion.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I recognize it's immaterial. I was just wondering, it moved to other properties, at least from a CMBS perspective, is that...?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","It's immaterial.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks. Just wondering, are there any updates on the Kl\u00e9pierre stake that we should be thinking about or how the McArthurGlen investments are progressing?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Generally, the business on both fronts is decent. Kl\u00e9pierre reports next week, so I can't add much more than that, and McArthurGlen has been a terrific investment for us. We open a big mall in Provence in April. And it's actually gone better than we anticipated and a great partnership.","Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay, that was it. Thanks.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum with Boenning & Scattergood. Your line is open.","Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning or good afternoon, I guess, we've just passed the 12:00 hour. Quick question, David or Rick, you mentioned 434 department stores today, one vacancy. How many department stores in five years' time do you expect to have in your portfolio?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","You want a number? It would be just a guess. I mean, my guess, it will be \u2013 if I have to guess, I don't know, maybe \u2013 it really depends on the one big guy out there, so I can't \u2013 I don't want to guess. It will be less than that, but I don't want to put a number on it.","Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Is there potential where we could see maybe a halving of that or 40% reduction of that, in your view?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","No. No, no, no way, no way, no way.","Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Okay.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I don't see it. No, I don't see that.","Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","And then maybe a related question, your $278 million investment in Hudson's Bay, what are the plans for that and is that company mulling a potential IPO similar to Seritage?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I mean, it's always the possibility. I don't think it's been a huge focus at this point. The investment's going according to what we thought it would be. We're looking to grow that partnership with some redevelopment of that portfolio and potentially some other transactions. But at this point pretty stable.","Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Great. And then last maybe, but not least, you mentioned there is a weighing in your capital allocation between buying back your stock and investing in your real estate and always trying to maintain a healthy investment in your real estate. Do you have sort of a target of how you think about that per annum, in terms of reinvestment versus the obvious attraction of buying back your own stock right now?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, look, I think the investments that we make at this point are extremely accretive, because the redevelopment, new development I think on average is 8-plus percent. So, that's had a multiple that is lower than buying our stock back. And, obviously, as you know, we've always \u2013 the most important thing we can do besides that is have a balance sheet that can withstand whatever craziness that maybe out there.","So \u2013 and those are the two priorities. And then as well \u2013 and then frankly, we'll dabble in the other one when the markets \u2013 when we're out of favor and the market, for whatever reason, doesn't believe in our product, we'll try to add to that. But we still have a number of accretive investments. We're at 8% plus and we want \u2013 we, obviously, want a balance sheet that continues to \u2013 I would not look \u2013 I would not overlook the fact that our coverage is 5.0. I mean, I know people rather talk about leasing spreads, but that's something to mention.","Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Agreed. It's very few of your peers have that.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yes. But we'll dabble, but it's not going to be a priority.","Floris van Dijkum - Boenning & Scattergood, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you, Floris. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Adornato with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Paul Edward Adornato - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. Just a follow-up in terms of capital allocation, could you comment on tenant allowances in new leases? What should we expect going forward? Is that you're at the point at which you have some leverage over their capital allocation in their space?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","The TA has been very constant year-over-year and it's right in line. It's right around $40 a foot, and that's what it's been for the new leases.","Paul Edward Adornato - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, great. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Just had a related question to that. You talked a lot about reinvesting in the malls. So, besides redevelopment towers, should we just longer term expect to maybe a change or increase in operational CapEx overall? And then maybe you could talk about how that differs for different quality mall spectrum.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I don't think, Simon. I think we've been pretty active. We still have \u2013 we're about to start on a major redo of Boca Town Center, this \u2013 once we get all the permits. We've done a lot of work. I mean, the good thing about what we've done is, once we kind of felt like the world \u2013 we had a big pike, we had 2008-2009 hit. We chased a couple of deals. We got a couple, but we didn't get everything, and in 2009, at the end in 2010, we've been very active on redevelopment. In fact, we've done a lot of good stuff. So we still have a lot to do, but we've done a vast majority. So I don't think there's going to be this significant change. But we have got to invest in the product. We will continue to do so. Certainly we still have a reasonably stable economy. And let's also put in perspective about everything, and the economy grew, the GDP was 1.6%. So if you take out 1% of inflation or thereabouts, I mean, that's pretty pathetic. So we're holding our own in a very, very non-real growth environment.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And just a quick one. There is some volatility or decreases in management fees and operating costs. Any comments around that?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah, it's all related to WPG and losing those management contracts.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, guys.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And our next question is from Linda Tsai with Barclays. Your line is open.","Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, hi. There was a Journal article not long ago discussing how Washington Prime has Amazon Lockers in 50 of its centers. Do you have any of these in your malls, and if so, has it shown to be an additional traffic driver or a source of conversion at the other stores?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We do not and better luck for them, to answer that.","Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And our last question is from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. It's Michael Bilerman with Christy, and thanks for staying through lunch time. David, in your opening remarks and the list of things you said you were not going to talk about, but you talked about, you mentioned Main Street Fairness, and I'm curious where things stand with the administration on trying to get that through. And at the same time, how much time you're spending with your retailers on border adjustability and how that could impact them, and is this the year in terms of how all the stuff will unfold?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, listen, on Marketplace Fairness Act, I don't think it's an administration issue. It's really a Congress issue. The Senate's ready to go. What I gather, the administrations understand it. It's really being held up by the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He's actually had \u2013 his district has actually come under \u2013 had some tough retail news that's come out of his district. Frankly, I don't understand it. I don't get why there has been no progress there, but I don't believe it to be an administration issue. It's really just one committee in Congress that's sitting on it, and it's a travesty. And we've all lobbied, but \u2013 I mean, it needs to change. It's just not fair. And if anything, the government should be about fairness and not picking winners and losers. At the end of the day if the consumer wants to shop online as opposed to bricks and mortar, that's life in the fast line, but they shouldn't choose that because they can save sales and use tax that they already own. And I mean it's a sad state of affairs that hasn't been done.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Well, I guess if we have a new President that's focused on jobs and if online is stealing sales away from bricks and mortar, that's affecting profitability of some of them, one would imagine that's a job issue.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, yeah and not only that, but what the courts \u2013 there is a number of states that are going to basically overturn the Supreme Court decision anyway, in our opinion. So it's just \u2013 they are taking it out of Congress' hands and it's just going to end up in litigation in every state, and it's silliness. It ought to be done, but \u2013 I mean, I don't know what else to tell you.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","You also mentioned gift card sales as a predictor. How much of the gift card sales are coming back and being spent in Simon Malls? And are you able to determine what that activity, where \u2013 what type of retailers is it going towards in terms of the people who are actually using the cards?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We actually can't keep track of it. But I think in \u2013 we think, just anecdotally, that there is a good percentage of that, very high percentage.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then just lastly, we've seen a number of retail locations bring in the Amazon Lockers. And I'm curious more so on the logistics companies and I don't know if you listened to UPS' call this morning, but the fourth quarter they saw 10.5% increase in deliveries to residential homes, which was the largest increase that they've seen in 10 years, and that they are wrestling with how to deal with that volume of packages that are needed to go. I'm just curious if you've had conversations with the FedExs and the UPSs of the world to leverage the significant amount of parking field (1:26:55) that you have for that last mile delivery, if perhaps retailers are shipping from store, doing other things, where you create a little bit more of a vertical perspective.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I mean, look, we've invested in Deliv, which basically is \u2013 the mall group is basically invested in that. There is couple of other concepts out there that we're looking at clearly. We do think shipping from store, picking \u2013 delivery or pickup at the stores is all very important and the mall, we think, will play a big role in that. But, again, we think lot of the online activity, on the research that we've done, one of the highest things is price and saving the sales tax. And that equalizes and we do think a lot of retailers are promoting a lot more to get online business than they are in the physical world. I mean, all that can balance out pretty quickly. We'll have to see.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Right. I guess, is there a probability you put on Main Street Fairness this year or (1:28:14)?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Honestly, I don't understand it. It's the most frustrated thing we've had to deal with. You've got jobs at risk. You've got \u2013 it's not fair. You're going to have Congressmen in certain districts where retail facilities close, because of it potentially. You're going to have less sales revenue in those states, in those jurisdictions. It is one of the most confounding things I have ever seen. The courts are going to take it out of Congress' hand, and it makes no sense to me and I'm hopeful the administration knows that. But I don't think their \u2013 I don't think this is their issue. I mean, I think it's stuck in one particular area of Congress and it makes no sense to me.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Right. But one would hope the administration potentially can use blunt force and some other things (1:29:26).","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I can't comment on that other than, obviously, I'm encouraged by the focus generally on business being part of the equation to get this economy growing. That to me has been very encouraging to see. What can we all do to make this economy grow better and faster. And I \u2013 that to me has been encouraging.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Okay. Thanks for the time, David.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Okay. I think, operator, I think that's it, right?","Operator","That is all the questions. Yes, sir.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","All right. Thank you.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com.","For our prepared remarks, I\u2019m pleased to introduce David Simon.","David Simon","Good morning. We\u2019re pleased to report another record quarter with operating and financial results. Demand from tenants from space in our highly productive centers is increasing. We continue to redevelop our irreplaceable real estate with new exciting dynamic ways to live work, plays, stay and shop that will further enhance the customer experience.","We continued identifying new unique and strategic development opportunities globally that will extend our geographic reach and create a new generation of world-class destinations on a accretive basis.","And let me turn to results, which were highlighted by funds from operation FFO of $1.0 6 billion or $2.98 per share, an increase of 20.6% compared to the prior year. We continue to grow our cash flow and report solid key operating metrics.","Total portfolio NOI increased four 4.5% or approximately $135 million year-to-date. Comp NOI increased 2.3% for the year-to-date period. Leasing activity remains solid and continues to improve. Average base rent was $53.84, up 3.3% compared to last year. The mall and Premium Outlets recorded leasing spreads of $7.32 per square foot, and an increase of 10.7%.","We're pleased to announce that retail sales momentum continue to pick up in the second quarter. Reported retailer sales per square foot for malls and outlets was $646 per foot compared to $618 million in the prior year period, an increase of 4.6%, which is a large increase - largest actually over the last four years.","Retail sales were strong across the portfolio with sales productivity increasing each month throughout the quarter. Our mall - Premium Outlets occupancy ended the quarter at 94.7%, an increase of 10 basis points compared to the occupancy at the end of the quarter this year. Importantly on an NOI awaited basis our operating metrics were as follows.","Reported retail sales on an NOI awaited basis is 813 compared to 646. Occupancy is 95.6% compared to 94.7%. Average base minimum rent is $70.70 cents - $70.77 compared to $53.84.","Turning to a new development, we opened the Premium Outlet collection in Edmonton, Canada making our fourth outlet center in Canada. It's a terrific opening. It's the only outlet center in Edmonton and so far locals and tourists have really appreciated the new project.","Construction continues on several additional new outlets. Denver, Colorado which will open in September, Queretaro, Mexico, which will open in December, Malaga, Spain will open in the spring of \u201919. During the quarter, we also announced a new joint venture with Siam Piwat, a world class retail and real estate developer to bring our internationally renowned Premium Outlet experience to Thailand.","This will be our first outlet in Thailand adding to our already successful joint ventures in Japan, Korea and Malaysia. Our centre in Bangkok is projected to begin construction later this year and will be a destination of choice for the 50 million metro area locals and obviously the country's very strong tourism with over 32 million visitors per year.","At the end of the second quarter redevelopment expansions were all ongoing across all of our platforms in the U.S., internationally just to name a few, we're expanding in Vancouver, in Canada, Ashford, in the - outside of London, as well as our big transformations with Brea, Ross Park, King of Prussia, many more in the works.","Capital markets, obviously our balance sheet continues to be industry leading. Our net debt to EBITDA was 5.4 times well below our peer group. Fixed interest coverage was 5 times. We only have 5% of our debt is variable rate. We refinanced approximately $2.4 billion of mortgage debt. Our share of that being 850 and an average rate of 3.98% and term of 8.9 years.","Our current liquidity is $7 billion and we repurchased 514,000 shares during the quarter for approximately $80 million. We also announced our dividend this quarter of $2 per share, an increase over of 11.1% year-over-year. We will pay at least $7.90 per share and dividends, an increase of more than 10% compared to the $7.15 [ph] paid last year and sometime \u2013 and sometime next year we will have paid $100 per share in dividends, $100 per share of dividends throughout our public history.","Finally, we're just pleased with the Supreme Court's decision. As you know, we were been very vocal about it and we do think this will help level the playing field between physical retailers and online and hopefully the communities that those physical retailers and those properties serve.","Guidance, we raised our full year guidance from $12.05 to $12.13 per share. This is an increase of $0.09 from our original prior guidance and represents 7.5% to 8.2% growth compared to our FFO of 11.21 per share for 2017.","Finally, I would just like to say it was a very good quarter and we continue to grow our cash flow with our good earnings momentum. We're ready for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you. Good morning, good morning out there.","David Simon","Good morning.","Alexander Goldfarb","Yeah. So my first question is, I don't think you talked about the big jump in other income, but in aggregate, if you could just talk about what the drivers were in there. And then also what your thoughts are on the impact of the change in internal leasing costs to 2019? Some of the other companies are starting to provide some estimate, so that the analyst can through up their numbers for 2019?","David Simon","Yes. The jump in other income was basically a gain in converting our Aero, IPCO investment into shares, out Authentic Brands Group and that number was offset by a significant decrease in lease settlement income. When you net the two it's essentially a positive $25 million, roughly.","The good news on that Alex is, I know there were a lot of naysayers on the Aero deal, were way in the money. We've already converted into a significant profit and Authentic Brands Group is a great company. We're a shareholder of around 6% roughly and we continue to think that company will do great things and it's great to be a partner associated with Jamie Salter and his team, as well as Lion Capital, General Atlantic and Leonard Green.","Obviously, you know, a very high level, as well as General Growth frankly, a very high level group of shareholders that will continue to accumulate brands and present opportunities for us. And then obviously we had a pretty significant decrease in lease settlement income. If you go quarter-over-quarter.","And on the leasing you know, we're still finalizing it, but it'll be under 1%, under 1% of our you know, of our run $12 plus. So I hope - I know you're smart and I hope you can do that math.","Alexander Goldfarb","I have back up just in case. The next question is you know, lot of headlines recently over Tesla them asking for cash back from their suppliers. Clearly it's been a big driver of mall traffic. So can you just talk a little bit about your thoughts on Tesla?","And then also just what we heard last week from some of the other retail companies, it sounds like the pace of backfilling space had increased. So maybe if you could just combine those, how you're thinking about the pace of backfilling tenants?","David Simon","Yeah. Just - Tesla is a great company, a great product, no concerns. I'll let Rick talk about retailer demand. And you know, I would say we feel pretty good. But let Rick add to that.","Rick Sokolov","In fact, it is accelerating and there is increasing interest you saw in our filings. We've done a lot of new leasing. Again, I won't incur David's wrath by listing all the tenants that we're doing business with. But there are a lot of them. We came out of our meetings with a significant number of open device across a broad swap of tenants. And as I said before, they are coming from e-tailers, international, existing tenants and brand extensions from our existing tenants, along with new tenants. And that is feeding our pipeline and I think you're seeing that as you walk our property.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Berman","Hey. It's Michael Berman here with Christine. Happy Monday. David you included a new slide in the supplemental slide 28 on the development activity summary, where you sort of broke down the share of net cost of the [indiscernible] in the quarter pipeline between the platform, and then redev and dev.","I'm wondering how you think about that densification piece of 15% today. But really each of the slices how you think that's going to evolve over the next few years, given you have a lot of projects in the pipeline that are not yet sort of in the activity summary, how you think that\u2019s - this is going to evolve both in terms of total size, in terms of cost, how that [indiscernible] in a quarter move and then the share between each of the slices?","David Simon","Yeah. I mean, I can only - I can only answer you know in big picture terms, because as you know, we only put this - we don't our development type like you know like the European companies do. But\u2026","Michael Berman","Shadow of the shadow of the shadow\u2026","David Simon","Yeah. If we did - if we did though, the general number would be over $5 billion of readily available projects. And I would say to you Michael the shift will be more towards the mall - the U.S. mall and densification effort. And so you know right now if you put those two together it's roughly 50%. I would think that that would tend to you know when we put on that King of Prussia and the Brea as we turn that in, but in that development pipe that reaches $5 billion.","You'd see more of a shift there. As an example, we don't have Phipps Plaza in yet, even though we know it's goal project, we're finalizing all of our numbers. We'll take that to our development community here in the next, I think in the next month or so.","So I think you'll see that shift in that take a bigger chunk of that. You know, international is episodic. We've got - we're - you know obviously we're excited about what's going on in Thailand and we're looking in other areas in Southeast Asia. We're also looking in the Middle East with our you know Premium Outlet business. So - and I do think we'll find - continue to find a U.S. Premium Outlet new development and I think you'll see the redevelopment of that portfolio begin to pick up.","Given the big nature of these projects, so the densification of mall you know, I see that - I would see that tend to increase generically.","Michael Berman","And then when you guys did the Aero deal, I remember you talked on the conference call about vertical integration and that was the time of - I think the Time Warner deal had been announced at that point and then you made a big deal about how vertical\u2026","David Simon","I didn't make a big deal. Okay, let's be clear, let's be clear on that.","Michael Berman","What I was saying was, you made a big deal about how you know other companies are given a lot of rope for vertical integration and much larger things versus $25 million, $30 million investment on a $100 billion company that wanted some latitude to do those sorts of things and couple of years later that investment as you mentioned clearly is done well and you've been able to rotate your stake in real larger brand oriented company.","So going forward, how do you think about furthering those sorts of investments where you are taking some level of additional vertical integration in terms of types of experiential type real estate or other types of brands or other retailers or other things that you would be able to see to bring to your assets? Does that change the calculus at all in your head?","David Simon","Well, you know, we feel comfortable that we - you know we're not \u2013 you know maybe we can replicate what we did in Aero. But I mean my goodness, we are - we had essentially no investment in Aero and the business is - I mean we actually have a real big gain, obviously because we see the GAAP financial statements.","But you know, that's a business that we you know have effectively from a book value no gain or no investment, negative investment that is you've gotten the gains through the P&L and we still own you know just under 6% ABG, which is worth more than you know a lot more investment.","We have the operating business which will throw off. You know, I don't know. We own a little under 50% which will throw off in the $30 million to $35 million range EBITDA, pretax, blah, blah, blah.","So and as you know we got criticized on that deal and a lot of the people were concerned we ","bought it because that's the only way we could keep the rent payer, and all these other stuff. So hopefully we've put some of that aside. We just thought there was - you know this was a brand that was doing at $1.2 billion of sales. And it had the - it made sense to be able to save the brand.","So I feel comfortable we're going to continue to find those investments. We're going to - we're looking at a number of them in the retail restaurant area. we're also looking at a number of them in the venture capital area. And then I wouldn't rule out you know those won't be big investments Michael, but then I wouldn't rule out you know at some point a bigger investment that you know that really aligns with what we're doing, which is we collect \u2013 we\u2019re in a brand building business, the consumer facing business. And obviously we've got all these physical property.","So I wouldn't rule it out, but you know nothing's in the works right now. But we'll continue to make hopefully smart tactical investments in good businesses, in good brands and good retailers and good restaurants. And we're working on a number of them. But those won't be sizable, in terms of what you've seen historically.","And I will add you know that given Aero\u2019s success, I mean ABG and Aero brought the Nautica business just recently. And you know creating a similar OpCo IPCo structure you know, and we think that's another good brand to be part of that family.","Michael Berman","Great. Thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore. You8r line is open.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Good morning.","David Simon","Good morning","Steve Sakwa","Hey, David, just looking at your page 27, the development activity, I mean I realize that some of the numbers kind of bounce around quarter-to-quarter. Your overall development returns were pretty flat and unchanged from last quarter. The mall redevelopment did tick down a couple hundred basis points. And I'm just wondering if there's anything specific that relates to mix or maybe there's more residential coming in that has lower returns. Anything we should kind of know about that?","David Simon","Not really. You know, I would say generally in all of our - all of these kind of metrics, whether they're you know sales, lease spreads, occupancy, development returns. You know we are always going to have quarter-to-quarter ups, downs, flatness, et cetera.","So generally it's just new stuff coming out. Its open coming out, new stuff coming in and I wouldn't say you know Steve there's any trend there other than mix changes all the time.","Steve Sakwa","And maybe just a follow up. Just anything on the construction cost side, just given all the things that we're hearing about, whether it's steel, aluminium, other import prices. I mean, how do you sort of think about that if you're looking at new projects and underwriting them?","David Simon","Well, that's a very good question. I do - we are planning for cost increases. So you know, we're going to - obviously we're covered in the stuff that's under construction, because we generally do a guaranteed max price contract. But the new stuff's all going to be vetted with what we think is higher construction cost. And again those returns are going to have to be generated that will be accretive to us, otherwise we won't do it.","But I do think that that's a fair statement. Costs are rising. And you know, I wouldn't call it material yet or deal breaking by any stretch of the imagination. But we are - we are confronted with our construction cost.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And then maybe just going back to some of the e-tailer comments that you made, I know - I believe it was Roosevelt Field. You sort of created almost like an incubator or space concept for the e-tailers and would rotate folks through. I'm just curious how that sort of experiments gone and sort of what your thought is about rolling that out across the portfolio?","David Simon","Good question. I think you know, we are still experimenting with the edit. It is doing well. We're cycling retailers in and out, not necessarily e-tailors. It could be someone wanting to build their brand, take advantage of the traffic in the mall, et cetera.","We do \u2013 you know, I'd say it's a little early yet to commit to this, but we do think that that's a business that you know once we fine-tune it, we could roll it out a little bit more. I know number of our peers are also experimenting with similar concepts.","So I do think there's a business there. We've been pleased with it. You know it's - we have growing pains like anything else. We cycled brands in and out of it, but I think we feel - we feel there's an opportunity there, hard to quantify and hard to tell you how many. But there's clearly - I mean, there's no difference here than anything. I mean, people \u2013 I shouldn't say people, brands and retailers want access to our traffic that's going through our buildings. It's up to us as the owners of it to make it in a way that presents their business so that the consumer can experience it. And I think this is one of many ways that we can do it. Rick, I don't know if you want to add anything.","Rick Sokolov","The only thing I would also say is we've already had one of the tenants in there that is opening up some incremental locations with us throughout the portfolio because they were pleased with the experience they had there. So it does work as an incubator and we're seeing positive results out of it.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. And maybe just last question, Dave you touched on sales up a little over 4.5%. I don't know if you or Rick just kind of maybe provide any commentary around categories or just things that did really well in the second quarter, maybe some of the areas that are lagging?","David Simon","The stronger categories were home improvement, sporting goods, entertainment, home entertainment, family apparel. Weaker were women's, moderate in special sizes and home furniture.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, Guys. Thanks.","David Simon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Craig Schmidt","Great, thanks. Maybe you could get an update on Simon's new tech initiatives to better connect its consumers with its centers?","David Simon","Well, that's a long winded answer on an earnings call. I\u2019d just say Greg, there is a lots going on in how we're approaching that. We have a number of ideas how to do it better. So we're doing both incremental approach, you know, to increase that connection. But I also think there are broader and bigger ideas that we have that we\u2019re considering.","So you know, I would say if you look at some of the generic things that are out there, you know, our visits store, our app store and our website are significant, our gift card sales are significant increases year-over-year, so we're making our connection through all - the various social medias are increasing and growing.","So there's a lot going on that we're doing. Our showcase of deals is getting more throughput, more retailers are joining. So there's so much going on incrementally that\u2019s showing very positive signs. But you know, we're also in the phase of developing bigger and better ideas to scale with even \u2013 even at a greater extent.","Rick Sokolov","The one thing I would add is we also have that. We\u2019ve moved online our coupon book and our VIP Club at Premium Outlets and that's generating literally millions of members that are substantially enhancing our ability to track our customers and establish relationships with them. So that's been also very positive in that area.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. And would you say your marketing budgets at your new individual centers are moving away from traditional media and towards some of these newer emerging ways to connect?","David Simon","Without question, yeah, a big shift in - you know, now listen we all - we shouldn't say all, I struggle all the time on return on investment and marketing dollars, some others might. But clearly the shift is toward social media away from traditional print and television. We still believe television can provide a lot of reach.","But you know, I think we're no different than a lot of other major companies that are - that are moving toward more social media to the extent that those platforms deliver what they say they're going to deliver. And you know, obviously we won't get into that that whole issue.","Craig Schmidt","And just lastly, are you seeing the strength in your \u2013 on your properties, on luxury retailers, we seem to be hearing from other sources?","David Simon","Yes. We had very good results with our luxury category without question.","Craig Schmidt","Thanks.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Rich Hill","Hey, David. Good morning. I wanted just follow up on the expense side, you've noted previously that you've done a good job of tightening the so-called belt on expenses and it looks like you did another good job with that this quarter.","So wondering you know, how much further you think you might have in terms of reducing those expenses just as we look forward over the next couple of quarters and maybe the next year. I am not looking for you to give guidance, but just in terms of your ability to continue to tighten up there? That would be helpful.","David Simon","I would say to you we're in pretty good shape. I don't expect anything dramatic now. The one thing I would point out to you and Tom I don't know what page it is, our other expenses went down. This was not included in our funds from operation. But part of our other expense, what page is that Tom?","Tom Ward","Page 21.","David Simon","Page 21 went down because of the increase in the stock price of WPG quarter-over-quarter. We elected not to put that in funds from operation, otherwise we would have generated $0.03 more and you can see that, that's basically a reduction of other expense, that's in footnote 3 there. So you may - I don't know if you saw that or not Rich, but I just want to point that out.","But I would say the broader question is, we're - you know we're probably in pretty good shape on the expenses. We're always focused on it, but I wouldn't expect anything dramatic there.","Rich Hill","Got it. And just maybe one other question if I can. Going back to the other income, I understand the reclassification from Aero, I'm sorry for maybe being dense here. But I was a little bit confused by the offset by lease settlement income. Can you clarify that. I assume you mean that lease settlement income maybe wasn't as high this quarter versus last quarter given Teavana?","David Simon","Yeah. I mean, basically I don't remember went to Teavana was in. But last Q over Q, I think we had a reduction of roughly $10 million plus in lease settlement income and the net increase in other income is around 25.","I wouldn't call it a reclass, it's actually not a reclass. We exchanged our interest in the Aero IPCo, which we own around 30% or shares in Authentic Brands Group on a value based upon where they recently - new investors came into to the company. We thought that was a good transaction for us because it not only diversifies the risk, but we\u2019re then writing you know the growth of the ABG above and beyond what happens with Aero. So wasn't a reclass, it was actually a transaction. But basically those are the two differences I hope I answered your question.","Rich Hill","You did. Thank you very much.","David Simon","Sure.","Rich Hill","That's it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeremy Metz","Hey, guys. Good morning. Just given some of the shifts we're seeing in the retail landscape today, e-commerce continuing to grow. I was hoping you could talk about the importance of scale today. We saw when your mall peers combine earlier this year, you guys obviously moved away from a portion of your lower gross assets a few years ago with the WPG spend. But obviously you\u2019ve continued to build - in your opening remarks you mentioned expanding geographically, expanding your reach. So just wondering if you could talk about the advantages of getting bigger in today's environment?","David Simon","Well, listen I think you know more or less as we've seen in corporate America, I think scale is really important. You know, and it goes beyond - beyond real estate. You know, look at look at BlackRock, I mean, where do they run $6 trillion, you know that scale is important. Look at that Blackstone, in terms of their private equity and real estate business.","Look at obviously - you know look at what's going on with the tech companies you know, from you know all the things that they all have scale and believe me they use that to their advantage in a lot of ways.","So I think scale is important. You know, the offset on scale is that our business in you know when you get to the fundamentals of the real estate it's still a very local business. So you've got to be able to do both in our business, whereas you know some of these other companies don't have to worry necessarily about you the location main and main, where we do.","So that scale is important learned experiences you know are important. And I think we've been able to do a lot of what we've been able to do because you know we've grown our business.","On the other hand, you know, you can blow it, it all takes is one you know big scale deal. And if you don't - if you don't understand it appropriately or you stretch the balance sheet you know too much and you can't weather a down cycle, I mean, you can - it can go for naught. So you try to find that fine balance, it's very difficult in a lot a respects.","And I would just finally say that you know we feel the good thing about what we feel about is that we you know, we don't feel and I've been said this for a little bit of time, but we don't feel like we have to just do a deal just to do a deal, we'll find where we can add value and make some money on it.","Jeremy Metz","I appreciate that color. And then just one last one for me, just in terms of densifying assets or adding these other non-retailer users, you\u2019ve talked about enhancing the experience in terms of the live work play and shop and you guys have obviously increased your focus on adding these other uses, I mean it's partially resulted to simply getting more access, do you think, or boxes, your peers have done the same.","I'm just wondering, just part of your larger development, redevelopement group or do you have a dedicated team looking specifically at these opportunities and if you do, do you continue to hire of that as add more projects, or do you feel like the team is largely built out at this point to handle what seems like a growing pipeline of opportunities?","David Simon","Yeah, no. All right on spot. So here's the way we do it generally, we have a development group that will get the permit. So you know, what I call the traditional mall development group, but the actual underwriting development, construction, et cetera is actually housed within its own separate group. And we are adding resources to that group to do our hotel and our multifamily opportunities that you know in some cases we'll do at our own as you know, some case we do with JVs.","So our roles and responsibilities change on by deal, but we're - you know the permitting process is basically that same process that we've embarked upon for year after year after year. But we are adding resources to the execution and the identification and importantly the underwriting of that group and I think we'll continue to add dedicated - we actually just hired someone that will do you know - continue to do hotel and resi stuff. So you know without question we\u2019ll be beefing up some internal resources.","Jeremy Metz","Thanks for the time,","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Your line is open.","Haendel St. Juste","Hey, good morning.","David Simon"," Good morning.","Haendel St. Juste","So David my Mizuho counterpart in Asia recently hosted some property tours on the ground there and noted incredible growth. So I guess I'm curious why you aren\u2019t there in a bigger presence, is your new outlet in Thailand perhaps a sign of more to come or you looking at looking at more in Asia these days and could we perhaps see Simon making incremental shift to do more in Asia given the opportunity relative to the US?","David Simon","Well, you know it's not - we've basically decided we don't want to do full price in Asia. You know, absent some unbelievable dislocation in the market and you know almost clay peer-like in you know full prices, you know troubled and you know the world's ending and you know, you go in and you buy it at a discount to the value.","So what we've found is that our Premium Outlet brand has terrific identity there and the ability to do that is basically new development, right. So new development takes time and part of that is finding the - you know we don't want to do that ourselves, so we have to find the right partner and then we have to find the right sites and then we have to develop it and then we have to lease it. It just takes time.","So I'm pleased to note that our partnership in Japan is doing well, same thing in Korea, same thing in Malaysia and now in Thailand we have a great partner and I think we're starting off here, it's going to take a couple of years to build. We have a great partner in Mexico and great partners in Canada.","So definitely we\u2019ll grow that business. But that's why it takes the time it takes and yes we are looking at other markets in Southeast Asia, but it does - it just \u2013 its a longer - unless you're going to go buy something - development takes time.","Haendel St. Juste","What about China, specifically?","David Simon","It's a very you know interesting question and that we think about the outlet business in China all the time. We've looked at opportunities all the time. We have not found the right one. But we have certainly by no stretch of the imagination ruled out the outlet business in China. I mean, that could be a possibility for the company under the right - under the right circumstances.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay. Thank you for that. Curious on of your thoughts on stock buybacks here, it looks like you're buying back during the quarter with the stock down in the 150, stocks moved a bit here, curious on what your appetite at these levels would be?","David Simon","I think it's still to be opportunistic. You know, we'll continue to buy stock back, you know, we try to be thoughtful when we do it and take advantage of the market when it's volatile.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay. Last one, on lease up progress at your recent redev and development projects, Denver, Boca, I'm curious, are you getting the merchandise, the rates and the lease term you're seeking. And as part of that how does the average length of terms for your new deals, not renewals, but new deals compared to say 5 or 10 years ago? Thank you.","Rick Sokolov","In terms of Denver and in the expansion in Toronto, you're going to find those opening substantially leased over 90% with great collections of tenants, including luxury and really across the board. So we've been very pleased with how that has been done. In our new deals the terms are very consistent with what they have been historically.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay. Thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai of Barclays. Your line is open.","Linda Tsai","Hi. Retail REITs I know lease settlement income is not in SS NOI. But we can also assume that the Aero gain was also excluded from SS NOI, right?","David Simon","Yes. Let's -- it's not incomparable. It's in our FFO. And I couldn't hear exactly what you said. So restate it.","Linda Tsai","I just want to know is Aero in your SS NOI?","David Simon","Oh no, I'm sorry. I thought I was hearing FF. No it's not in our same store NOI, absolutely not.","Linda Tsai","Okay.","David Simon","As you know - as you pointed out, nor is lease settlement income.","Linda Tsai","Okay. And then when you think about how retailers are building brands these days, you know, what's critical or what are some of the trends, like I've read for example that you know, stores feel like they need to be Instagrammable, and millennials like and prefer subscription services?","But what do you think is changed from a real estate point of view for landlords. And you know what are you doing to facilitate these new requirements?","David Simon","Well, I think you know, they basically want great \u2013 nothing\u2019s changed in that sense. I mean, they want really good real estate with traffic and the right brands around them. So you know, it's interesting and I won't - I don't want to steal Rick's thunder in this.","But you know, I would say we have at least 50, 60 retailers. We actually break them by category in these categories. You know, their e-commerce, pure e-commerce growing and then they want stores or they want access to our consumers. We have the growth e-commerce, in other words they've already done that and they are growing. We have the international expanders, people that are from international that are expanding. Then we have the new international tenants and they are starting to grow.","We have start up or to renew the portfolio with national aspirations and growth categories which are a start up or new to portfolio, again with national aspirations. When you put them together in these categories in have 50 names, but what they all want is consumers you know, the right cotenancy so to speak, if I can't come up with a better word and they want to be in. And I also want \u2013 I think the - who the owner of their real estate is important to them to some degree.","I mean, so when you put it all together, and you know that's - I think that's what they want. I hope I answered your question.","Linda Tsai","Thanks. That was helpful. Just one last question on \u2013 a clarification on Washington Prime. Why has their fair value changed? Because I didn't out guys still held shares?","David Simon","We had units that we had since the spinoff under 3%. We've had that from the get go. And the only reason why that volatility is in and out is because of the new accounting standards. So that started at the beginning of this year. And so each quarter we have the mark-to-market in any public securities or readily marketable securities that we have.","We have chosen not to include that in FFO and again, as we said you can see that on page 21, you can see the financial impacts, it does it does go through our GAAP statements.","Linda Tsai","And what we the fair market value adjustments, the result of?","David Simon","Its because the stock went up.","Linda Tsai","Okay.","David Simon","It's better than it going down. Actually the quarter before it went down. So we had a loss - we had an increase in our other expense Q1. And again, we didn't \u2013 that didn\u2019t run through FFO at that quarter either.","Linda Tsai","Thanks.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Mueller","Thanks, hi. David, you said that redevelopment of the Premium Outlet portfolio may be picking up. Curious what's driving that, are you just adding more GLA to meet demand or are you going to be doing something different to those centers?","David Simon","Well, I think in some cases absolutely we have gone back to kind of the - you know take Wrentham as an example. We have a food court that you know we\u2019re not sold on, that's the best use. And what do we do with that box to it up and then make it more customer friendly.","And I just think it's been a matter of - you know, we've been so busy in developing new centers that you know that was the focus and as that\u2019s changed to some degree, we\u2019re just going back to the portfolio and mining the opportunities much like we did with the mall business.","Now I will say, we've got you know, a couple of major new developments in the outlet business that we've been working on. So stay tuned on those, but you know, those will be exciting developments if in fact they you know they do come to fruition.","So we'll still do selective new development in the U.S., but I just think it's a matter of rededicating the resources to going back through the existing portfolio to make sure that you know, they're doing all that they can to continue to be attractive places for the consumer.","Rick Sokolov","The other thing we're doing, as David just indicated, if you did any Clarksburg or when you see Denver, you're going to see a much higher level of amenities for our customers, fireplaces, outdoor seating areas, upgraded play and as we go back and look at these properties we're implementing those incremental amenities throughout our portfolio with very good results.","Michael Mueller","It sounds good. Thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. Good morning. This is Keyvan.","David Simon","Morning","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. So David, I just wanted to go back to your comment about leasing improving, if you can just talk a little bit more about what's behind that and how much of the improvement in leasing volume or whatever you're referring to is tied to Simon improving the merchandise mix at the malls through redevelopment or just changing retailers or how much of it is it the older guard of retailers just doing better on improved strategy or merchandising. And lastly, how much of it is just a better economy. I mean, retail is supposed to do well and a 4% unemployment economy, right?","David Simon","Well, listen I think all of the above is the simple, I can't break it down by percentage. But you know, but the reality is our portfolio, our common area or a small shop is so big that there's not \u2013 there is just no way that one thing can move in one direction or another. It's just mathematically impossible.","So you know, listen the growth in the economy is terrific. We're very pleased to have seen it. And obviously is consumer is spending more. That's terrific. We haven't seen that for a number of years.","A number of our retailers are getting better and healthier. And I think the tax cut on their business gave them more earnings to invest or replenish their merchandise. We're working through a number of the bankruptcies and replacing them with better retailers. We're upgrading our mix, so you put it all together and I think that's what's generated at least the increase in sales.","But you know, it's just mathematically impossible for one thing to move it one way or another. I wish I had maybe I should, I wish I knew exactly how to calibrate which of the three or four categories you mentioned, which is driving it, but I think it's all in that number, it's all or part of it.","I mean, I don\u2019t \u2013 I the retailers to some extent were playing defense and now they're playing a little more offense. But you know it's impossible for me to tell you what you know, what by category, but I'd say it's all of the above.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And just last on CapEx. I know that number can move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. The CapEx offered per square foot did that change at all the trend wise over the past couple quarters?","David Simon","Not really. I mean, and I do think you mentioned a good point. I mean, there is quarter-to-quarter variance, if you look at it, you should look at it that 12 months or on an annual basis and you'll see it is not a lot - there's not a lot of difference.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Caitlin Burrows","Hi, good morning.","David Simon","Morning.","Caitlin Burrows","I have two shorter ones, just on the densification projects, you guys now indicate with an asterisk which project Simon has an ownership interest in, so I just was wondering for those that do not have an asterisk, does, somebody else own them. Did you contribute the land? Or kind of what's going on at those other properties?","David Simon","Well, in some cases, we contributed the land or sold the land. But in a lot of cases it's just - it's further validation of the location that we have that there is a lot more going on and that you know, in that parcel than you know - than what we're doing.","So, I think it's - it goes under the category of helpful information maybe I guess, I don't \u2013 and I don't get overly excited. I care about what we do, but it's always good to have better neighbours.","Caitlin Burrows","Got it. So just looking at one that doesn't have one, like Coconut Point in Estero, that opened last year with a hotel, that just means that it's something that somebody else was doing. But it should help our sensor, is that right category\u2026","David Simon","Correct. That\u2019s correct.","Rick Sokolov","We sold them the land as part of our master plan development. We had a parcel that we designated for hotel development. It was across the road from our existing project, so it wasn't integrated and it was just a sale, but it certainly enhances our overall environment.","Caitlin Burrows","Got it. Okay. And then the other was just, I know its small portion, wondering if you could give any update on Puerto Rico properties that you have. If they're - to what extent they're back to where they were a year ago or if they still have more catch up do?","David Simon","They have - they continue to have a significant amount of catch up to do. And I'd say the outlet, the Premium Outlet is in much better shape, the mall because you know, it's easier and faster to build an outlet store than it is a mall.","The mall is taking a little bit more time to get back up on its feet. We're hopeful by the end of this year, it will continue. But you know, there's a lot of work to be done and more in the mall than in the outlet at this point.","Caitlin Burrows","Okay. Thanks.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jeff Donnelly","Good morning, guys. I am just curious, David, occupancy costs, say, ticked below about 1.3% for the first time, I think since about 2016. Now that tenant sales are moving more strongly forward. I know I'm asking you to predict retail sales, but I'm just curious you know, longer term how do you think about occupancy costs, do you expect them to return to sort of the 11% to 12% range what you saw years ago that seemed to be where you stabilized or do you think you can hold the 13% peak that we've been operating at?","David Simon","Well, you know, that's a real tough one. I mean, I - there's so much that goes into that beyond you know - it's space by space, it's supply and demand. It's the model that you know, the high end retailers have much more margin on their product, and so they can pay a higher occupancy cost.","I mean, I don't think there's any real generic statement that I can give to you, other than I think we're you know pretty good at trying to price our real estate. But you know, we have to price in a way that the retailer is profitable. So I wish you it were more science than art because then it would solve a lot of problems and be even more efficient than we already are.","I can just do an algorithm and say here's the price of the real estate. But the reality is it's not quite that simple. And you know, I just \u2013 I can't predict where that will go though. I'm not alarmed that you know suddenly we're going to you know - it's going to have to go lower and lower. I just don't - I just - you know I'm not alarmed, I'm not worried about it.","Jeff Donnelly","And or in other words, like you don't get the message from your retailers that they need more occupancy costs because of more pressure on their operating margins?","David Simon","Well, we certainly - we get that every day, but we've gotten that every day for you know, I don't know how long. So, yeah, there's always a big discussion on that. And you know, I mean, it's retailer by retailer, it's a location, it's you know, again, there's so much more margin on their product \u2013 our product is so much different then and when I call you know, you can put it all together in Class A office you know, it's very on commodity like, because there's so much to it because of the location, the traffic, the mall, the competition, et cetera, et cetera.","So you know, it's very hard to do it, the way you might see traditional real estate priced. So \u2013 but we try to find that happy medium and you know, we're not - we're going to not be - you know, we're going to lose deals so in some cases we didn't, but we tried to find the happy medium.","Jeff Donnelly","Analyst just some of our peers have been increasing with the penetration of you know, their exposure to restaurants and entertainment as they sort of merchandise the mall. How do you guys balance the relevancy of your merchandising, in this case the restaurants versus the higher costs of those deals and maybe the higher turnover risk of restaurants, just so you're not effectively jumping from one risk to another? Because there is a lot of studies out there that say maybe saying we're getting a little over restaurant, I'm just curious what your thoughts are.","David Simon","Well, I think the most important thing is making sure you have the right brand, and you know, like others we've got a dedicated team that focuses on those opportunities both entertainment and in the restaurants. And it's really a function of making sure you have the ability to know how they're going to do, we have - how many restaurants we have Rick?","Rick Sokolov","We have literally 1750 food users in our mall portfolio.","David Simon","So I mean, that gives us a lot of experiences, what's going to work and what's not. And believe me you know Jeff, we take we take risks there. We experiment and sometimes we crap out. But you know, that's part of the job. I mean, we've got to - sometimes we've got to invest in the new restauranteur to see if this is something that will add value to that center and then maybe go beyond that center.","Now when we do that we're very good at making sure it's lean free. We're very sure we'll get the improvements that kitchen won't be ripped out, so you know that operator happens not to be the right operator, we don\u2019t start out.","That to me is the key on any of these new concepts, as you got to make sure that if you do take a little more risk than you do then you want to at the end of the day you've got a restaurant or a facility that\u2019s easier to lease and you don't have to reinvest again you know, you reduce costs. So you're investing a space that you can monetize over longer period of time.","Jeff Donnelly","Maybe just one last one, on leasing spreads just a housekeeping aspect. Do you have NOI weighted leasing spreads for Q1 and Q2 this year?","David Simon","We do not Tom we don\u2019t tend to give it out, but Tom will give it out to you maybe if he is in a good mood.","Jeff Donnelly","Okay.","David Simon","I determine whether he is at a good mood or not.","Tom Ward","Just kidding. I am just kidding.","David Simon","Well, maybe I am not. All right. Where we can, I know we done that. I don't know why, but we like, okay. Thank you.","Jeff Donnelly","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Christy McElroy of Citi. Your line is open.","Christy McElroy","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","David Simon"," Good morning.","Christy McElroy","It seems like with the Toys Toys\"R\"Us liquidation, there was less - a bit of a hole for some brands from a distribution standpoint. Are you seeing any residual impact from any of those brands seeking other distribution channels, maybe looking to open stores as an added direct to consumer distribution point, particularly maybe on the outlet and maybe it's not specific to choice it just trying to think about the residual impact from the fall out that\u2019s occurred in the last year or so?","Rick Sokolov","There's no doubt that the manufacturers are very focused on how they're going to distribute their goods. We are working with a number of potential retailers that are looking to be able to replace, primarily the specialty store component that Toys\"R\"Us had in our portfolio.","And we're optimistic - we're going to be able to come up with a couple of tenants that are going to want to take advantage of that and we're working with the manufacturers directly because they also are focused on how they're going to distribute their goods in that channel.","David Simon","Yeah. You know, Christy, I would say for sure though there is definitely going to - just on the Toys issue there \u2013 would shock me, and you know, and maybe who knows. But it would shock me if there's not a toy retailer that you know re-emerges from the Toys\"R\"Us debacle because I do think you know, there is a reason to buy toys in the physical environment.","So again, I mean, that toys thing was a debacle of massive proportions, but there is no question and there's a number of people that you know that are out there, that are thinking about how to create a new generational toy a physical toy retail experience. And in fact, I mean, I don't know if you know this Christy, but you'll see FAO Schwarz open up, I believe Q4, maybe even earlier in Rockefeller Center with their latest version on what FAO will look like going forward. So you know, again, there's no question that that will \u2013 that will I think will happen, we'll see.","Christy McElroy","I am sure. And it definitely has to be something more experiential. Just on the leasing side, in your traditional shop leasing, can you talk about any changes that you're making or looking to make to the language in the lease contracts, when it comes to things like cotenancy clauses and sales calculations, just given the changes to shopping that's occurred in shopping center format?","David Simon","Yeah, I think all of those - given the business continues to change and evolve, there is always - first of all we don't like them but you know, reality is we have to deal with them and there's always modifications and changes, that we have to deal with, because there's going to be you know, as we know Sears, many - certain other department stores. So we always have to modify those things.","Christy McElroy","Okay. And then just lastly on the guidance increase, it seemed like a majority of that increase was inherent in the gain on the Authentic Brands conversion. Is that accurate? Or have you included any of that, have you anticipated that in your prior guidance. I'm just trying to think about, things on the core side...","David Simon","Yeah, that's a very good question and I thank you for asking it. We always knew that we were going to convert that. And that was always in our original guidance. So again, I mean, we're a business, we're not just - you know we try to give this guidance and there's a lot - as you know we've got - we're not just 10 more - I mean we've got an ongoing, living, breathing business. But that was always contemplated.","Our partner had done it earlier. I can't really remember when they did it. We were debating whether to do it or not. But we've felt like it was likely to do, so in our original guidance we did it. And so the increase that we have today is above and beyond that because that was in the original guidance.","Christy McElroy","Okay. Any other big items like that that we should be thinking about as we towards the second half?","David Simon","Nothing jumps out of me.","Christy McElroy","Okay. Thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Wes Golladay of RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Wes Golladay","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just want to go back to Puerto Rico. Are you receiving any business interruption insurance? And are you looking, I guess, what is the lost in NOI for the year?","David Simon","Well, that's not in our numbers and we don't book BI until we actually receive it. And in fact, if you see some of the P&L changes and reduction in minimum rents and tenant reimbursements, a lot of that is due to the Puerto Rico situation. So none of that's in our guidance, I'm sorry none of that\u2019s in our \u2013 none of that has been received and it's not in our guidance at this point.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then looking to the second half for same store NOI base rent, do you expect a meaningful lift from converting temporary tenants to permanent tenants?","David Simon","No I mean, we don't look at it quite that way. And as you know, we give our same store comp NOI at the beginning of the year and then you know, whatever the number is, the number is. We do our best to do a little bit better than what the number is.","Wes Golladay","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for taking the question.","David Simon","Sure. No worries.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. David Simon, Chief Executive Officer for closing remarks.","David Simon","All right. Thank you very much and have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"19354":["Simon Property Group, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Tom Ward, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Tom Ward","Thank you, Christy. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.","Presenting on today\u2019s call is David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com.","For our prepared remarks, I\u2019m pleased to introduce David Simon.","David Simon","Good morning, everybody.","We\u2019re pleased to report a strong start to the year. Retailers are performing better following a strong holiday season and decent start to the year. Demand is picking up for our space and traffic and sales are up. We continue to invest in our product with a long-term view of creating compelling, integrated environments or consumers to live, work, stay, play, and of course shop. We completed several significant redevelopment projects, are under construction on others, and announced more activity that will further enhance the value of our real estate and grow our cash flow. And we continue to identify unique, strategic, new development opportunities globally, that will extend our reach and create world-class destinations.","Before I turn to the results of the quarter, I would like to provide some perspective. First, we expect to generate in excess of $4 billion in earnings this year, that\u2019s FFO. There are only 40 companies in the S&P 100 that are projected to generate over $4 billion in earnings this year and have an A rated balance sheet. Simon is one of them. Second, we expect to distribute approximately $3 billion in dividends this year, which would make us one of the top 40 dividend paying companies in the entire world and country and obviously, in the S&P 100.","Finally, our stock is trading at a 12 times multiple, which is a 30% discount to our historical average multiple of approximately 18 times. This is the lowest multiple SPG has traded at over the last eight years, despite compound annual growth rate of more than 11% in earnings and 14% in dividends over that period of time. And as you know, our numbers speak for themselves. Results in the quarter were highlighted by FFO of $2.87 per share, an increase of 4.7% compared to the prior year and exceeding the first call consensus estimates by $0.04 per share. This marks the first time we generated in excess of $1 billion of FFO in the quarter. We continue to grow our cash flow and report solid key operating metrics. Total portfolio NOI increased 4.8% or more than $70 million in the quarter and our comp NOI increased 2.3% for the quarter. And as you remember, and I want to reiterate, they do not include lease settlement income.","Linking activity remained solid, continues to improve. Average base minimum rent was $50 -- $53.54, up 3.3% compared to last year. The mall only outlets recorded leasing spreads of $8.45 per foot, an increase of 12.6%. And we are pleased that retail sales momentum continued to pick up in the first quarter. In fact, each of our platforms posted record sales productivity for the period. Reported retailer sales per square foot for our malls and premium outlets was $641 compared to $615 in the prior year period, an increase of 4.2%. As a reminder, this sales metric is based on information reported by the retailers. As a point of reference, while reported retail sales grew a strong 4%. We know there are significant number of retailers who are underreporting their sales number because they\u2019re deducting returns of online sales that were not previously reported as store sales.","This is not allowed under our leases. Although we plan to continue to provide reported retailer sales, it is important for the investment community to understand. We believe this metric is understated.","Our malls and outlets ended the quarter at 94.6%. Occupancy is down compared to last year due to timing of the bankruptcies processed last year and the first quarter of this year, as well as the addition of new space brought on line last year that is slightly lower than the overall average for the quarter.","On an NOI-weighted basis for our operating metrics were as follows. Reported retail sales on an NOI-weighted basis is $804 per foot compared to $641. And again, this number we believe is still understated. Occupancy is 95.6% compared to 94.6%. And average base minimum rent is $70.34 compared to $53.54.","Just to turn to new development. In Edmonton, Canada, the Premium Outlet Collection will open next Wednesday, May 2nd, marking our fourth outlet center in Canada. Construction continues on four additional new outlets, Denver, Colorado opening in December; Queretaro, Mexico, which will open in December; Malaga, Spain, which will open in the spring of \u201819; and Cannock, United Kingdom, which will open in the spring of 2020. We have development -- redevelopment expansion projects underway at nearly 30 of our properties across all of our platforms in the U.S. and internationally, and we continuously evaluate our portfolio for additional opportunities.","During the quarter, 175,000 square-foot expansion, opened at Aventura Mall, one of the most productive retail centers in the U.S. During the quarter, we started construction on a significant redevelopment at Southdale; we\u2019re replacing a former JCPenney box with a Life Time Athletic, Life Time Sports and Work, specialty shops, restaurants, 146-room Homewood Suites, as well as the Restoration Hardware and Shake Shack restaurant. We\u2019re also working through the entitlement process for our transformative redevelopment projects of the former department store spaces at Phipps, Plaza and at King of Prussia. Phipps has started construction KoP will start we hope by the end of the year.","Lastly, we announced our plans to redevelop five locations, five Sears locations Brea, Burlington, Midland, Ocean and Ross Park Mall. Each of these projects has unique plans dependent upon the needs of the communities in which they are located, including entertainment, fitness, dining halls, restaurants, residential, hotel, office and of course new to market retailers. These are all go projects.","Our industry-leading balance sheet continues to differentiate us. During the quarter our A\/A2 unsecured credit ratings were firm with the stable outlook by S&P and by Moody\u2019s, respectively. And by the way, similar A and A2 rated companies in our sector do not come close to our financial characteristics. However, it is what it is. We amended and extended our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility with the lower pricing grid for five years. And we closed and are committed on six mortgages, totaling 513 for roughly five years at 3.4% interest.","Keep in mind, we have no unsecured senior notes or consolidated secured debt maturing for the remainder of this year and little for 2019. Net debt to NOI was 5.5 times. Our coverage was 5 times. Only 6% of our total variable -- of our debt is variable. Our liquidity is more than $7 billion. And during the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $228 million. We announced our dividend of a $1.95 per share for the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 11.4%. We\u2019re increasing our FFO guidance from $11.95 to $12.05 per share. This represents approximately 6.5% to 7.5% growth compared to reported FFO of $11.21 per share for 2017.","To conclude, strong start to the year. We expect to generate $1.5 billion in excess cash flow, which will allow us to fund our new development, redevelopment, execute on our share repurchase authorization or decrease our leverage, which is already significantly below our peer group.","We welcome and encourage your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Steve Sakwa","Hi. Just a couple of quick things here. So, it looks like a lot of the operating metrics have pointed up in the right direction, leasing spreads improving, sales improving. I know occupancy can bounce around and there has been some store closures and a few bankruptcies, but I also know that some of the new developments that are brought on line tend to kind of pull that number down. So, I was wondering if you or Rick could just first share, how much of the 100 basis-point occupancy decline was maybe development related and then, how much of it was natural store closings or bankruptcies.","David Simon","Well, I would say, over the majority is related to bankruptcies. And remember, Steve, we are very focused on putting the right tenant in the right space. And when a -- we\u2019re at the mercy of bankruptcy court. So, the reality is, you file Chapter 11, you can reject the lease at any time, and as you know, the build-out and getting the space leased takes some time. We do expect that we will get back to where we were last year, maybe a little bit better. But again, that will depend upon if there are a little bit more bankruptcies or not. So, it\u2019s pretty much what we expected. Remember, as we gave guidance, we thought we would get back to where we are. We\u2019re processing the bankruptcies. And then, I would say, I don\u2019t know, 20, 30 basis points are probably just the new space that we\u2019ve added on, so in that range of 70-30, somewhere in that range.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Secondly, it\u2019s a little more of a housekeeping item. But, we noticed on the other income that you had a large jump in interest dividend and distribution income. I think, the lease settlement income sort of speaks for itself. But, can you just provide any color on what the large jump was in the quarter and is that recurring or is that just a one-time number.","David Simon","It is recurring. It\u2019s just we don\u2019t know when it recurs. So, that is basically the distribution we get from our interest in value retail. And so, it does manifest itself. Just so you know, I know a little bit about accounting. So, we cost account for that. We do not equity account. And so, when you cost account, you basically only record cash. That happens to be a cash distribution. And it does happen. It\u2019s happened every year for the last several years. It is lumpy. And that\u2019s what it was from. We\u2019ve put that in that line item because it\u2019s technically a distribution. Now, that\u2019s a function of -- it\u2019s cash flow, refinancing activity, I mean, it all goes into a pot there. But, we cost account for that. And then, we only book it when we receive the actual cash.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. And then, just last for me, just share repurchase. I know you didn\u2019t do anything in the fourth quarter, but you obviously took advantage in the first quarter. How should we just think about your buyback activity over the course of the year?","David Simon","I think, it\u2019s going to continue at these levels. We are -- if you look at our balance sheet, you look at very little exposure to potential rising rates, the underperformance of our stock price, the kind of the mood is getting better, retail demand increasing. Market\u2019s now recognizing it, why not buy stock back. So, I think, we will continue that. I think, just like anything else, like we typically do, we will be cautious about it. But, it\u2019s certainly in our plans.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Christy McElroy of Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, David. It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Christy. Two questions. The first, in your shareholders letter, you talked about the fifth platform being focused on the consumer. And I was wondering if you can delve a little bit deeper into the resources that you\u2019re committing to that. How you\u2019re going to measure success? How much capital you want to put forth that I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re thinking grander of like what Westfield did with Westfield Labs and OneMarket. And I know, there\u2019s a lot of different things that you\u2019ve done, whether it\u2019s a Snapchat the Family app, the Facebook, Happy Returns, all these things that you\u2019re trying to get together with the consumer but you can delve a little bit deeper into how you envision that going forward?","David Simon","Well, at this point, given what\u2019s going on, I really don\u2019t have a lot for sure, other than we\u2019re dedicating resources and efforts to it. I hope to have something to talk to the market about later in the year. I wouldn\u2019t compare it to whatever it\u2019s called one labs, Westfield Labs, I\u2019m not sure what that\u2019s all about. We\u2019re actually working on this right now. We think about it all the time. We are a retail real estate company. But, we have the flexibility to think about other investments and other ways that technology can improve our consumer experience without jeopardizing basically the core business. And that\u2019s a huge focus for the Company. As you know, our -- even though Tom wanted me to take it out of my letter, I did hit to the market kind of what are marketing connection to the consumer brings every year; it\u2019s in the letter. Thank you for reading the letter, first of all. And I mean, it\u2019s real money. You capitalize it. It\u2019s a real business, depending on how you want to capitalize that. I think, we have this huge connection to the consumer, 100 million consumers, 2 billion visits a year. So, a lot\u2019s going on there. But, I\u2019m not really ready to get granular with you but I hope to do it by the end of this year.","Michael Bilerman","But, is that something that you feel like you want to go and acquire something or is it all being built and investing in-house?","David Simon","Right now, we\u2019re building but I wouldn\u2019t rule out strategic investment at all. We just -- right now, it\u2019s tough for us to make any investment. So, you look at how those values are compared to our values. But there are -- we have a tremendous amount of optionality on how to continue to grow our business because of the position that we\u2019re in. So, we\u2019ll continue to look at everything under the hood. As you know, we make investments through our venture group. There could be larger; we\u2019ve tended to make those kind of relatively small investments, but there could be larger investments. We\u2019re building something right now that I think will be very interesting. And that\u2019s the thing that I\u2019m referring to that I hope to -- they view by at least by the end of this year, but as you know, when you\u2019re building something, it\u2019s always a little -- it\u2019s not quite like building a mall but there a lot of analogies to it.","Christy McElroy","Hey, David. It\u2019s Christy here, just a quick one for me. It seems like the property expense recovery rate was down in the quarter from recent trends. Just wondering if there was anything onetime in there and how we should be thinking about the property level expenses going forward.","David Simon","Not really. First quarter had no -- had utility expenses, there were -- it was a little bit -- we had a little bit of spike up in those. We\u2019re also adding some properties to it, so that those numbers tend to go, but basically, our utility expenses and snow expenses. As you know, the spring is not sprung yet. Maybe it\u2019s springing right now as we speak. So it\u2019s really more of that. I wouldn\u2019t read anything else into that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Rich Hill","Hey. Good morning, David. Maybe a quick question for you. One of the things that we were looking at was maybe a little bit of increase in the month to month leases. It looks like they increased to around 3.5 million square feet versus around 1.6 million square feet. I recognize that\u2019s still small overall. But, I\u2019d be curious if you could give us any color as to whether that\u2019s timing related, the change in strategy. How you\u2019re thinking about that?","David Simon","When you get bankrupt space back, you wait for the right tenant. It\u2019s really just typically part of our strategy here that we are looking at the regional local markets a little bit more in detail. So, we tend to do those a little bit shorter-term sometimes. But, it\u2019s really just a function of us recycling our portfolio through. Now, remember, in our occupancy, we only include leases that are over a year. So, the 94.6 just concludes; that doesn\u2019t include like short-term leasing that is just three, six months. But, all of that is about a year.","Rick Sokolov","The only thing I would add is that we\u2019re maximizing our revenue. So, we go out of our way and try and make sure that we have as much space occupied for as long as we can. And we\u2019re also able to incubate tenants out of that program. We got a number of tenants that have started with us temporary tenants which in fact end up going longer term leases because they find they can make money and like the experience.","Rich Hill","And can you remind me, maybe going back to Christy\u2019s comment here a little bit. Do those month-to-month leases pay reimbursements or is it just like typical lease\u2026 ","David Simon","Yes. And remember, a lot of those month to months are leases that we haven\u2019t finalized the negotiation with. So, we tend to take a big retailer. Okay? Maybe they\u2019re headquartered in San Francisco, and I won\u2019t name names. Believe it or not, just because of the two organizations back and forth, we may not have those leases negotiated completely. So, they are not going to leave and then come back. So, those tend to go month-to-month. And what you\u2019re looking at in the 8-K is essentially that backlog. So, you need to differentiate between short-term leasing and month-to-month. Month-to-month is basically our total book of business that we have many national retailers in \u201818 that are done. And those tend to be done throughout \u201818. Even though we try to get them all done, we may have a strategy not to get them all done for all sorts of reasons. So, I think you need to separate those two out. Those month-to-month are primarily national retailers that have just not been finalized and they go. And remember a lot of our leases expire at January 31. So, a lot of reasons don\u2019t get -- believe it or not, don\u2019t get done until May and June. And don\u2019t ask me but that\u2019s been year after year after year. So, I hope you understand the difference.","Rich Hill","No, I believe.","David Simon","Let me repeat. So, you see in the 8-K is mostly vast majority of national tenants that we have finalized our deals, they automatically go to month-to-month, in our 94.6 only leases that are a year older in that number.","Operator","Thank you our next question is from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Craig Schmidt","Thank you. We see that you\u2019re continuing to ramp up your densification pipeline. I was just wondering, as you look out your portfolio, how many projects you think you could be pursuing a densification effort on? It seems primarily hotels have been your densification effort of choice. Do you see more office and resi efforts as you densify? ","David Simon","Yes. I would say to you that just off the top of my head, we have at least 20 major projects, one of which is under construction. Now, we have to move the fire station at Phipps. But Phipps is a great example where we\u2019re building a hotel with Nobu and a restaurant and an office building. There is no residential there. But as you know, we already built residential in our development there. But, we have a lot of residential. So, like -- and Craig you know the portfolio. So, Stoneridge and the East Bay, significant amount of resi will be part of the Sears redevelopment; same thing with Brea in Orange County. So, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s mostly hotel. The reality is I think, you\u2019ll see more and more resi built. And just a gross number, at least 20 but we\u2019re building a hotel and Sawgrass. I mean, it\u2019s all over the board, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re excited about, and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re dedicating more obviously capital, but also human resources toward.","Craig Schmidt","Great. And then, regarding Bon-Ton, maybe you could share some of your future plans for the repurposing efforts of those department stores.","David Simon","I\u2019ll let Rick speak, other than Bon-Ton is a nonmaterial event for us. We\u2019ve already got users identified. Again, we don\u2019t own all of the real estate. So, some of it will be out of our hands, at least for some period of time. But Rick, you can add to that.","David Simon","We basically have already identified users for virtually every one of the stores. And as David said, there are some that we own that we\u2019re moving aggressively on right now; there are some that Bon-Ton owns, some that are third-party owned. But, we have users. They have said yes, let\u2019s make finalize economics. And we would hope to have information about that later in the year. The stores aren\u2019t going to even come back till third quarter while they finish their process.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.","Alexander Goldfarb","Just two just questions from us. First, David, in your opening comments, you referenced internet returns and how you make sure that the tenants aren\u2019t understating their sales. Could you just expand on that? As far -- it sounds like you guys get a full detailed P&L and somehow you\u2019re able to double check to make sure that the retailers, the tenants are leaving off anything to further understate. But, maybe you could just elaborate a little bit more on that.","David Simon","Well, there is not much to elaborate other than we actually don\u2019t get P&Ls, we get -- we have audit rights. And in our normal procedure, we saw some anomalies about sales. And as we\u2019ve gone through our audit rights despite the retailer has audit rights on us in some cases. Now, if you go back historically, it used to be all these CAM audits. But, since we all went to fix CAM, that\u2019s less of an issue. We found out that there -- what\u2019s fascinating to me about the internet and it\u2019s never really discussed is everyone talks about the internet\u2019s gross sales, they never talk about the net sales. And I think by and large, bricks and mortar are -- because as you know apparel 30% to 40% returns and I think most of those returns are occurring in a lot of cases in the physical world, which is good for the retailers because maybe they are giving them credits or maybe they exchange it. But, we\u2019ve just found that we\u2019re getting dinged by the internet return when fact they are not allowed to because the reality is the only thing they are allowed to offset in terms of sales is returns from the store. And in many cases, we limit the total returns they are allowed to net against us. So, this is an issue. I mean I don\u2019t want to make a big deal about it. But, when the market is fascinated by sales per square foot, we just think we need to tell you the other side of the story. What happens here and how it gets dealt with is anybody\u2019s guess. It\u2019s surely part of our lease negotiation, but we just want to tell the market, we are giving you our reported sales and they are less than what\u2019s going on in that market because of the internet sales returns. And I can\u2019t quantify it but I do think I wouldn\u2019t tell you if they weren\u2019t material out that. How\u2019s that?","Alexander Goldfarb","That\u2019s what I figured. The second question is, part of your redevelopment that you guys have been doing has also been upgrading the food courts, which I don\u2019t think usually get much attention. So, whether it\u2019s like Woodbury or Westchester, certainly it\u2019s pretty dramatic from what it was. But, as far as measuring return, like it\u2019s to say, hey, at a restaurant, we drive this much more NOI, this much traffic, you add new retailers, new hotel, you can judge that. How do you -- are the food courts really dramatically increasing sales in NOI or these are more just, hey, you got to upgrade it, make it look good, it\u2019s probably got the same sales that it was doing before. But if we\u2019re going to do with the center, we have to. So, is this more defensive spend or are you actually getting a good return when you\u2019re doing those?","David Simon","Look, I think it\u2019s all. It\u2019s offense; it\u2019s defense. The reality is, those numbers are all in our numbers, so, however you want to look at it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that critical to say it\u2019s offense or defense. When we do make an investment in our food hall operations, that cost and that income that we get is all in the numbers that Tom provides in his 8-K. And just remember, and we don\u2019t talk about this, we\u2019ve been thinking about it, I\u2019ve been think about it. The 8-K we have here is just the approved projects, ready to go that we -- our own capital committees approved. It does not include our soon to be approved deals like a Phipps or all of the Sears redevelopment that we have to deal with at the end of year. And that\u2019s basically -- it\u2019s more than a shadow pipeline but it is significant amount of investment that we think we\u2019ll get accretive returns on. But, I would just say that simply, yes, it\u2019s both; it\u2019s offense, it\u2019s defense. The cost and the income from that is certainly in our numbers. And the world wants newness, healthy food, community place to hang out, all of the stuff that\u2019s really good. There\u2019s a lot of great operators. We need to do more and more of it. We\u2019re excited about it. Our peers have done it. They\u2019ve done a nice job with it. And I think it will continue to continue to move forward. Now, on some cases, we may take it out because the reality is, there\u2019s a better use for it. And each -- the thing about real estate is gather these trends, but the reality is it\u2019s got -- it boils down to the location, demographics, and all that stuff that makes real estate unique.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim","This is Ki Bin. So, David, for a couple quarters, you\u2019ve mentioned that you think the retail demand or environment is getting better. So, what is it that you\u2019ve seen or you see it every day that that\u2019s not parent in the supplemental snapshot every quarter?","David Simon","Well, we talk to our sales folks and they tell us demand\u2019s picking up. Now, leases take time. Bankruptcies don\u2019t take any time. Okay? So, they have a lease, they reject it. And then, we don\u2019t know if they are going to reject it or not; there\u2019s lots of games of chicken. But, we\u2019ve got one of the best leasing groups in the country. In the world, I look them in the eye; they tell me their demand is picking up. So, I talk to retailers, Rick talks to retailers. I mean, obviously, results are historical. They\u2019re not future expectations. We feel better about the business than in \u201817. We gave your judgment that bankruptcies would be less than 18. So, far we\u2019re right. We\u2019re not perfect in our estimates and judgments, but we\u2019ve been doing this a long time. And the guy that overseas leasing generally tells me green shoots. I don\u2019t know. Sometimes I wonder whether -- but John and I\u2019ve been working together a long time. I believe his judgment. Rick, you can comment on this. What do you think?","Rick Sokolov","Interestingly, we have meetings every week with tenants where we\u2019re in their offices and they are coming in the Indianapolis and we\u2019re going over the portfolio. And that optimism is being generated out of those meetings where we are exposing opportunities to them. And where last year they would have said, we exposed 20 and they were interested in three and now they are interested in 12. So, there is definitely a more optimistic view; they more capital to spend and they are more focused on new opportunities than they were last year and that\u2019s because of our optimism.","Ki Bin Kim","That\u2019s helpful. Is that just broad-based or is there a certain segment, it\u2019s a new type of tenants, is it the old guard? Just curious, how that looks like?","David Simon","It\u2019s a combination. I mean, look at -- each company is different, but look at just from the gap look at Old Navy. They are growing the Old Navy business. Now, maybe they weren\u2019t two or three years ago. Obviously, the great thing about what\u2019s been going on in our industry is there are more and more entrepreneurs in the food and obviously in the retail front. You don\u2019t have to know -- I know, Rick -- this is usually where Rick updates his list. Let\u2019s move to call along and we\u2019ll avoid it. But, he\u2019s happy to give it to you. There are more folks. I mean, our new business group is doing new and new deals, new ideas.","Our business always recycles itself; it\u2019s done it for so long. Our product has been around for 70 years. And despite -- and I don\u2019t want to blame -- I don\u2019t want to like being negative on the media. But, the media wants this one narrative, but it\u2019s just not reality. And look at our numbers, okay? We\u2019re going to make $4 billion this year. Okay? And that\u2019s -- yes, I mean, it\u2019s not perfect. I\u2019d love for everybody -- I\u2019d like not to have a slight decrease in occupancy and this, that and the other. But, it\u2019s -- we\u2019re in good shape. And I think the business generally is getting a little bit firmer. But, and again, and I go back and Tom might know it, but I wrote an article, my shareholder letter in \u201815 and I told you my concern about the leverage going into the system on retails. And the two big bankruptcies this year had basically -- Claire\u2019s had nothing to do with its operation. It\u2019s all about too much leverage. And Toys R Us, it was about the fact that it was so levered to begin with that they could never invest in the product, whether that\u2019s online or in the stores or anything, and the natural media narrative as well as the mall, well, it\u2019s not. Look at -- peel the onion, figure it out. And Tom, when did I write that in my letter, \u201815? Nobody reads my letter, but the reality is I told you about it in \u201815. So, that\u2019s where we try to explain it to you methodically. We show it, we back it up with our numbers. And every retail is different. But the reality is we just feel a little bit better than -- now easier you feel better when you don\u2019t have all these bankruptcies. But we\u2019re going to have some more. And no, I\u2019m not going to tell you which ones. And yes, some of it are because of operations or not -- the life has passed them by. But that\u2019s been going on in our business forever. Traffic is up, sales up, demand is up, and our numbers are catching up.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Metz of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeremy Metz","I just want to continue on your comments about getting better and retailer demand increasing. I\u2019m wondering what you\u2019re seeing from your tenants in terms of reinvesting in their existing stores. Are you seeing encouraging activity here relative to maybe a year ago?","Rick Sokolov","I think, our tenants that are now recognized being that they are only going to and be able to increase their share by giving the consumer a better environment. And Dave has been taking about that for the last quarters, asking our retailers to invest in the store. And we\u2019re seeing that more now. And that is in fact encouraging. One of the things that we\u2019re very focused on is right sizing our tenants. So, where we have a tenant that we believe is got too much space, we will work with them and reallocate that space, get them to a smaller store, it\u2019s more productive, we make money and we get back more space that we can lease to another productive tenant. And that\u2019s just like manufacturing new space without having to build it. And so, we\u2019re very focused on that. And the tenants are now more implying to work with us than they were in the last year or so.","Jeremy Metz","Great, I appreciate that. And then, just switching gears in terms of those Sears boxes, the five redevelopments you recently announced the plans for, you mentioned earlier that those construction spend numbers aren\u2019t in the pipeline yet. But, given it sounds like those can be some pretty significant projects here, adding additional uses, the hotels, office, resi. Just wondering if you can give us any sort of sense of how much capital those five could total here.","David Simon","Well, let me answer it this way. We\u2019ve made a deal with Sears to control 12 boxes. And when I say Sears, I should also mention Seritage. Our total investment in that -- now some of these are not this year, the five are this year because we\u2019re getting those back this year. But, the 12 in total is about $1.2 billion and that will flex little bit up and down. So, you should look at the total amount as opposed to the five. But, you\u2019ll see the five start coming into our 8-K. But, I would I say to you that you look at the 12 and it\u2019s about $1.2 billion altogether.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Caitlin Burrows","I guess, also just on those densification projects, in the supplement, and I know another example is Northgate Mall outside of Seattle, which was in the news. That one mentioned it could have housing and offices but reduced square footage of retail. So, just wondering to what extent the project you\u2019re doing could involve a reduction of retail square footage so that even though the end result might be or should be an increase in NOI that there could be some decline in between?","David Simon","Yes. There is no question that that will have a reduction in retail space. Because remember, we have Penny, Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom, and it\u2019s a tight size, but it\u2019s a great piece of real estate. And ultimately, it will be a residential, office and still retail. But, I\u2019d say, roughly retail would be cut in half, more or less, in that range. Obviously, this is a process over time. We\u2019ve got to go through the approval process, but the retail there will be dramatically reduced.","Caitlin Burrows","I guess, when you think about the densification projects overall, is that normally the case, or more often is it like on a parking lot on the side that wouldn\u2019t end up impacting the retail portion?","David Simon","Well, look, I think a lot of this is happening with our Sears stuff. So, if you consider Sears a retailer, in theory, it\u2019s taking that out. I mean all the 12 -- now, in a lot of cases we\u2019re just changing the mix, but it\u2019ll still be retail. So, I would say to you, a lot of it is reducing the department store, not so much the small shops, but really reducing the department store square footage and not the small shop. So, the income opportunity is really enhanced because as you know, either they pay very little rent or to buy the box on an accretive basis because getting small shop kind of rents or we\u2019re having mixed-use development. So, in a lot of cases, the retail will be reduced in total, but it\u2019ll be mostly department store reduction as opposed to what you and I would consider small shops.","Rick Sokolov","And I would tell you that a great example of that focusing not just on the box, the land at King of Prussia, the Penny store is going to be demolished. That gives us 17 acres of land adjacent to King of Prussia mall and that is going to be a significant mixed-use project with hotel, office, residential, restaurants, retail, and amenities. And so, that\u2019s a major opportunity for us to substantially upgrade what is already one of the best properties in the United States.","Caitlin Burrows","And then, just last one using Northgate or on this topic but just using Northgate as example, is the reason that\u2019s not listed yet just because the decision-making process is pretty early stage?","David Simon","It\u2019s early. Listen, the critical path there\u2019s approvals. And then, once the approvals come, we\u2019ll start to build. So, it\u2019s a -- Seattle is obviously a great market and a great city. And this is a great piece of real estate. The new metro line is -- it basically comes off in our parking lot. But it\u2019s a multiyear process. I think, the most exciting that we\u2019ve got that the market could focus on, if they want say okay, what are you doing now would be Phipps. I mean, Phipps\u2019s Belk leaves August of this year. We demolish the store. It\u2019s a little complicated because we got to demolish the party and then go up. But that\u2019s going to happen. That\u2019s basically -- we have this odd process here. I mean, it\u2019s basically -- they\u2019re finalizing all the numbers. But that will show up in either next quarter, closely thereafter. But it\u2019s for all intents and purposes a go deal. And it\u2019s roughly, if I remember right around, 350 million bucks. And it\u2019ll be accretive. And it is going to make that real estate just tremendous, fantastic. The only thing that could flex there is the office. But we think a brand new building there in that area with that parking and those amenities will be exciting. And we will be doing a new food hall there as along with the Life Time Work and Fitness and Sport, Nobu hotel restaurant. That\u2019s going to be the one you can say, well, this is great, you guys talk about this all but this is actually happening. Northgate\u2019s a year or so process. But the other big ones to look for are Brea, Stoneridge and obviously KoP. I mean, those are the big, what I say to you are the big four that are all going to be programmed in here in the next year or so.","Caitlin Burrows","And then, just switching topics, the income and other taxes line item was historically an expense last year and the first quarter was positive, I think due to a loss from Aero this year, back to an expense. Just wondering if you could go through the impact Aeropostale had to your earnings this quarter and the outlook for that investment.","David Simon","Well, last year -- I mean, this is the good news and the bad news. Last year -- as you know, the first quarter of retail operation usually loses, yes we had the tax benefit of that; this year, because of the lower tax and the operations are better, we had less of the tax benefit. And that\u2019s really what it manifests itself. I think, Aero business generally is, they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re supposed to do. So, that\u2019s a business that with a little elbow grease a less worry about comp sales and all this other stuff. I think we\u2019re going to -- our operating business will -- should have an EBITDA -- and again, we only own 49%, but should have an EBITDA, I don\u2019t know o $35 million. And we bought it basically one times EBITDA. So, I don\u2019t know, people criticize me for it. But, somehow it\u2019s working out. And as you know, they\u2019re going to take on the Nautica operations. We think that\u2019s another unique thing that can be done, the profitability of the Aero operating company. And then, our partner besides General Growth, Authentic Brands Group, continues to do an excellent job. And the brand development of both Aero and then ultimately all their brands, as well as Nautica, which we expect to close here in the next 30 days. So, it\u2019s okay. We have a decent story to tell in our retail investments so far. So, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s good.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Nick Yulico of UBS. Your line is now open.","Nick Yulico","Good morning, everyone. Looking at the increase in tenant sale per square foot trying to figure out how much is attributed to turning out in weaker tenants from the portfolio versus sales growth. And so, could we get some perspective on what is the average sales per square foot for tenants that have thrown out of the portfolio through bankruptcy in the quarter and in the last year?","David Simon","We don\u2019t have those numbers there. But we have such huge portfolio we lost 1 million square feet in bankruptcies. Our small shops are 65 million. So, no matter how you want to do that Nick, it\u2019s not going to be material. Okay? You can make up a number and do it yourself and you will see that\u2019s not material. 65 million square feet is still 65 million square feet.","Nick Yulico","And then, on the development page, recognizing these numbers can fluctuate. But, the expected return is now 8%, it was 9% last quarter. What\u2019s driving that? Is it tougher construction costs or some change in product mix, location?","David Simon","Things come in, things go out; we round it. So, there is some rounding up and rounding down, but nothing out of the ordinary mix change. That\u2019s it.","Operator","Thank you our next question is from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Vincent Chao","I just want to go back to the Aeropostale conversation little bit. Obviously, you\u2019ve done a good job stabilizing it on a big basis. But I am just curious there were some special circumstances when you bought that. I guess, what\u2019s the longer term plan there? It seems like not something you would necessarily keep long-term but just curious how you\u2019re thinking about the long-term for that investment?","David Simon","Well, again, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a small investment. We have basically less than $30 million in it. So, obviously, it\u2019s a very good investment. It does -- we bought it really, really fortunately. The team has done very good job. But again, our investment in this is basically $30 million. So, it\u2019s not like I obsess with. I do obsess with making sure the operations continue to move forward in the positive manner, which they have been. But, it\u2019s not -- for $30 million, I am not going to -- it\u2019s not like oh God, we got to do something with Aero. But I am open to any of your idea that you\u2019d like.","Vincent Chao","Leverage buyout, okay?","David Simon","That\u2019s the one thing we\u2019ll not do. Okay.","Vincent Chao","I guess, just another question maybe something you are obsessed a little bit more, just the big progress that you mentioned that are going to come into the pipeline. You saw the share of your net cost there -- the reporting numbers go up for the first time in a little while. I guess, after these are all in there, I guess, or maybe by the end of the year, what do you think the pipeline will be? Is it going to be over 1.5 billion at that point, just given some of the things that have been brought on? And then from a delivery perspective, is that more of a 2020 kind of NOI uplift?","David Simon","Well, what I would say to you is the stuff that we\u2019re working on now, again, part of the timing is -- the great thing about us is we\u2019re not long development. So, we can turn it on and turn it off, just like our balance sheet. But, I would say to you the stuff that\u2019s in the pipeline now is over $4 billion. And I would call that more than a shadow pipeline, I\u2019d call the real pipeline. The difficulty in answering your question, which is not that it\u2019s not an appropriate question, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s hard to tell you exactly when that will come on line. But, I would say to you, as Tom has described, it\u2019s going to be about a 1 billion plus a year. I still feel like that\u2019s the right number, because we\u2019ve got this $4 billion pipe that I see and I can identify clearly whether it\u2019s 2 billion one year, 1 billion another year, kind of it\u2019s -- that\u2019s harder to -- because a lot of these are little bit out of our control and that you just have to go through the approval process. But the real stuff is $4 billion. And all that\u2019s like in works now. And so that\u2019s why I still think that 1 billion plus a year is probably a pretty good number because it\u2019ll take three, four years to get all basically done. And then, we\u2019ll add to that as well because obviously even though we have 12 Sears stores, that\u2019s not -- there is going to be more. That\u2019s not the end.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Mueller of JP Morgan. Your line is open. ","Michael Mueller","I appreciate the color on the development pipeline. I guess, the one question I have left is this first quarter lease term, how much of that was contemplated in guidance? And is there anything else material that you expect in the balance of the year.","David Simon","Yes. It was all pretty much in our initial guidance because it was unique situation that was -- that we had anticipated that was going to be resolved.","Michael Mueller","And for the balance of the year, anything else material in there?","David Simon","On lease term, not really. And again, I just -- it\u2019s always been part of our business, it\u2019s an okay part of our business. Because if you can get the present value of lease obligation and then you get the space back, it\u2019s not too shabby as my hero would say. But, I don\u2019t sense that there\u2019s anything really that\u2019s going to be that extraordinary. And again, remember, Michael, it\u2019s not in our comp NOI.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum of Boenning. Your line is open.","Floris van Dijkum","Question on -- David, you\u2019ve built a reputation as being a pretty astute capital allocator. And as you look at the various platforms that you\u2019re allocating capital to, whether you\u2019re your U.S. mall business, your outlet business or your international business or for that matter, buying back your own stock, can you maybe talk about the attractiveness, as you sit right now, for each of those uses of capital? Clearly you continue to invest and plow money back into your U.S. mall portfolio, but maybe if you can talk about relative attractiveness, particularly regarding your stock as well.","David Simon","Well, I mean, right now, it\u2019s basically 12 times. It\u2019s highly attractive. And the only hypothetical constrain in that is that we just think having -- it\u2019s never really manifested itself in our multiples. The optionality of having this powerful balance sheet is something that I never want to get rid of. So, we could buy a ton of stock back but we always are going to be conservative on that front only because we want this powerful balance sheet for optionality reasons, optionality to do something external, optionality to weather any storm, make additional investments, make our properties better and never. And so, we\u2019re never going -- remember, Rick and I workout dudes. Okay? Rick, I mean, when I got back to the real estate business in 1990, I spent from \u201890, to \u201893 doing workouts; Rick did it as well, right, Rick?","Rick Sokolov","Yes.","David Simon","So, Andy is here, he is conservative. So, that\u2019s -- we\u2019ll never jeopardize the balance sheet. Now, I don\u2019t think we get rewarded for it as much as we probably should. But that\u2019s fine. It is what it is. I don\u2019t think the rating agencies appreciated it as much as they should. But that\u2019s fine. It is what it is. And so for us -- I just think, we\u2019re never going to be wildly aggressive on buying our stock back just because we want that ultimate flexibility. But the priorities are we\u2019ll continue to buy stock back, the biggest priority we have obviously is we\u2019re really excited about all this mixed use stuff that we\u2019re doing and some of these big projects. That\u2019s going to be the future of a lot of investment and growth. And then, we may take the Company in the different direction. Michael Bilerman mentioned the consumer. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t rule out some interesting things from us down the road, because I think -- I just think we have the ability to do stuff like that that we should rule out.","So, I hope that answers your question. And thankfully, we have a $1.5 billion cash flow after dividend that we can put back into the business. And we\u2019re not over our skis. So, if we end up in a really tough recessionary environment, we\u2019re not going to -- and I wrote this in my letter. We are not -- again, we are not going to -- the development community historically leverage-leverage, increase rates of return, blah, blah, blah. We are never going to push that to the limit even though it makes your return on investment that much better and all the other metrics associated with it. It\u2019s just not who we are. So, I mean, I -- it\u2019s a long winded answer. But, I mean -- so, we\u2019ll continue to kind of -- what we\u2019re doing I think right now is what we\u2019ll continue to do. But, I want the option that if obviously if it gets different, I am going to step one thing up or decrease one thing up. That allows us. We have the optionality to do that.","Floris van Dijkum","One other question, David, I\u2019d love to get your color on what you think the Unibail entry into the U.S. by Westfield means for the global retail dynamics and also for the U.S. mall dynamics?","David Simon","Well, first of all I would say, one or two points. One is, people that are looking for a mark on values, it\u2019s a very, very healthy mark; and two is operationally, I don\u2019t see -- we\u2019ll wait to see. I mean, I\u2019ll reserve judgment there but I don\u2019t see a big significant change. I mean Westfield did a good job before. I am sure they\u2019ll do a good job after. But, I think the most important thing is that there is a very healthy mark-out there if you are interested in those marks. I think from our standpoint, we will little to no impact.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Linda Tsai of Barclays. Your line is open.","Linda Tsai","Do you have any comments on 1Q traffic across the different property types? What kind of uptick are you seeing, given improve trends coming out of the better holiday season?","David Simon","I\u2019d say, generally, it was -- I mean, wasn\u2019t like up 5%, it was up around 1 across the board and it didn\u2019t really matter if there were outlets or malls; it was kind of across the board. The outlets tend to get a little bit more to hit because of the weather. But, even though -- even they were up.","Linda Tsai","Are you seeing tourism come back to the outlet?","David Simon","Yes, we are, even though it\u2019s not as robust as it has been. It continues to move. Outlet sales were really, really nice in the first quarter. So, a lot more retailers are doing better. So, we were very pleased generally with the outlet results.","Linda Tsai","Great. And then, can you offer some insights on Kl\u00e9pierre walking away from its bid of Hammerson. What might have been the thinking behind that?","David Simon","Well, it\u2019s really -- even though lots of discussion on this. Kl\u00e9pierre, there\u2019s a supervisor board and executive board. We\u2019re on the supervisory board but the executive Board really runs the company and makes those decisions. So, it\u2019s really more important to hear from them. That was a Kl\u00e9pierre led efforts in transaction. Obviously, they didn\u2019t do it without the supervisory board giving them the green light to do yes or no. But it\u2019s really that\u2019s question is really much better directed toward them.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Christy McElroy of Citi. Your line is now open.","Michael Bilerman","Hey. David, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman with two quick follow-ups. Is there anything with all the things going on with all of your competitors, whether it is the Westfield-Unibail merger, the GGP-Brookfield deal, clearly you\u2019ve had management changes that may assert in financial activism, the activism [indiscernible]. Does this allow Simon at all to take advantage of all those things going on for shareholders at all, in terms of just operations and dealing with things and there is just more on uncertainty at all your competitors, not from an M&A perspective.","David Simon","I don\u2019t think so. I mean, I think they are all running their business I think very effectively. So, I don\u2019t see that at all. They all have the good -- the ones you mentioned all have good properties, good management teams. I would imagine all of that\u2019s business as usual, regardless of whatever corporate activities going on. So, I don\u2019t think so.","Michael Bilerman","You\u2019re not hearing that from me retailers that just may like loves drama going on in C suite or corporate at all?","David Simon","Not at all.","Michael Bilerman","And then just going back to this whole thing there, returns and the leases and you\u2019re comment about the CAM audits and the movement towards fixed CAM and how that changed. Is there any change in the way you\u2019re doing new lease agreements to address this for you to make sure that you\u2019re getting your fair share, percentage rents and the right rent at the end of the day for a space?","David Simon","Well, I mean that\u2019s a really good question and it\u2019s a big question. And every retailer is different. It\u2019s just - -I mean, believe it or not Rick, me, John Rulli and his team, I mean we\u2019re -- every retail is different. We\u2019re very focused on it. There\u2019s not a standard response yet, but it\u2019s -- it needs to be addressed in the future leases. Because we all -- we don\u2019t mind internet sales. I mean, because we do think there\u2019s a lot of returns associated with it. We obviously want those returns in the store because that facilitates a trip and it helps the retailer. And it\u2019s all just a function of making sure it\u2019s appropriately dealt with. So, it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s not an adversarial scenario but it just needs to be appropriately addressed. And we\u2019re in the midst of trying to figure out what\u2019s the right approach.","And unfortunately, there\u2019s not a cookie-cutter answer because every retailer does a little bit different. But it\u2019s not -- we want the returns in the store. We want the trip in the store. But it -- as you know, I have been like, don\u2019t worry too much about sales and I\u2019ve been too prudent [ph] on that. And I understand why the market doesn\u2019t like my view of that. But the reality, it\u2019s becoming even -- there\u2019s even a bigger gap on the focus on this because there\u2019s more -- certainly more business being done online but that also means more returns. And the consumer likes to do the returns in the store. And the reality is this whole green effort, we wrote a white paper three-four years ago about the fact that we all want higher levels of sustainability from an energy point of view. And the reality is the internet and the constant packaging and the constant state of returns is really a lot less green than doing your trip in total. So, there\u2019s a lot of stuff on this but I don\u2019t want to bore you.","But point is, I don\u2019t have a good answer for you yet other than we\u2019re working cooperatively with our clients to find out what the right answer is. And it\u2019s not a fair share thing, it\u2019s just -- as long as we have to report that number, I want -- we need to somehow -- the market needs to understand there\u2019s this issue that\u2019s out there.","Michael Bilerman","And I wanted to congratulate Andy on his retirement, next to go out with a $30 billion balance sheet at under 3.5% rate with a seven-year average maturity, certainly calling it probably the peak from that perspective. But, is there any comments in terms of CFO process? What you\u2019re go through internal versus external and how you think that\u2019s going to be, timing wise?","David Simon","So, first of all, Andy, we\u2019ll say goodbye to Andy, not till the end of this year. But, Andy has done a fantastic job as we all know. And when I wrote the comments about his retirement, I really, really meant them and not that I don\u2019t mean what I write. But the fact of the matter is that I felt a -- in my heart how I felt about Andy. He\u2019s done a tremendous job. He has done such a good job that there is no financing that we need to do. Okay? So, that\u2019s kind of ironic, right? So this is a CFO that\u2019s done such a great job, the reality is there\u2019s nothing to do. I\u2019m kidding. There is always something to do. But currently, the simple answer is, we -- looking more internally. We have some really good internal candidates. And I\u2019m thinking more of that as opposed to external. But, I haven\u2019t put a pin in it yet. But Andy\u2019s done a unbelievable job with the balance sheet. He and I have worked together 25 years. He\u2019s got the best relationships in the industry, banking industry. And we will certainly miss him but the reality is he\u2019s done such a good job, there is nothing to do.","David Simon","16 billion in the last three years, plus to revolvers that you got a great internal group that can step up into your commence, we always set a great infrastructure here with very, very strong candidate and the team environment in the finance department.","Andy Juster","$16 billion in the last three years, plus two revolvers. But, you\u2019ve got a great internal group that can step up in an year\u2019s time. We\u2019ve always had a great infrastructure here with very, very candidates. And it\u2019s a team environment in the finance department.","David Simon","So, the answer is I\u2019m thinking about it. I\u2019m getting closer and closer. But Andy is right, it\u2019s a team effort. But, it\u2019ll develop this year.","Christy McElroy","David, it\u2019s Christy, just one more quick one for me. You suggested buybacks are likely to continue. To what extent are assumptions for additional buybacks from here contemplated in the current FFO guidance range?","David Simon","They really aren\u2019t other than what we\u2019ve already done.","Operator","And that concludes our Q&A session for today. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr.David Simon for any further remarks.","David Simon","All right. Thank you everyone. I appreciate your questions and your comments.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. Tom Ward, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Tom Ward","Thank you, Whitley. Good morning and welcome to Simon Property Group\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Presenting on today\u2019s call is David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also on the call are Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; Andy Juster, Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Broadwater, Chief Accounting Officer.","Before we begin, a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. We refer you to today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements.","Please note that this call includes information that maybe accurate only as of today\u2019s date. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the press release and the supplemental information in today\u2019s Form 8-K filing. Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com. For our prepared remarks, I\u2019m pleased to introduce David Simon.","David Simon","Okay. Good morning. We had a strong start to 2015. As you know, we closed on the acquisition of Jersey Gardens and University Park Village, two great properties that we are excited to have in our portfolio. We created two joint ventures with two of our longstanding retail partners, one with Hudson's Bay Company and the other with Sears Holdings which will serve as additional avenues for growth. And of course we continue to produce strong operating and financial performance.","As you know, results in the quarter were highlighted by funds from operation of $2.28 per share, exceeding once again the First Call consensus by $0.03. And that was achieved even though we had a decrease of approximately $0.03 for the quarter due to the strong dollar against the euro and the yen. And on a comparable basis excluding the operating results from WPG properties in the prior year period. Our FFO per share increased 6.5% or $0.14 even with the currency devaluation.","Let me turn to our operating metrics, cash flow. Occupancy was 95.8%, leasing activity remains strong and healthy. The malls and premium outlets recorded leasing spreads of $11.19 per square foot, an increase of 18.9%. Now let\u2019s talk about comp NOI. Comp NOI increased 3.5% in the first quarter of 2015, compared to an increase of 5.3% in the first quarter of 2014. As a reminder, approximately 95% of our domestic property NOI is included in our comp NOI calculation. And very importantly with respect to this quarter, our comp NOI in the first quarter was negatively impacted by about 50 basis points, due to a significant overage retroactive billing within the mills in the first quarter of 2014 and if you remember, we put in the mills in terms of our comp NOI beginning last year.","If you wanted to understand our comp NOI on the outlets and the malls it\u2019s approximately 4%, and right on our budget. Total sales across our portfolio increased 2% in the first quarter, compared to the first quarter of last year and I will also point out there was a recent pitch affirming our A rating. They did a report that I would suggest at the Analytic community review just to put in the back of your mind on our comp NOI growth.","We have exceeded our peers by an average of 240 basis points from the period of time of 2005 to 2014. I thought that was interesting reading, in any event let\u2019s go to construction. We continue new premium outlets in Gloucester, which will serve the South Jersey in Philadelphia areas and new centers in Tampa and Tucson, as well as our designer outlet in Vancouver. All our great high quality major markets and each is scheduled to open later this year.","We are slated to begin construction on as many as three additional domestic premium outlets in 2015, as well as three international outlets in 2015 for a total of six. We are beginning side work shortly at the shops at Clearfork, which as you know is our new full price development in Ft. Worth anchored by Neiman. We plan on opening that in early 2017. Yesterday, we were excited to announce our partnership with Swire and the Whitman family for the retail component of Brickell City Centre, which is anchored by Saks.","We look forward to contributing our leasing and management expertise to this signature project, which includes a significant residential component and that will open in the fall of 2016 and on Oyster Bay, which we are renaming Syosset Park. We have began the approval process for what will be a unique mixed use life style center with retail office hotel park for the families of the Oyster Bay area and residential components. Initial feedback on our plan has been positive. We expect the process to go well.","On the redevelopment and expansion we\u2019ve got 24 properties across our three platforms in the U.S. and Asia for a total commitment of $1.8 billion at the end of the first quarter. During the quarter, we completed a 265,000 square foot expansion at Yeoju Premium Outlets in Seoul and recently completed a 136,000 square foot expansion of Shisui Premium Outlets in Tokyo, both off to great starts; and let\u2019s not forget construction continues on major re-development expansion projects at some of our most productive malls, all under construction including, but not limited to Roosevelt Field, The Galleria in Houston, Stanford Shopping Center, King of Prussia, Del Amo, and our premium outlets in Woodbury, Las Vegas, and San Francisco, and Chicago, all under construction, all bringing significant amount of new square footage for 2016 and over the next 18 months.","Kl\u00e9pierre, we were pleased to have played the key role in Kl\u00e9pierre\u2019s acquisition of Corio, which became effective at the end of March, creating the leading pure-play retail property company in Continental Europe. We now have a \u20ac21 billion portfolio in 16 countries. And to remind the investment community, this was a \u20ac7.4 billion M&A transaction. We are pleased to see the rebound in the European shopper. Kl\u00e9pierre will report the results next week and we expect a higher and stronger growth portfolio given the acquisition.","Capital markets, we expanded our $2 billion revolving credit facility to $2.75 billion and extended its maturity to 2020. Our current liquidity, including revolvers and cash on hands is over $6 billion. Our industry leading balance sheet continues to differentiate us from our peer group.","As you know, we announced a $2 billion share repurchase program. We have not yet repurchased any shares as a result of our trading window blackout due to earnings and the timing of our buyback announcement. And proudly, we are proud to announce yet another dividend increase of $1.50, which is a year-over-year increase of 15% and a 7% increase from the first quarter of 2015. Again, nobody has got our dividend growth. We will pay at least $5.90, an increase of nearly, as I said, 15% from last year.","So let me turn to guidance. We\u2019ve increased our guidance based on our view of the year, again, from $9.65 to $9.75, again, nobody in our peer group has the kind of growth that we have. And we continue to feel very comfortable, as I mentioned to you, on the comp NOI growth of 4% for the year for malls, Premium Outlets and Mills.","And we are ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, good morning. It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Christy.","David Simon","How are you doing?","Michael Bilerman","Great. So, David, I was curious as to how you think about your stake in Macerich at this point. You sort of view it as a $470 million mall, that\u2019s given you a 3% yield, you think it is potentially worth $570, or do you sort of view it as worth $470 million, you bought it for $370 million, you have a $100 million and sort of take that money and go home?","David Simon","Well, Michael, frankly, since we were not able to engage with Macerich, even though we tried very hard to, as you know, we put what I felt was a unbelievable hell of an offer on the table and I, obviously, tried very hard to engage. We have been so busy between the Sears and the HBC, finishing Brickell, doing Clearfork, making sure our redevelopment is on time and on budget. The three new deals that we have internationally, I have really not had the luxury of figuring out what I\u2019m going to do with that stake.","So at this point, I can\u2019t really answer your question, but at some point, I will address it in the near future. But we had just been too busy running the business, producing very good strong results, raising the dividend, doing the buyback, doing all the redevelopment, all the new ventures that I haven\u2019t really sat down and figure out what to do next. I\u2019m open to your ideas if you have any though.","Michael Bilerman","Yeah. I don\u2019t think I should publicly say that on a call. In terms of Europe and you talked about the Kl\u00e9pierre Corio transaction and being instrumental in that deal, as you think about potentially putting additional to Europe when you originally made the state, the euro was about EUR 1.30, you are under EUR 1.10 today, you obviously have some hedge because you have some euro denominated debt. But I am just curious as you think about potentially taking your stake backup to a 30% level, if that\u2019s in the cards and putting capital out given where the euro is and how you sort of think about that.","David Simon","Well, that kind of opportunity is always on the table. I will say that, we are up a EUR 1.4 billion in our investment. Guys, right?","Andrew Juster","Yeah.","David Simon","So that\u2019s not too shabby of a trade if I can quote out on Sandler who is one of my heroes. I quoted him last year, not last year but in 2013 annual letter, but all you talk about is Steve Ross letter, he haven\u2019t mentioned mine but I thought I had a pretty good line in there. I mentioned in our call I think people who site, we did helped engineer a $7.4 billion European merger. That again is not to \u2013 don\u2019t underestimate the fact and the role that I played \u2013 we played in putting together those two companies that was a EUR7.4 billion investment. And as you know that the capital going towards Europe and the timing of that deal I think is going to be very attractive for us in the long run. So I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with my investment, but we will just see how that evolves. There were couple other large shareholders, they certainly haven\u2019t indicated to me anytime that they\u2019re going to \u2013 that they\u2019re looking to get out. I think they are very pleased with what those transpired since our involvement over the last three years.","Christy McElroy","Hi, good morning, David. It\u2019s Christy here. You\u2019ve talked often about your larger regional model re-development and expansion projects, but I am wondering with the new Hudson's Bay and Sears JVs and this may be more or so with the Sears boxes. But is your new control over [indiscernible] boxes unlock any future potential major redevelopment projects in any of your centers or is it too early to tell? And maybe you could just provide some general comments on the future opportunities for investments that could arise from these JV?","David Simon","Well, I think the JV with Sears clearly is all about redeveloping those boxes with Sears potentially as taking some of that space and in some cases maybe not. And as also part of that deal, we bought the Plaza store which is a fantastic mall, does I don\u2019t know 750 a day of food. It got a lot of demand. So that also gives us the ability to look at expanding that mall. So the answer, I don\u2019t want to put a number on it Christy but I would definitely say that it\u2019s all about retaining with Sears maybe downsizing their stores and then into Plaza certainly \u2013 there is a major expansion in the works there that we are going to move very, very fast on. And that will, the Plaza just is a general scope, will get couple of hundred million bucks at the end of the day. So all of that was part of about \u2013 all of that was done in the mind to faster redevelopment for sure.","Christy McElroy","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Craig Schmidt","Thank you. This is something related to Christy\u2019s last question. There seems to be more churning in both the mall, especially in the mall anchor space. I am just wondering from Simon\u2019s mall portfolio perspective, is that actually an opportunity for you, something you actually would welcome just given your dominant portfolio and opportunities at distance you from your peers?","David Simon","I would say we have \u2013 we don\u2019t use the word dominant here. We have a very high quality portfolio that\u2019s produced outsize comp NOI growth with our peer over and I know we get focused on a quarter here, quarter there, but if you look over any kind of extended period of time we\u2019ve clearly outperformed our peer group. I would say there is, there is not a lot of churning in the department store world, I think we have brick one, empty box out of how many Rick?","Richard Sokolov","450 onwards.","David Simon","And what is that one, I should know it actually.","Richard Sokolov","It\u2019s in [indiscernible].","David Simon","Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah that\u2019s a tough one. But in any event like in Riverside, we got the Saks building back we actually just approved internally yesterday a whole redevelopment of that Box, so we were down to one box, but clearly on the specialty side we did lose a handful of retailers and I think at the end of the day there will be an opportunity from it obviously we are focused on releasing it on that space, but we are going to put in better retailers and as you know, I mean the retail business like any business in today\u2019s environment is Darwinian and the retailers that are going away are relatively weaker ones. There is a whole host of stronger ones in the pipeline that we would expect to be able to add excitement to our properties and ultimately increase our cash flow from their participation in our building. So, that\u2019s the nature of our business.","As you know Craig, we like showing the slide about the top 10 retailers at 93, we went public till today, it is a little more going on today then maybe it was a year or two ago, but nothing that we are overly concerned about and we are poised to do the work necessary to make these properties better and obviously having a high quality portfolio like we do will make it happen.","Craig Schmidt","Okay and then just beside your significant redevelopment pipeline efforts. Are there any emerging areas or real estate formats that you are looking to down the road that could be in the area of growth for Simon?","David Simon","Like other users or\u2026?","Craig Schmidt","I mean obviously you haven\u2019t been that interested in highs steel, but is there, I mean just thinking you know the malls is mature business at some point the opportunities for premium outlet slow and then what are you seeing maybe five years down the road that might be an opportunity to grow?","David Simon","Well, look we have always looked. I think the Hudson Bay joint venture is going to give us another avenue of gross in that whole single credit tenant kind of business, both internationally in the U.S. you know street retail potentially out of that I don\u2019t know, you know the values there are pretty salty when the deals that we have seen. So, you know I think Craig, we\u2019ve always been creative in trying to find other areas, it will focus around retail real estate, but we are not concerned not at all about not being able to find avenues of growth, but clearly we still got a big pipeline of redevelopment.","The outlet business, our outlet business is very strong. So, we posted great comp NOI numbers this quarter. Sales were very strong. So, we see that growth continuing and then with the redevelopment that we are doing at some of our iconic mall properties, again these aren\u2019t pipe dreams. They are \u2013 Houston Galleria, Roosevelt Field, Stanford Galleria, Del Amo, King of Prussia I mean this stuff is, maybe we should put on our website to show you the steel, but this stuff is all happening. So, we got plenty to say grace over right now.","Craig Schmidt","Okay, thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Jeff Donnelly","Good morning, guys. Just a first question on \u2013 back on Macerich. What were the pursuit costs related there? And I guess where do they fall in your Q1 numbers?","David Simon","It\u2019s in other expense and they are done and we have no more.","Jeff Donnelly","Are you able to give an estimate or?","David Simon","Immaterial. I mean, I don\u2019t know \u2013 I don\u2019t want to \u2013 it basic \u2013 immaterial. We do a lot of this in-house, you are looking at them.","Jeff Donnelly","Okay.","David Simon","For better or worse, okay?","Jeff Donnelly","And you work cheaply. So\u2026","David Simon","Some may argue that. But the point is, for better or worse, you are looking at the M&A guide here, okay?","Jeff Donnelly","Okay. Maybe to switch gears, I\u2019m just curious on occupancy. I think Q1 occupancy was down a little bit year-over-year; and maybe I missed it in your remarks, but is that just a return to a more normal \u2013 what I will call sort of pullback post-holiday, or is there something else going on there?","David Simon","Well, I would say, Jeff, we clearly \u2013 normally, we are always going to close 60 bps to 80 bps from the seasonality part of our business, right? We had more than that this time and that\u2019s all related to, I\u2019d say, another 50 bps or so, all related to bankruptcies.","Jeff Donnelly","Okay.","David Simon","And, again, we had planned that, that\u2019s why we were cautious on our comp NOI growth, so there is no surprise there. Cautious being \u2013 I\u2019d argue 4% is not \u2013 is pretty significant when I look at other categories, I look at office, I look at industrial, I look at across the platform, 4% ain\u2019t too bad. But nevertheless, it is a little bit lower and it was all because we were planning the guys that were on the ropes. And the guys that were on the ropes ended up on the mat, so to speak. In the spirit of the upcoming Pacquiao\/Mayweather fight, okay?","Jeff Donnelly","Okay.","David Simon","They ended up on the mat.","Rick Sokolov","The only thing I would say, Jeff, is we expect that occupancy to go up as we move through the year and get some of that space redeployed, which we\u2019re in the process of doing right now.","Jeff Donnelly","Yes, because I think at the end of the fourth quarter you guys were looking for sort of flat occupancy by year end. I wasn\u2019t sure if that was still the case.","Rick Sokolov","Yeah.","David Simon","Yeah, look, could we be a few basis points below it? Sure. But, again, you also have to factor in we\u2019ve got a lot of redevelopment going on. So our portfolio is in a pretty significant \u2013 undergoing a pretty significant activities going on. So it will be very close to that number.","Jeff Donnelly","I saw that David Contis was working on converting temporary space to permanent space. How much do you guys have in the way of short-term tenancy today, and how does that compare to history?","David Simon","It\u2019s been going down pretty significantly. I\u2019m going to say, again, we don\u2019t \u2013 in our occupancy, we only include folks that have a lease of a year in. So, now we do \u2013 sometimes we do year-to-year leases because we are looking for a better group, but that number has been \u2013 is high. The year-to-year guys have been as high as the mid-5%s, we are down about 4% now, Jeff, roughly, rough numbers, right, guys?","Rick Sokolov","Yeah.","David Simon","Getting close, we will get there.","Jeff Donnelly","And just the last question or two is on WP Glimcher. Is there a set date when you expect that arrangement on providing services to end?","David Simon","May 16th is the end of that right, Rick?","Rick Sokolov","May 2016","David Simon","Yeah.","Jeff Donnelly","Okay. Then on Oyster Bay, how close are you guys \u2013","David Simon","Let me clarify May 2016, not May 16th. Okay?","Jeff Donnelly","Right, right. And just on Oyster Bay, how close are you guys to getting the necessary approvals to move ahead there?","David Simon","Look it is a process; I think by the end of this year, we will be in very good shape. But we have a lot \u2013 there is a lot to go through. So we are shooting the next six months or so are going to be very important but that\u2019s how we are thinking about the timing.","Jeff Donnelly","Okay. Thanks guys.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Please proceed.","Ross Nussbaum","Hey, guys. Good morning.","David Simon","How are you?","Ross Nussbaum","David, let me first ask in stock buyback. Do you intend to actually buyback any stock around the current levels or was it put in place as a placeholder or was it a statement to Macerich a little of everything.","David Simon","Well, I mean I think the REIT market I would say this obviously I am not going to tell you when or how we\u2019re going to buy stock back, but I would say we wouldn\u2019t have announced it once we were serious about it. We couldn\u2019t buy any stock back because we were in our blackout period when the announcement came. And as I look at other companies and their valuation and I look at ours, and our growth prospects and our track record, I continue to think we are extremely well positioned. As I look at history year-after-year, quarter-after-quarter and all that we\u2019ve got going on, look at our valuation compared to our peer group and I feel very comfortable that we are a very strong and good investment.","Now with the added volatility in the REIT sector, we want to be able to take advantage of that volatility. So I think you will see us at the appropriate times of volatility and no statement had nothing to do with Macerich obviously had that deal gone forward maybe the capital would have been allotted differently, but I look at our growth profile, I look at the history of our results, I look at our balance sheet, I look at the peer group, I look at revaluations generally and I think I can\u2019t pick a better investment than ours as we look forward. So we will take advantage of volatility. We\u2019ll do this opportunistically and you will see us in the market at the appropriate times.","Ross Nussbaum","Okay. Appreciate that. Can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on in the department store industry right now? And I know you\u2019ve got different motivating factors behind what happened with Hudson\u2019s Bay and with what is going on with Sears. I guess a couple of questions. One is, did you discuss with Sears or do they want to sell you more than what you actually bought? I am curious what you think of their, I\u2019ll call it spin rights offering and do you see other department store companies also transacting with their real estate any time soon?","David Simon","Well, look I would say that Sears and us got comfortable with the portfolio. It wasn\u2019t dramatically different from the beginning to where we ended up. And I think it\u2019s good to have that kind of relationship. I think it can grow overtime. I think they have valuable real estate and we see [indiscernible] has been able to know as a company we wouldn\u2019t invest in it less we saw that going forward. And frankly, Hudson\u2019s Bay I think they \u2013 I really like their management team. I really like that real estate being a partner with them and their real estate and looking for future growth opportunities, [indiscernible] and other avenue of growth. So I see that as another very good opportunity.","Could other retailers take advantage of their inherent real estate value? Sure, but if they do it to the extent or they\u2019ve got a balloon if they squeeze one end too high, you got to be very careful on how they do it. But if they\u2019re thoughtful about how they want to take advantage of the real estate, I am sure those value to be made for their shareholders. But that\u2019s not necessarily a focus for us. We are very pleased to have partnered with both these folks and we expect them to grow. Rick?","Richard Sokolov","The only other thing that I would add is that it does put a spotlight on the fact that the credit worthiness and operating stability of our department store companies I believe is greater than the analyst in the investment community has recognized before and when we\u2019ve said all along we thought that they were in a stable position. I think that\u2019s being worn-out by the ability to add financial stability by taking a focus on the real estate asset.","Ross Nussbaum","And David did you separate out the Hudson's Bay venture from SPG because you didn\u2019t want a bunch of boring long terms net leases in SPG or was there something other than that?","David Simon","Well I think it is part of SPG and first of all it hasn\u2019t actually closed yet. We are closing when we announced that it should be closing in the next, by the end of the quarter probably, but we\u2019ve always view that is ultimately a standalone business going forward. Now that will help grow faster, the credit, the net lease retailer, I mean we \u2013 they are great retailers. We are going to run that joint venture. They\u2019ve got great real estate entrepreneurs. We certainly can underwrite retail credit. We have ideas on how to grow that business. So, ultimately that business could in fact end up separated from us, but we will want to add value to it through our deal making capabilities and yes it probably, if it ends up more focused on the credit, you know the credit lease business you know it\u2019s \u2013 that probably is better separated from SPG in long run, but of that is to be determined whilst as we go forward.","Ross Nussbaum","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler ONeill. Please proceed.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning. David just a few questions here, first you brought up the rating agencies in your comments. So, two questions on that, one is the 7% cap rate that they are using clearly we\u2019ve had a number of demonstrable mall trades that show cap rates are well below, so curious if they are going to move away from the 7% and second on that is, as you guys entertain the Macerich to buy them, did the rating agencies do any push back to you guys on your rating or their view is they know who you are and even if anything was breached they know that you would resolve that in due course and therefore a rating impact was unlikely.","David Simon","Well. Look I will speak to the last first, I mean, no they have all the confidence in the world in us when it comes to doing a transaction of that nature that we were \u2013 that we did not expect to be downgraded or notched at all, right Andy?","Andrew Juster","Right. I mean they\u2019ve done $40 billion of acquisition and they\u2019ve been very pleased with the results.","David Simon","So, and again as not that this is all that interesting anymore, but part of the reason we were selling assets to GGP was in fact, you know the primary reason was in fact to make sure that our A rating would stay in place. As far as the seven, yes they should update it, it\u2019s silly. But you know\u2026","Andrew Juster","It is a disastrous scenario\u2026","David Simon","But they are being conservative. It\u2019s not market, I agree with you. I don\u2019t know what to do about it.","Andrew Juster","I used to be eight and nine.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. So, glacial compression there. Second question is, on the Hudson Bay can you just talk a little bit about the challenges of having real estate and other people centers and we\u2019ve seen other companies in the past trying to do that hasn\u2019t worked out, was there a different perspective that you guys have on making that work or how should we think that this time it may work versus what we\u2019ve seen historically?","David Simon","That\u2019s not really even there is no thinking that boy it\u2019s great to have own real estate in other peoples centers. That\u2019s really not \u2013 this is a growth vehicle to go find other opportunities in the credit world based on retail real estate. Right now, Hudson\u2019s Bay has all of the plans to operate those stores, so there is nothing about in that sense. Obviously if for whatever reason they decide to not to operate the store, we would have that opportunity. So that\u2019s really not anywhere near on the agenda.","We value this at a pretty attractive cap rate 6% and 8% in really good mall. So we think it\u2019s attractive accretive transaction for us from a value point of view, and it\u2019s really about creating the entity to go do more stuff and seeding it with these stores as opposed to we\u2019re going to go play. We have no intention at all to go play any kind of habit or anything in other people\u2019s mall, so that\u2019s not even on the agenda.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then just finally, your presentation on Macerich you guys disclosed your top center productivity and some of your mall stats. If there is any way if that could be obviously quarterly would be great, but annually I mean it was tremendous retail candy for us and obviously helps in the analysis of you guys. So if there is a suggestion box, would love to see that on an annual basis.","David Simon","Speaking of suggestion boxes, I better not say this because I might get criticized but I remember at a golf club that was built by Pete and Dye, a Crooked Stick here in Indianapolis. And the member\u2019s suggestion box is in the middle of the pond, okay. But I will not, that will not be duly noted and I am not saying that but duly noted. And look I think we put that together because we felt it was important if there are any confusion about stuff that was said there, we wanted to clarify that.","Frankly, Alex, we look at ourselves differently than a collection of assets, but duly noted express \u2013 everybody express their views on that. To Tom, we have been I think as clear and as articulate in our financial presentations as anybody. We have never wavered from FFO as an example. We delivered via the white paper. Occasionally like with WP Spin we separate that out because it\u2019s important to note a transaction of that nature but we give you WP first or we give you FFO first and then we show you whatever is important to change.","So I feel like we necessarily are a little different in that area, but duly noted we won\u2019t make [indiscernible] to the pond to put in your suggestion. We will take it up Tom and we\u2019ll see about it in the future.","Alexander Goldfarb","Awesome. Thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Good morning, David.","David Simon","Hi.","Steve Sakwa","Couple of questions, I don\u2019t think you disclosed the percentage ownership in the Brickell transaction. Is that something you could provide and what role exactly is Simon playing in this development?","David Simon","We\u2019re going to have a 25% interest in the retail and we are going to see the manager of the retail portion of the project and we are going to be leaving the leasing effort along with Swire and Whitman Property.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. So you will be the \u2013 I guess the leasing agent on this.","David Simon","Yeah.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. I guess David on Copley, I didn\u2019t hear any talk on that. Where do we stand on the residential project?","David Simon","Well, we have an upcoming BRA meeting which is there in the next month. We are hopeful to get approved and there will be a couple other hurdles after that, but that puts us on the path to start construction. So the next month or so we thought we were going to be able to do it. This month things got a little, couple of political things happened out of control, but we\u2019ve been assured that we can get back on the agenda here in this upcoming month.","Steve Sakwa","No, it sounds like maybe kind of June, July start.","David Simon","Yes. I think we should, we feel comfortable by July. We will have all of the permits and all of the approvals done. You know it\u2019s a fluid situation, but that\u2019s correct.","Steve Sakwa","And if that\u2019s the case I guess when would the sales process, like just help us think through the timing if you start construction. When does a sales office start, just how far after that, is that a year later?","David Simon","That\u2019s not going to start for a year after that, only because you know the complexity of this build is significant. So we have to go down the turnpike support the foundation and then we got to go into Neiman Marcus store, relay that and then go up. So, there is no real need to rush that. I\u2019d say roughly a year from now that would be the focus, a lots going on at the mall. We are going to start the renovation of the actual interior of it. We are going to do the south west portal entrance. So there is a lot \u2013 we are finishing the office reno, so it is a property that were a lot is going on, but I\u2019d say the sales office would be probably roughly a year from now.","Steve Sakwa","Okay and then last question, I mean you mentioned all of the major projects you\u2019ve got going on in the U.S. here, I am just curious how do you feel about sort of the international investment opportunities versus domestic?","David Simon","Well, with the outlet business, you know we\u2019ve got, I mentioned in my call we have three that we think we\u2019re going to start this year. We have great outlet in Provence partnering with MGE, McArthurGlen. We\u2019ve got a new site with fantastic developer in Mexico [indiscernible] which has built some of the best malls who is our partner in Mexico City. We expect that to start this year and then we\u2019ve got with Genting Group, we are very close to finalizing the deal to start our second outlet in Malaysia and I mentioned to you we just finished Yeoju and Shisui expansion. So that\u2019s a lot of activity internationally. We are also working on a couple of other opportunities in the outlet with some new joint ventures and then we have got another site, two sites in Canada.","So, internationally on the development front with the outlet, premium outlet product we are busy. And then again, with Kl\u00e9pierre we help do this huge deal that here domestically people don\u2019t think about, but it was a 7.4 billion euro deal. They just closed March 31. They also bought a great asset in Spain shortly thereafter, you know there is tremendous amount going on with the integration and the portfolio review of the long terms assets. There is a lot of development work going on as well within the total combined portfolio. So, that to us is kind of we view that as our full price retail entity going forward in continental Europe and I expect that company to continue to grow. So, we are active internationally. I don\u2019t see us buying full price retail in Asia or other parts, I mean I think right now it is kind of finding new markets for our premium outlook product.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. Thanks.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St Juste with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Haendel St. Juste","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you guys \u2013 I guess first question just on the factors behind your higher FFO guidance, curious if there is any changes to your FX outlook and the middle guidance. And if there is any level of perhaps share repurchase baked into the full year with outlook?","David Simon","The answer is no on the share buyback and no \u2013 we\u2019ve factored in the currency where it is today. So we have a few cents. Last quarter, quarter one of \u201914 the Euro was $1.37 average, this year it was $1.13 so that\u2019s a pretty big gap, now it\u2019s $1.08.","Andrew Juster","41%, right.","David Simon","We are pretty proud that we took a $0.03 hit in our Q1 \u201915 and still beat consensus pretty good within our numbers. It\u2019s clearly going to affect our total. We have $0.10 roughly year-over-year that was in that range. We have a little bit exposure, but drops further but nothing that we can\u2019t deal with.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay, fair enough. And following up on the Miami project with Swire, just want to clarify first. The 25% ownership, that\u2019s just on the retail or is that the entire project?","David Simon","Just the retail.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay. And then the strategic decision involved with the project now. Why now did you approach them, did they approach you and then how should we think about the project in terms of merchandising mix? It looks like GDP their nearby design district has a bit of stranglehold on luxury. How much of a challenge do you think that might present your ability to track a higher tier tenant retailers?","David Simon","Well, they approached us and look we have been involved in this for a while. We feel unbelievably confident we are going to deliver obviously they designed it and they\u2019ve done the most of the work, but we feel together we\u2019re going to deliver a great product that I think is going to the marketplace. There is no question that this is going to be a unique terrific long term mixed use retail asset. I think it will blow \u2013 I think it\u2019s going to blow people\u2019s minds away and the leasing. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress on leasing and we are very, very confident about our ability to deliver a very, very compelling mix.","Andrew Juster","The only thing I would add is that this project in and of itself as a hotel to condo towers and to office towers and surrounding it, there is another eight or nine residential office and hotel projects going on in the hotter brick haul. So it\u2019s a very young, very sophisticated and very well paced submarket inside of the State County overall market we are very excited about it.","Haendel St. Juste","Too early to talk about target yields?","Richard Sokolov","Yeah. Look since we have partners in there, it will be put in our 8-K but that kind of stuff is probably not going to be singled-out out of respect for partners, but we think it\u2019s an attractive investment and we wouldn\u2019t make it otherwise. And as I said, this will be produced in a very high level. Swire and the Whitman family are first-class operators you couldn\u2019t pick that of partners and we all know Bell Harbor for sure and we all know what Swire has done in China and Hong Kong. It built some of the most amazing stuff. So to be associated with those kind of folks on a long term basis, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased and we will make money in this investment, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t do it.","Haendel St. Juste","Could there be more or you contemplating additional investments with Swire or is it again too early to talk about that?","David Simon","We are not in Hong Kong and this is their big investment in the U.S. which certainly have a lot of respect for that organization.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay but just to be clear at this point there is nothing talked about perhaps overseas with them in Asia, Hong Kong or China.","David Simon","No.","Haendel St. Juste","Alright thank you guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Andrew Rosivach","Sorry guys I tried to get out of the queue it was running away, but really quick, you guys have listed amazing metrics, specially relative basis, especially when you are taking to account leverage and unfortunately you can go through quarters where that actually doesn\u2019t influence your share price and I am just curious just in terms of, unfortunately my clients have tried to get rate and discussions over the last couple of quarters, you know when you bid for another company that your shareholder don\u2019t own you can actually harm the relative performance of your supporters and I\u2019m just wondering like is that part of the decision making process you kind of know it will hurt and you make the call that the long term gain actually offsets a certain pain or is it not in the calculus?","David Simon","Well we always want feedback from our shareholders and we always take that into account, but hopefully they have confidence in us, but we are making right decisions that will add to the value of their investment and we are always confronted whether it is a M&A deal or new development or redevelopment to weigh short-term paying for long term gain. We thankfully, hopefully will continue, but certainly historically we\u2019ve made pretty good decisions on that front. We\u2019ve certainly have embedded a 1000 of where we\u2019ve been made risky investments. We\u2019ve done it on a low key basis and small basis compared to the enterprise and I go back to two to jump out of me, you know one was the one in China.","The other was in, I call my blue period where we are doing all the technology, you know in the late, whenever I was \u2013 I try to forget about it. Late 90s early 2000, so you know I would say to with this last situation, I mean the shareholders that we spoke to at least what they told me they were supportive of what we were trying to accomplish and that\u2019s what they told me and again, I mean we never got to the point where we were able to lay out all that we could do there, but we certainly always factor that in. We do know that sometimes doing these things is not the easy road. You know the easy road is to just do what a lot of other folks do, which is not a lot, okay. But this company is all about not doing what is easy.","And then it\u2019s easy just to you know I don\u2019t know redevelop a thing here, build something there, but that\u2019s not what we are about, we are about and are trying to make this company unique and when you do that you sometimes you do create short-term confusion and\/or short term underperformance. We hope, all we can do we hope is that people look at the track record and look at dividend growth. I mean 15% dividend growth at a company our size \u2026","Andrew Rosivach","There is not push back on that. There is no push back that you are actually great at doing M&A, it just when it goes on for a quarter and most of my clients are based on one of your performance on a relative basis that after a while it starts to hurt and I even got the impression you know when you wrote your March 20 final offer, I got a sense when you were saying not to go through multi-year proxy, I think you were starting to notice the pain it was creating with your share price.","David Simon","Well look that is a whole different subject that is probably better off, I am happy to have you with or anybody else, but it is probably better off to have that not necessarily on \u2013 in this kind of format, but we \u2013 look short term, we are all about short term gain if there is a long term play there but it\u2019s important to have support from our shareholders. And I can say to you that they were the ones that I talk to or relatively support of what we try to accomplish, but on the other hand going through a multiyear proxy fight et cetera. If we had done that, that\u2019s when we might have lost support. That\u2019s a judgment call I have to make and I made the judgment call and I did. I think the support would have been there had we on the deal, rather the support would have been there on a long drawn out battle, I don\u2019t know. But I decide to not to ask for.","Andrew Rosivach","Thanks for your commentary. Appreciate it.","David Simon","Sure. No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Vincent Chao","Hi, good morning everyone. Just wanted to go back to the FX question a little bit, I appreciate the comments on the earnings side of things. Just curious last quarter we talked a little about the impact on some of the tourism driven markets. Just wondering if you could give I guess an update on what you\u2019re seeing in those markets as it pertains to FX impacts?","David Simon","In the U.S. side with the strong dollar.","Vincent Chao","Right.","David Simon","Yeah, okay. Fair enough. We are seeing a little bit \u2013 I would tell you that it\u2019s just really volatile right now on some of those tourist markets where there is a good month, a good week, and then there is a bad month and a bad week. So it kind of balances out, but I would say it\u2019s safe to say that the strong dollar is affecting to some extent sales in some of the really highly international assets that we have but nothing that\u2019s going to change our financial profile or earnings or any of that. But it is a lot more volatile, you hear occasionally in South Florida a little bit, you hear \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen anything at Woodbury but I\u2019ve heard a lot in New York, now we have no exposure there but you hear and then when I say hear, I\u2019m hearing from the retailers, but with something to pay attention to it.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thanks. And then just more domestically just given the drop in oil prices, it seems like there was expectations that would flow into the economy, but seems like it\u2019s being saved. Just curious if you are seeing anything different from that in your own mall traffic and that kind of that.","David Simon","I\u2019d still say generally we are still dealing with a cautious consumer, it\u2019s safe to say and it\u2019s volatile. So the comment I heard about the tourism also applies to just the domestic consumer as well. The patterns of the consumer are tougher to predict right now. I still think there is \u2013 confidence is getting better, but there is still a lot of debt being reduced and it\u2019s still there is a good month, good week, and then a bad month, a bad week and the pattern is sloppy enough but it\u2019s certainly not getting busters. And look we had 2% total sales increase from quarter-over-quarter \u201914 to \u201915. That\u2019s the kind of world we are in right now. We did get unbelievably so we did not mention this, Nova [ph] mentioned in it so I probably shouldn\u2019t mention it but we had another awful winter in northeast. For those of you in Boston only, we have a lot of exposure in northeast. Believe it or not, our snow expense was higher this year than last year across the portfolio. So we still had to deal with a little bit of the weather, but we are dealing with a cautious consumer and we are delivering \u2013 the good news is, we are delivering results in that environment. That\u2019s all we can do.","Vincent Chao","Okay. Thank you very much.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carol Kemple with Hilliard Lyons. Please proceed.","Carol Kemple","Good morning. Thinking about the premium outlet pipeline out there, how much room do you think there is for premium outlets of Simon\u2019s quality to be built in the U.S.? Can you quantify a number? Are there 20 possible sites left in the U.S., or where do you think that number would be?","David Simon","Well, I think that would be a real challenge of our kind of quality to produce. Right now, the way we look at it, 20 additional outlets. I still think it\u2019s a handful. We are going through \u2013 the industry is going through a little bit of a growth spurt. But, Carol, I would say, 20 would be a stretch. I\u2019m going to \u2013 this is so hard to give you a real number, but I would say \u2013 as we look at the stuff that we might see building, we\u2019ve got three now that will start, maybe another two or three next year. But from our standpoint, I would see under 10 over the next three to five years, domestic starts within our portfolio.","Carol Kemple","Okay.","Rick Sokolov","The one thing I would say to you Carol is when you think about growth, please don\u2019t forget about the expansions that David mentioned earlier. They are almost the equivalent in terms of productivity of a new outlet. We are adding a lot of square footage at Chicago and at Woodbury and at San Francisco. And all of that is adding mass, and that\u2019s absorbing demand in the most productive way that could possibly happen. And I encourage all of you to go out and see what we just opened at Desert Hills, and if you are out in Las Vegas, what we are opening in Las Vegas North the week of the ICSC convention. These things are dramatic expansions with great retailers that are highly, highly productive.","Carol Kemple","Okay, thanks. And then this question is for Rick. We\u2019ve heard a lot about store closings. I know you love to give your list of who wants the space. Do you have any new names for us?","David Simon","I can\u2019t wait.","Rick Sokolov","Well, you have to relax and stretch. But I think one thing that I would like to point out to everybody is we talk about all this, the tenant that has the broadest footprint in our portfolio is L Brands, with Victoria\u2019s Secret and they are doing great results, and they are growing and they are expanding and they are adding things to the Victoria's Secret stores. But we are doing with a lot of international retailers that people haven\u2019t -- DAVIDsTEA has come down, we are growing UNIQLO, we are growing H&M, we are growing Sephora, and we are growing Altar\u2019d State, which is a great retailer that has got a significant growth platform. And frankly, as David said, the ones that left are low productivity, oversized. So that gives us the opportunity to bring in higher productivity retailers that are just going to increase the market share of our properties.","Carol Kemple","Okay, thank you.","David Simon","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Michael Mueller","Yes, hi. Just a quick one. It sounds like a lot could be going on at Syosset. So how much of that project would you actually do yourselves?","David Simon","Yeah, in terms of the mixed use, we haven\u2019t gotten to that point, Michael. We probably \u2013 when it gets to the office, we will probably sell the office. We might partner on the residential, but \u2013 again, there is roughly 400,000 of retail, so that we will do with our partner. The other hotel we may or may not do. So my guess is at the end of the day, we\u2019d probably look to either sell or joint venture. We probably won\u2019t do the office; we might sell or joint venture the other uses.","Michael Mueller","Got it. Okay. That was pretty much it. Thanks.","David Simon","Sure. No worries.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.","Linda Tsai","Hi. When people talk about omni-channel, my sense is that they think of traditional mall-based or full-priced stores. To what extent are you seeing omni-channel capabilities incorporated into the Premium Outlet model? Do you think this is something that makes sense for you and the retailers?","David Simon","Well, I think the retailers as they bring in the omni-channel world to their physical stores will certainly apply to the outlet world as well. And again, they are all at different degrees of that integration. But I don\u2019t think outlets would be ignored on that front at all. So I would expect that to be part of it.","Linda Tsai","Thanks.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Your next question, we have a follow-up from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed.","Michael Bilerman","Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman, again. David, I\u2019m just curious to get your thoughts a little bit on Land and Buildings and Orange Capital\u2019s proxy campaign post them rebuffing your offer. And at least in Jon\u2019s letter he references a conversation that he had with you and, obviously, I don\u2019t know if that conversation is done verbatim. But it implied that what you had told him was based on where Simon\u2019s stock is currently, almost $200; that that would imply $100 for Macerich. So I\u2019m just curious how you think about that as well as their campaign.","David Simon","Well, look, I\u2019m not \u2013 put it this way, I\u2019m not surprised by Land and Buildings\u2019 and Orange\u2019s \u2013 that they might pursue something like this, or others. But as you can see from their proxy materials, we are not participating or providing any financial support in their proxy. But I\u2019m not surprised that someone like them would take up this particular issue. But, again, we are not\u2014this is not us, this is them. And I said to you, you can see it from their preliminary proxy stuff that we\u2019re not supporting or involved in that at all. And then, as a shareholder, we will wait and see what happens.","Michael Bilerman","Right. I guess as a shareholder, when they came out after rebuffing your offer for the final time, then they put out their presentation of the plan forward, I guess as a shareholder would you have wanted to know how they achieve a price equal to or greater than the offer that you had put on the table? And I guess did that surprise you that that wasn\u2019t in there?","David Simon","Well, look, that\u2019s up for Macerich to respond to. I mean I can only tell you what I told you earlier, which is I think we put a hell of a deal on the table and I was looking to engage with Art. I consider Art a peer. We\u2019ve had a good relationship. People say hostile offer. I don\u2019t \u2013 let me give you my thinking on this. Any time somebody offers a lot of money to somebody, I never consider that hostile, okay? Now, it may not be \u2013 it maybe unsolicited, but it ain\u2019t hostile\u2026","Michael Bilerman","At a 30% premium, no less.","David Simon","Okay. It ain\u2019t hostile. So I hope Art and the board realizes that I didn\u2019t view it as hostile. I view it \u2013 sure, it was unsolicited, but it was a hell of an offer done in the spirit of trying to negotiate a deal at a big number and I will leave it at that. It\u2019s yesterday\u2019s news, but I will leave it at that. But it was not hostile. Unsolicited, absolutely. But, again, anytime I think \u2013 I\u2019m a simpleton when it comes to this \u2013 but anytime you offer a big number to somebody, I don\u2019t view that as hostile. I just view that as of the way of the world, I guess.","Michael Bilerman","Yes, okay. Thanks, David.","David Simon","All right. No worries.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue. I will now turn the call over to David for closing remarks.","David Simon","All right. Thank you, everyone, and take care and we will talk to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR Website at investors.simon.com.","For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.","David Simon","Okay. Good morning. We had a very busy and productive quarter, and very pleased with our financial results. Results of the quarter were highlighted by funds from operation of $1.081 billion, or $3.05 per share. We achieved this consensus this quarter even with certain unanticipated retail of bankruptcies, reduced property level NOI from the acceleration of properties undergoing significant redevelopment such as Northgate compared to our budgets.","Reduced overage rents from tourism spending, including the negative impact from the continued strong U.S. dollar and lower distribution income from certain international investments. We continue to grow our cash flow and report solid key operating metrics.","Comp NOI increased 1.6% for the third quarter and total portfolio increased 1.3% for the quarter. Portfolio NOI was negatively impacted by 50 basis points due to properties undergoing significant redevelopment and the unfavorable FX impact due to the continuing strong dollar.","Year-to-date comp NOI has increased 1.7%. Retail bankruptcies negatively impacted our comp NOI by over 100 basis points in the third quarter. As a reminder, our Japan Premium Outlets and designer outlets in Europe produce over $1000 in retail sales per square foot, and all of our 26 international outlets excluding Canada, which is in our basically North American portfolio generated comp NOI growth of 6.3% on a constant currency basis, which as a reminder is not included in our comp NOI, and if you did that, we'd be well over 2%.","Retail sales momentum accelerated in the third quarter. Reported retail sales per square foot for malls and outlets was $680 compared to $650 per foot, an increase of 4.5%. Leasing activity remains solid, average base minimal rent was $54.55. The malls and Premium Outlets recorded leasing spread of $12.10, an increase of 22.2%.","Our malls and outlets occupancy end of the quarter, 94.7% an increase of 30 basis points compared to occupancy at the end of the second quarter. And again, tenant bankruptcies affected that by roughly 60 basis points. On an NOI weighted basis, excluding our international outlets, which I discussed above, we reported were as follows.","Reported retailer sales on an NOI weighted basis is $867 compared to $680 per foot. NOI weighted sales growth was 6.1% year-over-year compared to 4.5%. As mentioned, occupancy is 95.8% compared to 94%. Average base minimum rent is $73.14 compared to the $54.55 number and our weighted comp NOI growth would be 2.7%.","We started construction on new Premium Outlet in Tulsa, Oklahoma scheduled to open in the spring of 2021. Construction continues on four other new international outlet developments, Malaga, Spain, Bangkok, Thailand, West Midlands England, and not to forget Normandy, France, which we expect to be a terrific new outlet center.","We had a very busy quarter in terms of completion of redevelopment projects, in particular, expansions on several of our high performing international outlets. We opened -- including two in South Korea and one in Vancouver out -- Vancouver designer outlet in Canada.","During the quarter, we started construction on our significant redevelopment at Tacoma mall. And at the end of the third quarter, we have 30 properties across all of our platforms in the U.S. and internationally with the share of the net costs of approximately $1.4 billion. And as a reminder, this is being funded by our internally generated cash flow.","We announced and as you are aware, we closed on our new venture with the Rue Gilt Group to combine our shop premium outlets marketplace with RGG\u2019s highly successful Rue La La and Gilt creating a new multi-platform dedicated to digital value shopping. We're very excited to expand our omnichannel capabilities in partnership with our RGG, which is a very profitable company with significant sales.","Our industry leading capabilities in the physical outlet space combined with RGG\u2019s exceptional e-commerce success will give shoppers and enhance access to the world's best brands and most compelling deals, both online and in-store. You saw the announcement this week regarding strategic investments. I won't belabor that other than we're very excited about the transactions that we're investing in Lifetime, Fitness, Pin Stripes, SOHO, PARM, Sports Illustrated, Allied esports. You can now for those of you that really like gaming, please enter the Simon cup. We encourage you to do so. You'll have a lot of fun, but I will not be funding the analyst, it's in fact one of you win.","Look for us to open Sports Illustrated, Sports Gaming Restaurants in the future. So now balance sheet. We completed three tranche senior notes, totaling $3.5 billion at the coupon rate of 2.61%, average weighted turns of 15.9 years are offering marked industry milestones prior to our issuance no real estate company had ever issued 1.25 billion of 30-year bonds in a single issuance, and the interest rate for each of the tranches was the lowest achieved by any real estate company for similar notes.","We in October completed our four early redemptions of our senior notes, totaling $2.6 billion and during the quarter, we repurchased one point 1 15 million shares. After the bond redemptions, our liquidity stands at 7 billion, balance sheet\u2019s in great shape. We announced a dividend of $2.10 per share, a 5% increase year-over-year. We\u2019ll pay $8.30 per share in dividends in 2019. That's an increase of 5.1% compared to all of last year. We've grown the dividend more than 8% over the last few years. And as a reminder, our annualized dividend yield is greater than 5% which is more than 350 basis points higher than the 10-year Treasury which is it at basically at a record spread were more than 1.5 times covered in terms of our dividend coverage by our FFO, and we've paid out since we've been public now well over $30 billion, a lot of dough.","Now just to update finally. Guidance is $12 to $12.05, which is an increase of $0.03 from the bottom end of the range after giving effect to the $0.33 debt extinguishment charge as we outlined for you when we did our notes deal a month or so ago. So that's it. We're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Schmidt","Oh great. Thank you. I just wanted to touch a little bit. I mean you've been very active in terms of developing your experience for tenants for your assets. And I just wonder, how high could you be taking this penetration in the next say two or three years?","David Simon","Well I would say to you the level of interest and new retailers in this category continues to amaze us. They actually are very interested in our real estate. So despite the negative narrative that you see from the general media, they all want to locate in the mall, and in our real estate, and I think we're just at the beginning of that. So I continue to expect us to redevelop our assets with those kind of retailers significantly over the next decade.","Craig Schmidt","Yes I was just thinking about the Southdale where you replacing a appendix with the lifetime assets. What kind of lift could that give to that center?","David Simon","Significant. I mean, they -- they'll have 5000 members. They're great for the community. They are without question the best operator of a lifetime resort. In that whole industry they blow everybody away. They're great partners, good friends. And we expect continued growth there. They reinforce our real estate as a place for the community. And I couldn't be prouder working with them side by side and as partners.","They also have. They also have a world class shareholder base. So that's as we create kind of the next generation of our company. We're associating ourselves with world class entrepreneurs, partners, investors. We could sit here and talk about selling an outlet for a million dollars, but I encourage you to think about our company differently.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. And just lastly, I know we've touched on this. You're saying that human resources and permits are probably more of a generator than your access to capital. But then are you thinking you might have to accelerate some of your capital spend in the next few years, just given the redovs and developments you're doing, and you seem to continue to be on pace for whether it's the new developments and in the European outlets etcetera.","David Simon","I think, it's going to be relatively you know within you know margin of error relatively consistent with what we've been doing the last couple of years, correct. So we're spending a billion to a billion and a half per year, that's not going to jump up to two and a half billion just because of what I would you know because of some of the constraints that we have. Not financially, but just you know execution. So I would expect us to continue to be in that range over the next few years.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks.","David Simon","Yes sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Bilerman","Hey it\u2019s Michael Bilerman here for Christy. David because you know I just picked up our gold cards, but I don't think we're going to win. Our kids probably have a better chance of doing that than we do.","David Simon","Again, I would, get one of your kids to enter it and then they may have a better shot than you Michael.","Michael Bilerman","Exactly. If you think about all these investments that you're making, a lot of the consumer facing brands and you talked a little bit about you went through the list on the call. You know as reported in the press, the full House, SOHO House one was about a$100 million. How should we think about the totality of capital that you have out today across all of these different investments?","If you look at the balance sheet, I'm not sure if it's in the other assets category, but if it is, that that totality is gone from 1.2 billion up to 1.8 over the course of the nine months. Can you give us a little bit of a sense of the total money that you've put out across all of these different exciting adventures?","David Simon","Yes, First of all, just to clarify the increase in the other assets is basically because writing up the leases to value. I mean that's the biggest because of the new accounting rules. That's the biggest change. Okay, so you can't go from that number to what we've invested by any stretch of imagination. So that's number one.","Number two is to the extent that we reach materiality. We're obviously going to have to disclose that in our financial statements in our Q and our K. So the other assets is just so you know is basically the increase in those -- for what. And it's, driving up and that's $525 million roughly when you have to write up your leases to market with the new accounting rules. Okay.","So we have not reached the, I would say it this way, we certainly have not reached our investment, our outside investments to the level of materiality. That's the first point. Second is I look at it, our embedded, and we basically reinvesting our embedded gains that we have in Aero in ABG and some of the other Venture Group investments into some of these things. So right now we're playing with the houses money and it's not material. I don't think the SOHO House number is right. So, just I'm not going to go through each one at each level, again I encourage everybody try to think about us a little bit differently, but what we're doing is we're making these investments to learn. So that we're going to be number one a better company.","Two is creating investments with great partners, with great entrepreneurs, with great shareholders, I think is going to exponentially increase our opportunities both in our physical and ultimately in the online world. And the level of activity that we are seeing it's just very encouraging is all I can tell you, I mean I think where we're at the epicenter of kind of physical online world, Entertainment creating kind of the next generation destination center and it's, we're all trying to put it together, but we're not. At this point simple thing to think about is make sure you understand, you know that on the deferred assets. Number one.","Number two is make sure you understand we're not at the materiality level. And number three is, it's basically we're rolling the embedded gains. The way I think about it as our role in the embedded gains in our future investments. But we're also making these not as a learning experience because who cares about learning. We're doing it to make money and I expect all of these to pay off in the future.","Michael Bilerman","David, you've obviously been critical to the company's success for well over 25 years. You signed your last retention employment agreement back in 2011 that expired back in July. Where do things stand in terms of you going without an employment agreement at this point, or is that still being worked on?","David Simon","I have no employment agreement.","Michael Bilerman","So you'll just be an employee at will, with everybody else.","David Simon","That's the way it's shaping up. Yes, that\u2019s the answer.","Michael Bilerman","Christy has a question too.","Christy McElroy","Hey David, good morning. You mentioned the 100 basis point impact I think to comp NOI from bankruptcies in Q3. Just to try to get a sense for the impacts that have already incurred been incurred in Q3, versus what could be incremental in Q4. Just with regard to the Forever 21 bankruptcy filing, was there any reserve in the revenue line and impact to same store for non-payment of prepetition rent? And have you seen any impact thus far from Barneys or Kitchen Collection at this point?","David Simon","Not at this point. I mean, we don't really go through each and every retailer. I don't think it's fair given the size of our company for us to talk about specific retailers. I want to differ on that. But the reality is we have these we've updated our guidance, we've narrowed the range and all of that kind of embedded in that. So you know, I think the important point is, a number of these were unanticipated from our budget, we told you what our budget was at the beginning of the year. We don't update our comp NOI as you know.","And we would have well outperformed it. We still, you know, the biggest variable, we've got right now is still the overage rent in our tourist centers. And we'll see how the fourth quarter shakes out to me that's the bigger variable than anything else, but all of kind of all of the noise that is out there from certain retailers is kind of embedded in our guidance for the year.","Christy McElroy","Okay, thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Good morning. I guess David, maybe you or Rick could just talk about sort of the leasing pipeline and the momentum and as you think about 2020 and kind of where you sit in terms of leasing for next year and just the tenant demand. How would you sort of describe the environment today versus say a year ago, and how do you sort of feel like you're shaping up on 2020 expirations?","Rick Sokolov","Steve, it\u2019s Rick. In fact, David and I have just slogged through twelve hour days going property by property, and frankly the environment is still strong. There are a lot of tenants that want to access our properties across all three platforms. We are doing a whole lot of leasing. So far this year, we've got almost 10 and a half million square feet. You see our rents are up. Our spreads are up, and in a lot of instances spaces that we're getting back, we're putting in more productive tenants at higher rents.","David Simon","I would just say look, next year -- I think -- we obviously you know it does take time. We did where we are having a high bankruptcy year. I mean, there's no denying that. I mean you know I mean it were so, but as we put together our plan for next year, I think we'll be -- I think we'll be okay. And we're hustling. We're finding new tenants. The biggest setback that I see for next year is not so much replacing the bankruptcy, but really getting our redevelopment pipe open. We've got it. We have taken a step back this year, a reasonable level of cash flow. Forget whether it's comp or whatever, however, you want to describe it. ","But we've taken a reasonable step back this year because of taking down properties to redevelop, and you know and we are -- we are never a company that does. I've seen so many companies throw away the year and say, well we'll get back to 2021, we'll get back in 2022 we do not do that.","So the reality is, we're going to come in with comp NOI that\u2019s going to be not so bad, it\u2019s a little variable as I have described repeatedly, with our you know the tourism slowdown, which you know we pointed out six month \u2013 three, six months ago, and now you see it across the board for both retailers and companies that are -- had exposure to tourism and the strong dollar. But we are still going to deliver comp NOI growth that's not going to be that, you know is one of my heroes would say not too shabby. Next year, we've got a lot of \u2013 we don't give guidance until as you know end of January. I think it'll be fine even with, even with the bankruptcies that we've got to lease up, and the fact that we're still in a massive redevelopment number.","And that stuff the redevelopment takes time, and we are in that we are in that business. We're not in that -- but we don't have throwaway years, Steve you know that about us.","Steve Sakwa","No. Look I appreciate that. I guess again, not I guess trying to delve a little bit onto the redevelopment and just thinking about sort of next year and some of the headwinds you're taking down Northgate this year, I mean, do you sort of think about, I guess those types of projects that have negatively impacted. Do you expect those to continue? Number one.","And then as you just sort of think about the list of bankruptcies this year, and you sort of think about possibilities for next year. Does the list of potential bankruptcies next year look a lot smaller than maybe it did a year ago?","David Simon","No, I think -- listen, I think we're flushing through most of the dues. Okay. So, I actually think you know now who knows, I mean but I think we're kind of reaching bottom and 18 on that stuff or 19 on that stuff. It's rivaling what happened in 17. So it's not like something that we haven't experienced before. But we know what we have to do, and again, I don't want to get ahead of our guidance, but I don't think, I don't think you're not going to see a dramatic, Oh my God from us. Okay, when we present our plan.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. Thanks.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Caitlin Burrows","Hi. Good morning. Your third quarter same-store NOI growth of up 1.6% seems like it's the best in the mall sector, so I was just wondering if you guys could go through any thoughts you have on how you're able to differentiate yourself on a scale helping the mix of property types or something else?","David Simon","Well, I mean I think it's not. If you look over a long period of time, I mean, I think we've done that for a number of years. So I don't really. I don't know, I mean it's a function. We have good people, good assets with diversified not tied in one particular regional place. And again I just want to know the fact of the matters that we put in our international business, which we really don't have. We thought we're thinking about it, but we don't want to confuse people.","So, I mean we'd be well over 2% comp NOI growth. And don't forget about our international business, its 26 assets again exclude Canada because we have put Canada in our premium outlet business from the get-go. So I don't know I just, you know, it's, we're focused on the business and running the day to day, the best that we can. So I don't really want to compare contrast. But I think it's not, it's not, this isn't like a first quarter, this isn't the first time we've done that, I guess is what I want to say, right Rick?.","Rick Sokolov","Exactly. Listen, we grind every nickel everybody pays attention to every aspect of our business. On the income side and the expense side, and we've been doing it for a very long time, very consistently and we intend to continue to do it.","David Simon","Yes, I can give you here is the culture. So we go through every asset while we're planning, we were here till 9 o'clock last night. We're not sitting here, planning, how we're going to communicate. Maybe we should because sometimes we garble the message. While all the time, maybe.","So we've been in the last two days going through, this is we're going through our mall portfolio today than next week we go through the international business and each category have offered Bilerman to come here and see it. But Ward telling me not to do that again. But the reality is we are doing that nine. We did it all day Monday to nine. We do it all day today, we're right after this call. We're doing it. There is no downtime. We're not planning how to communicate what we're doing, we're just doing and that's the culture..","Caitlin Burrows","Got it. Okay. And then I was wondering, maybe if you guys could talk about the new outlet in Oklahoma that you're working on. Just what pre-leasing has been like, and what other retail options kind of are in the area?","David Simon","Well we have a very good mall there. It is the -- you know I mean not not to dwell too much on demographics, but it's the largest trade area without a without an outlet center. And we've been working on it for a while and you know based on our success in Denver and tenant demand, we feel extremely confident we're going to be able to liberate for a good return in a -- in a very good market.","I mean Tulsa is a very good market with good income demographics, and I think it's kind of a. It's really our bread and butter. We don't honestly, if we have to pre lease, we're not the kind of company we need to be. So we don't really pre lease so to speak, but we're very confident then that we'll be able to deliver the product that we want to deliver.","Caitlin Burrows","Okay,thanks.","David Simon","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","David Simon","Hey, good morning.","Jeremy Metz","David, just wanted to go back to Michael's question a little bit on the Simon Ventures and some of these other investments you made, and just hoping you can expand upon your last comment in response to the hedges, in terms of how do you really think about measure returns for some of these, just given some clear tangential benefits are you obviously looking to pull from doing this?","David Simon","Well, just to be clear. We expect these returns to be similar to what private equity type returns and they must stand on their own, but we're making them because we think there is potential to do business with that partner. So there are two separate decisions. One is, for instance in lifetime it's very simple, we looked at a multiple of EBITDA.","We looked at their growth. We looked at their future. And we're very confident that we're going to get a multiple of our invested capital. And all by the way, there are wonderful partners and we're going do arm's length business with them going forward. And to me that is a perfect scenario of a win-win.","So the investments must stand on their own. They must be and we look at them through a private equity lens much like everything else we've done. At the same time, if we can do business with them on an arm's length basis that's the gravy. And that's basically how we look at it and again. And we expect that we, by the way we've. Yeah, we've had some write-offs in our venture group which is a little. That venture groups, a little more at the early days of investing. Not in a round not kind of either BC round, BC or even DRAM.","But the ones that I've announced here this week are ones that are basically well-established companies. So that's -- this is in many cases growth capital or just solidifying our relationship and we think it's a good investment.","And again these aren't at the point of materiality. Again I want everybody to put the size of our company in perspective, but we are going to make money on those investments, number one. Number two is, we're going to learn a lot because a number of these companies are leaders are in their industry, and we're not too old. Rick and I were close. But we're not too old to learn. And I mean not to diverge and we were up at the RGG Board meeting last Thursday or Friday. I can't remember, but I mean the amount that we are going to learn, and in addition to the opportunities that we had as a partnership going forward.","But the amount, we're going to be a better real estate operator, and this is what I need everyone to try and appreciate. We are going to be a better real estate operator. The more we know e-commerce, okay and the more we know how they integrate.","And have been partners with one of the best entrepreneurs, frankly ever in the e-commerce space, one of the early pioneers in that team. I mean just separates I think ultimately what we're going to be able to do. And again, I can't -- I can't say it's going to mean, and it's and it's a profitable company and they do several hundred million dollars of sales and all this other stuff, but and we wouldn't have done it had we not felt like the company was worth it. But the reality is, we're going to. And it's going to accelerate our marketplace efforts, and we're going to be better in the real estate, we're going to be -- we're going to make money in that investment, but we're also going to be better real estate operators, because of that investment.","And we're going to know our retailers better, and we do already. But this is going to take us to another hopefully to another level. And that's -- that you know in technology and how you integrate it with the physical properties, and all you know and with our retailers, I think it's going to be very very interesting to see how it all evolves.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. Great, thank you for that. And just a follow up I have is just on the densification projects. You remove the disclosure from the sub but regardless, you obviously have a number of projects going on that are going to deliver here and have been 2019 but really next year and beyond. I just wondering if you could talk about the pipeline, what's the total dollars at a gross cost basis today that have under way.","And I guess what's beyond, what was last disclosed I guess last quarter. How much additional opportunities are you working on currently given some of the other need here for capital and it's a bit of a different skill sets, I'm assuming there is a human capacity to how much you can really have going on at any one point along these will that.","David Simon","Yes, Don't read anything into the fact that we took that out. So here's why we took it out and we can put it back in.","Number one, if you are under construction, and we have approved it's in our detail, its i.e. it's already in the detail. That's number one. Number two is, we are also outlining other stuff that's being done on the peripheral of our properties that we aren't doing that I thought was. I didn't want to mislead the market, somehow, even though [Indiscernible] that it wasn't our projects. So we took that out.","And three is the pipeline is so big, we weren't having, we weren't doing the right discipline of, you know what's in there, because it is a, big pipeline. So we just felt like it's probably better to communicate it when it's been approved. So the pipeline is actually, I didn't want to just lift like we'll be at schedule that says, here's all the densification we're going to do. I'd rather just put it in the 8-K when we actually are doing it. That's the nature of our company as opposed to outlining potential stuff. So the pipeline is continues to be very big Northgate.","The Northgate continues to evolve. It's a $1 billion project you know with office, residential, all sorts of mixed-use stuff. So you know we have the Houston Galleria development again that could have been on a pipe, but we're not quite ready to start construction. So you'll continue to see what's the number over $2 billion to $3 billion. If I had that we had put a number on it, but we'll, I think we'll just, it is so much ingrained in our business now. There is no reason to separate it. It's just part of our 8-K that you'll see as we approve deals. So I look at it as an evolution or sophistication in our ability to execute. So it's just part of our portfolio as opposed to this is a separate distinct schedule. Doesn't need to be anymore because it just part of the nature of what we do.","Jeremy Metz","Got it. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, good morning out there. So two -- two questions. First\u2026","David Simon","Alex, why do you say good morning after all the time? You think we\u2019re that far out there?","Alexander Goldfarb","Well I -- you know I, it's just a standard hello greeting. So anyway now you're asking me to think on my feet, which is tough. I said sorry about the questions. First, on the debt side, obviously you had strong demand on your unsecured bonds, you priced pretty tight the Apple. But maybe, you can just talk about what's going on in the mortgage market. You know some of the folks that we've spoken to have said, you know the lenders are either pulling back, or trying to pare exposure or tightening terms, lowering LTVs. I mean, we all saw you know the LTV and the underwriting for the Norwalk SoNo mall.","So maybe you can just give a sense of what's going on the mortgage side of the business, and whether it's by asset type, is it across the board or is it certain productivity levels you know of malls etcetera just a bit more color on there?","Brian McDade","Good morning, Alex. It\u2019s Brian. So look I think from the mortgage perspective, this year has been a relatively light year from a maturity profile perspective, but we're much more active next year. We are already in the market on some of those assets, and are receiving solid indications back in line with what our expectations are. Look I think, at the end of the day we're not seeing any reduction in appetite, but certainly that's a function of our asset quality. And so, we expect that market is going to be there. I understand that there's a few deals that are out there now, that will get priced here in the next six to eight weeks, which will further drive down price discovery in that marketplace.","David Simon","Yes. And look I think, we would we reaffirm Brian's points, but also just add a couple of things. Number one is sponsorship in and again that said, I'm not reflecting any other deals that are out there, but sponsorship isn\u2019t the case for everybody. Sponsorship is critically important. That's number one.","And the balance sheet and that's what's great about where we stand is that, we don't -- we can do all sorts of different financings. We're not tied to the secured market or the unsecured market. And that again is a material separator, which I mean we didn't harp on it again today because you know when Tom says this first thing, he usually puts it in. I'm like -- I think people are tired of talking about it. So, but I would think that and the proof is always in the pudding, which the pudding was pretty damn good a month ago, okay.","So the reality is we do have this separator in our real estate peer group, because we have the ability to go in and out of the markets pretty effectively, whether secured unsecured etcetera.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, that's helpful. And then the second question is on all the new investing you're doing the Sports Illustrated whether not you do Forever 21. All these things as you underwrite them how is your tolerance for sort of the time to get to cash flow positive. Is it the same as you would underwrite for real estate meaning or do these projects take longer or do you allow yourself more to let these things go before you decide ultimately to just kick the venture out and move on to the next. Just curious how you're underwriting is different in the time it takes to profitability versus the non-traditional retail ventures versus traditional retail real estate?","David Simon","Well, I think it really depends on the category and what the, -- I mean the reality is, all these companies have comparable. So some case there are valued at 5 times cash flow. In some cases they're value to 20 times cash flow. And it's really a function of what we see in the future and where the market is. So we don't really get ahead of ourselves, one way or another on that.","And then like I said, I think we look at it similar to what you know with respect to Simon Venture Group, what kind of the venture people look at it, we look at it with the same lens and in the private equity, I think we do the same thing. And again, we have this extra soft in the sense that we're expecting to get other benefits out of it, which are not necessarily in our numbers, but which is important to us.","And I don't want to talk about retailers specifically and, but we are not. It just so everyone, it's clear we're not involved in the one retailer, you mentioned about investing or doing anything on that front. I mean I think it got mischaracterize. Last call, so I just want to be clear on that, we're not involved in any retailer that is in BK in terms of us looking to invest. So just to be clear on that.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, thank you David.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Hill","Hey, David. So look, I think the reason that you're differentiating yourself is you're playing a lot more offense than maybe some of your peers who are playing defense. So with that in mind, I have, I have one question and one follow up to that.","Look 7% to 8% development yields to quote you not too shabby in this world backdrop of slow growth and low rates. Are you seeing, maybe even more demand from sovereign wealth funds, other foreign investors to maybe partner with you on your developments with an eye on the long term?","David Simon","Well look, I think it's a really good question, Rich. And you know it's funny. Most of those folks I've got to be careful here, so I don't know. I don't mean to you know, I mean right now let's face it. We're a contrarian investment, okay. If you look at our multiple compared the kind of most of the other non-retail real estate confidence, and if you look at cash flow stability or multiples or however you want to slice and dice it, we're you know in today's world we're contrary. And there are not frankly a lot of contrarian investors, there's more herd mentality. There are some very sophisticated sovereign wealth\u2019s that would love to partner with us on new opportunities.","And again, when I say new opportunities, you know existing, existing, existing real estate that they may have and they want someone like us to do that. We're starting those discussions very, very early early early days just to get to know them. But the reality is not a lot of contrary investment and for whatever reason we are considered a contrarian, but you do make a good point. We're on the offense, and the fact that matters, we've been so busy and excited about the both the redevelopment, the densification and some of the new ventures that we've had, that that's that's perfectly fine for us, so we're going to continue to run the business.","So I do think at some point there's a -- there's that there will be a swap back to reality. But you know those kind of investors would rather buy certain assets types that are three and a half yield. I won't name names as opposed to you know six plus and Class A regional malls. That's been historically a bad debt overtime. And you know who am I to say, I'm smarter than those other guys. But listen, I'm willing to -- I'm willing to play the game and see who's right in the long run.","Rich Hill","Got it. And so, one follow up question to that. You look at \u2013 you have a tremendous amount of free cash flow that you're spinning off, or a super strong balance sheet. Why wouldn't you just ramp up CapEx as a percentage of your operating cash flow right now, and spend even more money to redevelop your properties for the future and how -- I guess, I guess the question I'm ultimately asking is, you'd said CapEx is going to be relatively range bound. Why wouldn't you play even more offense than what you're playing right now?","David Simon","Well it goes back to a little you know. I mean, it is literally some of the big projects we have. We're still constrained by getting approvals. So we have two or three big ones that are in the approval process, just to name three that jump out at me. Brea, Orange County, Stoneridge which is in the East Bay Area of California, King of Prussia. So you know we -- we don't have the approvals yet to start. That's the biggest limiter. And you know I don't. On the -- and then we are building office and the reality is, we don't. That's the one area, we're not going to build speck on. I mean, we're depending on the side. We're going to want some lead tenants. We're not -- we're not foolish.","So but we think we have really good product that\u2019s differentiated in the markets that we're contemplating it. But getting the lead tenant, does take a little bit of time. So I think we're -- you know we're pretty aggressive, but you know and Northgate, it's a great example. I think Northgate, we could have been a little more methodical, we had it. Just to give you a -- you know it depresses me a little bit. But just to give you an order of magnitude, we had roughly we had in that in our numbers this year to do about 15 million of NOI. And it's going to do five, roughly. Yes I get five. Come on, I know these numbers. And that's because we accelerated, we basically decided let's just get on with our lives and tear them all down.","Okay. Happy to be out there when the mall is coming down believe it or not. So we are doing it. It's just I think we're moving pretty fast in some of these areas. We're not going to be you know if we are building office, we're not going to get over. I mean, it's 100,000 square foot QDC [ph] building that's one thing, but we're not going to get over our skis too much on some of the stuff to make sure we're in good shape.","Rich Hill","Got it. That's helpful David. Thank you.","David Simon","Sure. Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.","Nick Yulico","Good morning. Sorry if I missed this. But could we just get the bankruptcy impact on same-store NOI growth this quarter? I think, it was cited as about a 100 basis points in the first two quarters this year?","David Simon","It's a 100 year-to-date and it was 60 roughly 60 in this quarter, correct or not?","Brian McDade","A 100 for the quarter.","David Simon","100 for the quarter, I\u2019m sorry. 100 for the quarter.","Nick Yulico","Okay. Thanks, and then second question is just going back to Forever 21, we looked at the bankruptcy filing for them. You only have one existing store on the store closure list. That rose about feel, this -- it excludes all the stores in development, which will not be opening. So I guess, that store closure was -- I mean, should that give us comfort. There is one store in there? Or should we be expecting that over your 98 stores with them, either you already gave rent release or you're planning to over the next year?","David Simon","I guess, I don't. We don't want to talk about specific retailers. Well I think, there we\u2019ll have to see how that. That that bankruptcy evolves. I mean, there are more stores that they rejected that or about to reject that they never opened in. Again, I don't want to get into the nitty, gritty detail, but in that particular case you brought it up. It was Riley Rose. We had a handful of those that at least is executed that won't be open.","So whether you know they weren't in our initial numbers in any of them. So you'll see some of those come out one way or another, but it's never been an arts until they open, it's not in our not in our document I guess or 8-K. But we'll see how it goes. I mean, I can't -- I can't, I'm not you know and I want to be very careful here, so I'm not involved in it. We're \u2013 we\u2019re negotiating kind of the future like every other major landlord and we'll see how it all shapes out at the end of the day.","Nick Yulico","Okay. And I hate -- I guess, I'm just trying to tie it back to the bankruptcy impact year-to-date. It was 100 basis points. I'm assuming there was not much in that from Forever 21, unless you've already renegotiated leases. And it's almost 1.5% of your base rent. So as we look forward over the next year, it's kind of feels like that bankruptcy impact to Forever 21 by itself could be similar to your overall bankruptcy impact this year. Is that fair?","David Simon","Well I think you'll see a bigger, what we'll know more in 2020. It's not going to be material in 2019. And I think the focus is going to be really 2020, what that that group is able to do going forward, which is out of our hands, and we're going to have to wait and see. We'll have a \u2013 again, I don't want to get into particular tenants, but we'll have that, that's our view of what happens with that, and other bankrupt tenants will ultimately be in our 2020 estimates. And that's the way for us to look at it.","At this point, the materiality of any of these guys and in the next year end is not in my opinion going to be material.","Nick Yulico","Okay. All right. Thank you.","David Simon","For you, it might be once that might be what, I know, okay. But it's -- we did update our guidance and what we know today about the bankrupt tenants is in our guidance. And that's the important thing. And then our view of you know some of these bankrupt tenants and what their plan is for 2020 will be in our 2020 guidance. And that's the best way I can answer that.","Nick Yulico","Thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Linda Tsai","Hi. Just following up on what you were just talking about. So with some of these bankruptcies having been unexpected in 2019, as you look out to 2020, do you think a base case of 2% NOI [ph] growth would still be achievable?","David Simon","We give our guidance at the end of January. Do we have a date yet? Not yet. We get word -- we're waiting to see if the Colts make the Super Bowl, because we want to -- we want to make. We want to. We want to work it around that day, around that day. That was a joke, but no, no I actually think they're a pretty good team. But where we give that all of that will be reflected in, and we've never given 2020 guidance, and you know I mean people have estimates all over the place. So I don't, I don't really opine on a one way or another.","Linda Tsai","Okay. And then, in terms of SPO.com How are you and Michael Rubin thinking about its value proposition. You know how much crossover would the product you provide online through SPO.com is available through other online distribution channels? And then, do you have any sense of the price differential on SPO.com and how it might compare with other discounters like Ross or T.J?","David Simon","Yes, look this is a complicated -- that's a complicated question, and I think, I think the important thing is, we both think and not just us, but you know our SPO team and the existing RGG team couldn't be more excited about the future opportunities together that we have. I think their team is unquestionably excited. I would not. You know, I think it's going to be a great partnership for our company and together, we're going to do a lot more both in terms of growing their existing business and then the partnership taking the origins of our business and extrapolating that going forward.","But it is early days. We're very committed to making this exciting, and between all of our relationships with the brands, and all of our physical attributes and their e-commerce attributes. Now this could be a really really significant opportunity for our partnership.","So let's give it a little bit of time. I can't give you an exact roadmap, because some of this stuff we'd like to keep to ourselves, because we are -- we are still growing the business and there's a lot of competition out there on that front. So, but again, couldn't be, couldn't be more pleased with the potential opportunity in the future.","Linda Tsai","Thanks for that.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. Good morning. So you're -- you\u2019ve been reporting improving sales per square foot for the past several years, but that formula there's some noise to it because the denominator is always changing. So I was wondering if you had a sense of the total sales productivity on at your centers over the past couple of years. Just try and get a sense of if it's becoming more vibrant or somewhat static overtime. And I realize that hotels and apartments you can't because there's no sales data for it, but just try and get a bigger picture.","David Simon","You know, I will give you the benefit of rule of large numbers. There is absolutely given our large portfolio. There is absolutely your comment about the denominator changing, is there a relevant in terms of our results. Because one particular property going in one particular property going out or 10 going in or 10 going out aunt going to move the number my friend. So that's number one.","Number two is many cases in our new developments; they come in below our average. And with that said, if anything, its understanding it. And then finally, I'll say, we continue to believe that we're reporting and this is really important and I've said it again, I want to keep saying it, but we're getting the you what's reported to us. And in some cases, what are reported to us is not actually gross sales.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. I'm just going back to the topic of your investments that you're making and in places like RGG or Authentic Brands. Is it easy to get the sense that you're focused on making your fleet better and adding on different types of opportunities like private equity or venture capital. When does it start to become more interesting to actually increasing your fleet size or is it the case that the upside opportunity and redevelopment and private equity type of investments is still just far greater and better opportunity then increase in the fleet size?","David Simon","Did you say fleet?","Ki Bin Kim","Yes, sort of mall counts, retail center counts, things like that.","David Simon","Okay, well, look, I think we've historically have been acquisitive over our career. We just haven't done anything in a while. But the fact of the matter is if we have so much going on in so many opportunities here feel pretty good. I mean I don't feel like we need to do that, but if there's something out there that's makes sense. We would look at it. But I think its business as usual for us and the focus being on, it sounds like gobbledygook.","But the focus is just making us a better company, we got plenty of assets. And all of these things that we are doing and attempting to do is to make the real estate in our company better. But we are more than a real estate company and that we interface with brands and consumers to an unbelievable extent. So why that takes advantage of that reach that we've done reasonably well. But we can certainly do it too much greater extent and that continues to be a focus for us.","Ki Bin Kim","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Vince Tibone","Hi, good morning.","David Simon","Good morning.","Vince Tibone","Could you elaborate on the magnitude of the decline in international tourism, and the impact that had on foot traffic in tenant tailed some of your key gateway market properties?","David Simon","Well, we don't give out specifics on that. But I mean, put it this way, the business has been, the tourist centers have been relatively flat in terms of sales, and we think had we had a normal you know if we had a normal, what I'd call a normal dollar in terms of the strength versus vis-\u00e0-vis the euro and other currencies and you know and all the other noise that's out there, we would have expected at 5%, 6% increase.","So I don't know if that means, I don't know if that gives you kind of what you want, but it's you know that some of our bigger international property sales have been flat. And traffic's actually not been too much the problem. It's been stable, but it's really we're seeing the flatness of the sales that we would expect it. When we did budget, we would have expected to have a 5 or so percent increase in sales.","Vince Tibone","Interesting, but that's helpful color. And then just one more for me and maybe switching gears a little, can you provide some color on the trends you're seeing in the private market for malls. I mean, do you think cap rates or the number of interested bidders has changed over the last six months or so?","David Simon","I would say to you that, I have not seen a change, but I would think that, I have not really seen a tangible change. I still think you know investing is more or less a herd mentality. And we're you know I was going to give an animal analogy, but I better refrain. Last time I did cockroach, which I -- I'm not going to do today, but I think people steal, the guys that have the money you know I think they, they they've always been retail real estate's always been you know it's not -- it's not a commodity, so the operator really matters so to speak.","So it's not like a warehouse that's like you know one commodity versus the next. And so do the operators matter, and the money that kind of goes in and out a commodity real estate as you know it's always kind of ebbs and flows for retail real estate, because who the operator is always been materially important.","So that's, that's one aspect I'd say to you. The next is, I still think they're surprisingly I'm actually surprised about it. But the so-called smart money has not played a big role in this. But, I mean they obviously have different points of view and they may be right. But we feel pretty good about what we're doing.","Vince Tibone","That's helpful. And just one follow up on that. I mean, let's say the herd mentality does push cap rates higher. Is there a point where you would potentially come in and be an acquirer of single assets on the market? Given to your point that the platform makes a big difference and you could probably increase in a line from these acquisitions.","David Simon","Yes. I think if there was a good fit, we would certainly take a -- take a hard look at it.","Vince Tibone","Okay, great.","David Simon","I think that's, I think that's the other point. I mean, we're not really seeing that's a good point that we're not really seeing kind of that A-assets show up on the market.","Vince Tibone","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Mueller","Yes, hi good morning. I guess following up on that. For the properties where you have JV Partners, have you seen those investors want to exit more in recent years or they find with the exposures and it's more about where to park incremental dollars for them?","David Simon","I would say a lot of them are following the herd mentality.","Michael Mueller","Okay.","David Simon","I think my guess might be -- I'm not trying to be, am I clear on that. Not, I'll restate what I would be answering.","Michael Mueller","No, I think so. I think so. Yes\u2026.","David Simon","I think all, I think a lot of the folks out there are you know a little nervous about our business. But you know I would just put it you know not our business, not Simon Property Group business, but I\u2019m nervous about whatever retail generally and so they do tend to, they do tend to follow the herd mentality, that's where somebody maybe us. It\u2019s going to make a lot of money. I assure you. I've seen this movie before, and our cash flows are very very very resilient. If you have good real estate and a good operator, they always evolve and always change. And if you look at the mall that was built in the 60s, you look at the malls that were built in the 70s and 80s and 90s and 2000. Look at the redevelopment I mean, my goodness they changed a lot. And, and they're changing today.","So I don't, I don't know. No one here, I mean no one here is overly concerned about it, but all of these guys, they all get that you know it's a lot of people suffer, suffer from groupthink. Okay. Maybe we do too. But we don't. We're in good shape.","Michael Mueller","Got it. And I mean, would you think over the next three years, five years or so maybe we see a pickup in you buying out some of these JV Partners or is it a little bit more of a function of you've got a big redevelopment pipeline, a lot of capital that's going there and you're getting bigger returns on that. So it's, I guess that's the tradeoff. How do we think about that?","David Simon","Yes, I mean we're focused. Listen I'm going to. If they're nervous, I'm going to buy them at a real big discount, so let them get really nervous. I want them nervous, okay. Nervous is good for us. Okay. So that\u2019s okay. The reality is there could be opportunities. But you know, we'll see.","Michael Mueller","Okay, thanks David, bye.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And we have a follow up question from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Hello. Christy if your line is on mute, please unmute.","Christy McElroy","Hey, David, it\u2019s Christy here. I know that it's just an accounting question for me and you know that the new straight lining of cam was addressed on the last call. I anticipate straight line trending higher this year, but with the recent bankruptcies I'm just wondering what kind of assessments have been in there? Also for the write-off of occurred straight line rents being uncollectible just with the bankruptcies this year, given the new rules around determination of un-collectability, just trying to get a good sense for what the normal run rate is for that line?","David Simon","I mean, that all flows through, so I don't have that off the top of my head. I would say to you. It's not material, but I mean that would do that all the time, right. So that we have to -- we have to make that decision all the time, whether it's collectable or not collectable.","Christy McElroy","Okay. I just didn't know if there was a material impact on that line. Aside from that, is it being elevated with the straight lining of camp?","David Simon","Not material.","Michael Bilerman","David, it's Michael speaking. You talked a little bit about how your stocks of contrarian investment at this point given the multiple, and you've used some of your significant balance sheet capacity to buyback your stock. You did about 300 million in the last six months. You've talked a little bit on this call about maybe partnering with sovereign wealth. It sounds like either buying assets or managing assets they may, or look at new opportunity. No\u2026","David Simon","I don't think, I don't think I said that Michael. So I said, I said, there I said there are very few contrarian investors right now. And we're not really, we're at the very early stages of seeing how they feel about our -- you know the market in general. So I just want to be clear on that, okay.","Michael Bilerman","Right. I was listening to when you're talking about maybe working with them, but I didn't know if there is an opportunity to either liquefy some of the value in the assets that you've created. The debt markets provided you a cash amount of capital at a very attractive rates. Right, is your stock that is the one that is associated with the performance that you're putting up. And so, I know in the past you've been reluctant to sell JV stakes in your assets to buyback your stock. I'm wondering, if that's changed at all, or in some of these conversations that you're happy and having if you find that there is an opportunity to partner with contrarian capital, that you want to do that.","David Simon","Well, again I have never been a fan to sell an asset-A, to make a mark because A, assets grow historically over time and most everybody that sold A-asset, if they're going to believe it's an A asset in the future. Regret that decision. Okay.","So and buying stock back is a temporary investment decision and the reality is we're in this for the long haul as we've demonstrated over almost 26 years has been a public company. So I think that's kind of the worst thing. Frankly, we could do and getting this mark, getting a mark on our portfolio is fool's gold, it's never worked because the next question is, well, what about the rest of the portfolio. So and again, just to reemphasize.","So the answer is you know no interest in doing that, number one. Number two is, there are you know, some of these, I mean we're just I don't want to over emphasize and hopefully I didn't I look back at the call, but we're not out running around saying, do you want to go. People come to us we'll talk to them about interest partnership interest, but we're not out soliciting sovereign wealth funds, were not out doing that the reality is we don't need their capital. So, they know my number 1800 David call me if they want, they don't have to. Okay?","Michael Bilerman","And I wasn't thinking about it from\u2026","David Simon","I don't want to overemphasize. We've talked to a few here and there. I think they respect what we do but I don't really know, maybe that's a flaw in us that we haven't really solicited them just to have better relationships. But I mean, we've done oaky without them being a major player for us to get to where we are today. We've never needed that in scale. So that's that. So I don't want to overemphasize. We've had discussions here and there, because you know sometimes they call, sometimes they don\u2019t.","So we're not out, we're not out trying to buy partnership interest of ourselves or others. We're not out talking to sovereign wealth other than we'll have a couple of conversations. And look, the reality is a lot of that institutional investors as we all know you know have a certain queasiness over retail. We've seen that before, it doesn't affect us. It's not, it doesn't, it affects you, it affects others. It does not affect me and my company in what we do. That's the important point, okay.","Michael Bilerman","And I wasn't thinking about it from a positive mark. I was thinking about more so in being able to raise additional capital and invest in your stock, and you know just basically bolster that program that you're doing right now using the free cash flow and capacity, doing something more meaningful if you're able to find an investor that's willing to partner with you. I understand the dynamics, and I understand getting up the growth. I just didn't know if that was part of the psyche today, just given where things stand.","David Simon","No, I mean the stuff that look, I think most of the and again we're beaten. You know we're spending more time on this than warranted, but most people, most institutional investors would like to do something you know is as we've talked to him often on over several years. Most of all like to do external stuff with us, variety. And you know but the reality is, we haven't been doing that. So we haven\u2019t been talking to him, okay.","So again, it's where we're spending too much time on this. On the other front, look, we've got what you know why are we aggressively buying our stock back? Listen, we love our balance sheet. We'll be you know I think it's an unbelievable advantage. Unbelievable. It's under appreciated. Sorry Tom, I took out your paragraph in a teleconference text, to do $3.5 billion in four hours, you know 30-year bonds, blah blah, blah is all pretty powerful. We don't want to jeopardize that. We've seen when people had overstepped their numbers, overstepped their credit ratings. You know how it kind of can retard the opportunities going forward. We don't want to do that.","And importantly, I mean we're in that process of adding to our already successful retail real estate portfolio, and what does that mean? We're doing all this densification stuff. We're building our consumer facing business. You know we're positioning the company for the future. And as we all know, you know any leading company out there is invest in the future. You know from Microsoft to Amazon, to you know go down the list. Every successful company that understands the importance of investment.","And so I want the balance sheet that allows us to invest. If I had a criticism of historical retailers, they did not invest in there. And again, it's not for me to criticize, honestly, I don't want this to sound you know like I know it all. But the reality is what we've seen with Rick and I have seen because of strained balance sheets or overspending in one thing versus the other thing is the inability to reinvest in your business is a major no no. So that's, you know that we are not going to do the major no no.","Michael Bilerman","Thanks for your time, David.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. David Simon for any closing remarks.","David Simon","Okay, thank you. Everyone have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating.

My name is Cosmic, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would like to turn the call over to Shelly Doran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.","Shelly J. Doran","Good morning, and welcome to Simon Property Group's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Please be aware that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to our filings with the SEC for a detailed discussion.","Acknowledging the fact that this call may be webcast for some time to come, we believe it is important to note that our call includes time-sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today's date, July 24, 2012.","Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the earnings release or the company's supplemental information package that was included in this morning's Form 8-K. This package is available on the Simon website, in the Investors section.","Participating in today's call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.","David E. Simon","Okay, thanks. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our strong results for the quarter, and I'll just go through some highlights.","First of all, funds from operation was $1.89 per share, up 14.5% from the second quarter of 2011. Our FFO exceeded the First Call consensus by $0.08 per share. For the malls and the Premium Outlets, our comparable property NOI grew 5.1%. Comp NOI growth in the second quarter of 2011 was 3.5%, so a very healthy trend.","Tenant sales were up 9.9% to $554 per foot. Occupancy was up 60 basis points to 94.2%. Average rent per square foot increased by 3.7%, and the releasing spread was a positive 10% or $4.77 per square foot.","On the capital market side, on June 1, as you know, we completed a new $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that supplements our existing $4 billion revolver, resulting in $6 billion of total capacity. The facility matures 2016 with a 1-year extension option at the same rate as our other facility, which is LIBOR plus 100 basis points. In the secured market, we've been very active year-to-date. We have closed a lock rate on 17 new mortgages, totaling approximately $1.9 billion, of which our share of that debt is $1.3 billion. The weighted average interest rate on the loans is 4.3%, and the term is 7.5 years on the average term. And last Friday, we redeemed 2 million units of our operating partnership owned by an affiliate of JCPenney at $124 per unit or share.","On the acquisition side, June 4, we acquired a 50% interest in Silver Sands Factory Stores, a large and highly productive upscale outlet centered in Destin, Florida. The 450,000-square foot center generates sales of approximately $500 per square foot. We've assumed leasing and management duties, and in the coming months, it will be re-branded as a Premium Outlet Center.","Development activity is very strong. First of all, we grand opened Merrimack Premium Outlets, a large outlet center in Merrimack, New Hampshire on June 14. Strong opening. We're 99% leased, great-looking center. Construction continues on 5 additional Premium Outlet Centers, all scheduled to open this fall or in 2013. They're located in the U.S., Canada, Japan and Korea, clearly demonstrating the global nature of our company in our Premium Outlet platform.","First of all, 2 in the U.S. are in Texas City, suburb of Houston, which opens this fall; and then Chandler, Arizona, a suburb of Phoenix, which will open next year. We're continuing construction in Toronto, which opens next year. Another outlet center in Japan, which will be our ninth, near the airport outside of Tokyo; and Busan, our third Premium Outlet Center in Korea. We started construction on July 11 at St. Louis Premium Outlet Centers. We announced the strong lineup of tenants and are opening this plant for the fall of 2013.","Progress is being made under our agreement to develop Premium Outlet Centers in Brazil with BR Malls. And importantly, construction is underway on 25 redevelopment expansion projects at the mall, Premium Outlet and Mills platforms in the U.S. and 2 Premium Outlets in Japan, all with 2012\/2013 completion dates. We continue to expect our share of the development and redevelopment spend to approximate $1 billion this year, next year and 2014.","Let me just turn to Klepierre and give you a quick update. As you know, we bought 54.4 million shares or 29% of the French public company in March. They are the largest -- second largest owner of retail assets in Continental Europe, with assets valued at EUR 16.2 billion. They will be announcing their earnings later today. Their business has been remarkably stable considering the turmoil in Europe. They have made excellent progress in refinancing debt, selling assets and creating additional liquidity. And I have been very involved in the development of their future strategic direction. As they accomplish their goals, there's no doubt in my mind that they will be poised to take advantage of future growth opportunities.","Turning to dividends. As you now know, we have announced the fourth consecutive increase in our quarterly dividend from $1 per share to $1.05 per share. Our dividend is now 31% higher than it was a year ago and well above our previous all-time high before the onslaught of the great recession. I'm happy to announce that we've increased our 2012 FFO guidance again. Initially, as you'll recall, we were at $7.20 to $7.30 per share. Our new guidance now is $7.60 to $7.70 per share. Primary factors contributing to this are strong operational performance and the impact of our recent investment activity.","Now just to highlight another important factor in what's happening with the company, we continue to add to our very talented management group. As you know, in 2011, we added Contis to our mall platform, Fivel, to help us in our legal and deal business. And obviously, I'm very pleased to announce the most recent addition many of you know, Matt Lentz. Matt is our Chief Investment Officer, which is a new position in our organization. He brings a great and extensive, broad real estate background both from a bricks-and-mortar point of view but also from a securities point of view, also very been involved in reviewing many international opportunities in his previous roles. He'll focus -- his job will primarily assist myself and others in the management group in pursuing strategic growth opportunities for the company. And Matt's first day on the job was, in fact, yesterday, and as far as I know, he's still here. But actually, his wife is about to give birth, so I hope he's not at the office.","Concluding, let me just say last second quarter, I addressed the unfair advantage that the Internet retailers have in not being required to collect sales and use tax on remote sales. I believe our efforts and others have made significant progress at the state level, but our tenants need Congress to act to level the playing field on a national level. In the past year, the Marketplace Equity Act was introduced by a bipartisan group of senators, and similar legislation has been introduced in the House to address the inequality in today's marketplace and level the playing field between bricks-and-mortars and online retail business. We support these proposals. We'll continue to be very focused on making this happen, and we appreciate all -- everybody's support in showing their strong support of this very important legislation.","So with that said, we can turn it over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first  question comes from the line of Mr. Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","David, just going to the JCPenney for a second, $1.24 [ph] is certainly below where you guys are trading. Just want to get a little more color on one, who approached who first, and two, just want to try and understand why someone would take $124 versus where your stock is trading in the open market.","David E. Simon","Well, look, let's just say we have a strong relationship with Penney. They're a very important retail partner of ours. I know -- Rick and I know Mr. Johnson, and we also know very well members of the board. So I'm not going to get into the particulars, but just so you understand, I mean, the unit holders have the ability to convert their units on a one-for-one basis for common shares. And we view it essentially as common stock equivalents because, obviously, they can convert it on a one-for-one basis. When they do that, then they -- we have the option to give them fully diluted stock or cash, and it was through that discussion that we negotiated the deal. And I'm very convinced it's a great opportunity for the company, and I think it met Penney's strategic goals in terms of their focus on what they're trying to do with their business. So we're pleased with the transaction, and beyond that, there's not much to add to it, Alexander.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then on Brazil, Equity International sold their stake in BR Malls. Just curious if you guys took a look at buying their stake or if there's any discussion around that.","David E. Simon","Well, we've looked at a lot of things with BR Malls. We've looked at a lot of things in Brazil. The good news is we're very close to approving our first outlet there, which will start construction here potentially within the next 30 to 60 days and open -- it's outside of S\u00e3o Paulo, and open late next year. That's not in this list that I've described to you, but it is moving a pace and I expect that to -- I expect that to happen, and I think we'll get our first outlet center built and open next year. So we're pleased we're making very good progress on that.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And just a final question just with the recent economic data. Has there been any change in the conversations with tenants? Are they still full steam ahead in terms of leasing space in their program this year, next year and further out?","Richard S. Sokolov","Alex, this is Rick. There really has not been any change. They are still coming in and aggressively looking for new opportunities across all the platforms.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Mr. Ross Nussbaum from UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you guys talk about the dynamics that you're seeing in the department store sector as you look ahead to next year? Obviously, you've got one big transformation going on at JCPenney and then you've got another different type of situation over at Sears. At what point do you guys -- or do you believe there's still needs to be some rationalization in terms of the number of boxes that are out there?","David E. Simon","Well, I put Penney in a completely -- Rick and I put Penney in a completely different category than Sears. I mean, Penney is very focused on delivering value to their customer. They have a very talented management team. We expect -- obviously, they are going through a transformation. But we expect Penney to be a viable mall anchor in a fashion that they have been historically. Sears is a little bit different. I mean, the fact of the matter is Sears needs less space. I think we've touched on this the last time. Sears needs less space than what they currently have, and I think there'll be ongoing discussions with us and Sears and the other mall people that will rationalize that space, creating opportunities for both the landlord and Sears. I really, really would not lump them in together. They're 2 different companies on 2 different paths. And at the end of the day, look, it's going to be -- Sears will be a lot of work, but we feel confident as they probably reduce some of their space that that will ultimately benefit us in the long run. Rick, anything you want to add?","Richard S. Sokolov","I would just add if you look at today's landscape in the department store universe, their equity, their balance sheets, their credit profiles are all dramatically better than they were just a few short years ago. You have Lord & Taylor that's been recreated into a very viable and aggressive growth vehicle. Dillard is very well situated. Macy's is well situated. Carson's has a new leadership and great financial upward trajectory. So candidly, we're in a better position now than we have been, and with no new development, these stores are maintaining their existing stores because they want to really enhance their top line.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And the second question is -- and I've gotten this question over the past couple of days from some of your investors. Does the hiring of Matt reflect in any way a signal that you intend to accelerate your international expansion, or is it more of a reflection that you just needed another body or 2 in the door given everything you've got going on?","David E. Simon","Well, it's really a function of what we've got going on. I mean, we -- believe it or not, this is a big company, and just like -- I am never satisfied with the portfolio and where we've taken the company. I'm always going to try and add talent to the organization. I've known Matt a long time. We talked on and off. We wanted to fill this position, lost probably in late '08 and then the world ended, so we put it on a back burner because we said, well, we're going hunker down. I just think there's so many opportunities for this company. It's very important to continue to add talent, another pair of hands, another deep thinker. He fits in great with the team. So to me, it was a no-brainer. And we'll take it wherever it goes, wherever we think we should invest. Who would have thought we would have bought our stock at $124 3 months ago? But that's -- we saw an opportunity. Who would have thought we would have invested internationally 4 months ago, get paid? I'm getting paid. Most people pay for options. I'm getting paid as I think about that company as optionality. What do I mean by that? If you look at the cash flow that we'll get from their dividend against the cost that it took both in equity and debt, we're going to get paid $55, plus or minus, million a year to decide what we want to do with that stake. That's a good spot to be in. There's not many malls you can build that can generate $55 million of cash flow. So having another guy to think these things with our team, I think, is exciting. I also think it -- with David and Steve, we hired Larry Krema to run our HR group. I think it also demonstrates that this company is a neat place to work and be part of.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt from Bank of America.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The pace of outlet development, it actually seems as high as it's ever been. I'm wondering if that's sustainable going forward in 2014 and 2015?","David E. Simon","On the new development or the redevelopment?","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The new development.","David E. Simon","I still think the full-price new development still is not -- it's still a ways away, even though there are a couple announced ones here and there. The outlet business still has some pockets, but again, I think we discussed the last time. I mean, I don't -- I know there's all these ones that are being bandied about, but I think it's going to be harder to do. So I think pure new development is still going to be a little bit -- still be less than everybody thinks. The redevelopment, though, has the potential to really pick up, and that's where -- thankfully, between Rick and Contis, that's where a big, big focus is. That has, Craig, a little bit of potential to do more than what we're doing. But Rick, you can add to that thinking.","Richard S. Sokolov","Yes. Just on the outlet side, right now, it's being driven by explosive demand among a number of tenants that are not in the business that want to get in the business. And I don't want to lose sight of the fact that this demand is going to help our existing portfolio dramatically and that you're seeing that in our result. There's got to be a finite end to the arc of new development. There's a limited number of new opportunities. On the redevelopment side, when David articulated, I believe it was last year or the year before, our redevelopment program, we identified some for you. Literally, 3 quarters of them are under construction right now, and we're in the process of reloading that pipeline with the next wave of opportunities. So there's a lot going on, and if you look in the 8-K, we're producing low double-digit yields on those, which, on a risk-adjusted basis, are even better than they are on just a return basis, which are terrific in and of themselves.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess when I look at your portfolio, you have between Westbury -- Woodbury, Orlando, San Marcos, centers that are at 700,000 square feet and larger. Is there the capacity in your portfolio to take some as large as that?","David E. Simon","I think that it's in the outlet side. That's still going to be few and far between. I mean, we're making Orlando bigger. We're making Vegas bigger. We're making Desert Hills bigger. But these are, I hate using this word, but iconic outlets. Those will all be bigger. Those are all -- Seattle's getting bigger. Chicago will get bigger. So these are all -- that is probably underappreciated opportunity for this company. Just like -- Craig, I mean, people talk they're going to do this, they're going to do that. People are focused on a company having this particular lease here and there. We've got 5 outlets under construction. We just opened one. So people talk about, well, we're about to or hoping to lease the space. Hello, we got 5 under construction, so...","Richard S. Sokolov","And you just mentioned expansions of many of the best outlet centers in the United States.","David E. Simon","Right. And that coupled. So there is a lot to what we're doing. That's why we have great here.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","We saw a report that Bank of America is not renewing its deals to keep their ATMs in Simon Malls this year. Because of that or for other reasons, do you expect any material changes in your ancillary income?","David E. Simon","No. In fact, we've already replaced them with another operator. That's been in the works for, really, a couple of years. No big deal. Yes, I was surprised it got the press, but no big deal.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then also, you reported land sale gains of over $6 million. Could you tell us who you sold that land to?","David E. Simon","Yes, I don't have it in front of me, but...","Richard S. Sokolov","We sold a piece of land in Northwest Houston for a supermarket right next to our Houston Premium Outlets, and that was a pretty substantial gain.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Cedrick Lachance from Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Just going back on outlets, in regards to Silver Sands, you got a loan there from the bank at a rate under 4%. Can you give me a sense of the appetite for mortgage financing in the outlet space at this point?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Yes, Cedrik, most of our portfolio in the outlet business, because it's wholly-owned, is unencumbered. But where we have shown the products to the mortgage market, whether it's the banks or the life companies, I think they recognize the quality and the stability of the cash flow, so I think about Philadelphia Premium Outlets, we had a mortgage on. We just got some financing on the -- we've got a construction\/mini firm on Toronto at very attractive pricing. So it's a very attractive, very viable product for that market.","David E. Simon","Yes, I mean -- and I would just say, Cedrik, throw that in for the Mills projects, too. I mean, we're -- some of these are locked out, but the ones that are open and the ones that we bought out of the TMLP are extremely financeable, and that financing rivals any A mall that there is out there as well.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And just going back a little bit, looking at the big picture, where do you see the most fertile ground for investments today? Is it primarily in publicly traded companies, or is it in malls or outlets that are owned privately?","David E. Simon","Well, that's a tough one, Cedrik, to be honest with you. At this point, I would probably say that outside the opportunity that we saw at Klepierre, it's probably the private deals that we see as the most -- the biggest opportunity primarily because the private owners are going to have a much more difficult time to get financing and\/or the private individuals that may want to monetize their business for whatever reason or their asset for whatever reason. I would say that's probably the biggest opportunity that we see, though it doesn't rule out that eventually, there may be some more public opportunities. But I would say to you as we think about what we're looking at, they tend to be more private-oriented, and it's either financing issues or state issues or whatever that's driving the need to do it. Now philosophically, we will not -- we don't rarely -- and I don't blackline everything, but we don't participate in bidding when -- if there's a banker or a broker and it says, \"Bids are due at 2:00 p.m. Please send in your letter.\" We don't do that. I mean, I can't remember the last deal that we did where we'll participate in an auction. I mean, we just don't do it. We don't need to do it. We have no interest in doing it. So these are people that want to do business with us, and then we -- it doesn't mean that they're not represented by bankers or whatever, but those bankers know that if there's an auction, they can send it to the next mall guy. We're not going to play.","Operator","The next question is from David Harris from Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","On the appointment of Matt Lentz, how much experience has Matt acquired outside of public securities over the years?","David E. Simon","He's had -- he used to be a broker. He's been in the bricks-and-mortar business, so I think it's pretty good. I mean, we've got a group here that any -- not that I think there's any holes there, but we've got a lot of guys here that know about bricks-and-mortar that will help him.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Will his compensation details be made public?","David E. Simon","I believe it'll be whatever this -- I can't keep track of all the rules, but I think he will be one of the...","Stephen E. Sterrett","He'll be a named executive officer.","David E. Simon","Yes, I think he'll be a Form 4, 5 -- I don't know. Whatever the rules are, he'll be part of the rules.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","So that will be in next year's proxy?","David E. Simon","Potentially. I'm not going to guarantee it because I really don't know.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Then turning to Klepierre, if I'm doing my numbers right, it sounded like you were down about $200 million on your investment here, about half is the stock depreciation and half is FX. You did put in $1 billion against $2 billion gross investment by way of a hedge, by way of your -- I think it was a credit line facility. Have you expanded that or hedged your position against the currency any more since then? I mean, it looks like all the risks are to the downside, David.","David E. Simon","Yes, well, David, look, we don't -- I don't think about -- the good news about -- for the investors is I actually think about the real estate long term, not quarter-to-quarter. So yes, the euro is down a little bit. The stock, we did buy it at a premium to where it was trading. That gap has been closed. In fact, it's been up since -- where we bought it. We kind of look at where we bought it versus the net asset value, and we still think the net asset value is higher than when we bought it. I'm not going to panic about the euro. It's a good portfolio. It's stable. You'll see the results later today. So to me, this isn't -- it's not a quarter-to-quarter gain. So that's of no concern to me, no consequence to me. But we did increase our hedge, and we're about 60-some percent hedged. We did that before even the latest euro depreciation. But I think the other point is that -- and if I could put it in real estate context, the real question is what happens in the principal. But this is not -- we didn't do this based upon short-term trading patterns. But if you look at the dividend and our cost of financing, just a simple -- go back, you know real estate, right?","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","A little, just a little.","David E. Simon","Cash on cash returns. We're going to get roughly, and this is even with the lower currency, we're going to get $55 million added cash flow while we decide whether we love this company, we want to maintain our investment, whether -- who knows what we do with this investment. But the fact of the matter is we're getting paid while we help make it a better company, which we're doing today. And I think about what it takes to build $55 million of additional cash flow, and I think it's a good trade. But look, the proof will be in the pudding. We'll see.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Another question on Klepierre. Since the election of Hollande, there have been a raft of tax changes, including increases in the dividend tax. Have any of these prompted you to recalculate your pro forma after-tax returns?","David E. Simon","No, no. None of those at this point will have an impact on us.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan from Morgan Stanley.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On the sales growth trends that have been continuing to impress, I mean, maybe you could answer a little bit of the composition of it. I mean, clearly, they're above what a lot of retailers are reporting on a portfolio-wide basis. So I mean, how much of the increase is a same-tenant basis versus sort of shifts in the mix within the mall? And then maybe on a trend basis, kind of how is the tourist spending side of your portfolio going?","Richard S. Sokolov","Let me unpack that a little bit. One, the  tourist aspects of the portfolios are still very strong. We're still seeing a lot of activity from a number of the tourism groups, but the only one that's softened at all is Japan. So that is still a major contributor, and we are out-weighted in tourist market. Secondly, when you think about the contributions of any one tenant, our sales base is over 60 million square feet. So when you get a number out of us, it's a broad-based trend. It's not going to be materially influenced by the out-performance of any one or any collection of tenants. Thirdly, I believe this reflects the fact that we're doing a good job making our properties better and hopefully taking market share from other properties operating in our markets. And that comes from adding better tenants, adding additional anchors, adding renovations and making our physical plants better, and all of ose things are feeding into what you're seeing as our bottom line sales growth.","Stephen E. Sterrett","And Paul, this is Steve. I'd just add one more comment that if you componentize that growth a bit, the rate of sales pace growth that we're seeing in the outlets in the malls is pretty much on top of each other.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And so, I mean, would you say that the kind of the non-same tenant number is maybe -- if your 10% comp year-over-year, is it -- half of that is due to change in mix or...","David E. Simon","Let me just say this. Our comp numbers and our rolling 12 are right on top of each other, absolutely right on top of each other, if that's what you're getting at. The comp sales and the rolling 12 are exactly right on top of each other.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just on terms of new concepts, I mean, there's been good growth from -- a lot of the public chains have sort of gotten back into growth mode. I haven't as many new concepts at least relative to the kind of '04 to '06 period. Maybe that's sort of what spurred a lot of development that you're not seeing now. But maybe, Rick, are you seeing signs that we're about to see an acceleration of new concepts?","Richard S. Sokolov","Well, there's a couple of things that are happening. One, a number of retailers that were new concepts, say, x years ago are now public, and they are substantially accelerating their growth because they have a very firm capital plan. Francesca, Teavana, Tumi, Five Below, Fresh Market. We also are seeing a number of concepts that were, again, relatively new a while ago that are being aggressively grown by their companies, Crazy 8, PS by Aero. But we're also seeing a number of new concepts, Versona by Cato, Dry Goods by Von Maur, Vince by Kellwood, C. Wonder, Hearts on Fire, Tesla. Hot Topic is doing Blackheart.","David E. Simon","We get it. We get it.","Richard S. Sokolov","So I'm going to wear you out. But there's a lot of stuff that's going on in that sector still.","David E. Simon","Paul, we all cringed because this gives Rick the opportunity to list all these tenents. Okay, so...","Operator","The next question is from the line of Steve Sakwa from ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","David, I was just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more about some of the synergies and maybe best practices that both Klepierre and Simon are kind of sharing with each other. And I realize it's still kind of in early days, but are there any sort of success stories or things that you could sort of talk about that kind of show how things are kind of transforming kind of across both companies?","David E. Simon","Well, look, the fact is we've been very focused on the balance sheet. As you know, they've raised a lot of money in the bond market at much lower spreads than where they were beforehand. So that's a very tangible, very important, credible and important thing that we brought to the table. I'm not sure that absent our investment that they would have been able to do it. We've also reduced the reliance on their funding from BNP. And I mean, those are real tangible -- in the bounds of the organization making happen. Operationally, I mean, we're helping them think about all the promotional other income opportunities. I mean, that's going to take time, but we are now talking to certain sponsors on a global basis. We've helped them with a few tenants and a few areas on a global basis. Their head of leasing was in our -- at our shopping center convention, the ICSC. We had a number of global meetings with him and our people with the global brands, including H&M, Apple, just to name a few, Hollister. So it's happening. That stuff's going to take time, but the bond business is tangible. It's there, it happened, and that's only been in 4 months. Now strategically, you'll see changes with this company over a period of time. And the management team there has been very, very good, very cooperative, very interested in replicating what we have and listening to what we have to say. So it's working. It's a lot of work. We spent -- I spent last week there touring assets with them, going through strategy, going through numbers, going through developments. Actually, it's a scary thing helping design some of the extensions. It's scary because I was helping them, and that's -- but there's certain things I've learned over the years, too. So it's happening. It's going to take time. There's a lot that we're providing. There's more that we'll provide over a period of time. We're also respectful. We've been there 4 months. We try not to be Attila the Hun. We want to be -- we want to learn as much as we can. But the cooperation, the synergies are available. They're there. The chemistry between their managers and ours have been great. The only negative is that every morning, I have to hear about Europe every day. Harris reminded me of some of the ups and downs that go with the territory in trying to create value. We're big boys. We know nothing's easy. But I look at it, I'm getting paid to make this company better, and I've got a board and a management team that wants to get better, and we've got people here that can help make them better. And it's happening, and you can see it in the bond yields right away.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess second question, last quarter, we talked a little bit about the St. Louis project and kind of where you and the other project from Taubman were. Now that you guys have kind of started construction and had your groundbreaking, I'm just wondering, kind of maybe being first out of the ground, has the leasing dynamic changed at all? And can you kind of provide us with maybe an update on where you are leasing on that project?","David E. Simon","Well, we announced a whole host of tenants on July 11. We've added a few more to that mix. I mean, look, they're -- Taubman's a formidable competitor. I'm sure they'll announce certain tenants as well. We anticipate that they're going to build their project. We're going to build ours. Our numbers are -- we're comfortable with our investment. This is not driven by ego, by any stretch of the imagination. We expect to get our lease. We expect to have double-digit returns. Taubman's a very formidable competitor. I'm sure they'll feel the same way about what they're doing. And it's most likely that we're going to have 2 outlet centers there. But I think, as I said, we're comfortable. We've got a lot of experience in the outlet business. I've been at it since '98. We were -- people scratched their head when we did our first joint venture with Chelsea. People scratched their head when we bought it in '04. I got confidence in our team. We expect to build a very high-yielding outlet center and we're moving forward with it.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just last question on kind of the international outlets I see. I think, if I did my math right, that Japan sales were up kind of 5% to 6%. And I'm just wondering, how do you kind of look at Japan in terms of potentially new outlets? And maybe talk a little bit about just how Korea's performing and also the new project in Malaysia and any update on the China project.","David E. Simon","Sure. Generally, Asia is very strong. I mean, there's supply and -- and even with all the -- it gets down to kind of almost Europe to some extent. I mean, even with all the macro headlines in Japan, I mean, they're still doing roughly $1,000 a foot. And there's just not that many, and they're just not going to be that many. We've got our ninth that will open next spring. It's in a great location. We have a terrific partner in Mitsubishi Estate. So I don't think that 9 is going to go to 18. There might be 1 or 2 or 3 more to do in the next few years. We're also -- as you know, there, we phase a lot of stuff in, so we'll do 3, 4, 5 phases there. Japan, so even with all the headwinds and everything else, we've got a wonderful niche there, and we'll continue to exploit it and increase the cash flow there. Korea's the same thing. There's 1 or 2 formidable competitors, but our outlets there are probably -- what's the -- $700 a foot? $800?","Stephen E. Sterrett","$800.","David E. Simon","$800 a foot. The brands that we deliver are great. We have a very good partner there as well. So it's fine in Malaysia. It's exactly what we thought it would be. It's really trying to get access to a Singaporean market. We have a great partner there. They're doing stuff worldwide, which we're talking to them about, some other opportunities, and it's meeting our expectations there, so so far, so good. China is a little bit not as far along as we would like it. It's still a very complex place to do business. We're still hopeful that we'll get one started there. But it is more complex, and we're being more cautious given the -- if you think there's a robust pipeline in the outlet business here, you happen to think that pipeline has been around for years and years and not much will get -- not much of it will get built. The pipeline there expands daily. So we're trying to really underwrite it smartly, make sure this is something that we want to do. We do have a good partner in Shanghai. But we're going to be very, very judicious in how we ultimately build something there.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan from Cowen and Company.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","David, I appreciate all the commentary on Klepierre. I have one other question. As I recall, their 2011 asset sales were completed at about a 5% premium to appraised NAV, and I believe at the beginning of this year, they talked about planning EUR 1 billion of additional sales for this year and next. I wonder if you could tell us number one, if that disposition plan is still in place and what the pricing expectations are relative to NAV.","David E. Simon","Well, look, they're going to announce probably shortly here. But generally, I'll say this, and I want to be very careful. Everything -- they're ahead of schedule, and NAV, by and large, has not been an issue in terms of being able to sell the assets at or above their NAV. But you'll see their results. I don't want to -- I just want to be very careful here because they do report or they may have already reported. I think they go out at 6:00 Central European Time. But so far, so good. And it's still on plan, perhaps ahead of schedule, and it's moving right along.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Second question on Woodbury, which you mentioned earlier and you mentioned also in the last call, in terms of the expansion potential there, can you indicate whether the plan is to add square footage on land you already own or at land you otherwise control?","David E. Simon","It's land that we own. So it's really reconfiguring a number of spaces, decking some of the parking and creating additional space on the land that we own.","Richard S. Sokolov","It's about a 60,000 square feet addition, primarily reconfiguring the additional -- the existing formats and just substantially upgrading the whole physical plant.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then separately on Amazon, David, you touched on this in, again, your prepared comments. But as they prepare to pay sales taxes in several large states this quarter and open more infill DCs, have they had any discussions with you about opening outlet or full-price stores?","David E. Simon","Not with us.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then final question, just a line item in other income maybe for Steve. The interest and dividend income was down materially on a consecutive-quarter basis. I wonder if you could tell us what's going on with that line item.","Stephen E. Sterrett","A couple of things, Jim. Number one, the dividend from our U.K. investment, CSC, was a second quarter event last year, third quarter this year, just the timing of their payment of that dividend. And then we had some investments in some loans that were, in fact, paid off earlier this year, so interest income is down.","David E. Simon","Yes, we're bummed out about that.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So on a full year basis, so the loans that were paid off, it sounds like they're variable on a year-over-year basis.","Stephen E. Sterrett","On a year-over-year basis, that's correct.","David E. Simon","And then the other point is we did -- as you know, we did have the mez loan with Mills, and obviously, that got paid off and retired as part of that whole transaction, so you're seeing that as well, Jim.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley from Citi.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just another Klepierre question. David, your involvement in forming the strategic direction for the company, does that involve acquisitions at this stage, or is Klepierre somewhat held back by levering cost of capital at this stage?","David E. Simon","I don't think that they are. I don't know that it should be their #1 focus. And we actually did discuss at the recent meetings a couple of opportunities that are out there. But I don't think  it should be their #1 focus. But I don't think it's too far off in the future that we could be -- it could be up there, and we do think there's going to be a number of opportunistic deals. And again, it doesn't mean Klepierre. It could be Simon. It could be all sorts of things. But there are going to be a handful of those things to do, and I think it should be on the agenda, but probably not at the top of the list.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of Brazil, could you give us an update on discussions with retailers regarding the Brazil outlet industry? And in particular, I'm interested in some of what the domestic Brazilian retailers' thoughts are on the outlet industry and the outlet channel given, I guess, the infancy of that industry down there.","Richard S. Sokolov","We had a, almost, say, 30 days ago, kind of a presentation to a number of Brazilian plus international retailers about our outlet pipeline with BR Malls. It was very, very well attended. The international retailers are growing there daily, and certainly, the high-end guys that we think are important to bring into the outlet properties are gaining entrance into Brazil on a weekly basis, so to speak, like Tory Burch just opened a store at a new high-end mall in S\u00e3o Paulo. So very, very well attended. The Brazilian retailers are very excited about the pipeline, and we expect them to populate these outlets aggressively. So it's very, very encouraging kind of what's going on down there.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Rich Moore from RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is Wes Golladay. A quick question on the outlets. We've heard the number 100 outlets in 10 years. Do you think there's actually more capacity than that for development in the United States?","David E. Simon","No, and I wouldn't put much credence in our opinion, we could be wrong, but certainly, we don't think there's 10 outlets in -- or 100 outlets in 10 years. Not a chance. We don't see it that way.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Well, I guess, maybe how would you view it, the total opportunity for development?","David E. Simon","Look, I think there'll be a handful, but I don't see 100 outlets in 10 years, not a chance.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And turning to the malls, what are you guys seeing in terms of traffic trends for the last quarter?","Richard S. Sokolov","Traffic has been relatively flat to up a little in all the platforms.","Operator","The next question comes from Christy McElroy from UBS.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sorry for all the outlet questions, I just have a follow-up. Given the pipeline in the U.S. with competing projects and quite a few private developers in the fray, I'm wondering how influential the core group of outlet retailers are in the center actually getting built. And while demand for space is obviously very strong today, how are the deciding factors for retailers signing a lease and a new project different compared to what they were 5 to 7 years ago?","David E. Simon","Well, look, we are living this every day. I would say to you it is still quite a challenge to convince outlet retailers, whether they're manufacturers or full-price retailers. This is our experience, and we have a pretty good portfolio, pretty big one. I think it's still quite a challenge to convince them to go to new centers. That's why all this talk about this unbelievable demand and all of this hundred centers and this that and the other, I've got to tell you we work our tails off to convince the  retailers that this is worthy of an outlet center. So I don't think it's, by any stretch of the imagination, simple and easy to do. When we do it, we have confidence we'll do it. But it is not like you can plop these anywhere by anybody, anywhere by anybody, and it'll be successful. It's just not going to happen. And I think the retailers that have a high understanding of this business, whether they're manufacturers or full-price retailers, understand that and will also govern. They're open to buy very seriously.","Richard S. Sokolov","The only thing I would add is I think we would hope that the retailers have a high regard for the consistency of what we produce. David and I were just up in New Hampshire and visited Merrimack. That is an incredibly well-executed, well-leased, well-marketed project, and hopefully, we have that going for us when we approach retailers about our new project. They have confidence that we will -- they know what we will deliver and know that it will produce.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then on your property operating expenses, they seem to run a little bit lower than normal again this quarter. I know in Q1, there were some favorable comps, given weather and such. I'm wondering if there was anything specific in Q2 that you could point to, any trends that favorably impacted OpEx this quarter. And is there a way for you to break out your same-store NOI growth between revenue growth and expense growth?","David E. Simon","Well, there's a way to do it, but we don't. I assume we know what drives our business. Look, where size and scale -- when we talked about this company 15 years ago or 17 years ago or 18 years ago, we thought size and scale matter for a couple of different points. Retail relationships, ability to run efficiently, ability to cover our overhead at the executive level over a huge asset base more efficiently than our peer groups, that's what it takes to generate comp NOI growth, and that's what we do. Nothing jumps out, as we're reviewing it right now, that is worthy of mention. But we are very focused on our operating margins, and our size and scale and quality of assets allow us to do that.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tayo Okusanyo from Jefferies.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question in regards to any early indications about what back-to-school may look like this year?","David E. Simon","It's really too early to say at this point.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then, David, any other market -- I mean, you guys are seniors in many key markets, but any other markets internationally that you might be interested in?","David E. Simon","Let's see. Look, we have a big investment in Klepierre, and I think internationally, that's the big focus. We have got to make sure that that turns out to be a profitable investment. That's the #1 priority. The outlet business in Asia continues to progress. I explained that in detail to you. But that's really the focus. I mean, Brazil, Latin America, I mean, I do think will present more and more opportunities, not just Brazil but all of South America, for the company. And so I think you'll see us hopefully do some smart things down there over time. And Steve is whispering to me, but you can certainly jump in there. But we do have -- we are building Canada, Toronto. I mean, Toronto, there was a lot of talk about it. There's not a lot of talk about it now. We are under construction. We're going to have a great outlet there. We've got a great partner. We're looking at another deal in Canada, but hopefully, that will be a market that will possess -- present a few more opportunities for us.","Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just the last question. In regards to the supplemental line of credit, the additional $2 billion, should we be reading something into that in regards that you guys are seeing something out there that you need that additional source of capital for?","David E. Simon","I would just say it's consistent with our philosophy to be as prudent and opportunistic as we possibly can be. I mean, you're always trying to balance prudence against opportunity. They tend to kind of conflict each other. When you should be prudent, there's a lot of opportunities, so you try to get that right balance. And the world -- let's face it. The world is going to continue to be uncertain for, I think, a few years to come. If not, that's just the world we live in. So there's no reason not to be -- not to have the ability to be both prudent and opportunistic. And then based on how we read the tea leaves, figure out where the primary -- who wins, prudence or opportunity.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John Kim from CLSA.","John P. Kim - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","I had a question on the Main Street Fairness Act. Do you view this initiative as ultimately a revenue booster for your centers, or is this more of a defense mechanism?","David E. Simon","Look, I think it helps -- I think it's going to help our merchants. Anything that helps our merchants ultimately helps us. Look, Congress should not -- look, this is a states' right issue. I think most people in this country believe in state rights. So that's one aspect of it. But also, the government, Congress should not be picking, creating winners and losers. And this certainly has helped fuel the online against the bricks-and-mortar. Certainly, we're not -- oh this is going to mean x million of revenues, but if it helps our merchants, it's bound to trickle down to us in some way, shape or form.","John P. Kim - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","So for the states that have already begun collecting tax from Internet companies, you haven't really seen a noticeable difference in sales?","David E. Simon","It's so early in that effort that I would -- certainly, we haven't seen anything, but it is just beginning.","John P. Kim - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Okay. On Klepierre, I don't see the second quarter numbers out yet, but in the first quarter, retail sales in Spain were down 6%, Italy was down 2%. What's the bull case for the company to potentially turn these markets around?","David E. Simon","Well, look, I think the bull case is that supply and demand will be in their favor once demand picks up because you cannot expand. It's very hard to get the right to build there. And the other point is they've got a great portfolio in Northern Europe, which is somewhat insulated from what's going on in kind of the Scandinavian areas, somewhat insulated from what's going on in Continental Europe. I think operationally, there are things that we can do to help the company increase its cash flow. And an operational focus from the company, we think, will increase the cash, so I think that's the bull case. The negative is, look, they're going to have to weather tough environment. The one country there that continues to be difficult for them is Spain. And again, it's not all Spain. It's certain assets in Spain. And we'll weather that storm, and I think as things stabilize, we'll get back to being able to generate cash flow growth from those assets.","John P. Kim - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Sure. And maybe just a follow-up to David Harris's question, if the euro continues to decline, how would that impact your decision to potentially acquire the remaining part of the company?","David E. Simon","We really -- at this point, we're pleased with our investment, and that's the focus. I can't really speculate on that going forward. Certainly, it makes it cheaper, right?","John P. Kim - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Yes, well, that's the potential outcome.","David E. Simon","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Nathan Isbee from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just going back to the same-store growth, I assume a good portion of that is coming from the 3.7% average base rent growth. Can you give us some detail on where the 3.7% growth is coming from, especially given your spreads are right around 10%?","Richard S. Sokolov","We're basically in the position of one, increasing occupancy; two, we're adding considerable number of anchors that are generating revenue. But see, it's just re-leasing our space at higher rents. And when you look at our expiring rents and look at what our average rent is, we've got a nice spread in there. And as our product gets better, we're able to take advantage of that and generate the higher rental revenues.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","The 3.7% is in your small shop, correct?","David E. Simon","Correct, yes.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And the 10% spreads, I assume across maybe 10% to 13%.","Stephen E. Sterrett","Yes, Nate, this is Steve. We've had this discussion before on calls, but one thing, we calculate our spread in the most conservative way possible, which is what is the ending cash rent that a tenant was paying compared to the beginning cash rent that the new tenant or the same tenant on the new lease is paying. And that is a much more conservative approach than the GAAP method of which you're preparing financials, which would include the straight-lining of both the old lease and the new lease. So that's going to have some impact on it.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, I understand. Even on a cash basis, the delta between, let's say, 1.3% to 1.5%, let's say, from your spreads to 3.7% across a very large portfolio is still pretty wide.","David E. Simon","Well, you got overage rent. I mean, you got lots of things that...","Stephen E. Sterrett","You're taking overage rent and you're capturing it in the new base rent.","David E. Simon","I mean, you got a lot of things going on.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one final question, a follow-up on St. Louis. Can you give us some insight on how the tenants are viewing the 2 projects? Are there any tenants that you're aware of that have said no to you because they were going next door?","David E. Simon","Yes, yes. There are a handful of tenants that had said no to us, absolutely.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And are there any tenants that have signed in both?","David E. Simon","There are some that have expressed that they're prepared to do both.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And so is it safe to say you're not putting in normal radius restrictions or you're not having the success putting them in...","David E. Simon","I think it's a tenant-by-tenant discussion. I don't think there's any -- it's a tenant by tenant -- we're going to tend to get that for the people that commit just to us like we do for every other outlet center.","Richard S. Sokolov","And the only other thing to say is we have announced, as David said, we're now 62% leased and committed. So that is certainly consistent with the kind of leasing progress we have had on all of our new projects.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from Macquarie.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","Just a couple of quick follow-ups. First on leasing. Could you comment on -- I know you figured releasing spreads that you quote are on a cash basis. What would that look like on a straight-line basis for that 10% number?","Stephen E. Sterrett","Ki Bin, we don't calculate it on a straight-line basis. As David has said, I think, gazillions of times on this calls, the laser focus is cash flow, and so that's the way we look at the spread.","David E. Simon","It would be higher, though.","Stephen E. Sterrett","It would be higher.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","Yes, that was what I was trying to get at.","David E. Simon","We're still getting steps in all of our leases.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","And if it's possible, could you comment on what is the average vintage of the leases that have been expiring this year? Are they, like, 7 years old? And the second part of that question is, if you could calculate, what would the, on a like-for-like basis, the sales per square foot be back then versus today?","Richard S. Sokolov","I want to caution you on 2 things. One, and Steve touched on it earlier, when we roll over, we've done a very good job over the years getting much more focused on our breakpoints on our overage rent. So when you look at the relationship between the spreads and our comp NOI growth, there's a comp NOI being generated from sources other than just our spread. And David just said we also build in all of our bumps over the course of the leases, so the ending rent has already been impacted by our ability to raise the base rent over the existing terms.","David E. Simon","But if you look at '04, '05 sales per square foot, they were in the $400s, and we're rolling leases over. I mean, our expiration aren't in front of me, but it's the mid to high 30s. I mean, that's -- so now we're at $550, and we're getting in the 50s. I mean, that gives you a sense of what's happened on that. I think that's what you asked.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","Yes. I just want to clarify that. So you're saying roughly, on a like-for-like basis...","David E. Simon","In other words, if you look at the leases we did 6, 7 years ago are rolling off today. These are rough, rough numbers, but they were $38, $37, $38. That probably was just under 9% -- probably under 10%, probably 9% of sales. And if you look at where we are today, we're $550. And that relationship is probably still pretty the same, but therein lies the spread differential. That's what you're thinking about.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","Yes. And just last quick question, in respect to your comp sale, 1.5%, 1.4% treasury rates and maybe risk premiums offsetting some of that decline. How has that impacted B mall pricing, and have you seen any additional activity on that front?","David E. Simon","Well, look, I think -- and I think this applies, which is great. I mean, this is what PIMCO -- this is what Bill Gross said. I mean, the fact of the matter is unless the real estate is going out of business, okay, the fact is people are going to need cash flow growth, right? And that's the world that we live in. In a slow growth environment, rates are going to stay low, cash flow is going to be stable. I mean, if we proved anything to you over the years, it's that this real estate is -- it doesn't mean that certain things don't turn against us, and they have, okay? We've had centers that we've lost for whatever reason. But these things are sticky, cash flow is stable and yield is there. And you're seeing it by opportunistic investors. You're seeing it -- I mean, in Europe, you're seeing it. I mean, the stuff that Klepierre is selling is to yield-hungry investors. Why would they want to buy the German bond when they can get a 6 yield or 5.5, 6 yield on a stable asset? I think that's great for us to be in, not just us but all real estate companies. And that's a very attractive feature, one of the reasons why we're increasing our dividend.","Ki Bin Kim - Macquarie Research","I guess maybe do you expect any kind of reignition of the transaction market for BMO in the second half and maybe specific to you, too?","David E. Simon","With those -- with the outlook the way it is, the answer is yes, and it's happening slowly. I mean, you're starting to see the market pick up.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley from Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Michael Bilerman. David, I just want to come back to the unit purchase from JCPenney, and I think most would agree with your comment that units, think of them as one-for-one common stock equivalents. So being able to buy something back and create $60 million of shareholder value is impressive, given the fact that there's still another 61 million units outstanding. And so is there something particular about this OP agreement with JCPenney that -- where there was restrictions or something that would have caused the value of that stake to be 20% less than what the market is?","David E. Simon","No. There's only one operating partnership, and all the unitholders are treated the same. There's a preferred unit, but we're getting rid of that soon. But all the unit holders, there's no separate, different agreements. They're all the same.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So then going back to the question of getting a 20% discount, was there a time lapse effectively if they came to you and said, \"Okay, I'm going to exercise -- I'm going to put my notice in to redeem units,\" and now you have the option of delivering them stock or cash. Was there a time that they saved on that?","David E. Simon","The time actually is very quick, but put that aside. We actually didn't get noticed, technically. But there was a discussion about -- relatively simple. If they give us -- they did not give us notice. They give us notice, they get the stock, and they can market it. We actually -- Shelly, correct me. But we actually have to register the stock, I think, right?","Shelly J. Doran","[indiscernible]","David E. Simon","So it's freely tradable, we register it, boom, done. It was in the discussion that obviously, it turned to cash. And we part -- believe it or not, we part with our cash. We're very tough whenever we write a check out of this building. We are very focused on parting with our cash. We like cash, and that's what happened.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But if they were to take stock, how quickly could they have monetized that stock?","David E. Simon","Two million shares, I assume it's pretty quick.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Why would someone leave $55 million on the table? I mean, it's not like small potatoes, right?","David E. Simon","Well, look, I'm not going to get into that. Let's move on, Michael.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Is there other opportunities that you have with -- you still have 61 million units. I recognize a lot of them are family -- there's a bunch of family units in there. But is there other opportunities where you can buy back stock at such an accretive discount?","David E. Simon","Look, there's nothing that I can really add to that other than what I've already said.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just curious what the board's course of action has been since the proxy and the shareholder vote.","David E. Simon","Well, look, I mean, it is -- the board obviously has taken the vote to heart. They are very focused in talking to shareholders about it. The good news -- look, I mean, the fact of the matter is we're putting this -- our focus, our #1 focus, and that's me, Rick, Steve, the other members of our team, is on the business, okay, and obviously, our performance over this year, last year, for as long as we've all been together, is pretty good, and it speaks for itself. And we have all the confidence in the world that we'll continue to deliver very good performance to our shareholders. There's no guarantees, but that's the focus. The vote, given our performance, was extremely disappointing, and we didn't understand the vote, and there's enough precedence out there to suggest it was -- we just didn't understand the vote. But we'll be talking to our shareholders about it, trying to understand the way they voted it. And I will say that we've had some discussions. There's not a clear consensus as to why we voted -- they voted against it. We've had a number of shareholders that were supportive of it, but the board will take its job very seriously. We welcome any shareholder comments. We've had discussions with shareholders. We expect to have more, and we'll take it from there. But the #1 focus, obviously, even though we're disappointed because we've been such stewards of capital and performance, continues to be how do we make this company better, and we do it every day. But we've had discussions, and we'll continue to have more discussions with shareholders.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, hopefully, this is okay from JCPenney, but should we expect any other announcements between you and JCPenney in regards to maybe buying anchor boxes or other sort of ventures with them in the future?","David E. Simon","Well, no. This thing was just really focused on the transaction that we did. We'll talk to them like we talk to all of our retail partners, but nothing -- I wouldn't expect anything out of the normal course of business.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller from JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Most have been answered, but just one question. David, in the past, you cut up the U.S. portfolio based on sales just to show how concentrated it was, x percent of your NOI comes from over $800, over $500 a foot in sales. When you look at the Klepierre portfolio, how concentrated is it on that basis?","David E. Simon","It's really not up for me to do that, but I'm sure they'll welcome the question. I will say this, they do a very sophisticated analysis of their portfolio, buys, hold, redevelopment. But it's really not up for me to do it. But I do think the quality is there, the opportunities for enhancing the operations are there, but it's really not up for me to do that. I will tell you, though, they're very sophisticated in how they slice and dice the portfolio and what they want to do with the assets.","Operator","Sir, you have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Simon.","David E. Simon","Thank you. Thanks for your questions, and we look forward to answering anything else you might need over the next few days. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation.

Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Good morning. We're pleased to report another record quarter with continued strong operating and financial results. Our investment in our product remains unabated with a long-term view of creating compelling integrated environments with critical mass that service the hub of retail, dining, entertainment and socializing within their communities. We completed several significant new developments and redevelopments in the quarter or under construction and others and announced more transformational mixed-use activity that will further enhance the value of our real estate and grow our cash flow.","Turning to the results, highlighted FFO by $1.90 billion or $3.05 per share, an increase of 5.5% per share compared to the prior year. We continue to grow our cash flow and report solid key operating metrics. Total portfolio NOI increased 4.1% or approximately $188 million to-date. Comp NOI increased 2.3% for the year-to-date period.","Leasing activity remains solid. Average base rent was $53.88, up 2.8% compared to last year. The Mall and Premium Outlet recorded leasing spreads of $7.59 per square foot, an increase of 13.9%. We're pleased that retailer sales momentum continued in the third quarter.","Our Mall and Premium Outlets was $650 compared to $622 in the prior year period per foot, an increase of 4.5%, and sales were strong across the portfolio in the third quarter. Retail sales productivity has increased each month over the last 12 consecutive months.","Occupancy at the end of the quarter was 95.5%, an increase of 80 basis points for the second quarter and an increase of 20 basis points compared to prior years.","On an NOI weighted basis, our operating metrics were as follows. Retail sales would be $817 per foot compared to $650, occupancy would be 96.3% compared to 95.5% and average base minimum rent would be $71.21 compared to $53.88.","At the end of September, we opened Denver Premium Outlet. Center is fully leased. It's off to great start. Center is another terrific asset within a great portfolio and a great location and a strong and growing market.","Construction continues on two international outlets, expected to open in 2019, Queretaro, Mexico and Malaga, Spain. And we announced a 50-50 joint venture with Macerich to create Los Angeles Premium Outlets. This will be an exciting project on fantastic real estate and obviously one of the country's most attractive markets.","Now at the end of the third quarter, redevelopment and expansion projects were ongoing across all of our platforms in the U.S. internationally, and internationally, we started construction on significant expansions of Paju Premium Outlets in Seoul and Tosu Premium Outlets in Japan.","Last week, we held the ground-breaking of our landmark mixed-use transformation at Phipps Plaza that will include Atlanta's first Nobu Hotel and Restaurant, a Class A office building, a Life Time athletic resort, food hall and outdoor community gathering space, all in the area of one department store that we reclaimed.","We also announced our transformational vision for Northgate in Seattle. We're thrilled to collaborate with NHL Seattle, make their training center and corporate headquarters, an enterable element of the re-imagined at Northgate Community. This project is a prime example of our unique ability to repurpose our well-located real estate, create compelling ways for consumers to live, work, play, stay, shop and now skate at our destination.","Now, Sears, over the last several years, as you know, including what we just recently did at Phipps, we have reclaimed a number of our unproductive department stores in our portfolio. The reclamation of unproductive space, specifically some department stores, is an unprecedented opportunity for us to dramatically enhance the productivity of the space, our centers overall. And we will continue to proactively recapture additional stores to further enhance our centers.","The SPG portfolio currently has 33 Sears stores that Sears has closed or announced they will be closed. Of those 33 stores, we have, through proactive action, controlled 22 of those 33, five of which are in our joint venture with Seritage. Of those 17 that we control, Sears will no longer exist in 2019. They will be demolished, replaced and redeveloped.","Now, turning back to the 33 that Sears owns and controls, five that will be closing, and Seritage controls six for the total of 33, not including the ones in our joint venture. And they are \u2013 Seritage is the process of redeveloping those and are in construction \u2013 under construction with six of those former Sears stores. The remaining, we have 29 that are currently operating, eight are owned by us and leased to Sears, four owned by Seritage and leased to Sears, and 17 are owned by Sears.","Turning to capital markets, during the first nine months, we closed on 13 mortgages, totaling approximately $3 billion, of which our share is approximately $1.3 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.83%, term of 8.4. We have the highest investment-grade credit rating in the industry.","Our net to EBITDA was 5.4 times. Our interest coverage is 5 times, which is well in excess of our peers, well in excess on both fronts. Our current liquidity is $7 billion. We continue to have excess cash flow, which we can reinvest in our business.","Today, we announced our dividend of $2 per share for the fourth quarter, a year-over-year increase of 8.1%. And we're approaching the $100 per share dividend since we've been public, which we will celebrate in December. So $100 per share have been paid to the shareholders roughly in dividends through our public company existence. Our total dividend payment will be $7.90 in 2018, which is an increase of 10.5% compared to last year.","Now turning to guidance, we once again raised our full year guidance to $12.09 to $12.13. Just to keep in mind, this is an updated range compared to our \u2013 updated range includes \u2013 compared to our original guidance of $11.90 to $12.02. And this new range is a growth of approximately 7.9% to 8.2% compared to our reported FFO of last year.","So, we're ready for questions. But before I turn it over, we had a very strong quarter and we continue to grow our cash flow.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning, David.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","I just wonder, if you or Rick, could you just talk maybe a little bit about the leasing environment? And as you sit here today, looking forward, maybe just reflect on the last year and how you felt maybe a year ago and just sort of give us a flavor for the leasing environment?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, we tend to take a longer term view, so we can talk about quarter-to-quarter or even year-to-year, but as you know, we take a longer term view. And I would say, certainly, our long-term view has not changed. The activity has increased from 2017 to 2018. I think there's clearly \u2013 for the retailers that are investing in their product, there's increased sales. As you know, we showed you that.","And I'd say it's certainly generally better than last year, but again, you've got to take a longer term view. We have more activity going on. There's more new concepts on the restaurant, entertainment, overall retail. You've got the folks that start out on the Internet that want to own physical stores. So, I'd say, generally, the environment is better. But, as you know, we never really were overly concerned about maybe a less robust leasing environment in 2017 because we tend to take longer term views of this. Happy for Rick to add anything he would like to this.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","The only thing that I would add is that there is, I sense, an acceleration. Last year at this time, I think people were talking, but there was less aggressive approach to opening new stores. I think as David said, the people that are well positioned are now more encouraged to open stores. Obviously, sales are better, the profitability is better. And we are very well positioned. We don't talk about it a lot, but every day, every one of our properties is getting better because of the capital we're spending.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Okay, David, just secondly, I just noticed on the leasing spreads information you provide on page 22 of the supplemental, there was a pretty big jump in the square footage of openings and a pretty sharp decline in the average rent per foot. I realize these are trailing 12-month figures, but it almost appears like maybe a different set of assets is being compared now. Do you have any comments on that?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure. We're \u2013 again, I \u2013 what's the most important thing that I focus on...","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","(00:13:38)","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","... just so we're clear. You got it. And the operating metrics, it's funny. Just to take a step back. So when sales were \u2013 it's always like, okay, what's the operating metrics du jour. Okay. And the reality is our business is changing in that we're going to be recapturing these boxes that pay very low rent and we're carving them up. And we're now showing to you that love metrics, okay, the importance of the embedded growth in our business by recapturing these leases that pay very low rent. So we put all of our openings and all of our closings in that number so that you can see the embedded market rent growth that we have in our business.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks. And then lastly, just in the other income, I know there were different components, and last year, you had some securities gains. And this year, you didn't. But is there is any \u2013 there was a big jump in the other income. And I just know there's a lot of different things that run through that, but are there any comments or things you can share.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. So last year, as you know, we sold the Seritage stock at $48.49 (00:14:59), which I think if I look today, it was a pretty good trade to sell it at that rate. In other income, we did get our business interruption, not all of it, but some of it from Puerto Rico. And that's what's in other income. It doesn't flow through the operating numbers. That was \u2013 we always had planned to get that and it's always been in our numbers, but you can't book that until you actually get the cash from that according to GAAP. And then, we got some of that BI in the third quarter.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Okay. Is there a number you could share with us that's kind of embedded in that other income or -","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, it's the big jump in that \u2013 the vast majority of it, yeah.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Okay, it's a vast majority of the $20 million increase.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Okay","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah, that's correct. And it really is \u2013 now, so you know, we always planned on getting to BI. You just can't show it in your normal minimum rent or CAM recoveries or any of that information. It's got to be in other income.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore ISI","Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah, no worries. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is now open.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. It's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. David, can you just elaborate a little bit on Sears. You were named to the creditors' committee yesterday, so maybe talk a little bit about the role that you plan to play there. And you went through a lot of different numbers in terms of the Sears boxes. If you just look sequentially, you went from 59 effectively down to 46, which includes the 17, which are closing. So, there's 13 stores during the quarter that fell out. I wasn't sure whether those were recaptured during the quarter and form part of some redevelopment plan. But just looking sequentially, sub-to-sub, 59 to 46, inclusive of the 17 that are closing. Just to trying to get some color there.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. Look, I think the thing to focus on, we're putting Sears in our rearview mirror. Okay? So what we're trying to explain \u2013 and there are a lot of moving boxes and obviously, the whole situation is a tragic, frankly. Put aside, how it affects us, we think this is a unique opportunity. We're going to redevelop this. We're going to generate positive momentum with the properties due to this. We're going to reinvest in the communities. We're going to be able to drive traffic now from this box. Put all of that aside, we're going to be able to make money on this. Put that all aside, if I may, and just it's a tragic set of events that a company that's been around for so long is in this state of affairs. So that to us is \u2013 that's what I think about. It wasn't that long ago, 10, 12 years ago, that 300,000 people worked at Sears. Okay?","So I mean, I think we should put that in perspective. But let's focus on what we \u2013 the task at hand. And what I'm trying to do \u2013 and there are a lot of moving parts, but basically \u2013 and what I explained \u2013 I'm sure I garbled some because you know I have a hard time spitting out words. But the reality is, we have 33 stores that are closed or in the process of closed at the end of this year. We control 22 of those and 5 of those are in our joint venture with Seritage. Of the 17 that we have unmitigated control, Sears will no longer exist in 2019. They will either be torn down, redeveloped, re-leased, but they'll be in our rearview mirror. So we are effectively down to 29 operating stores. We own 8, Seritage owns 4, and then the 17 are owned by Sears. And we'll have to wait and see what happens on the \u2013 in terms of whether they'll continue to operate those or not. Obviously, we're planning for the ultimate unfortunate demise of Sears and we're ready for it. And we have the balance sheet and the capital with intellectual and human resources to deal with these set of events.","So, that's what I would focus on. The other thing to keep in mind is that there's also Seritage that owns some in that. And they've done a reasonable job of re-leasing some of their space. So those are the numbers that I would focus on. And it's still moving around because they \u2013 some are closed, some aren't, but those are the numbers. And at the end of the day, next year, we'll report 29 Sears stores. That's it.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Right. It sounds like there was at least 11 that are controlled by others, other than you and Seritage, that closed during the quarter, (00:20:32) in that 33 to 22, right?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","That's correct. Sears owns the balance of those. That's correct. That's correct.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","But the creditors' committee and sort of your role there and Rick mentioned not a big competitor. (00:20:45)","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","There is no comment that I can have on that where we \u2013 for better or worse, we tend to be on creditors' committees with large unfortunate bankruptcies of retailers. So, we have a certain expertise in that. We'll see how it all plays out. But beyond that I can't \u2013 I really can't comment.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Can you talk a little bit about international in terms of what's happening there? Obviously, Kl\u00e9pierre, its shares have come down meaningfully alongside a lot of other real estate stocks in Europe. There's obviously been consolidation activity going on there, in part, Kl\u00e9pierre tried to make the bid for Hammerson when Hammerson went after Intu. And now, Intu has its own consortia bid from their main shareholder alongside capital sources. How are you thinking about Europe overall both of your investment in Kl\u00e9pierre but then also consolidation opportunities in that region, whether that would be Simon-led or Kl\u00e9pierre-led?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well that was \u2013 I would classify that as add on sentence, but let's put that aside. I am very comfortable with our investment in Kl\u00e9pierre. They have \u2013 I mean, I have to look at the long-term prospects of that company, measured against kind of the short-term volatility. And from a long-term perspective, I don't really see any real change. There's very little new development. They have a lot of redevelopment activity. There are good operators getting better. So our investment is solid, and stocks go up, stocks go down. We take a long-term view.","We have exposure in Europe not only through Kl\u00e9pierre but obviously through McArthurGlen and through our interest in value retail. I would tell you that the market generally ignores and underestimate the value that we have outside of the U.S., whether that's Mexico, Europe, Asia. There is no appreciation of the value that we've created in that. That's fine. We continue to do what we do.","I don't really \u2013 I think we mentioned briefly what Kl\u00e9pierre did on Hammerson, that's in their rearview mirror. I think that's better coming from them. I think the CEO's made that clear to investors. Not much I can add to that. And there's nothing I can add to what's going on with Intu. I mean we don't \u2013 as they say, we don't have a dog in that hunt, so here in Indiana that is.","So, I continue to think Europe is fine. It's certainly \u2013 I think the trend there is similar to ours and that the better assets will get better, and the ones that are smaller unless they're uniquely positioned will be put under pressure, but even the better ones will grow, will offset whatever diminution might have happened on the little ones.","So I generally feel pretty good. I mean there are parts in Europe that you might want to avoid i.e. Turkey and other places like that, given that currency in the lira and what happens on that front, but generally, I think it's okay. Look, I'm sure the Kl\u00e9pierre team has a focus on Italy, what's going on there, you have Brexit. So you could certainly take a contrarian view at the right time. We did that in 2012 when we invested in Kl\u00e9pierre. Could we be coming into another contrarian point of view, perhaps, but we're really not overly active other than making sure our investments grow in value.","Michael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. Good morning.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Just going back to the Sears boxes in terms of the 17 that you expected to close by year end, the 22, including the Seritage JV. I know it's a little early here still, but can you just sort of frame it out from a timing and capital allocation perspective in terms of how much of this you really think will fall into redevelopment, potentially kickoff some larger redevelopments? And what sort of rough capital investment this could possibly represent?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, remember, part of \u2013 the vast majority of the 17 of the 22, we actually transacted to get back \u2013 when was that?","Thomas Ward - Simon Property Group, Inc.","November.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","November. Okay. So remember that just to put that in perspective. So those plans are already moving. I mean, not \u2013 just to name a few Northshore, Cape Cod...","Thomas Ward - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Brea,","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Brea, Stoneridge...","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Broadway.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","...Broadway, Midland, just to name a few, so all of those are coming online. And that's why I made the comment that the 17 that we control, Sears is going to be gone. There won't be \u2013 you won't \u2013 there will not be a Sears. It will be either gone, under construction or will take the box and there'll be a new retailer hopefully open by then, but obviously it does take time. So the 22 of the 33 are basically all under redevelopment. The capital of that is over $1 billion. That's always been in our plan. And there is no surprise there. And so that's \u2013 that we are moving at a high level to redevelop those boxes as quickly and as smartly as we can. Then, there's 11 that Sears and Seritage own, that we're not involved in. I think Seritage of those six \u2013 and again, there's a lot of numbers here, that's why I'm repeating myself and I appreciate the question, of those six, Seritage has already redeveloped over half of those. So those are moving \u2013 they're doing those independently in conjunction with us, but independently. And that's fine. And then, there's five that Sears owns and then, we'll see what happens with that real estate. And I think it's a blanket statement that we would love to own at the right price any of the real estate that we don't control. And so we \u2013 patience, seeing how this plays out is important.","So I hope that answers it, but it will be well over $1 billion. You'll start to see in the 8-K this stuff as we approve it. I don't know. I'm asking Tom. I don't know. We just approved Cape Cod, Northshore...","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","There are some in there.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","There are some in there. So you're going to see it. We have a busy capital appropriations committee. We approved three or four, Monday, you'll see those in the fourth quarter numbers. So it's all moving, it's all moving quickly. And I would tell you, generally, other than, obviously, to see a retailer like Sears end up where it is, I mean this will be fine for us. We'll add value to the real estate. We wish it would have been done in a different manner, but we have to confront what we have to confront. And I think we'll make this \u2013 it'll be an opportunity for us just like everything else we've dealt with over the last 25 years as a public company.","Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","No, I appreciate that color call. And as we see that start to come on to the development pipeline, I mean, is it fair to assume the same kind of yield you've been achieving at 7% to 8% on redevelopments or would it be higher than that?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. No, look, as you know, every deal is different, but that would be our goal. That would be our goal for sure.","Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great, and second one for me. Just going back to the leasing commentary about the environment being a little better here today. Are you starting to see this translate into year leases as well in terms of timing to get deals done, terms, leasing capital, or is it more just on the activity front at this point? And then, in terms of rents, we've talked about this before, but you're not necessarily getting the benefit of sales in an area move online, but you do feel the returns at the store level. So to that end, are you starting to push occupancy costs to account for that leakage or you're looking at other metrics to understand tenant profitability and therefore what a tenant can pay and are tenants accepting that this old model maybe needs to change or is it just more of an educational process on both sides still at this point?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","This is Rick. Obviously, you've covered a lot of ground. Let me take it apart. One, our terms, our TA are certainly within the norms that we've established over the years.","Our tempo of leasing is accelerating in that we now have more tenants coming in saying, all right, let me look at 5, 10, 15 openings for 2019. That is an acceleration from what we had this time last year. That's encouraging.","Our occupancy costs today are the lowest they have been in the last two and a half years. So that's encouraging. And that's taking into account the fact that there is an understatement of sales productivity. All of our leasing agents are totally aware of not that potential but that fact. And as we are pricing our real estate, we are prosecuting that to the extent we can to drive rents. And you've seen our average base rent go up and our spreads are going up.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I would just add though. I mean, retailers are smart and savvy. They are doing what they need to do on their cost structure. And so it's not easy. But like I said, we have a unique position in this industry. We have really quality properties, a lot of scale. We have the ability to think. We have the ability to be patient. We have the ability to say no. We take gambles, we win, we lose, we draw. So we do okay, but it continues to be \u2013 it's not \u2013 there're still very thoughtful negotiations. Everybody is focused on increasing their profitability. They're no different with us. And we try as hard as we can to create a decent win-win scenario. And then, when we do that, the math spits out. But it's better than it was last year. In the long run, we have no worries about where we're going to be. And I think as we continue to redevelop, we're going to make these properties fantastic. But in the meantime, we're going to be in this spot where it's going to be a thoughtful, diligent, but appropriately focused negotiation between us and our best clients.","Jeremy Metz - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks for the time.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Hi, Craig.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. I noticed on your redevelopment activity, the yields for the Premium Outlet redevs went from 10% to 11% and The Mills went from 11% to 13%. I just wondered what was pushing those returns. And is it perhaps that the leasing is going better at these redevelopment efforts?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I wouldn't \u2013 those are hard to like extrapolate trends. I think it's just a function of mix. Nothing that really jumps out. But I'm sure we'll look at it and Tom could answer, but I just think it's probably just mix off the top of my head, nothing major. We do have the ability, I think, to continue to add value through our redevelopment, new development efforts. And it goes up and it will go down, but it will \u2013 that gives you the directional idea of kind of where things are.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So, I mean, it's clear that although the construction costs are going up that it really isn't impacting your returns on these. (00:36:02)","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, that's a good question and let me just say this. Everything \u2013 we are \u2013 it's a good point and let me address this, this way. I mean, we have no risk at this point and things always change, but at this point, we have absolutely no risk in what we're building today. You always have contingency in there, but nothing what I would say beyond our contingency, and obviously, our contingencies in our 8-K. We are seeing a general increase in construction costs. It's really a market by market scenario, but the potential rise of those cost are not in any way at the point where we're saying we can't make the numbers work. I don't anticipate that happening, but obviously, we're paying attention to it.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And then, we keep hearing about new technology in both retail and just the retail center. I wonder if there's anything new that might surprise consumers this holiday season, whether it's an unmanned checkouts or mobile apps, making things more personalized, or virtual or augmented reality.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I think, I think we and all sorts of retailers and technology companies are focused on a couple of things, payment, obviously, driving traffic, which could be through a lot of individual personalized promotion, the checkout process and improving that is really important, and then the ease of parking as well. So, lots of experiments, lots of things happening by us and others, by retailers and by technology companies. And I think there is clearly a bounce back on the physical world compared to the pure online Internet, just because I do think payment and ease and convenience can be enhanced by technology in the store environment.","So we're looking forward to those introductions into the physical world. I think that will make physical shopping a lot more easier and convenient. And then, obviously, there's so much benefits to physical shopping compared to looking on your phone and trying to buy stuff. And what's fascinating to us, fascinating, and we see it because, remember, we have our (00:39:22) rights, so we can see the high level of returns. The high level of returns that we see from online sales to the physical stores is that never talked about. Okay? But if you wanted to go \u2013 write a research report, Craig, that would be the big focus because everybody wants to say, here's the gross Internet sale, but they don't want to tell you the net. They want to hit the physical world. But the returns are staggering, okay, and especially in the product that I'm discussing. But no one wants to talk about that.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So I understand your frustration, but thank you for your answers.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure. Well, I'm not frustrated, by the way. Just so it's clear, I'm just saying it's very interesting that no one talks about it. It's just the fact.","Craig Richard Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. Thanks.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey, good morning. Good morning out there, David. So two questions from us. First, you mentioned the international and you think that it's underappreciated, but just curious, I mean, obviously, in the U.S., you guys have a very efficient platform, but globally, you're definitely spread out. So just sort of curious, how you would compare your overseas platforms' efficiency to the U.S. And then, as you expand into like Thailand or the Middle East, how those markets are initially versus once you get a concentration of assets? Do you really see a material improvement in operations or the Premium Outlets work very well as a standalone or in clusters?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I'd say both. I mean the reality is our joint ventures with the Premium Outlet business has its own group of personnel. So they can add \u2013 as they add product to their platform, I mean they get scale. It's safe to say no one \u2013 none of our investments overseas has anywhere near the scale and the overhead metrics that we have. I mean our overhead metrics are underappreciated. I mean, Tom, can give you the numbers, but many of our peers are at 10% of NOI and we're at 3%, what, give me the numbers?","Thomas Ward - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We're at 3%.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We're at 3% and they're 8%, 9%, 10%. So all of our places don't have quite that scale. I could certainly \u2013 if I wanted to or could, I could certainly probably find a way to scale, but they're doing. And so it is what it is.","So they all benefit from adding good product to their platforms. I would say none of them have the scale that we do and we don't impose our scale to them at all. And I don't think that we will, but you can't rule it out. And if we did, I am sure we could do it \u2013 we could have better results, but at the moment, everything is good, so we let it go.","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And then, the second question is, you guys \u2013 in the last call, you talked about converting retail to other uses and obviously, you had the deal out in Northgate where it looks to be sort of cutting the mall in half. As you guys increasingly go through, is there like basically a \u2013 not exact percentage but a view of how much existing retail you could do without to replace with things like apartments or hotels or office versus how much you would increase the overall square footage of your properties to add incremental uses? So trying to get a sense of how much of your existing retail would you scale back to increase uses versus how much of the new mix uses would be incremental to the existing retail that's already there.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, it's hard to give you a number, but let me look at it this way. Okay? So, I think the greatest opportunity that we have, I think we're in good shape with small shop. There's always going to be a mall here or there that has too much small shops but I think we're in decent shape there. And so what we have the opportunity to do, and we are doing, is we probably \u2013 the mall of the future doesn't need five, six, three, it depends on the mall, but doesn't need the department stores. And then, the ability to reclaim that allows us to densify the properties, and I think we have that opportunity in a rather large scale.","So, again, this is where we suffer maybe from the scope of what we do and all the activity that we have, but take Phipps as an example. So this is \u2013 was that put in the 8-K or not?","Thomas Ward - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yes.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Okay. So it's in the 8-K now. All right. So, take Phipps, we had one department store, Belk, that was 140,000...?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","160,000.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","160,000. Thank you, Rick. We are adding essentially 300 plus \u2013 well, we have the hotel \u2013 the office is 324,000, right?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","(00:45:35)","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","And the hotel is -","Thomas Ward - Simon Property Group, Inc.","(00:45:39)","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","How big is that? Whatever, okay, so let's say, we're adding 500,000 square feet in something that was doing 160,000 \u2013 that was taking up 160,000 square feet. And I encourage you to look at the renderings. Do we have the renderings on our website?","Thomas Ward - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We can get them out.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Okay. We should, let's get them. Do you have the video with me, and Mr. De Niro and the Chef Nobu on our website, and Rick?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","That's right.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Because (00:46:09) it's out there. Okay. So we won't, but we will do that. And Northgate, you say the mall cutting to half. I've got to tell you, Northgate is so much bigger than that. And again, we have up to 800-plus apartments.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","1,200 apartments.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","1,200.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Frankly, we're going to have 1,200 apartments, 600,000 feet of retail. We're going to have probably 600,000 feet of office and the NHL Seattle training facility.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. So I mean, the scope of some of these things are really large, but if you're looking for \u2013 here's the number. I can't give it to you, other than as these \u2013 we do feel like there's a lot of fun stuff to do. It's aggravating in the sense that it's \u2013 you have to herd all (00:47:05) that catch in terms of accomplishment. But once we built something \u2013 I mean, like, once we \u2013 now that Phipps will be open hopefully in, and I'm pushing for two years, but maybe two and a half years, I think we're going to be really proud of that and our shareholders will be happy, and Rick and I will have great sushi. So, what else could you want?","Alexander Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Sounds pretty good. Okay. That perspective is helpful. Thank you, David.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. So, your dividend is going to be up 10.5% this year, which is great. I guess I was just wondering, considering your growing cash flow, how are you thinking about prioritizing on development and redevelopment where you're obviously very active versus increasing the dividend and potential acquisition opportunities right now?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, I'd say to you that I would expect \u2013 obviously, board decision, blah, blah, blah, but we would expect to continue to increase our dividend next year. Clearly, we will be \u2013 our redevelopment is really active and that could be increased. Now, again, the reality is, Caitlin, that it takes time. So take Brea, which we control that Sears store. It's going to be unbelievable, but we have another six months of permitting. So, we're able to \u2013 I'd love to, like, just stuff it all into \u2013 stuff it all into the box and do it all at once, but the reality is we can't because we have external constraints. I wouldn't say necessarily capital constraints at all, but \u2013 so I'm looking at Brian and he's saying, we don't have any, but maybe I tend to be a little conservative on that front. But anyway, we just have constraints on doing the redevelopment only because we've got the permitting and so on and so forth. So that continues to be a big priority.","Obviously, new development is not \u2013 in the U.S. is not wildly active. Though, I will tell you that the deal with Macerich I think is going to be a really good project, but that's a three year project essentially. Okay? So that takes time, and that we are really \u2013 we think that's going to be really a good deal. We've got another one in the works in another area of the country and probably two more outlets that we're going to build, but again, those are over \u2013 one could be a little quicker, but two years or so. So that continues to be a focus.","Internationally, it's basically we take our cash flow there and reinvest it. So it's not what I'd call Simon capital. We're actually not writing. Yeah, we may not get repatriation back to us, but we're basically doing what many thoughtful companies do is they take profits and they reinvest it and have more profits and keep doing it until they can't do it anymore. So we don't see that.","And so then the next thing is, look, we're going to \u2013 we still have \u2013 if the market doesn't like our business or doesn't like what we're doing, we still have a focus on buying stock back. And then, we're not all that active in the acquisition area. We could do a deal here or there. We certainly are interested in reclaiming at the right price certain department stores. And that's kind of how we're thinking about the world right now. I hope that's helpful.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","It is. And just in terms of the time it takes, is there any \u2013 I think there's some concern out there with the amount of department store reclaims that you have and everyone else does, that finding new uses is taking longer. Is that part of it or is it not?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Not with us. No, no, no, no. Sorry. No way. That's not our issue. Our issue is execution, permitting. It has nothing to do with demand, supply and demand, and has nothing to do with capital. That's not us. Sorry.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great to hear. And then maybe just last quickly. Looks like you guys have $600 million of 2.2% debt maturing in early 2019.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, just wondering the plans to address that. And if it were a 10-year unsecured deal, what you think the rate could be?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, we'll either use our cash or \u2013 certainly our \u2013 we have $7 billion available. So, that's just basically standard operating procedure. No big deal there. We could go to the unsecured market. Obviously, there's a lot of rate volatility today. We wouldn't probably do it today, but we'll have to wait and see kind of where the world shakes up. Brian, I don't know if you want to add anything.","Brian J. McDade - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. Look, I think our cost of money today on a 10-year basis would be about $4.8 billion (00:52:47). But we have \u2013 as David said, we've got over $7 billion of liquidity, so we have plenty of options to address the upcoming maturity. It is not only maturity we have in 2019.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. And I would say to you, what's fascinating, we have very, very little debt coming due in 2019 or 2020, yeah, both on the unsecured and secured basis. So, we're in a very good spot to do that. And I would also \u2013 again, it's overlooked, but if you look at our peers, internationally north of the border, domestic, Far East, nobody has our balance sheet. Nobody is 5 times debt to EBITDA, nobody. People are 2x of us. Not 7, but 10 plus. Please appreciate that.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","(00:54:03) commentary.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Okay. So, you broke up there, but anyway. So we're in good shape there and we'll see what happens on that front.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. David, I can't wait for you to co-star in De Niro's next film. I guess a question for both of you, Rick and David. And I'm just curious in situations where you guys have redeveloped anchor boxes, do you have any statistics you can share on the change in foot traffic sales or asking rents of the property since the new anchor opened?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","God, we'd have to \u2013 I'm sure we could put some together. Here's what's interesting, that we're seeing \u2013 and again, I wouldn't like \u2013 this is anecdotal. So don't (00:55:03) and I don't know if this means anything and so it's too early. But we've had department store closings in the portfolio. There's no hiding that, right. And we have seen \u2013 and again, nothing drives our business \u2013 this does not drive our business one way or another because the size of the portfolio. But what we've seen, which is actually encouraging, is that the in-line sales are actually getting the benefit of the department store closures. And we're also seeing some of the other department stores pick that business up.","So at the end of the day, like I said, maybe our industry got just too carried away with having all these big department store boxes. As we transition to the smaller, more appropriately sized group, and there'll be centers that lose in that and like we may have one or two that were nervous about, the reality is the rest of that center, and we will get a better and bigger benefit, I think we'll get healthier, and we're starting to see that. But again, I'd say that's anecdotal and nothing to quantify. But we are seeing that in some of these cases, which I think is encouraging. And that's what we want. We don't need all of those. We don't really get much of an economic benefit from those boxes. We've taken over driving the traffic to the center from those boxes as that would have been in the historical reason to have them.","So this could be healthy, other than Rick and I pull our hair out, we want every box leased, we want everything redeveloped, the teams moving really hard and everybody is like, we're playing very hard here to make this stuff happen quick. I mean that's the downside is that we \u2013 not that we ever have, but we are not coasting, okay? We're not coasting. So not that you should tell sorry for us, but I'm not asking you to, but that's the reality. We're humping and pumping. And I think this will be \u2013 I really think other than, yeah, there will be a couple of losses on the scoreboard for us. But at the end of the day, this will be a good thing for us and likely our entire industry.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","The one unambiguous result of replacing these anchors is there's no doubt that our total sales and total footfall at our properties is increasing. Just think about David's example at Phipps. When we're done, we're probably going to have tripled the retail sales, plus have all the hotel traffic, plus the office traffic. So in every instance what we're adding is going to be more productive and more dynamic than what we're replacing.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. And I guess, on Sears, I'm curious, were they current on the rents before they filed because typically retailers build up a pre-petition receivable before they file. But it's sounding like some other landlords that they were largely current, which frankly makes it seem like the bankruptcy started out as a (00:59:03) bluff that if they got called out on.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. We're not going to have a bad debt reserve. I think that's correct.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just one last one on Sears. You mentioned about $1 billion of investment for the 22 boxes you're redeveloping. Should people think of that as, I think, a rule of thumb is $40 million to $50 million a box or does that include investment beyond the Sears? I think people are looking for a number there. And I am curious how your return on investment you see in that $1 billion compares to what it's been on prior anchor redevelopments.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I think what I would \u2013 the best way to do this is really say to you, Jeff, that we're going to have $1 billion-plus of spend. We've been at this \u2013 Tom, $1 billion for how many years? Six, okay. Six years a $1 billion spend. So I think, Jeff, if you look at what we've been doing, we've been spending $1 billion. And if you look at 2015, 2016, some of that may have been tilted toward new development more than redevelopment. It's now going to tilt more toward redevelopment, but it \u2013 and I think it'll go up, but that $1 billion of spend is not just those 22 boxes. That's a lot of stuff in there. Okay?","So, like, Phipps is a $300-plus-million spend. It'll be over two years, two and a half probably, but two years. And that's not Sears. That was an old (01:00:40) store. Northgate, I mean, the Northgate numbers could be much bigger than that, but again, that'll be over three years. And again, that's not a Sears' box. So when I say that $1 billion plus spend, it's like \u2013 it's the vision of what we see on redeveloping our business and it will tilt more toward that. On the other hand, when you add Carson with Macerich and you add a couple more, I mean, I think our spend on average has averaged about $1 billion. It could go up as we add these things. It's not going to go to $2 billion a year, but it could go to $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion. We're doing our plan for 2019. Tom told me not to invite anybody to our planning process. Correct?","Thomas Ward - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Correct.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","So I'm officially not inviting anybody. But right now, we're looking at a little over $1.3 billion. So I think it's just more than just Sears. Okay?","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Yeah. It looks like sales growth at The Mills has been similar to the rest of the portfolio. So I'm curious what's enabling you to drive the spreads that are significantly higher there?","Brian J. McDade - Simon Property Group, Inc.","The Mills, they're very well positioned in virtually every market where they operate. They are a unique mix of full price, value, outlet, entertainment, food, they're all 1.5 million to 2 million square feet. And they just are able to attract a very broad segment of shoppers and they're performing well. There's no real magic, but we have a very broad use of potential users there. And we've been able to keep those things very well leased and they're very productive.","Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is the occupancy cost notably different than the other part of the portfolio?","Brian J. McDade - Simon Property Group, Inc.","No.","Michael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. That was it. Thanks.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, David. I want to go back to a comment you made. I think at the outset, talking about how maybe your international portfolio has been, not to put in your mouth, undervalued or under appreciated. When I look at your development pipeline, it looks like there is a tremendous amount of focus on international. So how are you thinking about that? I think it's just a little bit above 10% right now as a percentage of NOI. As you think forward over the next five years, do you have a bright line test as to where you want to get it or is it just you're going to do good deals when you can find them?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I think, Rich, we don't have a (01:03:50) where we need to be a 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 20%, that's not how we look at it. So the reality is \u2013 and most of that, as you know, is through development that we've made some strategic investments i.e. Kl\u00e9pierre and McArthurGlen that come to mind. And I would \u2013 and remember, we own a decent chunk of value retail. We don't really book any of their earnings. And we've had this discussion, we only book when we get cash, which is cash distributions, which is basically cost accounting for those of you who remember cost accounting, which I do.","But long story short, we don't really have a \u2013 I don't have any desire to do more. I don't have any desire to do less. I only have desire to make money. So we do think we add value, we do think maybe some of our international partners don't think so, but I think we do. So I think it's more deal-driven, but it's an important part of our business and we will continue to invest in our platforms whether it's Japan, Korea. We announced a devolvement in Thailand, which I think will be fantastic. That opens up that whole country. The tourism there is remarkable. I just happen to do a retail tour in Europe and the interest in that is, the Far East \u2013 our Premium Outlet business in the Far East is very \u2013 it has a high level of interest from our retailers. So I just think it's going to be how do we continue to drive and make money from our investments there. No desire one way or another.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. So just one quick follow-up question then, and maybe this is just that in light of (01:06:22) of some global consolidation that we've seen. Do you think landlords have to have global footprint to make money?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I think it can help, but I don't think it's the \u2013 and I've evolved on this. I don't think you need it. I think it can help. I wouldn't do a deal because that was a really important component of that transaction i.e., exporting retailers from one level to another. However, it's not inconsequential. So take an example, I've met and I won't name a name, but I was just in Spain with a large retailer. And the fact that we have a terrific relationship with them in the U.S. and Kl\u00e9pierre has a terrific relationship in Europe, doesn't hurt. But if I had overpaid for the Kl\u00e9pierre stake, that relationship wouldn't make it up. Okay? But I think it is helpful, but it's not a reason to do a deal.","Richard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you for that color. I appreciate it.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Hi. So, my question is more numbers focused. I'm just trying to understand the nature of the guidance change. And then, just kind of given the $0.05 beat in 3Q, how comes, it's only the low end of guidance that was raised rather than the high end as well?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, look, \u2013 I don't know. There's lots of numbers. We're a big company. One deal, one of that is not going to change this that and the other. But obviously, the currency in Europe is a little bit softer than it was. We tend to be conservative. There's nothing to really study or read into that. It was just a number. Okay?","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Fair enough, David. All right. And then -","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","(01:08:54) As I said, it's just the number. Okay?","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","All right. Fair enough. And then, any update in regard to just lease accounting targets we should be expecting for 2019? I know earlier on in the year, you've kind of given us some guidance to that.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yes. That's the same general number. No change in that. We're not going to \u2013 we'll make that clear when we give our guidance in February. We'll absolutely make it clear. The number that we've told the market more or less is the same number. There's not going to be much change there. And we'll debate whether we should \u2013 we might go a year just saying here's what it would have been before and after just so people do it, but we might not, but you'll see the number. And it's not \u2013 and that's really the only thing that's going to \u2013 with these other new pronouncements, that's the only thing that's really going to be different. And again, it's not a huge number.","Yes, basically, 1%. And it's pretty much over that \u2013 so it's 25 basis points per quarter and you can do the math to get to the number.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Great. And then last one for me. Although it's a couple of years out, any other information you can just share about the JV with Macerich?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","No. It's a development JV. I think a lot of people from discussions with Macerich are probably familiar with the site. And we take the site over in about a year and then we build. So we're happy to be part of it and we think it'll be a very good LA Premium Outlet Center. So, we don't get the site back until Carson does what they need to do, and the timing on that is roughly a year from now.","Omotayo Tejumade Okusanya - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Haendel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Hey. Good morning out there. Dave, I guess a question for you on the lease termination environment. Are you guys still \u2013 are you receiving early termination buyout offers from retailers? And what's your appetite or sentiments regarding these early buyout offers?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","We have some. It was lower this quarter \u2013 much lower this quarter than a year ago quarter, right. Actually, you can see it in our 8-K. I don't remember the number off the top, like...","Brian J. McDade - Simon Property Group, Inc.","It was $9.8 million for the quarter versus $13.2 million.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, it's down. I'm not a big fan of them, frankly, but we'll do them. I would say we'll do them occasionally. It's certainly \u2013 as you know, it's not in our comp NOI because there is a lot of volatility associated with it. I would say, generally, the buyouts requests are down pretty reasonably, Rick, do you agree?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I agree. There has been less activity this period than we had last year.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, it's down. Occasionally, we get it. I'm not a big fan of it. Look, we'll do it for \u2013 we'll do it for strategic reasons. One is, maybe we're helping the retailer, two is we want the space back, but it's not what we \u2013 I would prefer not to like do a lot of it, but we will do it strategically. And it's basically a function of whether the offer is fair or whether it helps the retailer and what are our prospects for renewing the space quickly. And so all that goes into the blender and then we make a decision one way or another. But we don't run around trying to look for it. It basically comes to us.","Haendel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Got it. Got it. All right. That's helpful. Thanks. I missed it earlier. I think you mentioned that you did receive business interruption income in the third quarter and you put it in the other income, but I didn't catch-up figure. Did you provide one?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","No, no, we didn't, but it's the vast majority of the other income number.","Haendel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Got it. Okay. And capital allocation, I guess a follow up to an earlier question. You guys did not buy back any stock after being active. It looks like second quarter stock is pretty much at the same level. Anything precluding you there from buying back stock or just maybe storing up dry powder for incremental read there. (01:14:17) Just curious on your thoughts on capital allocation regarding stock buybacks.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. I just think we're conservative. I would tell you that I want to hug Brian and Andy every day. Maybe I should get a little credit too. I just love our balance sheet where it is. I just love it, love it, love it. I just think it's so cool to have a balance sheet like that. So, we're going to be really conservative, thoughtful. And then, as you mentioned, I mean, obviously, we've got a very active redevelopment pipeline, but I just love, love, love our balance sheet. And I just think that's something that it's got to be unique, it's got to be unique set of circumstances to really do anything material to it.","Haendel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Okay. Last one, I guess, same-store expense growth in the third quarter, can you provide what that was?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I don't know. I mean I have no idea, but Tom will follow you offline (01:15:34). We don't really do that. It's just our NOI or comp NOI.

No worries.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Just to clarify something you guys mentioned earlier. The definition for leasing spreads and the volume, I think the pool (01:16:05) changed and now you're including anchor boxes. If that's correct, do you have any of those stats under the previous language available just for the sake of comparability?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, it's not just anchors, it's everything. It's whatever boxes come in and come out, (01:16:26) whatever theaters we renew, whatever amendments we take. And we just \u2013 we sat back and said, look, this is our business and it's important to focus on that because I think the market wants to know, great, you're getting these boxes back, but is there value in that real estate? Why are you paying for it, if there is not value on the re-leasing of that? And that's what we're trying to express.","So we had \u2013 I will say this, if you look at the earlier definition, we had positive spreads that we think the market would be fine with. But I think the more important thing is to focus on what the future of our opportunity set is. And that's what we're trying to do.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","All right. And if I think about Simon and the size and the scale you guys have well above your peers, it's still interesting that on simon.com, you can't buy anything. Have you guys thought about that? Are there any initiatives underway? I could imagine, having something like that could probably help a lot of your data collection initiatives.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Have you been studying what we're up to? A very good question and an appropriate question. And the best answer, I have a really thoughtful answer and that is to stay tuned.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Sounds good. All right. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Derek Johnston - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Derek Johnston - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","How is the mixed-use redevelopment at Phipps Plaza reshaping your vision of the portfolios' potentiality? And in your thinking, how many additional large-scale repositionings exist within the Malls' portfolio? And what's your appetite for accelerating these investments?","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","It's interesting. We've been active now for over an hour and the word's KOP (01:18:38) and King of Prussia haven't come up yet. Our portfolio has a number of those activities. We emphasized before when we get back one of these department store boxes, it's more than just 150,000 to 200,000 feet. It's anywhere from 10 to 18 acres adjacent to some of the best real state in the United States. We are very focused on what we can do with those 18 acres. And you are going to see an accelerating amount of activity in a number of our properties where we have back 22 boxes. David said, we'd like to get back others. We've taken back Penneys (01:19:24). We've taken back Belks. So, you're going to keep seeing that. We have the capital, we have the expertise, we have the opportunity and it's going to be accelerating throughout the portfolio. Frankly, we've been doing this for a decade. The difference is we now have access to these 10 acres to 18 acres adjacent to our properties that can accelerate all of these activities and there are more top of mind for the investment community. So, it's a great opportunity. We're well positioned to doing it and it is, in fact, happening as we sit here talking to you.","Derek Johnston - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Excellent. Thank you. And just a last one, if you could share any updates on digitally native or e-tailer initiatives? I know you have some experience there now and have been doing it for a while. Any early customer or maybe brand retailer feedback that you think is worth sharing?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","I would simply say that the store experience \u2013 the best way I can \u2013 we verbal on (01:20:38) a little bit, so let me be really concise. The best way I can say that is the store experience and the store requirement is back, and that is shouldn't be underappreciated. They all want stores. Period, end of story.","Richard S. Sokolov - Simon Property Group, Inc.","And they are opening stores. We have a very active program right now where we've got probably 25 retailers that started on the internet that have opened stores with us and are opening more, because as David said, they work and they make money.","Derek Johnston - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Excellent. Thank you.","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. In terms of the business interruption insurance and other income from Puerto Rico this quarter, do you expect anything material in 4Q as well?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Yeah. We expect to have some more because it comes in over a period of time, but again, all of that was planned in our guidance at the beginning of the year. Remember, we had Puerto Rico down. So, we've been reporting our numbers with basically on average around $35 million of EBITDA, adios, okay, between those two assets. So now, we're starting to play catch-up and happened a year ago. So that's been out of our numbers fourth quarter of last year, all the way up now and we're starting to come back a little bit as we collect the cash.","Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Would that continue into 2019 as well?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, at that point, the property will be back online, so then we'll have it. Then, we'll report it \u2013 just start normal NOI that we would get from that property.","Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then, I understand that Sears going away is a long-term positive for you and the rest of the industry. As this is playing out though, short term, medium term, do you see store closures or liquidation sales is having a dampening effect on retailers for the holiday season and then, to the extent that the liquidations continue post-holiday?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, look, let me restate what I said about Sears. I am disappointed. We didn't want Sears to basically file Chapter 11 or go out of business. But given that it's \u2013 at least the Chapter 11 process is happening and given the fact that we could buy some of the real estate back, we're going to make the best of it. And at the end of the day, that could be a positive for us and in terms of diversifying the mix of our properties and so on and all the stuff that we already talked about. There is always a little bit of disruption when you have a liquidation. Just so you know, when you liquidate a store, you've got to follow a lot of rules. We will certainly enforce our legal rights there and hopefully, it will not be disruptive to the other patrons of our shopping environments and\/or have any impact on our retailers. But there is a process there that they've got to run by and we intend to make sure they operate accordingly.","Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. And then finally, you said you just completed a tour of Europe and I'm sure you visit regularly, but are there any novel retail models or concepts you felt inspired by or (01:24:30) U.S.?","David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.","Well, listen, a lot of the \u2013 there are a lot of great retailers in Europe, Spain, obviously, Sweden, Italy, France. And so I think what you don't see a lot of is kind of the Internet folks. I mean we're seeing most of that here, but beyond that in terms of Internet \u2013 entertainment, restaurants and obviously fashion and apparel, they're fantastic and they're very good people. And we do a lot of good stuff with them throughout the world, Asia, Europe and the U.S. So it's important for us. And I think that one of the benefits we've gotten over the years is that we're now \u2013 they recognize who we are and what we do, which may not have been the case a decade ago.","Linda Tsai - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","David E.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions following at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","And now I\u2019ll turn the conference over to your host, Tom Ward, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please begin.","Tom Ward","Thank you, Tyrone. Good morning, and welcome to Simon Property Group\u2019s third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Presenting on today\u2019s call is David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also on the call are Rick Sokolov, President and Chief Operating Officer; Andy Juster, Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Broadwater, Chief Accounting Officer.","Before we begin, a quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors.","We refer you to today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of forward-looking statements. Please note that this call includes information that may be accurate only as of today\u2019s date.","Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the press release and the supplemental information in today\u2019s Form 8-K filing. Both the press release and the supplemental information are available on our IR website at investors.simon.com.","For our prepared remarks, I\u2019m pleased to introduce David Simon.","David Simon","Okay. Good morning. We had a very productive quarter. We started, completed opened several significant redevelopment and transformation projects that will further enhance the value of our portfolio. And we continue to achieve strong financial results.","Before I get to some of the highlights of the quarter, I would like to quickly highlight our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our performance year-to-date our current view of the quarter, we are once again increasing our full-year 2016 FFO per share guidance range to $10.85 to $10.87 which was higher than our original guidance of $10.70 to $10.80.","Our increased range also reflects the potential charge of $0.08 per share with respect to our likely decision to postpone the construction of the Copley Residential Tower, due to the rapidly rising construction cost and our beginning concerns around supply and demand in the Boston residential market.","Work will continue on redeveloping and modernizing the existing retail space at the center as well as the development of the Southwest Corridor, which will create a new entrance to Copley. We expect this work will enhance the shopping experience for our guests and retailers and further strengthen our position in the heart of Boston and will be completed by summer of \u201817.","Assuming we make the decision to postpone, it does not foreclose the opportunity to build the tower in the future as market conditions warrant.","Now let me turn to the quarter. FFO per share was $2.70, an increase of 6.3% compared to the prior year, for the first nine months our comparable FFO per diluted share is at 10.1% compared to the prior year period. We continue to see strong demand for space across our portfolio, combined occupancy for our mall and premium outlets, ended the quarter at 96.3%, an increase of 20 basis points compared to the prior year.","Leasing activity remained solid. The mall and premium outlets recorded re-leasing spreads of $6.71 per share per foot, an increase of 10.9%. Given our high occupancy level of above 96%, the remaining space we are leasing, while not as well located, continues to produce healthy re-leasing spreads.","And as a reminder, we include lease amendments for the restructuring of leases, where we choose to work with retailers in certain situations pre or post-bankruptcy such as PacSun. Base minimum rent was $50.76 up 4.5% compared to last year reflecting growth in our rents, our occupancy cost of 13% as well.","Now, just as everyone knows, my focus is on cash flow growth and I believe this is the most important metric for the investment community focused on. Our total portfolio NOI increased 7.3% year-to-date and 6.6% for the quarter, third quarter. To put our growth rate in perspective, the 7.3% year-to-date growth is more than $300 million.","Our results to date keep us on track for our full-year guidance of total NOI growth of more than 6% for our portfolio. On the NOI overview schedule included in our supplemental filed this morning, you can see the various platforms of growth that contribute to our portfolio of NOI.","The diversity of sources, fueling our NOI growth is unique to Simon. Comp NOI increased 3.5% year-to-date and 2.2% for the quarter, our comp NOI results are affected by declines in overage rent due solely to the impact of the strong dollar on our tourists spending at our centers are active in extensive redevelopment pipeline across all our property platforms as we relocate, reconfigure a significant number of tenants in order to enhance the future of retail and dining experiences at our properties and our decision to strategically moderate the marketing and specialty income in the common areas of our highly, of our very high-end portfolio.","Total retail sales per square-foot at our malls and premium outlets were $604 compared to $616 in the prior year period. Reported retailer centers continued to be impacted by the strong dollar at some of our tourist-oriented malls and premium outlets, reported retailer sales at our centers outside of our tourist oriented centers.","Our stable reported sales also include initial dilution from newly opened space and importantly we\u2019re beginning to anniversary some of this decline as you can see, recent sequential quarters Q2 to Q3 of our sales productivity is basically flat.","The end of the third quarter redevelopment and expansion projects were ongoing at 32 properties across all of our platforms. Our share approximately 1.1, we opened as you know, King of Prussia, which connected to the Plaza and the Court. We finished Fashion Center at Pentagon City. We started the expansion of Allen Premium Outlets of 120,000 square feet in North Texas. And in the next several weeks we open 60,000 square-foot expansions at the Outlets at Orange. And we also are opening our expansion in Venice Italy with our partner McArthurGlen of 67,000 square feet. So we continue to add value across the portfolio.","Now, on new developments, just so happens tomorrow, we\u2019re opening Clarksburg Premium Outlets. The center will offer great retail line-up. We expect it to cater to the whole Washington DC metro area. We currently have five, that\u2019s right, five outlets under construction, one in North Virginia, four in the international markets including France, South Korea, Malaysia and Canada, all of these will open in \u201817.","And even though we\u2019re opening a new outlet next week, the week after we\u2019re actually opening Brickell City Center in Miami, its anchored Saks. It\u2019s got a great retail line-up with great partners in Swire and the Whitman Family and it\u2019s part of a landmark mixed-use development. We look forward to managing the retail and as a reminder we\u2019re only investing in the retail. Construction continues on the full price development at Fort Worth, the Shops at Clearfork, anchored by Neiman Marcus, opening in the fall of \u201817.","And these eight new projects represent around $765 million of spend our share.","And let me turn to Aeropostale, we\u2019re pleased to have partnered with GGP, Authentic Brands Group, Hilco and Gordon Brothers to acquire Aeropostale in addition to the existing management team, the ABG Group will add significant operating experience to Aero.","We have a long track record of making smart capital allocation decisions. And after reviewing this opportunity with our partners, we believe this investment will prove to be yet another opportunity for our company. It\u2019s also important to keep this investment in perspective.","You\u2019ve all seen the gross number of $243 million. I want you to understand that $188 million of that is inventory being purchased by Hilco and Gordon Brothers and not by our buying group. Our initial investment is approximately $55 million by the group of which, our share is $33 million including working capital. And the only reason we decided to make this investment is because we believe we can make money.","If our model is right, we think we\u2019re buying this company at one to two times EBITDA with future growth opportunities ahead of it. And we continue to believe that this will be an astute investment. And for some of you who don\u2019t know ABG, it is backed by Leonard Green, which has been a significant important investor in retail throughout the years, Whole Foods, Neiman Marcus, J. Crew, just to name a handful.","Also during the quarter, we acquired our partners\u2019 interest with McArthurGlen in our two outlets in Naples and Venice. We continue to focus on our industry-leading balance sheet. We completed a number of secured financings during the quarter. We continue to lower our borrowing costs, increase our debt maturity, a term or current liquidity of $6.5 billion.","And finally, on our dividend, in 2016 we will have paid $6.50, that\u2019s an increase of 7.4% compared to 6.05% that we paid last year, that\u2019s a lot. I\u2019m ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Caitlin Burrows","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask on the leasing spread topic. I know you touched on it and it\u2019s been a popular point of conversation here. Since it\u2019s a trailing 12-month number, are the results we\u2019re seeing now in terms of lease spread just a pull forward and extension of something that happened to slow down in Q2 or did the third quarter slow too, realizing that it does include lease amendments?","David Simon","Well, we have had, look, let\u2019s just put this number in perspective number one. We do include lease amendments and that\u2019s having the biggest impact of the growth slowing. Yet if you look at our average base rent, you can see we\u2019re doing new initial terms where we\u2019re doing very well. And some of the expiring leases also are a little bit expiring at a little bit higher level.","Now, our investors know that over a long period of time, we\u2019ve always felt like the $5 to $6 spread was kind of always part of our model. The fact is we\u2019ve done a tremendous job of outperforming that. But the long-term we\u2019ve always kind of felt that $5 to $6 spread it\u2019s kind of where we think the market is.","We had a couple of years of significant outperformance. But we\u2019re not backing off our inherent value that we have in our leases as they roll-over. And we\u2019re just getting back to kind of more of a normalized environment. But for us, I don\u2019t know about our peers but for us, we include lease amendments. And the bottom line is that it\u2019s having some impact on leasing spreads.","But that $6 to $7 is maintaining itself and that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve told investors year after year after year. And we feel very good about that.","Caitlin Burrows","Okay. And then just also you mentioned that right now as you lease space, given the high occupancy, the remaining space might not be as well located. So I guess my question is since you have that high occupancy, what are kind of the thoughts behind making these, lease amendments and working with companies such as you pointed out PacSun?","David Simon","Well, it\u2019s literally a case-by-case analysis. I think we\u2019re as sophisticated as anybody. I think when Aeropostale is a great example of our ability to analyze what the right trade is in these deals. And in some cases, we\u2019re going to take the space back, in other cases we\u2019re going to help the retailer go through the hard time.","And it\u2019s really a case-by-case - it\u2019s a case-by-case analysis. But there is nobody I think in our industry that\u2019s more sophisticated in our ability to kind of maneuver through those situations. So, its case-by-case, anything can happen. Well, sometimes we work sometimes we get the space back. And certain in the Aero case, we thought the opportunity was even more exciting to just buy the retailer and make a vertical investment that the entire S&P community is doing.","Amazon makes vertical investments the cable industry makes vertical investments. And again I would encourage, we decided to make vertical investments, when we decided to franchise Starbuck locations two or three years ago, that\u2019s the nature of our company is that we\u2019re going to be nimble, we have the right judgment win to make a deal with its retailer, when not, when to make a vertical investments, when not, when to go to Europe, when not; when to pull the plug on Copley, and when not. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re in the position we\u2019re already in today.","And each and every case will be one-by-one. Now, I do appreciate and I hope I\u2019m right with you, Caitlin. I do appreciate you waiting to write until we have our call. And I do think that\u2019s important because the reason we have these calls is for not every - there is not every scenario where you can understand the nuances about what\u2019s going on in our business. So I do appreciate the patience, to hear our story. And then obviously you write whatever you want to write.","Caitlin Burrows","Great, thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. Good morning, David.","David Simon","Good morning.","Steve Sakwa","I guess is there a way for you to try and help separate out for us the impact of these amendments on the numbers? Meaning if PacSun and Aero were having as big an impact as they are, is there a way to sort of strip them out and give us a sense for kind of what the remaining lease spreads look like? Because obviously this is kind of the biggest number that people are focusing on, and if these two leases or tenants are having a disproportionate impact, it might help to separate out those figures for us.","David Simon","Well, I don\u2019t, look, our business Steve, I hear you. If we need to, we might. But the fact is you got to look at our business in totality. You can\u2019t look at it on one operating metric or not. Because what I would ask you to look at is, let\u2019s talk about the - we have grown our portfolio NOI $300 million year-to-date. Let\u2019s talk about that. Do you want to talk about that?","That to me is more material than any one operating statistic quarter-by-quarter. So, yes, we can slice and dice this any way but if we can spend more time talking about how does a company grow its portfolio NOI, there are many REITs that don\u2019t have $300 million of NOI yet we grew that in nine months.","So, I would rather talk about that that\u2019s more material than the fluctuations that have, that are occurring with operating metrics. We could talk about sales - sales are impacted by the fact that we have great properties in tourist markets and the strong dollar. That doesn\u2019t mean that that\u2019s going to last forever.","And but again, there is this high desire to make that the be-all of all these metrics. And again, our number is clean, the results we can\u2019t speak to anybody else how they do it. But I, as I said to you, if you want my opinion on what\u2019s important, it\u2019s the $300 million NOI growth. If you don\u2019t want that I got it. But that\u2019s what I focus on.","Steve Sakwa","No, I get it and I don\u2019t think people are dismissing your ability to deploy capital, whether it\u2019s through developments or expansions. But clearly there has been more pressure on the mall business, so I just think anything that you can do to assuage the fears about the internal growth prospects going forward. And perhaps it\u2019s just that a $6 to $7 spread on a roughly $60 or $61 expiring rent means that normalized leasing spreads should be 10%. And maybe that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to head to. There\u2019s a new normal in the business. That\u2019s okay; I think people are just trying to get comfort with that.","David Simon","Well, look, I think that\u2019s a good point, so let\u2019s talk about that. And I mentioned that a little bit in the first question. I think if you asked our investor group, we would have told them for 15 to 20 years that our re-leasing spreads are $5 or $6 a foot, okay. We have had a long period of outperformance on that. We\u2019ve gotten better at what we\u2019ve done all sorts of reasons that we don\u2019t have to bore you.","And you are right we may be going back to kind of what we have promised our investor base for a long period of time. And the outperformance, I don\u2019t think from our standpoint we ever guaranteed outperformance from how we looked at re-leasing spreads. We always said look, it\u2019s $5 or $6, one year it might be $8, one year it might be $4 but that\u2019s kind of what we see the long-term trend.","And I still feel comfortable but that\u2019s the basis. Now, it\u2019s no surprise that retail generally has come under pressure, lots of different reasons which we could go into but let\u2019s - unless you want to let\u2019s not. But the fact is, and we are impacted as I said to you before by our general GDP growth.","And to date, our retail generally is there is no inflation and our nominal GDP growth is 1.5%, yet we\u2019re growing our comps timing. And if nominal GDP, there is some inflation. So maybe real GDP growth is I don\u2019t know 50 basis points. We\u2019re still growing our business with no inflation in our particular business at 3.5% comp NOI that\u2019s not that. It\u2019s not 4% plus that we did last year or the year before, but it\u2019s still in the scheme of being able to grow our business, that\u2019s not bad.","And I\u2019m not defensive about it. I mean, that\u2019s kind of what I think we should expect when we have essentially a real GDP growth of 1%, maybe a little bit less, maybe a little bit more. And I think that\u2019s what you got to put in perspective.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks for the time.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Christy McElroy of Citi. Your line is open.","Michael Bilerman","Thanks, Michael Bilerman here with Christy. How are you?","David Simon","Good, thanks.","Michael Bilerman","So, David, I wonder if you can talk a little bit about putting capital into your stock. Last year you had bought I think it was like $350 million at about 180. Obviously the stock, with some of the sell-off as well as some of the retail headlines, has come off 20%. We spent a lot of time talking about something you spent $30 million on. I was wondering you got a $2 billion share repurchase program, how you feel about putting money into your stock?","David Simon","Well, look, I think at the end of the day the best thing we can do is invest in our product, okay because the stock will go up and it\u2019ll go down by investing in our product. And I think what unfortunately what I think a number of retailers, they\u2019ve not invested in their product, okay. Or they\u2019ve chased the holy-grail of internet sales to the determent of what they should be doing with the physical product, as still people want to go physical shopping.","And when they go physical shopping, you\u2019ve got to have a nice physical environment. So we have spent a lot of years wanting to invest in our physical product. And I think that\u2019s our number one focus continues to be we\u2019re well through that. The good news is we have been contrary in that and we started that in \u201810. And as you know we\u2019re finishing projects, that\u2019s not just talking about projects but finishing a lot of projects.","So, I think if that wind down then the opportunity to buy stock back is always there. And I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a high priority but that could change depending upon kind of where the world is and what the stock does. But I think my job is, the number one job I should be doing is, invest in making my product better. And that\u2019s my number one focus.","Michael Bilerman","And you talked in your opening comments about your deal-making over the years and always taking a proper risk-reward and thinking about the capital committed to whether it\u2019s a project or whether it\u2019s a venture investment. As you think about investing in Aero, putting $30 million in, is there sort of a house limit that you would want to have in those sorts of investments relative to the whole? And where would it sit within the Simon organization? Is it more within the venture side or is there another sort of area? I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in the David Simon bucket. Where does it sit within the organization?","David Simon","Well, look, even though I\u2019m older I can always learn new things. And I\u2019ve learned a lot actually going through the Aero-deal. We\u2019re going to act as an investor we\u2019re going to give strategic direction as a board member. Authentic brands, I\u2019d encourage you to look at the brands in the history of that company, they\u2019ve done a great job of, they are brand builders. They are entrepreneurs.","So, we\u2019re not going to be running the business, we\u2019re going to help strategically like we did. It will be, but we\u2019re - so I\u2019ve got my IT guys helping with their IT Systems. We\u2019ve got our lawyers helping with their license agreements. So we have a lot we can bring to the table. And that\u2019s what makes us unique.","And but it\u2019s not going to overwhelm anybody\u2019s particular time, they\u2019ve got a good management team that with our strategic help I think will continue to make that profitable. And look, based on the numbers, I think it\u2019s going to be a compelling investment. But it\u2019s not without risk. I mean, it is, there is risk out there whenever you make a venture like investment but I can\u2019t think of a better team between Gordon Brothers, Hilco, ABG, General Growth to all put a collective judgment to bear to make this a profitable investment.","I don\u2019t think going back to your first question I don\u2019t think this is going to be the wave of the future. I mean, AT&T, I mentioned vertical because I just try to put certain things outside of real-estate in perspective, okay. So, AT&T was buying, going vertical. They\u2019re spending a $100 billion, okay. I go vertical, I spend $33 million, okay, million not billion, $33 million.","And again I\u2019m not comparing, I\u2019ll just try to put these things in perspective, I\u2019m not comparing our business to AT&T or anybody else. Amazon, what\u2019s made Amazon great is they\u2019ve had the latitude to go vertical. They\u2019ve gone vertical, they\u2019ve gone content, they\u2019ve gone distribution, they\u2019ve gone retail, and that may be the future of corporate America is that you\u2019re not going to pigeon-hole these comps.","If we want to just talk about leasing a Sears-box that we get back, I mean, that\u2019s okay for some companies but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re about. So, again, there is no, we have no bucket, it\u2019s not going to take away from what we\u2019re doing, my number one priority is to make our product better any way that we can, technology digital investments look and feel, better retailers, different mix, redevelopment, however that transpires.","And making a vertical investment here or there, not going to overwhelm us. But I want the latitude to, and I think the investment community should want us to. By the end of the day, if our underwriting numbers are right and there is risk, we\u2019re buying a business that ought to be valued at six times EBITDA and we\u2019re buying at a 1 to 2. And I think that\u2019s a pretty good trend. But we\u2019re not there yet and that\u2019s the goal, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to accomplish.","Christy McElroy","Hi David, it\u2019s Christy, sorry about the three questions. Just bigger picture, the consortium has talked about 300 to 400 store-based count for Aeropostale, there has been a lot of talk about store-count rationalization among national retailers generally in how many stores do they actually need to serve their customers in their market today. Why is that the right number of stores for a retailer like Aeropostale?","And what does that imply for your view of the need for other retailers to close stores, especially now that you\u2019re looking at this issue through that Aeropostale lens?","David Simon","Well, look, and it\u2019s very - I think you\u2019ve pointed out something is very unique, is that we\u2019re getting a lens at a much granular level on retail. So it\u2019s very interesting.","Sourcing, look, there are five or six things that really make a retailer click, sourcing, obviously rent expense, store expense, the merchandize all of it, packaging, all the stuff that I think at the end of the day we\u2019re going to make us better real-estate owners. But that remains to be seen.","Aero, look, I\u2019m probably going to get in trouble for this but since I like you, I\u2019m going to tell you. Right now, we\u2019re looking at around 500 stores in the U.S., as kind of a model. And based upon we expect every one of those stores to be profitable. So, it\u2019s a much bigger business than we initially went in, in the investment.","We were thinking we could justify our investment at a much lower store-base the fact of the matter is we found out there is a lot more store profitability out there than we thought. So, it\u2019s going to be around 500 give or take. But I think store closings, it is - the pressure for that retailers\u2019 to invest in the internet to close stores from their investment community is great.","I would question whether that\u2019s the right strategy because some of these stores are very profitable. Yet, they feel like the headline closing stores, is the answer and then all of this investment into the internet is going to pay all these dividends.","The fact of the matter is there is a really healthy physical store environment and mall environment. And I think all of us can\u2019t lose sight of that. And that\u2019s where we should be investing.","So, I do think there will be more pressure on store closings. Unfortunately over our history, we\u2019re pro to that I don\u2019t need to remind you that the top 10 tenants that we went public with in \u201893 no longer exist in 2016. And we will be able to deal with it, it\u2019s much easier to deal with it when you have a quality portfolio that we do across all the retail platforms that we have. But it\u2019s the soup of the day.","And so, I don\u2019t think it needs to be 300 or 400 or 500, I think there are lots of profitable stores that retailers are feeling the pressure they\u2019ve got to do something. And I would like them to invest in their stores it\u2019s something I would like them to do. But I don\u2019t always win that argument.","So, we\u2019re equipped to handle that, that\u2019s what we do. And but I expect that trend probably to continue. Now what we did say when we started this year, our occupancy is up. Firstly it is up, so put that in perspective. We also said our bankruptcy store closings would be down in \u201816, it is down. We had much greater in \u201815, and we\u2019ve basically more or less leased all of the bankruptcies that we got back in \u201815 in a flat-to-tough retail environment. And I think everybody needs to put that in perspective, okay.","So, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re doing cartwheels here. It is, we\u2019re grinding, word is good as it gets when it comes to grinding. And that\u2019s the environment that is presented to us. And we\u2019ll have to deal with it.","Christy McElroy","Thanks so much for the color.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Spector of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Jeff Spector","Great, thank you. Good morning. I\u2019m also here with Craig Schmidt. I guess, David, if we could just talk a little bit more about the current environment. Let\u2019s say it continues; it persists through \u201817, even \u201818. How should we think about these rent amendments? How are you thinking about it when you\u2019re laying out your budget for next year? Is this just something that we should get used to as we transition here as the retailers invest more money in their stores, we see more store closings? How should we think about that?","David Simon","Well, look, I think again, it\u2019s a retail-by-retail perspective. We\u2019re seeing stabilization in our sales business, if you want to go focus on retail sales Q2-over-Q3 is basically flat. And if you take out tourism, you take out one retailer that\u2019s had decreases in sales, that\u2019s actually up. So, we\u2019re not like - there is no huge concern here. But we just, we\u2019re a product of the overall U.S. economy.","Jeff, what\u2019s the real GDP growth, you tell me. So, in that environment what do you think it is the real one? Real GDP growth, what would, Merrill\u2019s got a bunch of smart people, what would they say of this?","Jeff Spector","I think we\u2019re saying around that 1%, 1.5%.","David Simon","So, I mean, we\u2019re good, I\u2019m not that good but I got a lot of people around me that are good. That\u2019s a constraint. So but it is what it is. We\u2019ll sort it through and I do think in that kind of environment, we\u2019re going to have certain deals where we will go back and then we\u2019re going to have a lot of other deals, frankly, we\u2019re going to take the space back.","And my moods changing a little bit that maybe we\u2019re better off taking the space back. I think we did play ball a little bit more with the bankruptcies in \u201815 and the early \u201816. And that\u2019s showing up in the lease spreads. And I\u2019m thinking sales are okay, stabilizing, maybe the world gets over all of this stuff that\u2019s going on out there maybe we stabilize. A lot of people feel like we\u2019re headed for growth. So maybe we take more space back.","But we\u2019ve kept the buildings full, as evidenced by the occupancy, there is a trade-off. We\u2019re on our target for top-of-the-line increase. So, it\u2019s not all that bad. So, just put in perspective, \u201817 will transpire and will do a combination, sometimes will play ball, other times we\u2019re going to take the space back. And it\u2019s all a function of retail-by-retail decisions, space-by-space, retailer-by-retailer.","Jeff Spector","Okay, thanks. And I think Craig has one question.","Craig Schmidt","Great, thanks. Maybe I could do a little bit of a pivot here. Looking at your new developments for the outlets, four of the five projects are international. Can we expect to see continued good growth in new projects on international scale? And then maybe more specifically with your longer-term plans are with McArthurGlen?","David Simon","Well, we just had a meeting with - I had a meeting with our partner last Friday. Their business is very good, very solid. Provence is opening in spring of next year which will be fantastic. We\u2019re very close on getting the potential to build Normandie, which we think will be a great, which will basically cover the Western Parisian market. That could be fantastic.","We\u2019ve got a couple of acquisitions that we\u2019re working on, extensions that we\u2019re working on. So it\u2019s all good there, it\u2019s been, the team are working well together. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the investment. And I think it\u2019s Craig it\u2019s just kind of business as usual. We\u2019re still seeing new development growth, very pleased just that we\u2019ve been able to create that partnership and create that relationship going forward.","In Asia, the team is working in a couple of other markets that I\u2019m hopeful over time that we\u2019ll be able to build the premium outlet product there. We\u2019ve got couple of big expansions in the works Gotemba is an example that could be a landmark extension. So that business is, we\u2019re not slowing by any stretch of imagination internationally in our outlet business either with McArthurGlen or with our Asian partners.","Craig Schmidt","Thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Next question is from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning, David.","David Simon","How are you doing?","Alexander Goldfarb","Just fabulous; it\u2019s earnings season, life is great. So, just a few questions here, let me start with an easier one before I ask one on the favorite same-store topic. Here in New York, obviously, a lot of - sorry, the demand for street retail has gone down a lot, so a lot of vacant spaces; articles about global brands rethinking their street retail needs, especially with where rents are and store profitability.","Have you seen as those brands have dialed back, have you seen them, I don\u2019t want to say shift back, but have you seen more interest in going in malls where they are profitable? Or from your perspective, they\u2019ve always been running street retail, their investment there, separate from their decision to open up in malls?","David Simon","I don\u2019t think there is a generic answer to that, I think its brand-by-brand. And generally on the luxury side of those brands, their business is actually, they\u2019re starting to anniversary some of the strong dollar stuff. And obviously we are as well. And I meet with a lot of the folks, I mean, there are certainly some brands here and there that are pulling back but I\u2019d say generally and you\u2019re starting to see the numbers like from LVMH and Kering that have posted recently.","Their business is good, pretty good. I think New York is - this is a novice because we have no street retail. But New York is a little confusing to them because you got 5th, you\u2019ve got Madison, you\u2019ve got Downtown, you\u2019ve got different - you\u2019ve got new developments, you got West 57th Street, so they\u2019re all trying to sort that out. I think in our business, it hasn\u2019t changed. And if anything I\u2019d say the mood is generally better than it was six months ago, if you want a generic statement.","And I think New York City itself is just different because they\u2019re all trying to figure out where they need to be given what\u2019s going on in New York. But we don\u2019t have a dog in that hunt. And I think Brickell is going to be I mean, we have a little delay with the hurricane and I guess it really, technically wasn\u2019t a hurricane or not, I\u2019m not really sure. But Brickell I think is going to be lot of the retailers rope-in in the first quarter of next year. But I think that mix there is really going to be great, cool.","I think the stack-store is going to be great. And the demand on that just continued to pick up, right Rick, over, month after month. And I think that\u2019s a good indication that if you have a good product or you have a good scheme, retailers are coming. Rick, you want to comment on Brickell?","Rick Sokolov","I think Brickell is certainly going to show that there is going to be a great mix of designers, food, international retailers and right now we\u2019re 91% leased. And as David said, the opening is going to take place over. We\u2019re going to have a big slug over the next few weeks and another big slug over the first quarter of next year.","The only other thing I would say to you is that we are seeing the international retailers like Zara, like H&M accelerating their focus on our properties in the United States because there is demand to grow in this market. And we are seeing that.","David Simon","And I would just say, we\u2019ve got just to finish the whole thought and then you can ask me, if it\u2019s on comp NOI, it\u2019s not a tough question, it\u2019s going to tell you exactly what I\u2019m thinking.","Alexander Goldfarb","You don\u2019t know the question yet, David.","David Simon","All right, all right, bring it on.","Alexander Goldfarb","We don\u2019t give our questions in advance.","David Simon","All right, okay, good. Thank you. That\u2019s what I like about you Alex. So, but just to finish the luxury, people that would populate street retail in New York, we say luxury, not that it\u2019s easy but we\u2019re making progress with Clearfork and that\u2019s in Fort Worth, Texas. We\u2019re going to have those kinds of brands, not a lot of them but the right ones.","We opened King of Prussia with the connection and again, a lot of those are opening. But the results from those high-end brands have been fantastic. So, that part of our business is different, I think it\u2019s interesting it\u2019s actually starting to do better than maybe what you\u2019re seeing and whatever is being talked about in New York street retail. But I really, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t really have a dog in that hunt.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Then the second question is it sounded like you said that bankruptcies and the issues really peaked last year and that you guys were more accommodative with retailers trying to restructure. And, therefore, it seems like this year we\u2019re seeing the impact in the same-store metrics. At the same time, I think you said that the tourism impact strong dollar is also anniversarying.","So it almost sounds like next year we should expect same-store metrics to get a positive bump as these trends sort of anniversary. Is that fair? Or as you guys look into your leasing for next year, we still should see some of this impact, whether it\u2019s on re-leasing spreads or same-store NOI etcetera? Should we still see that in \u201817 or is \u201817 going to be a little better because this stuff anniversaries?","David Simon","Look, I think the big unknown is just what\u2019s going on, all you have to do and you\u2019re smart financial guy, look at our P&L right. You could see, put the leasing spreads aside, put all those other stuff aside, I mean, the reality is, the comp NOI is really a function of our overage rent which is right there on the financial statement, okay, it\u2019s down.","Can\u2019t help it, I mean, and it\u2019s really a function of the fact that we got these great tourist centers we\u2019re having, we\u2019re suffering from that impact. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a long-term impact. But it\u2019s starting to anniversary and it shouldn\u2019t continue to get worse, okay.","But Alex, it could get worse because no one knows what\u2019s going to happen with the dollar. The international tourist market is volatile. At best, we live in an uncertain time. But I think we\u2019re doing, to deliver this 3.5% and deliver over 6% portfolio growth is I think is reasonably good, it\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s reasonably good given some of the constraints that we\u2019re dealing with that are a little bit out of our control, a little bit. We\u2019re going to take responsibility for a lot of that stuff, but a little bit out of control.","So, I think it\u2019s too early to tell you on \u201817. Unfortunately I say this because it starts not next week, the week after, Rick, property budgets?","Rick Sokolov","Yes, week after.","David Simon","Week after where we go one-by-one, space-by-space and we\u2019ll report back early next year what our view of that is. And it\u2019s a little, there is a little more volatility in being able, the standard deviations probably little bit higher than it used to be just because of the environment that we have that we\u2019re operating in.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And just confirming you\u2019re taking an, $0.08-charge, that\u2019s in guidance for Copley?","David Simon","I\u2019m glad you asked that. And the answer is yes. That is in guidance. So if we had not taken that charge, our guidance would be up another $0.08.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thanks, David.","David Simon","No worries. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Your line is open.","Paul Morgan","Hi, good morning. Just to follow-on on that, so that would be $0.13. I mean is there anything you could point to as a driver of that kind of guidance increase in late October?","David Simon","Well, generally we\u2019re producing the results we want to produce. So I know the operating metrics on that, perfect, we\u2019re not going to deny that. I mean, but we told at the beginning of the year, this is the plan, 3.5%, 6%, and we\u2019re producing a little bit better on that front overall. And that\u2019s where it rolls up to.","And so, we\u2019re being very cautious on Copley, we have made the final decision on that. But I think it\u2019s likely that we\u2019re going to do that. But we\u2019ve got, I\u2019ve got to run it through the board and - but I want the market to know that that maybe off the table going forward at least for the time being.","And we could - look we could have kept it on our books and waited but you know what, I think the right thing to do if we in fact decide to do it will be to pick that hit.","Paul Morgan","Okay. And then you mentioned in terms of the same-store number not just PacSun, but then also I think you said intentionally kind of reducing the specialty leasing program in the common area at some of your high-end malls. Is that a material impact? And kind of what\u2019s sort of the thought process behind that? And kind of maybe - if you have a number, you\u2019ve given us in the past kind of what that program is as a percent of NOI?","David Simon","Well, I think it\u2019s material and that it does affect the comp number. The comps would be higher had we not chosen. But look, part of what we have to do is, listen to our clients. Our clients to some degree especially in certain areas of the mall very concerned about that. So, we want to be receptive, we\u2019ve got competition in some of these markets that we\u2019ve got to be responsive to. And we just think it\u2019s the right thing to do.","We did a lot of research on the consumer. Consumer really doesn\u2019t care but on the other hand, we have two - when it comes to the property business, we\u2019ve got to listen to our clients i.e. the retailers, etcetera. And we obviously have to be listened to the consumers, they diverge here but in this case we want to be as sensitive to the clients as we can. And some are very sensitive to us and we don\u2019t want to keep that from bringing the right mix into some of these centers. And that has hurt us over the years. We\u2019ve thinned out in the very high-end properties. Yes, go ahead.","Paul Morgan","I was just going to say, has this strategy been kind of accelerating recently is why you mentioned it in terms of the same-store number this quarter or has it kind of been ongoing over the past period of time?","David Simon","I think it\u2019s been, look, we didn\u2019t really do it last year because a lot of these projects were in the state of development. But it\u2019s clearly been - it\u2019s clearly been throughout \u201817.","Paul Morgan","Okay.","David Simon","And remember, this stuff builds, it has more of a...","Rick Sokolov","As you go later in the year it has more of a back-end impact, okay. So it kind of builds, it\u2019s less important in Q1 and Q2 just because seasonality of our business.","Paul Morgan","Great. Then just last question; I appreciate all the color on the Aero-economics. And just wanted to ask, there\u2019ve been dozens of similar bankruptcies over the years and you probably could\u2019ve had opportunities to do something similar then. Maybe could you point to anything outside just the economics of it that makes you think differently about this? And then just going forward, I know you had the macro view about vertical integration, but anything more, kind of your narrow business driven where you didn\u2019t do this for years and now it looks interesting?","David Simon","Well, I think that\u2019s a very good question. And I would say this, I think as we\u2019ve gotten to know authentic brand group we now have, for us to have done this without their involvement on how to stabilize and then grow the brand, I mean, that would, I might have that expertise a couple of years from now, maybe, I mean, I\u2019d say, we, I doubt it, but maybe, you never know.","And I think having and we have talked, it\u2019s very interesting. I\u2019ve been talking to authentic brands over - for a year about another, brands that might fit into this model that we are creating. But they didn\u2019t come to fruition for whatever reason. But I think we finally, we have, over this last year been able to develop kind of an operating model and platform.","They\u2019re great at brand building, having general growth as part of that. And their ability to bring their real-estate and their thoughtfulness to the table in terms of how you operate the business was very helpful. So having the liquidation angle solved with Hilco and Gordon Brothers was critical. So it was really the long - in a nutshell it was really, because the partners were able to do it. The partners brought so much to the table that this was the right deal.","If it were just us on our own, I\u2019d be the first to tell you I don\u2019t know that we would do it, we\u2019ve done Starbuck franchises but that\u2019s we did by the way. And I encourage everybody that goes Del Amo, goes to Pink\u2019s Hotdogs, that\u2019s owned by your company, Simon Property Group. I\u2019m so, excited about that franchise as we own. It\u2019s great hotdogs. It\u2019s an institution. That\u2019s - we\u2019ve got a small group that kind of runs that business, this is a little bit out of the ordinary.","And I would say simply put, the fact that we had this partnership that was able to navigate all of the complexities of this. And so, I think that\u2019s the important determinant of why we did this versus not doing others.","Paul Morgan","And the partners see it as not necessarily just a one-off, but something that could be replicated?","David Simon","Yes, but we\u2019ve got to walk, crawl before we run.","Paul Morgan","Great, thanks.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Next question is from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Rich Hill","Hi guys. Thanks for the time this morning; and I always appreciate the transparency. I wanted to just ask a quick question about the lease amendments, maybe in the context of your broader portfolio of malls. You have obviously the luxury of seeing across the productivity spectrum.","So when we\u2019re thinking about lease amendments in maybe your higher-quality malls, is it may be the case that some of these tenants are paying above-market rents to get into the best-quality malls and, therefore, you might still be incentivized to make a lease amendment? Maybe reduce their rent, but recognizing it\u2019s still a pretty attractive rent overall? Is that the right way to think about it?","Then maybe if you could provide some color, if any, about how you\u2019re seeing lease amendments on malls doing $700 a square-foot versus maybe those doing $350. But I do appreciate that it\u2019s mall-to-mall.","David Simon","Well, I mean, that\u2019s the bottom line. Certainly we have some of those cases. But it really is mall-by-mall, space-by-space. And what the retailer relationship is and what we think the retailer future is. I wish there were simple straightforward answer but there is not. We try to use our business judgment in figuring out what the right is.","It\u2019s also we want to be conservative or do we want to be aggressive what\u2019s our mood of the future. As you know last year, we had a lot of bankruptcies. And we gave direction to like okay, we\u2019re starting to change our attitude a little bit, I can\u2019t tell you that it\u2019s going to be a complete reversal. And we try the right we make the right judgment call.","Now I will tell you lease amendments are like anything else. Once you do it for one retailer, don\u2019t kid yourself, you hear about it, and it goes everywhere else. Part of our job is to contain that. And but we\u2019ve experienced this before, we did do is in other economic times. And again, our business is fine but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s - we\u2019re trying to be accommodating but we could shift our strategy pretty quickly. And we try to evaluate it one-by-one. Rick, do you want to add anything to it?","Rick Sokolov","I would say to you the most important consideration to realize this - these are lease amendments that are not forever. One of our considerations is do we have a better replacement tenant but that tenant won\u2019t be ready to open for a year or where it is in the project and what is the project. So all of those factors come into play as to how we want to deal with this specific room and how we price the room and how we interface with that tenant.","And the only other point I would make is that, and it gets lost some times. But today our portfolio has never been stronger, never been better physical condition, never had a better mix of small-shot tenants, better mix of boxes, better mix of restaurants better set of amenities.","So, we are on a continual basis taking share and that\u2019s our focus to make our properties as compelling as they can be. And that helps us in dealing with all the things you\u2019ve been talking about.","David Simon","And again, the business we are 96.3% occupied. And as an example, Macy\u2019s announced 100 store closing. Their closing, Macy\u2019s is leaving one of our malls, they\u2019re leaving one of our malls, we think. And a very small mall that has basically no financial impact to us at the end of the day.","So, there is this narrative and the mood. But the fact of the matter is, go back to 7.3% NOI growth that\u2019s $300 million. Let\u2019s put it all in perspective, okay.","Rich Hill","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","David Simon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum of Boenning. Your line is open.","Floris van Dijkum","Great, thanks. Could you give a brief update on what\u2019s happening with your Seritage JV?","Rick Sokolov","We are basically in the same position that we articulated in our last earnings call. We have identified users for our boxes. We have plans for our boxes. We are not going to proceed with that redevelopment. And so we have a firm understanding of our returns and the costs of downsize from the Sear stores.","There are conversations going on right now regarding those costs. And as soon as we have a clear understanding of that we\u2019re in a position to proceed to try next year on some of those redevelopments.","Floris van Dijkum","And that would include the Primark at Burlington Mall?","Rick Sokolov","That is independent. That is proceeding as is the addition of Primark at South Shore in a portion Sears which is not in Seritage. The Primark lease at Burlington was, existing at the time we did our joint venture. And that is proceeding.","Floris van Dijkum","Great. Thanks, Rick. David, a question for you in terms of how sustainable do you - I mean, you\u2019re talking about the 6.6% to 7% NOI growth, but if you put that in perspective, you do that for a decade you\u2019ve doubled NOI. I mean is that realistic for a $100 billion company?","David Simon","We\u2019re working to achieve that, okay. I can\u2019t, I\u2019m not that clairvoyant to look out that far.","Floris van Dijkum","But do you see anything near term that\u2019s going to break that streak?","David Simon","Well, I think we\u2019re going to lead our industry and portfolio NOI growth as we\u2019ve done it for so long, I don\u2019t see any reason why we can\u2019t continue.","Floris van Dijkum","Great. Thanks, guys.","David Simon","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Mueller","Hi, I guess going back to Aero for a second; you discussed this as being more of an opportunistic investment. But out of curiosity, when you first thought about it and got into it was it more a defensive play to control store closings? How did you look at it initially?","David Simon","Not at all, as I said in my opening comments, I mean, no one would put new money into a business that we didn\u2019t think would have exciting future. And that\u2019s evidenced by kind of the group that we have bought the companies. So we certainly get the benefit of Aero paying rent. But that\u2019s not a reason to invest in a business. We could re-lease those spaces. And that\u2019s not, that\u2019s not a factor in putting new money into investment.","Michael Mueller","Got it, okay. On the outlet side, you talked about international expansion. Can you just talk about the U.S. and what the opportunities are that you see over the next 5 years, 10 years, just what does that pipeline look like?","David Simon","In our outlet business?","Michael Mueller","Yes, outlets.","David Simon","I think, the pace may not be as hectic as we\u2019ve done over the last three or four years. But Norfolk we open next year, we\u2019re going to actually start another outlet in the spring of this year, spring \u201817 in a very good growing market. We\u2019ve got another one under serious examination. So I don\u2019t think it will be as maybe as active as we\u2019ve had over the last two or three years, but we\u2019ll selectively do some stuff one, at least one a year on average, maybe two. We\u2019ve got some I think some unique opportunities.","We\u2019re also very focused on expanding with the Allen deal. Adding 120,000-square-foot to a center that does, I don\u2019t know $600 plus a foot, and the outlet business is very attractive. So there is a lot to do with domestic portfolio as well.","Michael Mueller","Got it, okay, that was it. Thank you.","David Simon","Thanks.","Operator","Next question is from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ki Bin Kim","Thank you. So David, I just wanted to go back to something you just said just a minute ago. As you deal with retailers like Aeropostale and PacSun and go through your lease negotiations, how do you really contain the risk that somehow leverage doesn\u2019t move more towards retailers that might be in trouble, that might come back to you and try to do similar deals going forward?","David Simon","Well, as I said when this happens, you get, you do get a - it does tend to spread. On the other hand it\u2019s very simple, so we\u2019re not going to do it. So that changes the dynamics pretty quickly. So, look, again, we don\u2019t, this is a space-by-space, retail-by-retailer decision. It\u2019s not pervasive throughout.","But this and again I explained to you our rationale as to why we kind of did it \u201815, \u201816. But it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll reevaluate every day with every retailer. And my instinct is that we could be changing how we dealt with kind of the \u201815,\u201916 stuff already. But it will be a case-by-case basis.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And just going back to your development pipeline, you have about $3.5 billion worth of projects. Just given that some of those projects or a lot of them were probably started at time where maybe the view of the health of the retail environment might be a little bit different, how should we think about the overall arc of capital deployment? Is it reasonable to expect that number to come down going forward?","David Simon","Look, there is nothing in our redevelopment that we\u2019re not doing other than potentially Copley. And Copley was I mean I would encourage everybody to study what\u2019s going in construction cost and what\u2019s going on in supply and demand there. We did not want to be, unfortunately the build there is longer than it should be because of the nature of how we have to reinforce the structure.","And we spent a lot on it because to get approvals and to make sure we had the engineering to do it. But the reality is, when we started seeing the construction cost, it just not the right time to do it with all the supply and the cost there. We don\u2019t see that anywhere else in the portfolio.","So, we\u2019ve got a lot of very interesting stuff to do beyond what we\u2019re doing now. And like I said we\u2019ve done some really good work in the field and King of Prussia, being part of Brickell, Clearfork, we\u2019ve got plans to expand Fashion Valley and I could go through the whole list. But that part of the business is unabated because we think investing in our great real-estate is what we should do for a living and that\u2019s not changing.","But we do have to worry about supply and demand. And I\u2019m not worried about supply and demand in our retail portfolio. In the case of Copley I got nervous about it. Be the first to admit.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay, thank you.","David Simon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. This ends the Q&A portion of today\u2019s conference. I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. David Simon for any closing remarks.","David Simon","All right, thank you for your questions. And we\u2019ll talk to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day."]}}
