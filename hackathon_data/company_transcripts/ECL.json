As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Michael Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Michael J. Monahan - Senior Vice President External Relations","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's first quarter conference call. With me today are Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO.","A discussion of results, along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results and our outlook, are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor. Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials, stating that this teleconference, the discussion and slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected.","Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under item 1A, risk factors, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with a brief overview of the quarter, continued attractive new account gains and new product introductions drove good fixed currency sales growth in our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments during the first quarter, nearly offsetting a decline in Global Energy sales.","New business and ongoing cost efficiency work led the strong adjusted fixed currency operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the impact of soft economies, weak oil prices and currency headwinds. These, along with fewer shares outstanding, drove the adjusted earnings per share increase before currency translation.","While 2016 is proving to be a challenging year, we continue to focus on the same fundamental strategies that have successfully driven our strong growth record, providing the best products and service for our customers to give them the best results and lowest operating costs. They delivered again in the first quarter, and we expect them to deliver for the full year 2016.","Looking to the second quarter, we expect our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments to continue to show solid acquisition adjusted fixed currency growth, outpacing their markets in soft international economies, as they leverage investments we have made to further improve sales and service force effectiveness and profitability and more than offset lower results from our Global Energy business.","We look for the second quarter earnings per share to be in the $1.03 to $1.11 per share range, with that range including approximately $0.08 per share or 7% of unfavorable currency translation and impact from the Venezuela deconsolidation, as we continue to aggressively drive business growth.","For the full year, the Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments are expected to continue to show solid fixed currency growth. Global Energy segment expectations have softened. Global Energy sales are expected to be on the lower end of our range, down upper single digits versus last year. While the dollar has weakened somewhat, at this early point in the year, we are maintaining our earnings per share forecast for 2016 to reflect the uncertain currency trends and business environment.","Net, we continue to expect to outperform our markets in 2016, while also investing in the key drivers for future, sustainable above-average earnings growth. We expect our consolidated results to show improving comparisons in the second half and continue to look for adjusted diluted earnings per share in the $4.35 to $4.55 range.","Moving to some highlights from the first quarter. And as discussed in our press release, reported first quarter earnings per share were $0.77. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share decreased 4% to $0.77, reflecting an $0.11 or 14% currency headwind.","The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by delivered product and other cost savings, cost efficiencies and the lower share count. Our consolidated fixed currency acquisition adjusted sales were modestly lower, as our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments grew 4%, but were offset by lower Global Energy sales. Regional sales growth was led by Latin America and Europe. Adjusted fixed currency operating margins showed strong growth, expanding 60 basis points.","In 2016's difficult environment, we are focused on driving new business gains by helping customers to lower their costs. We are using our industry-leading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve the best results and lowest operating costs and, through these, aggressively drive new account gains across all of our segments. We expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share in the $1.03 to $1.11 range, reflecting a currency translation and Venezuela deconsolidation drag of approximately $0.08 or 7%. Consolidated results are expected to improve with the second half outperforming the first half. We look for our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share in the $4.35 to $4.55 per share range.","In summary, despite a very challenging global economic and market environment, we expect to continue to deliver solid fundamental results in 2016. We remain confident in our business, our markets and our people as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years.","And now, here's Doug Baker with some comments.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, everybody. Look, we had a solid quarter. We're on track for a full year delivery within our forecasted range. All of our sectors are handily outperforming their markets and competition, and we continue to gain share in all of these areas.","For the year, there are natural puts and takes. We look at our Institutional, Industrial and Other business segments. They have been above expectations at this point, driven by new business, innovation, cost savings, very good execution. This is driving improving top line and improved margin performance. Energy is heading to the lower side of our expectation in spite of share gains and savings initiatives, and this is really driven by an even tougher market than expected. This will pass. We continue to believe, though, that the upturn is really a 2017, not a 2016 story, i.e. the oil and gas market upturn.","If we froze FX at today's rates, FX would be less of a negative than planned, would be roughly $0.28 versus $0.38 negative. But given the fluidity of the FX situation, Brazil political environment, you've got the British exit vote, China, etc., we think it's too early and unwise to bake this into our forecast. Importantly, our forecast also continues to include significant investments in systems, R&D, talent initiatives which are all in total greater than last year, which I would remind you was greater than the prior year, and is, I think, a very strong indication of our confidence in the future which is high and we believe for good reason.","So, as we look at the future, we know that the temporary double headwinds of energy and FX will abate. We don't know exactly when, but they will pass. Even with them, we've been doing well and outperforming markets. We do know though that our plan and our position, we think, are spot on for the future. So, clean water, safe food, abundant energy and healthy environment is even more relevant going forward than it has been in the past 5 or 10 years.","We have a stronger competitive advantage position now, we believe, given our recent new innovations and our focus on driving excellent outcomes at low cost because of reduction in footprints on CO2 and water. We also have very strong execution momentum. Our teams are on it. They're doing a great job. They're driving new business. We had another very strong new business quarter in the first quarter, and we have promising new business bets in businesses like life sciences and geographies like MEA, and there are plenty more.","And finally, we got a culture in the team that knows how to deliver. For all these reasons, we feel very good about where we are, how we're going to get through the year, the position that we're going to be in to drive continued growth beyond.","So, that's my opening. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike, who will move on into Q&A.","Michael J. Monahan - Senior Vice President External Relations","Thanks, Doug. That concludes our formal remarks. Operator, would you please begin the question-and-answer period?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I guess, the first question. Oil has rebounded a lot off the lows. It doesn't sound like, from you or others, that that's going to be enough to really impact the trend in the Energy business. But how should we think about raw materials? It seems like that's probably somewhat more of a headwind by the second half of the year, assuming prices hold. And is it fair to say that the Energy business isn't seeing any real benefit yet from the move off the bottom? Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think the recent move in oil price, I think, look, the best predictions I read forecasted that oil would move up in anticipation of increased demand for the summer. It was likely going to weaken over the summer because really what needs to drive the fundamental price of oil is a rebalancing of supply and demand. And nobody really believed that was going to happen until towards the end of this year. And until that happens, you're not going to really, we believe, have sustained improvement in oil price or increase \u2013 maybe we shouldn't call it improvement \u2013 increase in oil price.","In terms of raw materials, I guess our forecast has always had two views; one, that raws likely move before we see the impacts of higher oil prices in our energy services business. That's in our forecast. So, in the back half, we have some uptick in raws included, not monstrous because we still have favorability in the first half, but that abates and goes away as we think the energy market starts correcting and healing.","So that's our view right now. I don't think you're going to see material increase in activity, which is what's really needed to drive our energy services volume until at the earliest very late this year, but most likely we aren't going to see the impact until 2017.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. And then the follow-up. You cited that energy is maybe a little bit weaker, but have you seen anything else change much in the last quarter? And I guess, I'm just thinking through the thought process of not flowing through the FX. I understand there's a lot of uncertainty, but a lot of data has pointed to weaker global growth. Are you seeing that impacting the businesses or are you staying conservative at this point? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think if you look in our total business mix, we called out mining is under a lot of pressure, which isn't a real surprise given everything else you read. And this is really the water technologies that we sell into the world's mining operations. I mean, that business is down double digits. So, you'll see spotty things. China, particularly on the heavy industrial side, is soft.","So, our business reflects what you're going to read day-to-day about the global economy. But overall, the model, as it has always proven, is fairly resilient. And so, we have puts and takes. We also have pretty strong business performance from Institutional in North America, in particular. There are oil dividends, which we've talked about, which are certainly lower raw materials which you see flowing through our II&O segments, which is one of the reasons gross profit is up.","The other reason, obviously, is innovation. So, I mean I don't think the other surprises are really outliers nor will they dictate, I think, the year. And even the energy market softness, I would say it's worse than we anticipated. I would still think Energy is likely going to come in with the range we talked about. It's just going to be at the bottom end of it.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Good. Hello, everyone. So, Doug, just kind of following up on that with the energy question, like, do you feel that, like at this point, while we might have the lingering behavioral impacts and obviously still some pricing pressure as you help out your customers, but do you feel like at this point that you kind of, that we're in the later innings of getting your arms around kind of that we're getting close to a true bottom in that?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, we're certainly in the later innings. I'm not unwise enough to pretend to know if the bottom is 30 days ago or 90 days in front of us or 6 months in front of us. But certainly, we're in the later innings. And I think the data I pay most attention to is where are we on the supply\/demand curve. There's virtually no inventory storage capabilities globally for oil, so this thing reacts wildly to very small changes in supply and demand. And that is still projected to start coming in very near balance at the end of the year, and I believe ultimately that's going to be the data that dictates when this thing completely turns. So we're, what are we, 18 months into this? And we're saying probably have six to nine months to go, so certainly we're in the later innings.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then, with the other businesses, too, like particularly on the Institutional side, on a relative basis, I definitely get the relative strength compared to the industry trends. But with the end markets still kind of being a little bit sluggish, I was wondering what it's going to take to get that Institutional business more in that sustained 6%-plus growth range that I know that we're hopeful for. Like, do we need the end markets to do that? Or are there certain initiatives in place that do that by themselves even in the sluggish end market environment? Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say in Institutional Nate, I mean, the Institutional business itself or even the sector, Institutional business was north of 6% last year. It was 5% in this quarter, but expected to be 6%-plus for the year. And that was really a quarter phenomenon. That business is operating in the 6% to 8% band that we've talked about, and I think the team has done a good job and the team will tell you and I'll tell you they still have a lot of opportunity to get after growth opportunities and margin opportunities, particularly outside of North America, which they're focusing on. So that business is running as well as it's run in terms of its financial performance for many, many years.","Operator","Our next question is from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good afternoon. Two quick ones. Can you flesh out a little bit the comments about Latin America? And secondly, can you give us an update on how you're thinking about the M&A pipeline, particularly any chances to increase your footprint in the emerging markets?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll do it. The expanded footprint in emerging markets, we've operated now obviously for a while, and we talked about 160 before the merger, and we're 170-plus post merger. However, we didn't have equal capabilities in all these markets. And in particular, we made a break-out investment move in MEA about 18 months ago. And this cost us margin obviously last year and even a little bit early this year, but it has driven improved results. Previously, we really ran MEA as part of Europe.","Our history, whenever we make these break-out organizational moves, we did it with food, retail, breaking it out from KAY QSR. We did it many years ago with healthcare outside of what was then called EPP, which is our janitorial business. There are plenty other examples here. Both participants benefit, improved focus, and I think you're seeing that MEA has accelerated since we've broken it out, We have increased focus. We have a handle on our supply chain challenges and opportunities. And I would also point out Europe has done better since we've taken MEA out as well. Just simply it drives increased focus on the region that's left. So, that would be a good example of how we are investing in what we think are critical markets long term.","Latin America, we grew by basically 10%, or 9% I guess in the quarter. We continue to do well in a region that's obviously under a lot of pressure, Brazil being the most notable headline owner right now. And I would say it's two things. I think we've always tried to focus on what matters most in these areas. Our food and beverage business, which is important throughout all those economies, is up 19%. Even our paper business, through some big wins, is having a very strong quarter. Water is up double digit down in that market as well, and we believe those businesses in particular are going to be very strong players in Latin America for a long time to come, and that's what our focus has been and is paying off.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. Within the Energy segment, did you see any change in client behavior around pricing? And just to check, would you still expect pricing in the production side of that segment to still see a modest decline in 2016?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, I just \u2013 we didn't see a change in customer behavior towards pricing, which would be accepting price increases. So, no, they are under pressure and this is not unusual, and they are certainly putting pressure on us. You got competitive pressure as well. Pricing still remains, in total, in the low-single digits and we expected to be there for the year, but it's real pressure and a challenge.","And what I would say is that's an average. So, you've got some much more material givebacks in certain situations in other areas where we've been able to hold price either because we have very, very unique technology and a high need, or it's a customer not under the same pressure given their geographic position. So, I would expect you'll continue to see that.","I think the other things that we're seeing in that market, I don't know if they're surprising, customers are turning off programs and services. We've expected some. We're seeing a little more than we expected, but that's always a temporary issue. And so, people will take some risks, particularly in North America, where the huge market pressure is really coming to bear.","And the business outside of North America continues to perform at a much higher rate, simply because the market really reacts here and everywhere else. People are typically pumping oil to meet builds, not necessarily to meet capital demands and trying to make money. So, we'd expect to continue to see that. We're remaining physically disciplined.","Some of the pain is self-induced. Last year, we had only $4 million in bad debt write-offs. In the Energy business, we expect it to be greater this year, but still in the single-digit millions, which is pretty low given the size of that business. And a lot of it is because the Energy team has been very, very acutely aware of the risks there. We're putting customers on cash-on-demand quite early. We're staying out of some bankruptcy situations, customers where we don't believe there's a future either before or after bankruptcy, we are walking from if they won't go to cash on delivery, etc.","So, those are the type of steps that we're taking, and they accentuate some short-term pain. But ultimately, even within the year, we think they're going to be fiscally responsible moves because we're just going to avoid some big write-offs and other challenges.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. Thank you for the \u2013 for all that color. Just a quick add-on to that. Since you spoke about the trends outside the U.S. being positive, what was the net new business contribution or the share gain contribution that you saw in Energy in the first quarter? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, net, $55 million, roughly.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. First question. In Energy, can we hold EBIT margins here in the back half of the year? Or can you, big picture, just quantify that for us? Are we \u2013 or is this a good rate for the foreseeable future?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Look, I mean, the first quarter seasonally is always the low margin. I mean, for the year, the margin is going to be greater than what Energy showed in the first quarter.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. And the bigger picture issues, we're in a better oil environment, so we don't really need to revise longer-term assumptions downward, I guess, is my broader question there.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I \u2013 look, I mean, we're going through a world-class correction in the oil market. And if you compare it to the last four corrections, which typically were more of a 12 months to 18 months and this is certainly going to be \u2013 exceed 24 months in our forecast, this is a more severe correction. But, no, coming out of this, we \u2013 look, the demand for oil has not really been the question.","What's happened is we've been in an oversupply situation, which has crushed price and now will crush activity which will lead to under supply. And I mean, that's what we believe is going to happen. And you're going to see prices move up, activity increase and the demand for our services increase as well. Right now, everybody is focusing on the easiest oil they can find. And to meet future demand, they're going to have to start reverting and getting back after the harder oil, which is what ultimately drives higher demand in our portfolio. We believe that story is intact.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And very quickly as a follow-up under the healthcare business just holding its own. Is this going to be a type of year where we're just looking for, sort of, sideways healthcare? Or are we going to hit an inflection point at some point on the acquired divestiture adjusted change? Thank you, guys.","Michael J. Monahan - Senior Vice President External Relations","Yeah. Healthcare, I think, is going to strengthen throughout the year. They had a very, very good new business quarter in the first quarter, second best that they have and measured. So, we feel good about what's going on. They are now \u2013 the recall that really started last year in the third quarter, is fully behind them. And while that wasn't a huge top line hit, it was a huge hit in terms of focus and energy of the group. And now, that's fully done, fully resolved and moving forward. I expect good things out of healthcare this year. They'll continue to improve. It's not going to be a dramatic inflection in one quarter, but I think you'll see sequential improvement.","Operator","Our next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, hi. Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just to, I guess, make sure we're all on the same page on the Energy side, can you just remind us of the mix in your Energy business again between downstream, production and so forth at the beginning of the year? And then, what's baked into each of those categories in terms of assumptions to get you to your lower end of upper-single digit decline for this year?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, the WellChem is about 10%, heading to 8%. The production, or OFC business, is about 60% and downstream is 30%. And downstream is growing. WellChem is going to be under pressure again this year. It's likely going to bake towards the second half because it's starting to run into where they were down 50% in the third and fourth quarter. As you go forward, the OFC business will be under some pressure, but the drama isn't anywhere near what you see in WellChem.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And I guess...","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Last year, we were down 8% in total. And we said this year that we would expect to be not to have as much top line pressure, but it may get to 8%. What I've indicated is we're at the lower end of our expectations, so high-single digit sales declines this year like last year, maybe a little less, but in line with that.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And I guess, if you were to try and characterize the main differential between when you gave the guidance in late February versus today, like, I guess, which one area gets moved to get you to that lower end and maybe more?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say WellChem is going to be a little worse than we thought and OFC is going to be a little worse than we thought. Downstream is going to be in line with what we thought.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit, I think you mentioned in your comments, the new business bets like life sciences. I was wondering if you were \u2013 if you could elaborate a little bit more on that and maybe if there's any other new businesses like this that you're referring to.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll elaborate on life sciences. Life sciences is a business that we competed in for a long time, but we did it as part of the work in our F&B business and some of the function was driven out of our healthcare business. We've taken those two pieces of business and created a focused division on the life sciences market, i.e. pharma, cosmetics, etc.","The changes in that business and their needs match very much what we can do. So, it's a market that's dominated by large multinationals. They're getting to shorter runs, need to run at higher efficiencies, cleaning in place technologies is important in that market and the core competencies that we have. So, a lot of the things that we do there match well.","I would say, when this business is run as a small piece of two other businesses, it performed well, we believe, with focused, enhanced capabilities, R&D, etc., that we are going to be able to up the performance of this business handily, just as we've done in other markets like food, retail, etc. in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thank you very much. Hey, Doug, you had a very strong free cash flow quarter in the beginning of the year. Was there anything unusual or any pull forwards over there?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","One, I mean, the first quarter historically is our low first \u2013 lowest cash flow quarter. Last year was more the anomaly, and we talked about it. That working capital \u2013 some anomalies in working capital last year really hid the underlying performance, and we said that you would expect to see improvements starting second, third and fourth quarter in 2015 and you did.","And so, this year, we're going against a last year what I would call unusual negative cash flow performance. This year is a little stronger than maybe normal, but it's really driven by excellent working capital. We put real focus on it after last year's frankly unacceptable first quarter. And I think you're just seeing that discipline and focus carry through. Part of it is a conversation I had around energy where I think that team in a very difficult environment has done a heck of a job on receivables, in particular, which we needed to because otherwise you're going to walk right into a problem. So, that's really what's going on.","So, strong underlying earnings. The business is performing well. It gets masked principally by FX. And Energy is going to go through ups and downs. I'm not going to walk away from the downs. But last year, get out of FX, we're up 12%. And I think if you look at our cash flow, you'll see the underlying strength and that's more indicative of what the business is doing even with Energy.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And just as a follow-up, can you give us an update on Swisher? I know it's not huge, but is the revenue coming in kind of the way that you expected you're expecting some kind of erosion? And how long do you think it will take to get the margins more in line with the historical Ecolab margins?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think the Swisher acquisition is going as expected. And remember, our expectations are quite high in terms of ultimate return. We did expect to see sales erosion. We are seeing it. It's in line with expectations. Importantly, the most critical and strategic part of their business, we're doing a great job securing. It's not all done. We're continuing to work on that.","In terms of getting after cost structure, the team has made a lot of progress. And if anything, I think we will end up ahead of plan as we move forward. It hasn't shown up yet really in the P&L. That would be probably more in the second half. But in the whole scheme of things, it's not monstrously materially material, but it'll show up in the Institutional results but really not until the second half. Right now, it's a drag, but it'll turn into a positive, but not until the second half, probably.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, Doug, back to Energy, just the cadence of earnings of Q2 through Q4, I know you discussed margins, but what's the actual operating profit cadence do you expect for the rest of the year?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I need dollars, guys. Just give us a second, David. Sorry. I wanted to get \u2013 we had a bunch of percentages. It's probably a little easier to give you absolute direction. So, we would expect second quarter profit is going to be greater than first quarter. Still under pressure, but not nearly as much pressure as we were in terms of percentage in the first quarter. Almost half as much pressure on the percent.","We are going to start seeing, we think, profits flatten out in the second half. And the question as they flatten in the third, it's probably more a fourth quarter scenario that we'll start seeing year-on-year flattening on profits as you start running against the base and you start having some sales stabilization and volume stabilization in the new business that we continue to put on start showing up. So, that's the expectation.","So, I would say pressure in the first three quarters for sure. It's just going to be pressure that continues to become less severe as the year goes on, part because of base, part because we'll start seeing some new business, but mostly base.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And just on the overall gross margin, nice expansion in Q1. You expect expansion in Q2. Would you expect expansion in the back half of the year as well, or would that be more flattish given the direction of raw materials?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We would expect probably not the same level as gross profit expansion in the back half as the first, but we will continue to see improvement throughout the year.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks for taking this. I guess, maybe a little bit of color, Doug, on what's driving the sequential improvement and, I guess, implicit margin performance? I mean, they were down pretty significantly in this quarter. Is that just easier comps or recovering pricing, raw materials? Just to understand some of the drivers, I think, would be helpful.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","First of all, the story is not that different, but the margin commentary I just had on gross profit was whole company, so.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, I'm talking Energy.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, okay. So if you want to get into that, that's what I thought. So Energy, you got seasonal volume where first quarter is our lowest volume on in whatever environment you want to go in the Energy business. And so in a flat environment, without any share gain, you're going to see a step-up in second and then a minor step-up again in the third and fourth quarter just from seasonality.","You have a market which isn't been stable, but we think stabilizes later in the year, not improves, as you go through. And so, we think that seasonality comes through. And then the other issue is share and we continue to gain share. And our net ahead, as we go through this, and while it's a tough environment, we continue to see the few things that are happening in the world are coming our way and we are getting some of the existing fields to move our way.","And so, it's a combination of those two things that we think leads to a minor improvement when you start looking at year-on-year. And you got to remember, last year, the second half, we really had a lot of the market decline in the second half, not all of it, but a lot of it, a lot more than the first half.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. And then, just in terms of the other businesses, it looks like healthcare, maybe Energy and let's add paper, these things all have either sequential improvement or looking for growth in the back half of the year. Are there any markets where you are seeing any other signs of weakness creeping in that we need to be watching out for that maybe don't have better growth prospects as we move into the year?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think the markets besides Energy where we're under the most pressure would be mining and heavy industry, steel, etc., around the world. I would say mining is probably getting down towards the bottom, right. It was fairly negative in the fourth and much more negative in the first. We're forecasting kind of flattening and then improvement in mining as we go forward, as we start running into the base, but it's not that big of a business. And the heavy industry stuff will start running into the base as well, so I don't think there \u2013 this is like the puts and takes we have all the time. So I don't know that it demands increased scrutiny from you. Trust me, it's getting plenty from us.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Good afternoon. A lot of them have been answered already, but I just want to follow up on the specialty or the KAY part of the Institutional business. We've seen growth there sort of slow down to mid-single digit levels. This business used to perform at high-single digit, low-double digit growth. Is it just it's kind of getting to the scale where it's more difficult to grow at the rates you used to grow, or is it market is still a little bit weaker? Can you talk a little bit about just what the expectation out of the business should be going forward?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that business is going to continue to perform. Look, it will have its double-digit quarters. But mostly, it's going to be growing in the high-single digits. And what really drives it, as I've always described that business, sort of feeds a village via elephants. And so, it's a market that's dominated by large players. And when you sell one, you have a big, fairly significant ramp-up. You annualize against it and you continue to see ramp-up. So, it's a little different cadence than many of our other businesses.","But that business is I think in great shape and doing the right things. The opportunities in that business are fairly significant because there is real pain in the industry, particularly in North America as a consequence of wage pressure and ACA requirements. And so increasingly customers are going to look to take labor out. Whatever the economists want to say, they're going to take labor out, and that's a great opportunity for our QSR business, in particular.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Sounds good. Then, if you look at, you mentioned along with new business wins, some cost efficiencies have helped you with profitability. Is this part of a specific restructuring program that you have? Is it an ongoing sort of control of discretionary expenses in a difficult time? Can you talk about these cost efficiencies and how much of a runway, I guess, you have left?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, as I've described, I think we have a lot of runway left on continuing to improve our efficiency as an organization. As I've tried to state before, the word synergy has a half-life. And after a point in time, you don't get to talk about cost savings and synergies any more. But there's no way you put together two companies the size we did in 150 countries and have all your synergies worked out in 36 months without taking monster risk. And we don't like to take stupid risks.","And so, there is a lot still to be mined from the combination of Nalco and Champion as we go forward as there always is in a company, even without that just getting better, new technology drives new opportunities. So yeah, we're quite confident. I mean, if you look at our track record before we did the Nalco merger, we had routine margin expansion for a number of years and we would expect you're going to see regular margin expansion going forward, even if we call it cost savings instead of synergy.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. Okay. Thanks, Doug. That's helpful.","Operator","Our next question is from John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. If I wanted to look at the sequential earnings change in Global Energy, do you have the restated fourth quarter earnings that would compare? So, I'm looking at your current earnings, the first quarter 2015, the $104.2 million, that's about $25 million lower than what you originally reported a year ago. So, with the rebasing and the Venezuelan deconsolidation, what's the fourth quarter that we would use for a sequential comparison?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","What is it, $125 million? We would say $125 million on both. And so, if you look at Q4 and Q1, I mean, we do this as a matter of routine to look both year-on-year and sequentially. The biggest driver in terms of this is volume. Some of that's seasonal and some of it is market, but that would account for the vast majority. Simply, you don't have the same coverage in your plants and everything else, which is why first quarter broadly is always a low-margin quarter for us and it's a low-margin quarter for Energy as well. And then, it was exacerbated by further market declines as you go in.","I would also point out fourth quarter, as we've said, during the fourth quarter had a number of one-time positive events in it. All of them legitimate, but that would probably be accounted for almost $14 million of the $125 million that just weren't going to recur, which we called out in that fourth quarter. And it was simply we sold some inventory that was out there at one time, which were smart moves economically for the company, were legitimate deals. But you don't get to sell that inventory over and over again, so it took risk off the table and triggered a sale and some gross profit realization as a consequence of that.","So, those things are also part of the story. And then, we also had a one-timer negative in the first quarter in Angola that was fairly substantial that needs to be accounted for. When you take those things, the whole thing makes sense. But the fourth quarter was a little bit overstated, and the first quarter is probably \u2013 is really reflective of low seasonality. And we will see improved margin in Energy going forward simply because volume will be greater in the out-quarters than it was in this quarter, and you'll have better overhead coverage.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And then, the other segment which has the 16% sales margins this quarter; you're getting almost up to the Institutional area now in terms of margins. And we don't have a lot of good history of that segment, given it usually was good margins on pest, offset by investment in GCS. But as GCS ramps its margins now, how high does that other segment get do you think?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, look, GCS makes money now so we actually have a margin on the positive there and they've done a good job driving that. I think pest has always been a good profit business. Our pest business as you've seen has reaccelerated. If you recall, a couple years ago, we said we'd put it in a shop and are reinvesting in pest in a number of areas, which we've done. And to the team's credit, they've taken that reinvestment and delivered on the top line performance that they committed to. So, that grew nearly double digits in the first quarter, which is what we had historically expected out of pest, but then didn't see for quite a while. GCS, I mean, out of that thing, I think you can see regularly high teens may be approaching. Our goal as a corporation is 20%, so I'm not going to really be happy until everybody is there.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Mike.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Can you hear me okay?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","I was wondering, Doug, if you could talk about the new Synergex sanitizer product for clean-in-place applications. That's kind of your workhorse in the F&B market. Can you talk about some of the risks and the opportunities as you're introducing the next-generation product in that market?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Look, I guess, there's always risk if you introduce anything, but there's greater risk if you introduce nothing. So, this is one of our core platforms. It's the heart of CIP. And so, while we'll talk about what sales are for specific product, it sort of understates its overall importance. And so, this is the next platform of antimicrobial as we move forward. And we need to continue to bring broad-based kill, the absence of bioaccumulation, all the things that we think are very important to have going forward. And this is the state-of-the-art antimicrobial, we believe, in that marketplace and is very important to us, continuing to drive our advantage in that market. So, we've got the best antimicrobial suite. It just got better with this introduction.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Right. And then, I was curious, also, you mentioned that you were going to be \u2013 or you were splitting the Europe business from the MEA business. Was wondering if you could comment on the margin profile of those two businesses as separated and how they have trended over the past few years, particularly with all the work that you've done in the Europe region.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We've reported regularly that we continue to improve Europe. And what we've given you historically is kind of apples and apples to our Renaissance program. Europe is now high-single digit margin business in total, and MEA is virtually double that. So, MEA is a strong region in terms of OI margin. If anything, we've reduced it in the near term as we up investments in G&A. We've split this out two years ago. We've added a number of key division leadership position, added corporate account positions, added supply chain positions so we have better ability to get product to customers in that region, done a number of things which have put us in a better stead to drive growth which is a real focus in that place. And we'll drive margin after we get growth really cooking. But really, right now, it's growth first.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Sterne, Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Hamzah Mazari - CRT Capital Group LLC","Good afternoon. Just a question on M&A and balance sheet. Maybe, given the current leverage, a little over two times, how are you thinking about appetite to do a larger deal? And would it be fair to say that you're looking outside Energy versus continuing to build Energy? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think in terms of our capability to do an outside deal we don't think is governed by our balance sheet at this point in time. So, we said our goal is to get down to roughly a 2 times EBITDA margin, and that's where we are. We think that's the right balance between financial efficiency and also strategic capability, i.e., capitalize or jump quickly if you needed to.","In terms of what we're looking at, I think our focus has been water because we believe it's a great opportunity. We continue to look there. You've seen recent Institutional and F&B deals. If they continue to have promising bolt-ons, we'll continue to do that. And then, I think healthcare broadly is an area that we're still very interested in. We think that's a great market for us, and we aim to win in that market. And I would say, typically, what we've set our minds to, we do. It sometimes takes us longer than we would like. You certainly saw that in GCS, but we get there. And we ended up persevering, and we are going to have a great healthcare business. So, those are areas we're looking at.","In terms of Energy, we've said we don't want to be dramatically bigger than we are in Energy. We've said that for a while. But with that, where there are promising properties or new technologies that we think we can develop into promising annuity streams, we'll do it. We just announced one late last year, a Canadian technology that we bought for that very reason because the Energy team, I think, has a very good vision of how to drive that technology into an annuity stream that helps customers and helps us.","So, that's how we look at it. Right now, the market, there are deals going down for prices that honestly we wouldn't pay. And we're going to remain disciplined. We did before. We did the Nalco deal after the froth was over, and let me try to be smart stewards of shareholder money as we go forward.","Hamzah Mazari - CRT Capital Group LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. So, you just answered my M&A question. So, moving to pest and equipment, is the 9% top line growth something that you are looking at going forward and will eventually \u2013 and if you could give us a feel for the timing, will we see that kind of a growth rate on healthcare?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, I would say we expect \u2013 I would say it's probably better to count on upper-single digits in our Other segment. We do think that's quite real, quite sustainable. They'll pop into double-digit land on some occasional quarters, and they'll be a little lower on some quarters just because of what happens at times. But, yeah, we think the pest and even the Equipment Care business have a long road at high-single digit type growth and may be typically popping even over our 6% to 8% kind of target.","Healthcare, ultimately, I think is the same type of business. I think it \u2013 our aim is to get that business, probably combine with life sciences to be upper-single digit business on an organic basis. Obviously, we may have additional M&A activity in that business and that would push it above that for periods of time.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Do you need the M&A, Doug, in order to get to that 6% to 8% growth target? Or can you do it on your own, the way the business is right now?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I don't \u2013 no, we don't believe we're missing something fundamental preventing us from doing it. And I think when you look at a lot of the underneath economics, that business is getting better and I think that team is on it and starting to get traction on the areas they need to get on and after, kind of the place where we have a unique difference, can own and protect and build, and that business is growing very handily and becoming a larger piece of that portfolio, which is what has to happen for you to see the big numbers out of that business. So, no, we don't need anything, but that doesn't mean if there's an attractive property or technology, we would be open to it just as we are in the other businesses.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Evans with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Doug, a quick question on Energy. Does the shift to these easier oil plays that you cited earlier, does that challenge your return to your prior Energy earnings levels?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the shift is somewhat temporary and mostly notable in saving the shale play and everything else. And if anything, it's a gain that runs out. So, in this very tough economic environment, what folks have done is basically gone to focus on the wells that are easiest to extract and cheapest to extract. That's how they're keeping cash flow going to pay their bills and hopefully survive until the price recovers. And when price recovers and demand needs to be met because you've got a lot of capital that's been pulled out of that business, they're going to have to go back to the other wells. And so, the shift is inevitable. You can't meet the demand for oil next year with just easy oil. So, I mean, this will happen. And so, then you will see the natural cadence occur in this business again.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Appreciate the answer. And then, staying with Energy just for another one. Could you just bridge me the 15% sales decline to the 42% EBIT in terms of maybe volume price?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, I don't have, like, the bridge in front of me. It's, look, in that and almost any business, when you have significant deleveraging in a business, you have almost this immediate significant impact on OI because there's no time to take out overhead. And I wouldn't anyway because a lot of this is just seasonally. So, you get under-absorption in the plants that just immediately, instead of going into inventory, hits your OI line. I mean, this is just basic P&L stuff, but 15% is a significant volume hit. We've been under pressure there.","We did not build inventory. We're trying to be disciplined on inventory and the other stuff, so we took it on the chin. Last year, if you recall, we were building inventory year-on-year in Energy because it took us a while to turn off the spigot in reaction to the market. So, you've got even probably more outsized year-on-year impact from absorption than you would under normal times.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got you. So this was just the volumes. No impact from any pricing decline.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, but in line with what I talked and not materially different from the other quarters.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you. Can you just comment on your recent new business launches within the water segment in terms of recent growth contribution? And also, any color on the cadence of the potential ramps for the new platforms which you mentioned for the second half of the year?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry. Can you repeat the second half of the question?","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Just any color on the cadence of the potential ramps of the new platforms, which you've mentioned in your release for the second half of the year?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So in the water business, I mean, we have continued expansion drive of our 3D TRASAR units, which continues to go well and move. We've also launched Solids, we've talked about, for the light side of the business. Let me just turn on to my page where we've got \u2013 so our expected revenue on new launches for water are going to be around $25 million to $30 million this year. They will build throughout the year. Typically, the way I would think about a launch, when we launch a program it typically takes five years for us to reach peak annual sales, so it's not this monster ramp-up. The technology also has legs, and we will often be selling technology for at least 10 years before we replace a platform or do other things.","And this certainly is obviously longer-lived technology than Apple probably talks about. So, in terms of expected sales from our cooling water product line around 3D TRASAR, we'll end up at $30 million ultimately this year, but our five-year expected sales out in 2020, 2021 would be around $100 million.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. That's helpful. And just very quickly, on the food and beverage side, you've mentioned penetrating your existing customers fairly well across your portfolio. One of the things you just actually just discussed, but you've also had some new business wins despite a tough environment. Can you just really quickly parse out what you believe are the Ecolab-specific trends here versus what you're seeing in the actual end market and how you're comping versus that? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well I mean, I believe our F&B business was up 4% in first quarter. And certainly, I don't think the food market, this is the heavily processed food, dairy market in particular is our focus in these markets. It includes protein and other areas, but those businesses are under pressure. And so, there's no doubt in my mind we're outperforming the market and the pressure comes in twofold. One, there are the consumer demand pressure as people move to different parts of the store to procure food. And second, there's been quite a bit of M&A activity in that market, which means ultimately they consolidate and take out manufacturing facilities, which reduces temporarily total opportunity for us.","Long term though, the drivers in F&B I think are in excellent shape. It's called population and food safety. And the population will grow around the world. The middle class will grow. Expectation for food quality will continue to increase, particularly in emerging markets. And food safety is only going to get more challenging. That's why there's a lot of conversation in the U.S. about local farming. Local farming is not going to feed 9 billion people, and it's also not by any means the most sustainable way to farm. What you're going to want to do is farm where stuff naturally grows. So, you're not going to see bananas growing in Manhattan anytime soon. It doesn't make any sense. It would be local, but it wouldn't be very sustainable. And so ultimately, I think you're going to still see long-distance shipping of food to, in particular, feed the Asian population growth. And long distance equals time, and time is the enemy of food safety.","And so if anything, we think the demands for food safety technology are going to grow faster than the food demand, which is ultimately going to be driven by the two components I talked about, population growth and middle-class expectation growth. So, I like our food and beverage business, new technology, team's on it. We're outperforming the market. I think that business gets better. And the water technology coupling we have is spot on for that business, and it's a huge way to leverage our installed base in F&B.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Doug, just to get a better feel for the Industrial segment, I'm curious, a nice couple hundred basis points fixed currency margin expansion year-over-year. You said volume gains, pricing, cost savings and lower product costs. I was just wondering, are those in order of magnitude, and how it spreads across the sub segments of the business? And then, lastly, what we should look for as we move through the year as what the bigger drivers are in the Industrial segment? Thanks so much.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's like an ingredient list. It's in order of magnitude. And so, what we've said is the one area, raw material benefits are expected to decline as the year moves on and possibly even move into slightly negative territory by year-end. But the balance of it, volume, pricing, cost savings are going to be tools that will remain in our quiver that we will use.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. And just across the sub segments, which may be the biggest drivers in Industrial?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You mean, which areas of those are going to be utilized? I don't \u2013 say it again?","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Just of the subcategories in your Industrial segment, which do you feel will drive the business overall through the balance of the year? Which of those.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think F&B and core water. I mean, core water is up 6%. It was mining that was down, and that business continues to strengthen. That's even with the pressure in steel and other areas. And so, China's tough, but there's always something going on in the world. But water we think continues to strengthen. They've got good innovation. They're on the new business. F&B is in solid shape. I mean, those are the large businesses in Industrial. Textile improved, had a pretty strong first quarter and we would expect to have a strong year as we go forward. So, it's pretty good I think across the segment. We're in pretty good shape.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Dolev with Nomura Asset Management. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Dolev - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to make clear that I understand. So, in late February, you spelled out 9% to 13% constant currency EPS growth. What is the constant currency EPS growth as of today for the year? What is the expectation in constant currency terms?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say at this point in time, we haven't really, as I said, reflected a change in currency and we haven't changed our range. So it wouldn't have changed.","Dan Dolev - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Got it. So, the math that I went through to get you to 6% to 10%, you're saying that's not the right math at this point?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, here's the thing. I guess, what we've said is if we snapped a line right now and froze all rates at the rate you see today and that was the end rate for the year, you're going to have $0.10 less currency headwind than we forecast in late February. But given all the stuff going on in the world, we don't think booking that at this point in time is wise. There's a lot of things that can change, including currency as the year goes on and there's just too much time remaining in the year in a very dynamic environment to go snap the line on one of multiple variables. So, what we've basically said is we have not changed our expected currency outcome for the year even though we recognize and admit that today's rates would indicate it's $0.10 better.","So, yeah, if you want to go do that math, but there's a lot of things going in here. We haven't increased our range either at this point in time. And I think as the year goes, we'll continue to try to be transparent in what our expectations are and what the underlying assumptions leading to our forecasted range. And from there, right, we're going to just watch multi-variable inputs and see how it all turns out, but I would expect to deliver on our range.","Dan Dolev - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Got it. Just one follow-up and more long-term reflective. The analysis that we did for our initiation work two years ago, we looked at your margin growth for the last few years, including and excluding the synergies, including \u2013 excluding all the synergies that you got from Nalco and Champion, which were a lot, you were probably getting 10 basis points to 15 basis points of margin growth per our math. In Q1, you got about 20 basis points. I assume there was some energy impact. Do you still stand behind that 20% margin? And how are you going to get there by 2020?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think when we launched the 20% margin, we did that at an investor conference. It was $20 million in sales, 20% margin \u2013 OI margin and 20% return on invested capital. I was very clear at that time that we weren't going to hit all three by 2020 because, if you did the math, it would imply much more than 15% EPS growth. And what we said is we believe all three are achievable, they're achievable within sight of 2020, but they weren't all going to occur by 2020. And that's still true. If you go to just the last two years, if 2016 expected FX hit, not a dime better, you've got 2015 and 2016, we'd lose $1.5 billion in sales in two years just from currency translation and over $250 million in OI.","I mean, that's what those rates mean. So, they chew up the bulk of the synergies you might have from one of those deals. With that, we continue to deliver positive EPS growth as we go through it. I will also say we also believe that translation FX, not transaction. Transaction FX, we never talk about. It's almost equal in size, but we think that's a real impact in the business that has to be dealt with because it's the equivalent of inflation basically. So, we don't talk about it. We only talk about translation because translation is sort of goofy. If I was headquartered in Munich last year, I would have been up 26% EPS with everything happening exactly the same except I'm consolidating into euro, not into dollars.","Our business isn't any better. Our share is not any better. Our margins aren't any better. Nothing's better except I translate into a more favorable currency. And so, this stuff flips back and forth. So, our margin improvement, yeah, I think is real. At fixed currency, it was more like 60%, not 20%, and we expect to have continued fixed margin growth year in, year out. And one year, it's going to look like 200% because currency is going to go in our favor, and I will tell you it's still only 60% because really you got to look at this the way the margin's really coming, country by country and currency by currency. That's the way we ultimately realize it over any period of time that matters to a corporation, right. So, that's how we look at it.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Thank you, Mr. Monahan, you may now begin.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's Second Quarter Conference Call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO.","[Technical Difficulty] (1:03-1:07)","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","...on the conference call. Hello? Did we lose it?","Operator","You're still connected, Mr. Monahan. Please go ahead.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","Okay. Sorry. We've got an odd dial tone.","All right. A discussion of our results, along with earnings release and the slides referencing our quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor. Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with a brief overview of the quarter, continued attractive new account gains and new product introductions drove strong acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales growth in our Global, Institutional, Industrial and Other segments during the second quarter, nearly offsetting a decline in Energy sales. New business and ongoing cost efficiency work led the adjusted fixed currency operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the impact of soft economies, challenging end markets and continued currency headwinds. These, along with lower taxes and shares outstanding, drove the 7% adjusted earnings per share increase before currency translation.","While Energy segment results have been challenging, we believe that recent trends suggest the bottoming of our energy cycle, and we expect second half Energy segment sequential results to reflect that stabilization. We look for the market recovery to begin gradually and take hold in 2017 and improve through 2018 and 2019, and for the Energy segment to show results reflecting that market improvement.","Looking to the third quarter, we expect our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments to continue to show further strong acquisition adjusted fixed currency growth outpacing their markets in soft international economies as they leverage investments we have made to further improve sales and service force effectiveness and profitability and more than offset lower year-on-year results from our Energy business. We look for the third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the $1.24 to $1.32 range, with that range including approximately $0.08 per share or 6% of unfavorable impact from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation, and currency translation as we continue to aggressively drive business growth.","For the full year, the Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments are expected to continue to show strong acquisition adjusted fixed currency growth. Energy year-on-year sales comparisons should improve versus the first half and for the full year are expected to decline around 10% versus the last year.","We continue to expect to outperform our markets in 2016 while also investing in the key drivers for future sustainable above-average earnings growth. We expect our consolidated results to show improving comparisons in the second half and have narrowed our forecast for adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2016 to the $4.35 to $4.50 range from $4.35 to $4.55, which includes expected currency headwinds of $0.27 to $0.32 per share of which $0.17 per share is from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation.","Moving to some highlights from the quarter, and as discussed in our press release, reported second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.87. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, second quarter 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.08 and included $0.08 or 7% currency headwinds. This compared with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.08 a year ago. The adjusted diluted earnings per share growth was driven by delivered product and other cost savings, cost efficiencies and lower taxes and shares which offset investments in the business and higher variable compensation.","Our consolidated acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales were modestly lower as our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments grew 4%, but were offset by lower Energy sales.","Regional sales growth was led by Latin America and Europe. Reported operating margins declined 50 basis points. Adjusted fixed currency operating margins expanded 30 basis points as delivered product and other cost savings and cost efficiencies offset investments in the business, higher variable compensation and lower Energy results.","In 2016's difficult environment, we are focused on driving new business gains by helping customers lower costs. We are using our industry-leading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve the best results and the lowest operating costs, and through these, aggressively drive new account gains across all of our segments.","We expect third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share in the $1.24 to $1.32 range, reflecting a combined Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation impact and currency translation drag of approximately $0.08 or 6%.","Consolidated results are expected to improve with the second half outperforming the first half. We narrowed our full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share forecast to the $4.35 to $4.50 per share range from $4.35 to $4.55. This forecast includes expected unfavorable currency exchange in the $0.27 to $0.32 per share range of which $0.17 per share is from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation.","In summary, despite a very challenging global economic and market environment, we expect to continue to deliver solid fundamental results in 2016. We remain confident in our business, our markets and our people, as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years.","And now, here's Doug Baker with some comments.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Thank you, Mike. Hello, everybody. Just a couple of thoughts on the quarter and the second half of the year. So, Q2 results were solid, particularly given the environment. So, adjusted EPS was flat versus last year, but plus 7% excluding currency. And if you look at operating cash flow, it was up 37% versus last year for the first half.","So, these results are driven by continued strong performance, as Mike just went through, in our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments. Those segments combined had a 6.5% top line growth, 4% organic. Our Energy segment is stabilizing. If you look at Q2 sales and OI, they're very much in line with Q1, with sales off about $5 million but OI is stronger in Q2.","Importantly, if you look at underlying metrics, what we call our leading indicators, both our new business and innovation metrics remained strong. We believe it will strengthen throughout the year. We expect a strong second half as a result; so that will be driven again by continued strong Industrial, Institutional and Other performances.","We will see a lessening Energy and FX headwinds we are forecasting in the second half. Energy is really driven principally by an easier base because last year we have seen more of the drop in the second half than the first, so the base is just simpler to compare against. FX is our forecast, but really we're annualizing against last year's big second half move, and we predict that FX will be close to neutral, modest negative in the fourth quarter, but obviously coming out and being more neutral going into 2017.","Last thing, I guess, I would highlight is a real callout to our team who I think is doing a great, great job in a very tough environment. We remain focused on what we can control, we're getting after new business, we're driving innovation, we're taking care of customers. We're doing a terrific job there. We continue to invest in the future. We're managing the business the right way, particularly around cash flow metrics and working capital, and we're are also continuing to focus on delivering in the short term while doing all of these.","So I'm very proud of the team and proud of the performance. And importantly, happy to be moving into the second half where we're starting to see a little less of a headwind that we've seen in the last six quarters.","So with that, now let me turn it back over to Mike to introduce Q&A.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","Thank you, Doug. That concludes our formal remarks. Operator, please begin the question-and-answer period.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one brief follow-up question per caller, so that others will have a chance to participate. Our first question is from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah, I wondered, Doug, just talk a little bit on the charge in the Energy business this quarter, was that just kind of a little bit of cleanup there in that business with a few more head count reductions and the inventory adjustment or do you see there being a little bit more to come? It seems like that could be an additional sign that you're also really seeing the bottom there.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, well, Nate, yeah, I would say, our view is that we have bottomed or are bottoming in an Energy segment. As a consequence, we felt it was a good time for us to analyze what assets were actually going to be useful or not useful, given the change in the Energy business. So, we chose the timing based on our belief that we are at the bottom and starting to move into an inflection point, though as I've said before, coming out angle is going to be a lot lower than the coming in angle. So, it's not going to be an equal recovery. It's going to take more time to get out.","But it's basically looking at our inventory situation, we had made product which made a lot of sense in the previous environment, i.e., guar replacements and the like, and given the drop-off in the guar market, they don't make sense anymore. And so, that would be an example of the type of inventory that we disposed of. Simply, it made a lot of sense two years ago; doesn't make a lot of sense in this environment.","And likewise in some of the capital, it could have been some fleet assets or some mixing vessels, et cetera, that just aren't going to be productive going forward, and so we felt it was the right thing to do to take these off the balance sheet. So, really the timing was as you said, and we do believe that this represents the \"re-look\" at the assets as a consequence of the change in the energy market. We don't believe there is more to come, but also it's hard to predict the future. But that was the idea.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then second, in terms of a follow-up question, obviously you continue to see that nice gross margin expansion. I know part of that is due to the lower raw materials and part of that is due to just ongoing internal initiatives. I was wondering if you could kind of give us a little bit of flavor for the two buckets, and then what to expect here going forward as we probably lose a little bit of that benefit on the raw materials side?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, similar to where we stood at the end of the first quarter, we are still forecasting a modest increase in raw material prices in the fourth quarter. And that's still our view. I would say, the likelihood of that has lessened and not increased as time's gone on, but that's still the forecast. I would say, our ability to drive gross profit isn't solely dependent on raw materials. Obviously, it's pricing, timing and volume. And we believe we'll be able to manage through any raw material rise that we're likely to experience just as we've successfully managed through 2004, 2009, 2010 and 2013, 2014, et cetera.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your questions.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Congratulations on the execution. First question, within Global Institutional, some very healthy organic growth there. Can you talk about some of the derivative constituent parts, how it's trending, lodging, QSR, restaurants, anything you can give us around price versus share? And then, I have a follow-up. Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, most of the growth in both specialty and institutional businesses is volume driven. You have exceptions like Latin America where you just have high inflation where we're going after and getting significant price because it's a must, given the environment. In terms of underlying business performance, we've never had a one-to-one on foot traffic and we're watching some of the same foot traffic reports that probably everybody else is. I would say broadly in the full-service restaurant area, foot traffic has been soft for literally seven years or eight years, so it hasn't been our principal driver. It's really our ability to drive share based on our technology's capability of lowering costs for our customers. And that's going to remain, we think, in the forefront of how we're going to continue to drive share.","And (15:31-15:35) to make sure that we're focusing on what our customer needs are, expanding with them as they expand geographically, and seeking out new QSR customers, particularly outside of the U.S. as they emerge in different markets. And all of those strategies continue to work. We think that both Institutional and Specialty will continue to perform well throughout the balance of the year.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And as a follow-up, making a comment on your equity investment in Aquatech in the water space. Can you talk about the broader capital deployment? Are we likely to see more smaller venture type or emerging growth type investments, or how does that landscape look to you folks for the balance of the year? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I would say Aquatech is somewhat unique. More frequently, we're buying companies as opposed to making equity investments in companies. Here it made sense to make the type of investment we're making given the matching capabilities of what we are looking to try to do, we thought it was a wise way to proceed. I would say in the M&A front generally, I'm quite comfortable that if you take some kind of midpoint of a range around 3% of sales that, without doing anything outsized, there's enough attractive targets out there to continue to add approximately 3% to the sales line. I think you're seeing that through announcements like Anios and other smaller announcements this year.","In terms of appetite, it's not that we don't have an appetite for a bigger deal. I think we'd be in a position to do one both on the balance sheet and I would say, most importantly, internally with management capacity and capability. But that's really going to be determined by mutual interest coming to a place where economically it makes sense. And these things, you have to be a little more patient around. So I would expect more smaller deals in the near-term.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, guys. If I could follow-up on that last one. I think historically over the long-term prior to big deals you talked about adding a couple percent from lock-on M&A, but typically not a lot of profits in the first year and then that ramp thereafter. Is that still the right way to think about it? And I guess as part two of that, I guess we're getting closer to year in on Swisher. How is that looking specifically from a profitability perspective?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, when we did the \u2013 so I'll answer the last question first. Swisher. Swisher is more or less on plan and as we predicted at the time we bought it we said the first four quarters of ownership would be likely negative. Obviously we bought that asset at a pretty low price. It was at a low price for a reason. It didn't make any money. It was likely losing money. And we wanted to turn that around over time because we're quite sensitive. We want to remain in control of keeping the volume and the customers happy. So I would say that's progressing and we'll start seeing positive out of Swisher either Q4 of this year or Q1 next year. So no different.","I'd say I think your formulaic statement around; we get the sales first and the profit next. I think it's more true than not. It's field-dependent. We \u2013 the metric we pay most attention to is return when we're doing deals, not accretion dilution. Swisher would be a good example of that. Dilutive the first year, but a hell of a return if we're able to execute on it and we think we will be able to. That's how we like to focus on doing deals. And so we're just not as sensitive to first-year profitability on these as long as we think the return's going to be great.","Now we're not against first-year profitability either, but often it will come hand-in-hand. So I think that's how I think about it. But if you do a series of these year-in, year-out, it sort of takes care of itself because you build up a number of annuity streams and you're making money on the deal over any reasonable period of time","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. And then the follow-up. Obviously interest rates have come down a lot since the Brexit situation. And I guess it seems to me you're likely to face another pension headwind next year if rates stay where they are. Is it too early to get a sense of the size of what that could be, or should we think of the average of the last couple of years when it was at $0.10 or $0.20 headwind? Is that possible? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","It's a math formula. So if you drew a line right now and said, this is the interest rate, it'd be $0.04 to $0.05 negative next year in that range. So like 1%. I don't think it's going to swamp the boat. I'd rather have a point favorable, but that's the type of impact you'd be looking at.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Hi. This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. I just wanted an update on how the market dynamics have shifted, particularly in Europe and the U.S. if anything's changed at all?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, U.S., I would say isn't much different than we expected this year. We never have high expectations. We always go into these years thinking that growth is going be more similar in the past couple years \u2013 and there's no magic second-half inflection point \u2013 seems to be regularly forecast but rarely realized. So U.S., we haven't seen a huge change. I think there is a bit of a consumer spend hiccup in April, May but that seems to have evened out a bit. In terms of Europe, I don't know that \u2013 I would say the more \u2013 the bigger impact in the near-term has been around \u2013 from terrorism, not British exit. And I think British exit may well indeed have significant impact on Europe in total. I guess it's too early to recognize that at this point in time.","But terrorism certainly, where it's hit, though, obviously, the Turkish tourism business is way off for two reasons: their challenges with Russia, which seem to be clearing up. Russian tourists were one of their main draws and that dried up, but obviously the terroristic activity throughout that country has had a dampening effect on people's desire to go visit. And likewise in parts of Europe, you've seen the same impact.","With that said, I still think we're going to have positive sales growth this year in Europe. We continue to drive share. Our share anywhere in the world is not anywhere near what we would call max capability. And so what we focus on is taking care of our customers, keeping them and driving share. And we still believe we are more in charge than not of driving top line.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then my second question is just with the vitality index, I think the bogey is like 35%. Are you at or near that or a little above, a little below? Just a color there, please.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, we're right around 30%. And the 35%, it's a little different by business unit. I think on average now, we'd say it's around 33%. So we're just under our target.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Sure. Can you compare the overall new business sold in the first half of 2016 versus first half 2015?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, I think we are plus \u2013 I think we're off a couple points year-on-year versus where we were last year, which isn't unusual. But we're basically running at the same elevated rate.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","And then as a follow-up, on the energy charge, can you sort of size what percentage of head count was taken out or give some way of thinking about the SG&A benefits from that charge on a go-forward basis?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, David, if this is wrong, we'll come back and correct. I think what this was, was the number \u2013 probably 4% to 5% of head count in the company is what it represented roughly.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Got it. Thank you very much","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, thank you. I just wanted to ask again about the energy recovery in the second half. Is that just more of an easier comps issue? Or \u2013 and just curious with oil trading back lower and maybe building some cushion in for the year, just curious, and maybe if you could give us some color on the different parts of that energy breakout and what are you expecting in each?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, we expect continued softness, clearly, in the WellChem business, in particular. OFC less so, but still soft and downstream continuing to grow in the second half, even modestly better than the first half growth. Some of that is just year-on-year timing as well. But mostly, Manav, what this is, is easier comps. There is a minor benefit from \u2013 there's some seasonality. We are not anticipating or expecting any upturn in energy market activity in the second half from really first half levels.","We do believe that you continue to have the correction that we've been seeing in terms of supply and demand in the overall oil market. That continues to narrow which we believe is the metric to watch more so than price. Price has seasonal components to it too. We believe that we are likely to see softening of price as the summer ended. It was predicted by many in the industry. I know many are acting surprised, but that was a common prediction and so we still think that the key metrics are supply and demand. They are narrowing. That's what's going to drive correction and price over any period of time, but we don't see any real activity recovery until 2017.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. And just to touch on the Anios deal I guess, if I said that correctly, the healthcare deal, but just some \u2013 the strategy there, is that more of the typical tuck-in that you do? Or what should we expect in the healthcare area?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, I mean healthcare remains obviously one of our real focus areas, and our healthcare business in the second quarter had 4% sales so we're seeing the recovery and improvement that we've been talking about in that business, and we anticipate a better second half in that business even before we close on Anios.","So the Anios business and the rationale is, one, it's in very similar businesses, has some excellent technology which we can leverage throughout the other geographic parts of our business. It's a great geographic footprint match with our current European business, i.e. where they're strong, we're almost non-existent and vice versa, so it's an almost ideal puzzle piece from that standpoint. And then the Anios brand is a strong brand, and we see it as a great way to go drive penetration in markets that may not be large enough for us to build our own locally focused healthcare organization, but still develop a very strong distributor-base strategy leveraging a very strong global brand name like Anios. So that's the basics of that deal.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey, Doug, just in a kind of a general question here. Outside of the Energy business, your other businesses are growing 4% organic. Given the overall global environment and market that we're in, does that feel like the right way to think about this going forward? Or you feel that there's levers to really accelerate the items from 4% to 5% to 6% in the current environment? And then potentially \u2013 excluding energy is kind of a wild card here?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, I think the 4% is a bit understated versus what the actual performance is. Yes. If you said the global environment is going to be static here because you've got a number of industries which are going through major contractions as a consequence of change in economic environment, specifically primary metals, steel, et cetera, which are big water technology consumers for us, have been contracting. That's got a half-life. They've stopped contracting. While they may not rebuild, you do run into year-on-year base.","Mining is obviously going through a major shift, and so you've got these \u2013 mining was down 10%. We've got some large pieces of our heavy water business down double-digits as well. That stuff will moderate over time even if the economy doesn't improve from here. So I really think much of our business is growing call it more like around the 5% zone. I don't think that's an unusual expectation or an unrealistic expectation in a modest-growth economy, which we're in globally. So I would probably pin it around there. I think it's going to take a better economy to get us firmly in the 6% to 8% over an extended period of time, and we're welcome to prove that out if the economic gods would benefit us with a better economy.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then as a follow-up, can you talk a little bit about healthcare and just the expectation for it to get better in the second half? We've seen a number of times where healthcare has kind of spiked up and then come back down. I guess you could call them head fakes or however you want to refer to them, but what gives you the confidence that we're actually going to see some consistent improvement?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, I think last year would probably be the only head fake I really know about and the head fake last year was called a recall, which feeds into this year's confidence that we're going to have a much stronger second half than the first because you're going against the recall base, which we talked obviously about last year in both our third and fourth quarter call. But if you look at the fundamentals in that business, we're having more success than we've ever had in terms of selling new customers on our programs. That's the fundamental that we look at and why we're bullish on this business.","So we got a good team, much better execution, the work that we did when we \"put the business in the shop\" I think is really paying off, and the team execution is quite strong right now. That's really the bullishness","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Doug, on Energy in terms of pricing. Did pricing declines accelerate at all this quarter or have they been stable at these levels?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, they've been fairly stable. I mean, I think we're in our peak decline, if you will, sort of the culmination of pricing moves taken last year and pricing moves taken this year in the third quarter. It's modestly different than what we've experienced in the second quarter, and then we expect it to start improving from there. So we're right around the bottom of the price impact, as well, too.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And I noticed earlier for 2017, but at current oil prices I guess you would say you could grow earnings in energy next year. Can you describe maybe how and how much, perhaps, as an early read for 2017?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, it is early. So I would have to ask you a number of other questions about what assumptions you've got for the market. If they're this assumption which is that you do see modest oil price recovery next year where it's \u2013 or let's call it $50, $55 for a continued period of time which is what we believe and you start seeing a very modest pickup in activity in 2017, we think that we'll see modest growth which we talked about previously. Call it mid-single-digits and in that scenario, just the volume leverage, overhead coverage leverage alone you would see sizable improvement in operating income from that business. That would \u2013 we do not believe next year is going to be a price recovery year simply because typically it's probably going to have to move into 2018 before we see substantial price recovery. The price recovery alone isn't needed to see improved margins or improved profits.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. I wanted to just build on the prior question. Doug, you mentioned that there's \u2013 the businesses may be understating its growth because of some of the headwinds and hopefully, heavy water. Where are we on those heavy water industries? You mentioned steel and mining that are dragging. Are those comps bottoming? Clearly the comment on energy, I just don't know about these other quantities.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, I think we believe mining; we come out of it fourth quarter or first quarter. We are annualizing against kind of the significant change that occurred in that market. Likewise, I would also say in heavy water the segments are under pressure there. It would be around the same timing. There's some in Q4, some in Q1, but call it end of the year","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. And then just \u2013 it was interesting to hear the comments that your consolidated overall revenue growth was driven by Latin America and Europe. It seems a little bit idiosyncratic with some of the global economies. Can you just talk about what was driving that? Was it your sales execution or are you seeing better fundamental trends in some of those markets than you are in the more mature North America market?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, our sales in North America ex-energy were clearly stronger than Europe. Substantially. I would say Energy's impact, negative impact, was principally North American story. So that's really the North American perspective. Europe, I think the Europe team's been doing an outstanding job and since last year when we started getting some sales traction they've been on the fundamentals that drive it, which is new business and innovation, and they're doing a good job executing it in spite of obviously a less-than-robust economy.","Latin America, we've got very modest volume growth in Latin America but a very strong pricing impacts, which is I said earlier were and are critical given the high inflation in those markets which is really driven by their currency devaluation. So they import a lot of technology and a lot of raw materials, and those raws cost more in those markets as a consequence of their currency moves and we had to get pricing to negate that and we are. So that's \u2013 I guess, the perspective I have on those regions. So L.A. we continue to get modest market share gains with significant pricing gains.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please go ahead with your questions.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Good afternoon. A couple of questions, if I may. First of all, can you talk a little bit about what's going on in the Food and Beverage market? We've seen growth there over the first six months or so, a little bit slower than it's been in the past. Are you anniversary-ing some of the share gains you've gotten, or is the overall market a little bit lighter in terms of demand? Can you just give us a little bit more view on what's going on and what you expect to go on there in the second half of the year?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, I guess second half we would expect F&B to be equal or a little better than you've seen in the first half. And as 4% probably moving into the 5% range is sort of the range that we're talking about. I'd say F&B continues to perform well. It's got pretty even execution around the globe. But you've seen a lot of consolidation, particularly in the North American market as there's been real pressure on a number of processed food companies, there's been a number of large acquisitions, both executed and considered. And so when two big companies get together they tend to drive synergies, which means fewer plants and what we would like is more food produced in more plants.","That's not exactly how our customers view it, so they like more food produced in less plants and as a result we've got to go work through those things. But we've been doing this off and on, this goes in cycles. We're just going through another one, and this too has an end. But at the end of the day we continue to drive share in that business. We've got great new technologies coming out, particularly in the antimicrobial areas. So I'm quite bullish about F&B's near-term future and long-term future.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, Doug. And then as a follow-up, I think you mentioned that you expect some raw material inflation in the back half of the year. Can you talk a little bit about sort of where you see that coming from, whether it's petrochemical side or non-petrochemical side of the equation, or \u2013 I'm just \u2013 I'm not seeing a lot of sort of raw material pressure, so I'm just wondering where you're seeing them.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, we see some of it in the caustic area and have already seen some. But also our forecast is a bit asymmetrical, i.e. no real pickup in activity, not significant price change in the oil market, yet we do have forecast some petrochemical raw materials increasing. But you need this in a forecast because I promise you maybe that's conservative. I promise other things that we think are conservative are going to prove to be not conservative, and so it's just what's in our forecast today as we go forward, and as I mentioned earlier I would say the likelihood of that increase is less now than it was a quarter ago but we'll see. We've remained with that in our forecast.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks. Wanted to ask another question just on the energy front, just on maybe the pace or trajectory of recovery. You mentioned, Doug, that you didn't think it would be the same angle of recovery as the angle of decline. Then you also mentioned you expected a sizable improvement in operating income, even with a mid-single-digit top line improvement next year. When you say sizable, I think the consensus number for EBIT growth next year in energy is around 20%, 25%. Is that the type of growth you think we should be baking in or is that aggressive?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, one, I would say \u2013 I don't want to get pinned down on exactly what we think energy EBIT growth will be next year, simply because we are just initiating our planning cycle as we go through and taking a view on what we believe raws are going to do next year as well as the market and everything else. So if you would, we'll give more transparency into that expectation as the year goes on. But right now, it seems to be \u2013 it's just too early for us to do that in good conscience because our odds of being a right are even smaller than they will be in December.","Now with that said, when you have volume degradation in a business, particularly after X, you just see a lot of margin chewed up because you no longer are getting coverage. And so you will see, I think a march back on OI that is different on sales, simply because as you get some nominal volume coverage, it starts rebuilding overhead coverage.","And you also get out of cutting inventories and back into even building inventories. And so, this thing is always a little bit pro-cyclical on how you have to manage inventories and everything else. It accentuates the negative, and probably in a small way, accentuates the positive when you get out of it.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. Thank you. And then, just was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the higher variable comp that you saw. You called it out in both the Industrial and Institutional segments, is that a headwind that we should expect to kind of continue at this pace into the second half? Or was there maybe some catch-up that happened during Q2 that makes the Q2 margin hit a little bit worse than we should expect going forward?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I mean fundamentally, it's bonus rebuild. We had given ourselves purposely an extremely challenging target last year, knowing it's going to be a difficult year. Our philosophy is always shareholders get paid first, management second. It was a tough year last. There is some, right now, on forecast required bonus rebuild year-on-year. That's what you're seeing. It's at its worst in the second quarter, but you will still see some in the third quarter and fourth quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your questions.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Doug, I was wondering if you could give us a little more on Laboratoires Anios. For example, what kind of growth rate did they have in the past several years? And then looking at your own healthcare growing at 4%, what do you think they could do as a combined entity?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah \u2013 no, they were growing mid-single digits, it's what they've been growing regularly for a long period of time. I think two things. As I mentioned when I talked about the rationale for buying a geographic footprint but also this opportunity it prevents that they couldn't fully capitalize on without us, i.e., this expansion geographically. And we didn't have the product line and even some of the registrations that they do to accelerate it without them.","And so, this is one of those opportunities that is occurring because we're joining forces, i.e., how do you get out and aggressively exploit the opportunity Anios has geographically outside of Europe. And we think it's significant, given our existing footprint or ability to do this quickly because we already have legal entities, capability to manage billing, people, and all the rest in all these markets. We can turn on a dime to do this, whereas obviously, it would be much more difficult for them.","So, that's some of the unique growth opportunities it presents. There's also technology they have that we think will feed our other geographies and vice versa. So, we believe there's a lot of compatibilities and synergies on the top line as well.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","So, when you look at this, they are 5%, you are 4%. Then, is it fair to say that by 2018, giving you a year to start getting those two things together, we could approach that 6% to 8% top line growth?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, I'd be disappointed if we weren't there maybe even sooner. So, we expect our healthcare business to be upper single-digit organic growth business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Doug, I wanted to ask on the Energy, the ascent out of the trough here. I know in the early days of the decline, maybe before it was as deep or maybe as long, as it's turned out, you guys thought you would get pricing back pretty quickly across your product line, maybe concede some in the short run to retain the volumes, but able to push prices later. I know in your comments a minute ago you mentioned seeing some price hikes for your Energy service business. Can you talk about whether that rate of improvement is different given the longer recovery that you've talked about?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, no, Bob. I think, I wouldn't expect \u2013 what I'm talking about in terms of \u2013 we think third quarter is probably our peak pain in terms of pricing year-on-year. We're still going to have negative pricing for a few quarters after that before you start annualizing against the price concessions that we've made in the industry. But we don't expect that we're going to have price increases, and I'm talking broadly. Will there be one exception? I'm sure there will be. But broadly in the energy market in 2017, we think that's more likely a 2018 and 2019 story as that market heals, recovers, and activity levels have to ramp up significantly in those years to fill in the hole that's been created by the capital that's been yanked out of this industry.","And so, we really think it takes that kind of accelerated activity to create an environment where you're going to see pricing. Others in this industry have talked about getting pricing sooner, but I would say, they're in parts of the industry where they've had much more dramatic price decreases than we have. Remember, we're talking in total on average, several percentage points, not 15% and 20% type reductions. And so, they're in a very different situation, and frankly probably have to get pricing to be healthy enough to continue to operate in those industries.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. Thanks. And then, second question, is there going to be any sort of blip from Olympic space gains in South American business, or is it just really not material?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","We go through this every four years. We tend to do a lot of the Olympic business too. Historically, you may see a blip in that country, but it doesn't seem to manifest itself in the total numbers. So, I don't think so. I certainly wouldn't bet on it. I will say this, we have, as a consequence of the Zika virus issue, legitimate concern comes up with new mosquito programs, et cetera, which we are selling and providing to customers in Latin America and now increasingly in the Southern part of the U.S.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you very much. You hit on this a little, but within water, you highlighted that mining was still down double digits but regionally LatAm was strong along with Europe, with APAC and North America little weak. I just had two quick questions. First, can you just parse out some of the key regional trends here and kind of what's driving that and then comment when you expect to lap the comps in mining? And two, were there any changes or whatsoever throughout the quarter within heavy industry, and what would be your updated outlook here? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. No. I would say, one, and I'm going from memory here, that mining, in particular, pressure is \u2013 China and North America is the major pressure. And in other markets, its continued to perform well, including in Australia, which has real mining pressure broadly, but through technologies and others, we continue to do decently.","Mining was negative 17% the first quarter, minus 10% this quarter, probably going to see a similar result in the third quarter, improved result in the fourth quarter. And I think you come out of it \u2013 and are probably in a position where you can grow that business again in 2017. Heavy, the pressure there is primary metals in particular, and it's growing, but very modestly, and I think that's what we're going to see in the second half. You're not going to see a significant upturn, but we do believe we'll see one early in 2017, as you start annualizing against some of the pain in that business and start moving forward.","In the light side of water, so water heavy and light combined were up about 4% in this quarter, light continues to be very strong upper single-digit organic growth. We see that continuing. That's the largest of the businesses, and it's really got very strong momentum. We've reemphasized that, put new technology in there. And we're very, very pleased with what's going on in the light water business.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's great color. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. You guys mentioned new product introduction drove market share gains, and just curious how the R&D budget looks, the new initiatives that you have coming out? So I guess, Doug, the question is what kind of impact in the current quarter and will you see going forward from new product development?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, our R&D budget \u2013 and GAAP has us only reporting on that that's really focused on kind of our traditional chemistry R&D and the like, continues to stay at about the same percentage of sales, but as sales has grown, the R&D budget would be expected to continue to grow. The other area that really is R&D for us is our fuel technology and our customer connection technology, which is also in large part driven both by (52:36) group and our Chief Technology Officer. That area has gotten significant increased investment and will continue to do so.","If you look at our combined technology and R&D budget, it's up significantly this year versus last year. Last year was up versus the prior year. We have not blinked in terms of making long-term investments in our business. We have not taken any dollar off the table there. We want to continue to manage this business wisely, which means make your long-term investments. January comes every year. We're working to go manage our cash flow and working capital intelligently which means take it out of the business even when it had adverse impacts in your quarterly results because when you reduce inventory, you reduce PLOH, overhead coverage but it's important that we get inventory down, and we've been driving it down. I think we're $200 million-plus in terms of reduced working capital year-on-year first half versus second half, so that's an important metric for us to continue to drive.","We want to make sure that we not only deliver very, very good EPS numbers but very good cash flow numbers as well because at the end of the day, that's what drives shareholder value. So, those are our focus areas. So, R&D will continue to get its investment. I don't care how bad the economy is.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. And then I can \u2013 probably could guess what the answer, but you now have a bit tighter of a guidance range for the back half of the year. I'm curious just, is it simply economy forex oil prices or is there more to what might be the swing factors to put you at the higher or lower end of that range? Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","I don't know. I think you covered the big three. And I don't think it's really oil price, to be honest, unless unnaturally craters. I think it's really continuing to watch the oil demand and supply gap. If it continues to narrow, then you're going to see a recovery in the industry in terms of activity, and if it doesn't, you won't. So, that's what we pay attention to in FX. Who knows?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Doug, one quick question. Energy clearly has been problematic, but as you look into 2017, looking at the rest of the portfolio, like any other areas there that concern you at all?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Oh, well. Yeah, I mean, we spend all our day looking for stuff to be concerned with. And of course, we're in 172 countries, so there's plenty of materials to seek out. I would say though on a broad basis, no, I think our businesses are in good shape in terms of competitive position, innovation pipeline, team health and the like. I think they should continue to perform as they've performed in recent years. They're going to have unique challenges to deal with every year, just as we've had in the past. I guess \u2013 everybody's guess is it may be raw materials last year, but I think we've proven that we can successfully manage through that, given what we've done in the last, call it, 10 plus years.","So, I would say I don't think there's any real standouts. I think it's key to stay nimble. This environment's very hard to predict. We want to make sure that we can react to both opportunities and challenges quickly and get after them, and make sure that we maintain our focus on fundamentals while dealing with whatever the challenge and\/or opportunity is du jour (56:29).

Sir, you may begin.","Michael Monahan","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's fourth quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO.","A copy of our earnings release and the accompanying slides referenced in this teleconference are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor.  Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on Slide 2, stating this teleconference and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed on the section of our most recent Form 10-Q under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our fourth quarter earnings release and on Slide 2. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","In addition, as mentioned on Slide 2 of this conference call, does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities. Also, please note that in order to provide a meaningful comparison of our operating performance, where applicable, actual results for the fourth quarter of 2012 are compared against pro forma results for the fourth quarter of 2011. The pro forma results are based on the historical consolidated financial statements of Ecolab and Nalco and were prepared to illustrate the effects of our merger with Nalco. These pro forma statements are available on our website at ecolab.com\/investor, as well as our Form 8-K filed April 27, 2012, and selected portions are contained in our slides and press release.","Starting with an overview in Slide 3. We delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, despite continuing economic headwinds and higher delivered product cost. We leveraged improved sales volume, pricing, our synergy and cost efficiency work to produce our 10th year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth out of the last 11.","Looking ahead, we expect to continue to outperform our markets and show double-digit earnings gains in the first quarter and the full year. And solid sales growth, appropriate pricing, innovation, synergies and margin leverage more than offset increased delivered product costs.","Moving to some highlights from the fourth quarter and as discussed in our press release, reported fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.77. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, fourth quarter 2012 earnings per share increased 27% to $0.89. The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by volume and pricing gains, new products and new accounts, which along with synergies and cost savings actions, more than offset higher delivered product cost.","We enjoyed strong gains in Global Energy, Latin America and our worldwide Kay operations. We continue to be aggressive focusing on top line growth. We are emphasizing our innovative product and service strengths to help customers get better results and lower costs. And through these, drive new account acquisition across all of our customer segments. We also continue to implement appropriate price increases to help offset higher delivered product costs in investments in our business. We remain focused on expanding our margins, emphasizing productivity and efficiency improvements to help increase profitability, as well as drive merger synergies.","We also continue to make investments in key growth businesses to sustain our technology and sales and service leadership positions. Our work to integrate Nalco and Ecolab have gone very well. One year into the merger, we are delivering on or ahead of plan on our cost and growth synergy targets.","Our agreement to acquire Champion Technologies, announced October 12, continues under review by the Department of Justice. We remain in active discussions with them and believe we are nearing a resolution and still expect to close in the first quarter, but have nothing further to report at this time.","While economic trends present ongoing challenges, we continue to look for the first quarter to show further sales gains and margin improvement. First quarter adjusted EPS is expected to increase 12% to 20% to the $0.56 to $0.60 range in compare against adjusted EPS of $0.50 as business growth and the increasing benefits from synergies and cost reductions more than offset soft economies, the higher delivered product and pension cost, the sale of Vehicle Care in comparison against a strong quarter last year.","We continue to expect full year 2013 adjusted earnings per share, excluding expected Champion accretion, in the range of $3.38 to $3.48, representing 13% to 17% base growth with Champion accretion improving on that.","In summary, we expect the first quarter to show another solid, double-digit earnings growth performance by Ecolab as we also make the key investments to drive superior results this year, as well as in the years ahead.","Slide 4 shows our fourth quarter results, both as reported and pro forma, with adjustments for special gains and charges, while Slide 5 shows our sales growth detail.","Ecolab's reported consolidated sales for the fourth quarter increased 65%. When compared with fourth quarter 2011 adjusted pro forma sales, which include the impact of Nalco in both years, Ecolab's fixed currency sales rose 7%.","Looking at the pro forma of growth components, volume and mix increased 5%, pricing rose 2%, acquisitions and divestitures did not have a significant impact, and currency decreased sales by 1%; rounding accounts for the remaining difference.","Reported sales for the U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing operations rose 2%. Adjusted for the transfer of water treatment-related businesses to the Global Water segment, U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing sales increased 5%.","Institutional sales grew 5% in the fourth quarter. Sales initiatives of targeting new accounts and effective product and service programs continue to lead our results, outperforming mixed end markets. Lodging room demand continues to show modest growth while foodservice foot traffic remained soft. To drive our growth and improve on our industry leadership, we remain focused on new products that deliver increased value and reduce labor, water and energy cost for our customers in our warewashing, laundry and housekeeping markets.","Programs we launched in 2012, like our next-generation warewashing platform called Apex2, have gained traction and have been well received in the marketplace. In the fourth quarter, we launched a new hard surface cleaning system for facilities managers. We also continued to increase our customer focus and service intimacy through sales force investments, simplified structures, national and local marketing initiatives and continued investment in field technology to help drive efficiency and service, as well as better align sales efforts.","Though Institutional will face a tough comparison against a strong sales period in first quarter 2012, we expect our new sales initiatives and product innovation will enable Institutional to show steady sales improvement in the first quarter and better gains throughout the year as it once again significantly outperforms its markets in 2013.","Kay's fourth quarter sales increased 12%. Quick Service sales enjoyed strong growth in the quarter from both large and small customers. The Food retail business grew at strong double-digit rates benefiting from several new customer additions. We look for continued good sales growth in the first quarter and another solid performance for Kay in 2013.","Healthcare sales increased 4% as good gains in our patient temperature management business led results, benefiting in part as guidelines for patient management during surgical procedures gained greater acceptance. Healthcare's growth also benefited from our environmental hygiene and surgical barrier solutions for hospitals that help prevent the transmission of hospital-acquired infections. These more than offset continued softness in the overall U.S. Healthcare market.","Looking ahead, first quarter sales are expected to show better growth as account gains, along with new products to be launched this year, will help drive sales and offset the challenging Healthcare environment.","Food & Beverage sales grew 2%. Good gains in the dairy and food offset beverage or lower beverage and protein sales.","Our market focus on improved customer penetration, along with our drive to provide Total Plant Assurance, offering comprehensive plant-wide Cleaning & Sanitizing, water treatment, wastewater and Pest Elimination solutions has enabled us to win new business and focus and -- pardon me, and offset slow conditions in the beverage and protein markets. When combined with our innovative products and our focus on lowering customer energy and water usage, we expect to see similar sales trends in the first quarter with better trends developing in the second half.","Sales for U.S. Other Services rose 3% in the fourth quarter. Pest Elimination sales continue to show good trends, rising 3%. Growth was led by stronger gains in food processing and healthcare, improved results in foodservice segments and robust growth in add-on service sales.","We continue to drive new product and program solutions to better meet our customer needs and differentiate our offerings. Programs launched in 2012 like the Expanded Large Fly Program and the new HotelProtect program with bed bug assurance offering have shown good results. We expect our new products and programs, along with aggressive selling and improved service levels, to yield continued good sales gains in 2013.","Sales for GCS increased 5% in the quarter. New account wins helped to drive strong growth in service revenues, which were partially offset by soft parts sales resulting from a system change which is now complete. We continue to see good results from chain account relationships as we drive sales through their regional and franchise organizations. We expect GCS to continue to show improved results in the first quarter as we expect continued good service trends and improved parts sales to benefit results.","Measured in fixed currencies, sales for International Cleaning, Sanitizing and Other Services increased 3%. Adjusted for the transfer of water treatment to the Global Water segment, fixed currency sales increased 5%.","Europe, Middle East and Africa fixed currency sales rose 3% in the fourth quarter. Europe's Institutional fourth quarter sales declined versus last year. New business gains among regional and local customers leveraged new products, but were more than offset by soft market trends and continuing weak demand in the South.","First quarter sales will also be lower than last year as the timing of distributor shipments and onetime sales last year, combined with soft end markets, impact the first quarter comparison.","Food & Beverage sales rose modestly over last year reflecting market share gains, a focus on corporate accounts and the cost-savings benefits of our innovative products. These worked to offset lower customer volumes.","Textile Care sales rose modestly in the fourth quarter. New account wins, new products and technology like lower temperature washing, more than offset soft market trends. These should also benefit 2013 along with a focus on improved account profitability that includes additional pricing and culling unprofitable accounts.","Healthcare sales have showed solid organic growth in Europe led by new account gains and new products. Pest Europe sales showed good growth due to a continued focus on corporate accounts, new programs and operational improvements. Our work to improve operational efficiency in our Europe business continues to show good progress. We are further leveraging our shared services facility, transferring more work to Eastern Europe and offshoring. We also continue to consolidate facilities and improve procurement savings.","We delivered more than 200 basis points of structural margin improvement in 2012, though the weak economy and raw material increases in Europe offset about half of those gains and operating income. As a result, EMEA's operating income margins increased by 110 basis points in 2012. We continue to expect EMEA's operating margins to improve to the low teens over the coming years, rising at around 100 basis points per year as the current economic challenges faced by Europe slow the pace of our progress.","For 2013, we expect further substantial gains with margins expected to rise around 100 basis points as a result of our actions. Looking ahead, we expect Europe's first quarter to show flat fixed currency sales with strong profit improvement as it outperforms the continuing weak European business environment.","Asia-Pacific sales grew 6% in fixed currencies. Better trends in China, along with strong growth in other emerging markets, served to offset slower growth in mature countries. Institutional sales showed solid sales growth, led by good account gains in fast-growing markets and by new product sales. Pest Elimination sales benefited from increased product penetration and account gains.","Looking ahead, Asia-Pacific expects continued solid sales growth in the first quarter of 2013.","Fourth quarter sales for Ecolab's Canadian operations increased 5% at fixed currency rates. Growth in the core businesses drove the solid results.","Latin America reported continued strong double-digit fixed currency sales gains, up 19%. Adjusted for the Brazil Pest and Institutional acquisitions, Latin America grew 14% in fixed currencies as Institutional, Food & Beverage and Pest Elimination continue to grow at double-digit rates despite some slowing in Latin American markets.","Fixed currency Global Water sales increased 3% in the fourth quarter compared with 2011 pro forma results. Good growth in Food & Beverage, Primary Metals, power and manufacturing were offset by a lower sales in mining. Regionally, we saw moderate growth in Asia, Latin America and North America. Europe grew modestly, reflecting the continued challenging economic conditions in that region. We continue to drive market penetration with innovative solutions to optimize water usage through technologies including 3D TRASAR for cooling towers, new commercial solutions for water recycling and reuse and applications for wastewater. We expect global water sales to be flat in the first quarter as gains in the Americas are offset by difficult markets and operating conditions in mining and Asia.","Fourth quarter 2012 fixed currency global sales for paper increased 1%. Strong growth in Latin America and moderate growth in Asia and Europe was led by the use of innovative technology and was partially offset by the strategic reduction in low margin business and lower customer plant utilization rates in North America. We expect first quarter paper sales will decline modestly as the paper market shows continued weakness, primarily in North America.","Measured in fixed currencies, pro forma energy sales grew 18%. The quarter reflected strong volume growth in upstream and market share gains in downstream. Strong double-digit growth in our upstream business was a result of healthy market conditions, share gains and a continued focus on higher growth energy sources. We saw a very strong growth in deepwater and shale accounts, continued momentum in oil sands, as well as strong activity in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Downstream business growth reflected share gains in Asia and Latin America.","We expect 2013 base Energy segment growth, excluding the impact of Champion, to run above our long-term expected trend of 10% to 12% sales growth, driven by shale, continued strength in the deepwater and oil sands business and steady growth in downstream. But the pace will moderate from 2012's fast pace to closer to their long-term trend. We look for our first quarter 2013 sales to reflect this moderation, as well as reflect the comparison to a very strong quarter last year when sales rose 29%. Net, we expect first quarter Energy sales to rise in the upper single digits, excluding the impact from Champion, with much stronger organic sales growth in the following quarters.","Slide 6 of our presentation shows selected income statements comparing reported 2012 with pro forma 2011 information to allow more meaningful comparisons.","Fourth quarter gross margins were 46%. Adjusted for special charges, fourth quarter gross margins were 46.4%. When compared with fourth quarter 2011 adjusted pro forma results, 2012 gross margins continue to expand, increasing 80 basis points. The adjusted gross margin improvement primarily reflected the benefits of the volume and pricing gains, as well as merger synergies and cost efficiencies, which more than offset higher delivered product cost and the business mix impact of higher energy sales.","Reported SG&A expenses represented 31.9% of fourth quarter sales. When compared with 2011 adjusted pro forma results, the 2012 SG&A expense ratio also continued to improve and declined 210 basis points. Leverage from the sales gains and cost-savings efforts, including merger synergies and Europe restructuring savings, led the improvement.","Reported operating income for Ecolab's U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing segment rose 17%. Adjusted for the transfer of water treatment to the Global Water segment, operating income increased 15% with margins up 190 basis points when compared with fourth quarter 2011 pro forma operating income. Volume and pricing gains and cost synergies efficiencies led the increase.","Operating income for U.S. Other Services declined 7%, as good results from Pests were offset by field investments, including EcoSure, and the completion in GCS of the parts distribution change.","International fixed currency operating income increased 32% versus last year. Adjusted for the transfer of water treatment business to the Global Water segment, operating income increased 35%, with EMEA operating income up 48%.","International margins improved 300 basis points, as pricing and volume gains and our Europe margin transformation efforts more than offset higher delivered product costs. Global Water operating income grew 37% in fixed currencies compared to pro forma results. Margins expanded 310 basis points, as pricing, volume gains and cost synergies led the increase versus a soft period last year before pricing actions began to benefit results.","Global Paper operating income increased 72% in fixed currencies, which compared against depressed results and an unusually large bad debt last year. Excluding bad debt, operating income rose 57%. Pricing, synergies and the elimination of low-margin business drove the increase. Similar to water, these results compared with the weak period last year before pricing actions began to benefit results.","Global Energy operating income grew 49% in fixed currencies. Margins expanded 350 basis points, led by the strong volume gain, operating leverage, pricing and synergies, which more than offset delivered product costs, investments in the business in comparison to last year, which included a sharp run up in raw material costs. We expect Energy's first quarter operating income will be similar to the prior year, reflecting the first quarter's lower volume growth, significant field investments and the business mix. We expect double-digit growth in the remainder of the year.","The Corporate segment and tax rate are discussed in the press release. Reflecting the pending Champion transaction, we did not repurchase any shares during the fourth quarter. The net of this performance is that Ecolab reported fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.77 compared with $0.34 reported a year ago. When adjusted for special gains and charges and discrete tax items in both years, adjusted earnings increased 27% to $0.89 when compared with $0.70 earned a year ago.","Turning to Slide 7. Ecolab's balance sheet reflected the impact of the Nalco merger. Total debt to total capital was 52% at December 31 compared with 57% reported a year ago. Our net debt to total capital is 47%. The large cash portion -- position reflects cash related to the pending Champion purchase.","Looking ahead, as outlined in Slide 8, we continue to take aggressive actions to drive both our top and bottom lines, expanding our market share and customer penetration among major accounts, leveraging our leadership positions in key growth markets in food, water, energy and healthcare, as we worked to offset continued generally soft global conditions. We expect to show margin expansion again in the first quarter, driven by sales growth, innovation, pricing, merger synergies and better operating efficiencies. And we expect to deliver on these aggressive goals while building growth for the future.","As also described in our press release, we look for our first quarter results to show moderate pro forma sales gains as underlying growth remains good, but as our Energy business compares against strong prior year results. We expect that Energy will return to double-digit growth in the second quarter. However, we expect this first quarter comparison will result in approximately a $0.03 negative impact on first quarter EPS along with a previously mentioned impact from lower interest rates on our pension plan and the absence of Vehicle Care that will, together, cost an additional $0.03 per share in the first quarter of 2013.","Despite these very substantial headwinds, many of which have an outsized impact on our seasonally smallest quarter, we still expect adjusted first quarter 2013 diluted earnings per share to increase 12% to 20% to the $0.56 to $0.60 range compared with the adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 earned last year. We look for continued double-digit growth over the balance of the year and expect full year 2013 adjusted earnings per share, excluding the expected Champion accretion, in the range of $3.38 to $3.48, representing a 13% to 17% base growth with Champion accretion improving upon that.","As an update regarding our pending Champion acquisition, we received clearances from all required countries except the U.S. As mentioned earlier, we remain engaged and active in ongoing discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding its review. We believe that we are nearing resolution of their issues and expect to close within the first quarter. We hope to have more information soon.","We continue to expect that Champion acquisitions will be $0.50 accretive to 2016 and help us to build a stronger Energy business and a stronger Ecolab with better growth opportunities to achieve continued, consistent, predictable, above-average growth.","We also want to let you know that consistent with our change to the Global business management structure, we'll begin reporting segment sales and operating income on a global basis for the Cleaning & Sanitizing businesses, including Institutional, Food & Beverage, Kay, Healthcare and Pest Elimination as outlined in Slide 9 beginning in the first quarter 2013. This will be on the same basis as water, paper and energy are currently reported, and we will present all of our businesses on the same global basis. This will not affect Ecolab's previously reported consolidated operating income or EPS, and we will issue annual and quarterly restated information prior to the first quarter release so you can see how this change will look in prior years.","In summary, we once again delivered on our forecast in the fourth quarter while offsetting higher delivered product costs in the weaker economy while still investing in our future. We look for sales and profit growth to continue to show double-digit growth in 2013's first quarter and full year as we drive to produce yet another strong year and build for our future.","And now, here's Doug Baker with a few comments on the quarter.","Douglas M. Baker","Just a couple of thoughts. First of all, Q4, I guess you would have to describe as a very good end to a very good year. First, we successfully drove integration all year, delivered $75 million in synergies as forecast. We had a lot of the heavy lifting behind us, reorganizations, relocations, comp and benefit changes and we feel good about that because while doing that, we continued to do a very good job driving the underlying business.","So last year, our underlying business continued to perform very well. We had record new net corporate account business gains. We had very good customer retention metrics. Sales grew, and margins expanded in virtually every business. Europe was a huge net plus, particularly in the fourth quarter, up a reported 310 basis points. But if we adjust for what we consider onetime, it's still over 250 basis point improvement year-on-year.  And Energy, as we all know, had an amazing year.","So we exit in good shape, and we expect another very good year in 2013. The formula is going to be quite familiar, i.e., new business plus new innovation plus synergies are all designed to overcome what we consider still continued lousy markets. We expect 13% to 17% EPS growth next year to adjusted EPS growth. And again, a strong Energy performance in the low to mid-teen growth while top and bottom line for the year is going to be one of the key drivers, but also solid performance from all of our businesses, which is exactly what we realized last year. Here, more in the single-digit growth, but expanding margins to drive great leverage.","All of the above continues to exclude the impact of Champion. We do expect Champion to close in the first quarter. And after it closes, we will then come back with our expected accretion impact from Champion for the year. But we'll wait until we close.","So those are my opening thoughts. I'm going to pass it over to Mike to start Q&A.","Michael Monahan","Operator, would you please begin the Q&A process?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question does come from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Energy. Can you maybe give a little more color on the Q1 headwinds impacting earnings, and how they will reverse or be less in the back half of the year?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. The simple answer is we had 29% growth in Q1 of last year. So it's really mostly a story of the base and a comparison with the base. And really our expectation is -- so we even talked about that 29% as abnormal last year and not to expect that to continue in the second, third and fourth quarter of 2012. And we said expect high teens, which is exactly what we ended up delivering. This year, it is more low- to mid-teens expectation, but the first quarter, because of the comparison, is just going to be lower. However, if you start doing 2-year growth rates and everything else, it's going to be continued very good news, and we expect good things. That business is in very good shape.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Doug, just on Europe, is this Q4 result a real turn in the business that you've been looking, waiting for?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I think we always knew -- we did a little over 100 basis points last year improvement year-on-year in margin. That follows the 65 basis points in '11. So cumulative, we're up about 175 basis points for the 2 years. That's below the projection we made when we announced the Renaissance restructure January of '11. However, we also didn't predict the Europe crisis and all the rest. So yes, I think it is a clear sign that the programs we've implemented are making headway. That in spite of the sluggish economies, we're reporting sales growth, i.e., modest, a couple of points. But that couple points generated very sizable OI returns and growth as a result of the Renaissance work that we did. And so as Mike talked in his earlier comments, we expect another 100 basis point improvement this year, and we still see, in total, 1,000 basis points over the life of this program. It's just going to take more years to get as a result of the Europe crisis than it would have if we had a \"more normal\" European economic situation, but we feel great about it.","Operator","Next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Wanted to talk a little bit on the pricing on the raw material upfront, Doug. Obviously, you got a little bit of relief heading into the end of the year relative to the big pressures that you saw at the beginning of the year. Obviously, still getting","a little pressure in the first quarter. What gives you the confidence looking out through the year that, again, you catch back up and that those raw material prices kind of abate?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, look you never -- I would say here's how we're treating it. Our best estimate is that it abates in the second half of the year. That's what we think is going to happen. Our plans assume that it won't happen. So we are out aggressively going after pricing and doing all the things that we know we need to do to make sure that we continue to manage the situation until it shows itself to be as benign as we forecast. So you have -- what you're going to do and you have what's your forecast, we try not to let the forecast influence us unduly. So my guess is it abates. If I'm wrong, we're still going to have it covered. If I'm right, I think we'll be even happier.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow up back on the kind of Europe front. You talked about your customer retention being pretty strong last year, which is obviously evident in the decent good performance there. How are you seeing the customer retention in Europe, particularly the pressures that everyone is facing, and given that you're still considered a premium-type product?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Well, we've done well in Europe. Frankly, all over the world, in terms of retention this year across our major businesses. I would say while our products are priced premium, we generally prove to be the lowest in-use cost because of the savings that we deliver in water, energy and the rest. And the longer people are with us, the more they understand the economic benefits of our programs. So we have historically been good at retaining customers, and I would say that's continuing. And we're having good success continuing to generate new customers. And you have to in this environment, because underneath the covers, if you will, we all know there's real softness in the economy. And so our version of same-store sales aren't going to be enough to drive the type of growth that we expect from ourselves.","Operator","Next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess following up on that last point. Diversey was out recently mentioning a large North American hospitality customer win that they implied was from you. I wondered if you'd comment on that. Or if not, on that, just more broadly, how do you see, with them better capitalized and we hear hiring sales people in the marketplace again. How do you see them as a competitor? Has it changed much?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I guess, Gary, to answer, we have always had a great deal of respect for Diversey. The best way for us to show the respect is to likewise be a very aggressive competitor. We don't plan to change that. I would say in all cases, we track wins and losses against every major competitor that we have in all the businesses that we're in to a competitor. We had substantially more gains than losses last year. That would include Diversey. And that includes the victory that they're touting. We tend not to get into a account by account. I think we've learned over the years that if you're going to talk about your wins, you probably should talk about all your losses too. And there's a million accounts that we handle over a year, I think at the end, we're going to work to drive performance. We feel good about how we're doing that, and we feel good about the momentum we have.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Great, and then a follow-up. Just can you give us an update on how you're feeling about potential revenue synergies from Nalco? I know you weren't expecting a whole lot this past year, but is that on track? Any wins or any commentary you can give on how that's looking.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. So externally, we had a very low target called 0. Internally, we had a little more ambitious target, and I would say we are handily ahead of our internal target. We've had more early success than I think we forecast and like the prospects going forward. So when we announced the merger, we talked about $0.5 billion by 2016 in growth synergies, and we still believe that's very achievable.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMC.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Could you talk about the conditions in the global water business in Asia, whether your business is growing or contracting, and what are the factors at work?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. It's growing. Didn't grow every quarter all year, but improved steadily throughout the year. And I guess that's how we view it. That some of the pressures on the water business, particularly in paper, occurred in Asia first. And we see Asia coming out of it in many cases led by China. So I guess, we view that as a positive story as we move forward. But of course, it varies by end market. You've got more pressure where you might expect, mining and some of the others which we addressed in the upfront comments. But the water business, we expect to continue to grow next year and to continue to have very good OI performance.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So when that business was part of Nalco, it used to rack up years where it would grow 20%. What are the factors that have slowed that rate of growth down? And what do you see as a more normal growth rate for the Asian water business?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Well, it grew quite quickly in 2011 as well. I mean, I don't -- if we're talking Asia, Jeff, in particular, because that's where the water business was growing quite quickly. It wasn't growing 20% globally. And we expect that the Asian business has capability to do that again. I don't think it's news that China, in particular, which was the major fuel for that growth, hit -- let's call it a major speed bump, in its industrial production in 2012. So certainly, that had a real impact. And China is moving out. I think we talked about China improving in the second half as early as the second quarter, and we've seen steady improvement there. So we expect Asia to continue to be a very strong part of what's going to drive water growth long term.","Operator","The next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Just a couple of questions, if I may. First of all, the higher delivered cost that you keep talking about and you expect to see in 2013, is that raw materials related on the product side? Is it packaging? Is it more people, feet on the street? Is it higher gasoline cost? Is it all of the above? Can you sort of talk about what some of the drivers of your higher costs are?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. It's part propylene's gone up. I mean, I think we've talked through the years about what our raw material areas are. And it's not dramatically different than first quarter of last year, it's just moved up from fourth quarter of this year. And -- but we have other pressures. However, I would say my expectation -- since '04, we have seen fairly consistent raw material pressures in our business. We've expanded margin during that period of time, and all we're saying is we all know there's a little bit of lag when we see the pressure from raw materials. It typically has upfront, a little bit of compression impact on our margins. And then through pricing and other actions, we have shown that we've been able to overcome these pressures with time. All we're trying to do is say, we see a little pressure in the early part of the year, we're not saying that it's going to impact the year. We're forecasting 13% to 17% EPS growth.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Fair enough. Switching gears to the profitability of the other division in general and GCS specifically. Can you let us know what the profitability gain or loss for GCS was in the fourth quarter and what's your expectations are for 2013? And just an overall comment\/observation\/question, your other division's profitability has declined for the last couple of years on year-over-year basis. I understand that the Pest Elimination business had probably something to do with that. You're now talking about more staffing cost in that business. Sort of what's the outlook for 2013? Or perhaps the inflection point is going to happen later than that in that business.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I would say a couple things. So there's 3 businesses really in there. I mean, one's a part of Pest, and that's where the staffing increases occurred. It's in our audit side of the business. Pest has been improving steadily. We had a top line problem we said we had to address in 2012. Team did a very good job. They got top line momentum, now firmly in the mid-single digits and working on improving from there. That gives you enough room to start driving Pest profitability because we can get leverage on that type of growth. EcoSure, we've had to make investments throughout 2012. We'll start lapping them in the second half. But we expect EcoSure profits to improve next year. And in GCS, we had a loss in the fourth quarter, but it was fairly small. And the GCS business has continued to improve year-on-year. I would expect that to continue. So for that segment, I would say that we expect it to be accretive, i.e., to drive OI increase in '13 versus '12 and not be down.","Operator","The next question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","Alina Khaykin ","This is actually Alina Khaykin sitting in for John. Quick question on the Champion acquisition. Can you talk about what's holding up the DOJ and where their real sticking point is?","Douglas M. Baker","No, I can't. What I guess I can say is, we continue to expect to be able to close in the first quarter, and we continue to expect this to be a very, very good deal for us.","Alina Khaykin ","Okay. And then also when just thinking about headcount for 2013 versus 2012 globally, how are you thinking about maybe adding sales force on a global basis?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, this year, organically, we're up just north of 1%. But part of that is because we had opportunities when we were merging the water businesses, et cetera. Next year, we'd probably be a little north of that in terms of expanding sales force a couple percent is what I would expect.","Operator","Next question comes from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing, which didn't have a project Renaissance. Saw operating margin expand by 180 basis points for the full year. What are sort of the -- if there are any things that you'd like to call out that were helping drive that other than just revenue leverage in that segment?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, first of all, the way synergies were applied to the businesses, they impacted all segments to one degree or another, because basically a lot of the synergy effort was on shared G&A and corporate cost as we discussed early. That was first year's  pressure, as well as purchasing. Purchasing, again, we had shared raw material suppliers, it's going to affect all businesses. So we are up in total for the business about 160 basis points, not just -- I'm talking about for the corporation year-on-year, if you do pro forma margin increase at OI level, then about 60 of that would be from synergies and 100 would be from, what I would call, just normal efforts. So these normal efforts apply to many businesses, but they apply in particular to U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing. [indiscernible] has been doing a great job in innovation in driving new platforms in both warewashing, now in laundry. These command substantially more price per pound or kilo than the products that they're replacing, but they deliver 3x to 4x, if you will, in the premium in terms of value to customers in energy and water reduction. So those are great margin enhancers as we continue to drive them. We continue to be on pricing because we continue to see raw material pressure. So that needs to be a constant push. And then of course, they work on field productivity and we've rolled out technology over the years that we've discussed in the field, which enables our field to spend less time on paperwork, more time selling, which means they can handle a few more accounts than they could pre-technology.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then just curious, because I know you plan on finishing off the share repurchase authority. I think it's about 280 million or so, are you waiting to do that until after the Champion acquisition closes? And would that be something that happens relatively quickly or would you sort of measure that out over the course of the year?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. We would and need to wait until after the Champion business closes. Part of the Champion deal includes stock. And it would be, I think -- I can't commit to an exact timetable, but once the Champion deal's closed, we have the ability to restart share repurchase.","Operator","The next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Rob Walker in for Lawrence. I guess, first on international. Given the strong Q4 margins, what are your expectations for 2013 for that segment margins?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, we already discussed Europe where we expect Europe margins increase by another 100 basis points. That's by far and away the biggest part of the segment. Latin America and Asia-Pacific margins will also improve as we improve, if you will, scale there. Sales volume will translate into margin improvement, because it's over pretty much a fix in existing infrastructure base. So we would expect those margins to continue to improve, mainly driven by Europe.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And in terms of cash flow, what are your expectations for 2013 in terms of CapEx, working capital, pension funding? And I guess, should we assume cash restructuring charges of around $100 million or so?","Michael Monahan","Rob, this is Mike. We're looking for free cash flow to about equal net income again in 2013. We haven't given a formal CapEx forecast. We were around $600 million in 2012. That will probably be the same ratio to sales going forward, maybe a little -- around the same ratio to sales.","Operator","Next question comes from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","A couple of questions for you. First, on Food & Beverage, you've had a couple of weak revenue quarters there. Is that mostly market weakness or are you seeing some competitive pressures there? And maybe if you could talk about how you're responding to that weakness in an area that we've kind of come to expect above market growth rates.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. No, we feel very good about our prospects with our Food & Beverage business. A couple of things. I mean, there's been some softness in the protein segment which has been widely reported. But at the end of the day, it's really just timing of when new businesses come on both in the base and coming on in the current year. We expect that business to be mid single-digit performer going forward, continuing to drive very good OI leverage.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And while you're speaking about timing, Doug, I know the Kay business can be somewhat lumpy. Just looking at the strength in Q4, was that more of a normal period or did we kind of see an up lump that might be unusually strong? And was also hoping you could talk about what you're seeing on the food retail side. It sounded like that was not significantly stronger than what you were seeing in QSR.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. The Kay business is, I'd say, performing very well. I think it has since we acquired it. And it's driven by new business, no doubt about it. We've had new business on both the QSR side and the food retail side. Food retail side has had outsized new business gains. Prospects there look good. But it will always be, I guess, lumpy in the sense of lumpy growth rate. But it just grows faster in some periods than others. It's -- and I don't want to start characterizing this as cyclical at all because it's never shrunk that I know of in any quarter. It just keeps building on its past success, and we see plenty of runway for that business to continue to do that.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Okay. And then the last one's just on the Global Paper business. Can you talk, in a little greater detail, about the strength you're seeing in the margins there, how sustainable that might be? And specifically around this elimination of low margin business, what was -- can you quantify the sales drag associated with that? Kind of what customers -- what kind of customers are they, and how much further you have to go in those low-margin elimination efforts?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I would say we're mostly through the paring  low-margin customers, and it was in -- wasn't in a single part of the paper industry. We really -- we do this regularly. We look at the top and worst contracts that we have. We determine how we're going to fix them. What do we need to do? In some cases, you have to exit them, particularly. And we really judge a contract based on its gross profit, not necessarily on its operating income. And simply, if you have a lousy gross profit, it's unfixable even with volume or growth of the customer over time. And so we've done some of that work. I think the paper team has managed in a difficult environment very well. They had a very strong year in terms of profit. The drag, I guess, I would simply say, it certainly impacted the business, but it's not like we would have chest pounding results in the top line if we hadn't undergone this. That business has been impacted by the economy. We will expect it to improve through 2013, but in either case, we expect it to have another strong year in terms of OI.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Ritzenthaler with Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Great. My first question is around the Global Energy segment, and you'd called out a couple of pockets of particularly strength, Latin America, Middle East, Asia. We've heard that from a couple of others that participate in the space. Is there an aspect of Nalco that is a beneficiary of exposure in those regions? And is there a competitive -- any sort of competitive response that you need to make to ensure that, that continues in '13?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I would say, one, several years ago, that business made a strategic move to go after, if you will, the new oil and the new finds. And much of those during that period were in emerging markets or Africa, Latin America, et cetera, Russia. And that move proved to be very wise. So we have a good position there. It's a position that's been building, not shrinking. We have very, very high retention rates in that business. And to sustain the business over the long term, we've got to continue to do what's gotten that business to where it is: Be the innovation leader, continue to be aggressive in terms of going after new business as it comes on and continue to hold onto it. I would say the business lends itself to high retention if you continue to do a good job because there's high risk in changing midstream. So once you're on a platform or you're on the oil field, you tend to keep that business as long as you perform. So there's nothing about this business we really don't like. We're going to continue to invest in it. Obviously, our move in Champion indicates that it's an area that we like quite a bit, mostly because it's a very similar model, much more so than I think we imagined the first day we started looking at this merger possibility, and we came to appreciate it through due diligence and have appreciated it more as we've owned it.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then on Latin America, I guess more broadly, is that -- should we be thinking about Latin America as kind of a high-single, low double-digit volume growth region as you look at the various businesses that are exposed there and as you continue to share gains? And I guess how much runway do you feel is left there? It seems like it's a multi-year kind of platform, but I think any other additional color you could give there would be helpful.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, no. I think the Latin America market has a lot of runway. So we consider that a double-digit growth opportunity for the foreseeable future. We have great opportunities in virtually every business we're in. I think we've got a very strong team in Latin America running that business. It's a team that's been enhanced recently with additional manpower in both management and now, in corporate accounts. So we like the Latin America business. I don't care if it's energy, water, Institutional, F&B, Kay, Healthcare even, but we've got plenty of opportunities.","Operator","Next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","Eric Petrie","This is Eric Petrie standing in for P.J. Just first on Healthcare, is that growing slower than your expectations? And are you looking into any bolt ons to bolster growth?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I would say the Healthcare business last year, as we annualized against some big acquisitions, it was double digit globally, single digits in the U.S. I think it was a 4% or 5% in the U.S. And we expect that business to continue to progress. I guess we expect more in the high single-digit type growth rate on a global basis. It's going to flip back and forth year-on-year between Europe, which is our other big platform for that business. But no, I would say we feel very good about the Healthcare business and its prospects, and we expect it to continue to be a major contributor.","Eric Petrie","Okay. And then how long do you expect the Nalco-related deal charges to continue? I know you called out $0.35 next year.","Douglas M. Baker","We're going to still have charges through 2014.","Eric Petrie","Any color on how to divide that $0.35 between like Champion, Nalco?","Douglas M. Baker","The $0.35 did not include -- well, I mean it's [indiscernible] of Champion. Did not include the Champion numbers. We'll give -- it'll include like the deal cost that we've swallowed to date on Champion, but none of the cost-related synergies, et cetera, in Champion.","Operator","Next question comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Angel Castillo Malpica - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This Angel Castillo on for Bob. He's actually tied up at our Ag Conference. But just -- most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to expand a little bit more on Latin America. You mentioned you've been pretty bullish on it. And today you mentioned you've been seeing some slowing in certain Latin American markets. I was wondering if you could expand a little bit more on that?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I think the reference really wasn't to our business per se. It was really to the underlying economic conditions, and Brazil would probably be the prime example, that there's been some slowing in Brazil. To date, we've been overcoming the slowdown, if you will, by very big successes with new accounts.","Angel Castillo Malpica - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just to kind of expand on that as well, just you said -- how much of that I guess would be market share versus pricing in Latin America in the growth and success you've had there?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Our pricing is, it depends by country, but obviously, we've got some very high inflation countries like Argentina, et cetera. In total, around that region, it's in the 3% to 4% range.","Operator","Next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to probe a little bit more in Europe. You guys are doing, I'd say, a pretty good job in terms of moving the margins up there. I was wondering, all things considered, are you seeing any stability in the end markets? In other words, have you seen the decline kind of abating over there? Can you just give us a little bit more color?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I would say steady would be a hard word to use in a sentence with Europe. So I would, I guess, describe Europe as, it's a very mixed story. But you've got -- I guess my expectation on Europe is going to be much more the same this year as last year. We do not see significant degradation, but you still see real softness in countries I think you would expect and particularly Italy, Greece, Spain and some of the other countries. And we expect to see that continue through this year. We think we will offset it, hence, our forecast of growth. Now, we did it last year. I think our plan is right, and we expect to have nominal growth again in 2013. But Europe, I don't think it'd be fair to call it steady-state right now.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the synergies at Nalco are primarily going to come through the Global Water unit, is that correct? In terms of the sale synergies, I'm talking.","Michael Monahan","What was that, Shlomo? We didn't catch it.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","The sales synergies that you're expecting through with Nalco, is that going be shown primarily in the Global Water unit or in the Food & Beverage area?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. [indiscernible] and part of it will be -- I think the new business activity with, call it new customers selling this program in an existing customer, principally going to hit water. We are seeing some F&B dragged into historic water accounts, which we'd also expect, they've got some food business that F&B did not -- had not yet penetrated the plant. In technology, I think you're going to see the technology plays in Energy, in Institutional and in water and F&B [indiscernible].","Operator","The next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Doug, when we talked about the paper in Asia, you mentioned it was rather weak but yet, there is quite a lot of growth in that particular industry in Asia with paper mills expanding or new ones coming on stream. Isn't Nalco participating in those?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, we participate in a number of them. But I would say a number of the greenfield openings were delayed 2 to 3 quarters, and those that were planned to open in the first half of '12 are now going to open in the first half of '13. So there were significant plant takedowns, greenfield delayed openings and the rest in the paper industry throughout Asia.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And if I could ask about Healthcare. What is the size of that business currently? And it seems to me as though it is not growing as you anticipated. Any help from insurance companies forcing hospitals to operate more -- in a more sanitizing fashion?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, the Healthcare business globally is $600 million and it grew a little over 10% last year, 8% organic. So I guess as a -- look, we have high expectations. Would I like more out of that business? Sure. And If I told you it grew at 15% in '12, I'd still say the same thing. But the business is performing quite well. And expanded margins had very significant OI improvement as well during that period. So we like the Healthcare business quite a bit. Still believe it's going to be -- and continue to be major contributor to the corporation's growth.","Michael Monahan","Okay, everyone. Well, thank you very much. That completes our call. So if you have any further questions, please give Lisa or I a call. Otherwise, have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference call.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Michael Monahan","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's Second Quarter Conference Call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO.","A copy of our earnings release and the accompanying slides referenced in this teleconference are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor.","Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on Slide 2, stating that this teleconference and the slides, including estimates of future performance, these are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our second quarter earnings release and on Slide 2. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with an overview on Slide 3, we delivered very strong earnings results in the second quarter, $0.01 above our forecasted range despite continuing economic headwinds. We leveraged improved sales volume growth, pricing and our synergy and cost efficiency work, as well as better-than-expected performance by our recent Champion acquisition and a lower tax rate to produce yet another double-digit increase in our adjusted earnings per share.","Looking ahead, we expect to continue to outperform our markets and show double-digit earnings gains again in the third quarter and the full year, as good sales growth, appropriate pricing, innovation, synergies and margin leverage, as well as acquisitions, more than offset investments in the business.","Moving to some highlights from the second quarter, and as discussed in our press release, reported second quarter earnings per share were $0.69. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, second quarter 2013 earnings per share increased an outstanding 19% to $0.86. The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by volume and pricing gains, new products and new accounts, synergies, cost savings actions and the Champion acquisition. We enjoyed double-digit acquisition adjusted gains in our Global Energy segment and strong growth in our Global Specialty business. These and other gains were leveraged by good margin expansion. Our newly-acquired Champion business also showed strong growth, and its outperformance versus our expectations led to EPS exceeding our forecast in the second quarter.","We continue to be aggressive, focusing on top line growth. We are emphasizing our innovative product and service strengths, as well as our range of solutions to help customers get better results at lower costs, and through these, drive new account acquisition across all of our customer segments. We also continue to implement appropriate price increases to help offset higher costs and investments in our business.","We remain focused on expanding our margins, emphasizing productivity and efficiency improvements to help increase profitability, as well as drive merger synergies. We also continue to make investments in key growth businesses to sustain our technology and sales and service leadership. We remain on target for our Nalco cost and growth synergy targets, and the Champion integration is underway and going well.","Looking ahead, while economic trends present ongoing challenges, we continue to look for the third quarter to show further attractive sales gains and strong margin improvement. Third quarter adjusted EPS is expected to increase 15% to 21% to the $1 to $1.05 range and compare against adjusted EPS of $0.87, as business growth and the benefits from synergies and cost reductions more than offset soft economies and business investments. We raised our earnings forecast for the full year 2013 and now expect them to be in a $3.48 to $3.56 range, representing 17% to 19% growth.","In summary, we expect the third quarter to show another strong double-digit earnings growth performance by Ecolab, as we also make key investments to drive superior results in this year, as well as for the years ahead.","Slide 4 shows our second quarter results, both as reported and with adjustments for special gains and charges, while Slide 5 shows sales growth detail. Ecolab's consolidated fixed currency sales for the second quarter increased 14%. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales rose 6%.","Looking at the growth components, volume and mix increased 4%, pricing rose 1%, acquisitions and divestitures were 8%, and currency was a negative 1%, rounding accounts for the difference in the total.","Reported fixed currency sales for the Global Industrial segment rose 4%. Adjusted for acquisitions, Global Industrial sales increased 3%. Reported fixed currency Global Food & Beverage sales increased 6%. Acquisition adjusted second quarter fixed currency sales grew 3%. Growth was led by beverage and brewing, dairy, food and agri, which more than offset modestly lower sales in the weak protein market. Regionally, we enjoyed strong results in Latin America, with moderate growth led by share gains in the other regions.","Global Food & Beverage continues to benefit from its Total Plant Assurance approach to customers, in which we combine our industry-leading Cleaning & Sanitizing, Water Treatment and Pest Elimination capabilities to deliver improved food safety results, lower operating costs and better product quality assurance for customers. This has enabled us to win key global customers and offset sluggish conditions in some of our regional markets. Looking ahead, we expect steady sales growth in the third quarter, and for the balance of the year, as we see further benefits from our innovation pipeline, better customer penetration and new business development.","Fixed currency Global Water sales increased 3% versus last year. Excluding the impact of mining and the de-emphasized businesses, Global Water sales to the heavy and light industry markets were up 5%. Gains were led by Asia Pacific and Latin America, with moderate growth in North America and slightly lower sales in EMEA. We continue to drive market penetration, with innovative solutions to optimize water usage using 3D TRASAR platform technologies, new commercial solutions for water recycling and reuse and applications for wastewater. We are focused on corporate account management, growth synergies, business capture, product innovation and continued market share gains to build growth, along with the ongoing work to improve the profitability of our account base. We expect Global Water sales to show a moderate sales increase in the third quarter, as continued growth in our core heavy and light markets is partially offset by unfavorable mining industry trends and our ongoing de-emphasis of nonstrategic business.","Fixed currency global sales for Paper increased 2%. Strong growth in Asia Pacific and solid gains in Latin America benefited from increased technology penetration and a return to more normal inventory levels. This growth was partially offset by a modest sales gain in EMEA, a modest decline in North America, resulting from continued low plant utilization. We expect third quarter Global Paper sales to rise moderately, led by Latin America and Asia Pacific, reflecting new business and technology penetration.","Fixed currency sales for the Global Institutional segment rose 3%. Fixed currency sales for the Global Institutional business rose -- 2% in the second quarter. Institutional's end markets continue to show mixed results, with modest growth in global lodging room demand and still challenging food service foot traffic across North America and Europe. Looking at regional sales trends, North America and Asia Pacific sales increased modestly, Europe declined modestly and Latin America continued to post strong sales growth.","Sales initiatives targeting new accounts in effective product and service programs continue to lead our results. To drive our future growth and improve on our industry leadership, we remain focused on executing global sales initiatives and on new products that deliver increased value and reduce labor, water and energy costs for customers in our restaurant, hospitality and long-term care markets.","Reflecting that innovation focus, we launched a new antimicrobial fruit and vegetable treatment in the second quarter, and it has been well received in the marketplace. We also continue to increase our customer focus and service intimacy on a global basis through sales force investments and talent development and in standardizing our global service protocols. We are also making further investments in field technology to help drive service efficiency and have better aligned our sales team efforts.","Longer term, our new Global Institutional structure will accelerate global deployment of our innovation and technology, which we expect will help improve growth by driving better market penetration and new account gains. We look for third quarter Global Institutional business sales to improve as the global sales initiatives progress, and continue aggressive efforts to outperform challenging markets, yield improving growth in the third quarter and over the balance of the year.","Second quarter sales for Global Specialty, which is comprised of KAY's global quick service, food retail and related businesses, grew 9% in fixed currencies. Global quick service sales increased mid-single digits, as we enjoyed steady growth from both large and small customers. New accounts, along with increased solutions for customers to drive operational efficiency and food safety, leveraged generally modest industry trends.","Regionally, Asia Pacific sales benefited from good quick service foot traffic growth, while the U.S. and Latin America recorded solid gains, and Europe saw modest growth. The food retail business showed double-digit sales growth in the quarter, benefiting from customer additions, new products and increased penetration. We look for similar good sales growth in the third quarter, as Global Specialty works to deliver another solid performance in 2013.","Fixed currency Global Healthcare sales decreased 1%, as soft U.S. and European healthcare markets continue to impact results. Good growth in temperature management was offset by lower instrument reprocessing product sales and the impact of exiting low-margin business. As part of our focus on account profitability, we also eliminated certain less profitable distributor programs, which resulted in shifting some distributor sales to later quarters. In total, these actions to improve long-term profitability hurt second quarter sales growth by about 3 percentage points.","To grow sales in this challenging environment, we have increased our focus on corporate accounts, raised our already-strong service levels and continue to strategically broaden our product lines. We expect Global Healthcare sales to show better results in the third quarter, as improved account gains in both North America and Europe, combined with the annualization of business we exited, lead to improved growth for the third quarter.","Reported fixed currency Energy segment sales grew 64%. As expected, acquisition adjusted Global Energy fixed currency sales returned to their lower double-digit growth trends in the second quarter, increasing 14%. Our upstream business saw a further double-digit growth in the second quarter, resulting from share gains and our continued focus on higher-growth energy production sources, including very strong growth in deepwater, shale and oil sands. The downstream business sales grew nicely, resulting from a pickup in North America refining and the strong market share gains.","As mentioned earlier, the Champion business enjoyed a strong performance in the quarter. The integration of the Energy and Champion businesses is going very well, and we are on plan with our integration targets. One result of this rapid and full integration of the businesses, including their sales functions, is that going forward, we will not be able to separate financials by entity, since they are now operating as one single business.","Looking ahead, we expect acquisition adjusted Energy segment sales to continue showing strong growth over the balance of the year, driven by shale, continued strength in the deepwater and oil sands business and steady growth in downstream as new Middle East capacity begins production. We expect third quarter acquisition adjusted sales growth will be in the low double digits as Energy goes up against tough comparisons last year, when sales grew a very strong 20%.","Sales for the Other segment declined 5%. When adjusted for the Vehicle Care divestiture, sales rose 5% in the second quarter.","Fixed currency Global Pest sales increased 5% in the second quarter compared with 2012. We enjoyed good growth in food and beverage, health care, full-service restaurants and quick-service restaurants. Regionally, we saw good growth in Latin America, Asia Pacific and North America. Europe grew modestly, reflecting the continued challenging conditions in that region. We continue to drive market penetration, with innovative service offerings and technologies, including the global protect programs, Bed Bug Assurance, STEALTH Fly Station, STEALTH Fusion and expanding solution offerings. We expect Global Pest sales to show further good growth in the third quarter, with strong gains in the Americas and Asia and modest growth in Europe.","Sales for Equipment Care, the business formerly known as GCS, showed improved growth in the second quarter, rising 7%. New account sales, better penetration and improved technician productivity drove strong growth in the service revenues, while parts sales also showed good gains. We continue to see good results from chain account relationships and also, as we drive sales through their regional and franchise organizations. We expect Equipment Care to show further gains in the third quarter, as continued good service trends, improved parts sales and streamlined operations benefit results.","Slide 6 of our presentation shows selected income statement items. Second quarter gross margins were 45.2%. Adjusted for acquisitions and special charges, second quarter 2013 gross margins increased 50 basis points versus a year ago. The improvement primarily reflected the benefits of volume and pricing gains, as well as merger synergies and cost efficiencies offsetting the business mix of higher Energy sales.","SG&A expenses represented 32.5% of second quarter sales, an improvement of 70 basis points versus last year. The favorable mix of Energy and Champion, as well as sales gains and cost savings efforts, including merger synergies, led the improvement.","Fixed currency operating income for Global Industrial increased 17%, with margins up 150 basis points. Pricing and cost synergies and efficiencies led the gain. Margins also improved, as we focused on more profitable areas of the business. Fixed currency operating income for Global Institutional increased 7%, with margins up 80 basis points. Pricing, volume gains and cost efficiencies drove the increase. Reported Global Energy fixed currency operating income increased 66%. Acquisition adjusted Global Energy operating income increased 28% in fixed currencies, led by the strong volume gains, synergies, operating leverage and pricing. Fixed currency operating income for the Other segment declined 4%. Adjusted for the sale of Vehicle Care, operating income grew 12%, with improved results from Pest and Equipment Care. The Corporate segment and tax rate are discussed in the press release.","We repurchased 1.8 million shares during the second quarter. The net of this performance is that Ecolab reported second quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.69 compared with $0.62 reported a year ago. When adjusted for special gains and charges and discrete tax items in both years, adjusted earnings increased 19% to $0.86 when compared with $0.72 earned a year ago.","Turning to Slide 7, and looking at Ecolab's balance sheet, total debt to total capital was 53% at June 30, the same as a year ago. Our net debt to total capital was 51%. First half cash flow reflects the normal seasonal pattern, where we typically see lower income and smaller cash flow in the first half, with both of them stronger in the second half.","Looking ahead, and as outlined in Slide 8, we continue to take aggressive actions to drive both our top and bottom lines, expanding our market share and customer penetration among major accounts, leveraging our positions in key growth markets in food, water, energy and healthcare as we work to offset generally soft global conditions. We expect to show good acquisition adjusted sales growth and margin expansion again in the third quarter, driven by innovation, pricing, merger synergies and better operating efficiencies. We expect to deliver on these aggressive goals while building growth for the future.","We expect adjusted earnings per share for 2013 diluted earnings per share to increase 15% to 21% to $1 to $1.05 range, compared with the adjusted earnings per share of $0.87 earned last year. We raised our outlook for the full year 2013 and now look for adjusted earnings per share in a range of $3.48 to $3.56, representing a very strong 17% to 19% growth.","In summary, we once again delivered on our forecast in the second quarter, while offsetting the weaker economy and further investing in our future. We look for further solid acquisition adjusted sales growth and continued double-digit profit gains in the third quarter, as well as for the full year 2013, as we drive to produce yet another strong year and build for our future.","That concludes my formal remarks. As a reminder, before we start the Q&A, we plan to hold our 2013 Investor Day in St. Paul on September 12. Space will be limited and is filling up fast, so if you have any interest in attending or have questions, please contact us.","And now here's Doug Baker with his comments on the quarter.","Douglas M. Baker","Thanks, Mike. Hello, everyone. So clearly, it was a very good quarter, and I will just highlight a couple of points. First of all, our underlying business sales growth accelerated from Q1, which was one of our top priorities, and it was driven by excellent new business efforts, we continue to go out and secure new customers while also driving new innovation, both in our existing base and also using it to leverage our new customer efforts.","Margins also improved. Certainly, volume and pricing were major contributors, but also the synergy and renaissance programs are also doing their part, and both those programs remain on track. So the Nalco integration continues to progress well, and the European renaissance program also is making a difference.","The latest acquisition, obviously Champion, was off to a very strong start. It had stronger sales than we had forecast moving in, which was -- is always good news. And so going forward, we see, I guess, a continuation of the improvement that we saw across the business.","We believe we're well positioned. We like the businesses. We are focused on execution and believe that our efforts will continue to enable us to overcome a difficult economic situation, which we do not forecast changing dramatically second half from first half. Neither getting better nor deteriorating significantly, so we see more of the same.","Hence, we've raised our guidance, which Mike just talked about, which indicates a 17% to 19% EPS increase year-on-year. So I guess we like where we sit right now. And if the team continues to execute, we feel we are in position to deliver a very good year, and we're confident we will do just that, execute.","So with that, I'll turn it back over for Q&A.","Michael Monahan","Operator, please begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question does come from Mike Ritzenthaler with Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","On revenue synergies, I guess, first, on Nalco, I'd be interested in how things are progressing versus the $75 million in growth synergies outlined and whether -- maybe you could add some context with some success stories or something that gives you the confidence that, that target is achievable this year. And I guess, secondly, on Champion, are we in a place yet where you can say that growth synergies will be north of 0 yet?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I'll start with the first question. Yes, so we're on target for the $75 million for the year. We had roughly $20 million in Q2. So if I was going to take the over or under on the $75 million for the year, I'd probably take the over. I think the teams are doing quite well. We talked about it last call, that we're seeing a number of big enterprise-wide deals, probably earlier than we had anticipated, so that remains on track. Regarding the ambitious target we've laid out for growth synergies on the Champion deal at 0, we're holding. So I would say we've had this for a couple of months. It's going to be very difficult to measure. Mostly what you're going to see is the ability to leverage Champion Technologies in the historic Nalco Energy Services base and vice versa. And that is already happening, and so we will see that. That would be revenue synergy. But at the end of the day, I think the guidance we've given is expect double-digit growth from the combined enterprise on a pro forma basis. And within that number is the revenue synergies we expect we're going to achieve.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","All right. And just as a brief follow-up, how much do moves impact your thoughts on raw materials, Doug. Oil prices are up, but certain intermediates and derivatives are modestly weaker. Does that change your previous view of being roughly flat? And how do those raws kind of influence Ecolab's ability to capture price in this challenging environment?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Our view on raws, look, everything's changed within the basket, but in total, it really didn't change. So we still see raws as really not much of a story for the year. It was a modest negative first quarter, modest positive second quarter, but I'm talking very modest. And for the year, we anticipate it's going to be a very modest negative. So raws are pretty benign. They're not moving much in total. Certainly, higher raw moves enable us to justify more price, particularly in certain markets. So it does have an impact on our ability to price some places. But in all instances, we are out every year working to secure price, because raws are not our only cost that is inflated. We have people cost, which is, by far, our largest cost in the business, given our investment in sales and service, and people costs go up every year. So we are out there working to secure pricing year in, year out. We don't sit back and just wait for large raw moves anymore, which I'd say was more of a pattern in the early 2000s, when you're in a very benign period for a long period of time. So we're out working to secure it. This year, pricing is going to be below last year, simply because you don't have the tail of a large move. But we still anticipate securing north of 1 point globally.","Operator","The next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Doug, just on Institutional, can you talk about your confidence in getting some acceleration in top line in the back half of the year?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I think Institutional improved from first quarter to second quarter. We've got -- if you peel it apart, I mean, clearly, the Institutional business in Europe has been the most impacted, if you will, by the economy. And it reduced its shrink from quarter-to-quarter and is anticipated to be flattish to modestly up in the second half. So that alone, because it's not a small piece of that business, is going to impact the overall growth rate. But Institutional around the world has got significant opportunities. They're on it. We've got a great Corporate account team, a very robust innovation pipeline. They've delivering against it. So we expect Institutional to continue to improve throughout this year and likely going into next year.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And, Doug, just in the U.S., any change in the competitive intensity from the usual suspects?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I mean, not -- I would say, overall, no. I mean, certainly, there's been shifts. So some of our competitors have been severely impacted by events, many of them of their own doing. And others are talking about aggressively rebuilding a program in the U.S. I would say on balance, I think the competitive environment is much more similar versus dissimilar to what we've seen historically. The way people typically try to attack us, if they're going to do it on a national basis, is try to undercut us on price. And that's been true since I've been here, and I'm about to enter my 25th year. So I would expect that's going to be the norm going forward. I think we manage against that challenge well, and I would expect that we will do so going forward. So we certainly haven't seen any share erosion. If anything, given the markets and the difficulty in food service, we've been gaining share, not shrinking, over the last few years, and I would expect that to continue.","Operator","The next question comes from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","There's been a couple of areas of pruning of either service lines or customers in Paper, Water and Health. I mean, one question is, would collectively, these actions amount to a point or 2 of revenue? And then as a follow-up, should we expect further actions in 2014 or has 2013 been a year of unusual portfolio management?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I would say they can be material within a given business, but they don't reach a level of 1 point of growth by any means over the entire enterprise. So yes, certainly, I think -- certainly, in Water, we are working to use this year, if you will, to sharpen our focus on the areas where we believe we've got the greatest right to succeed. And as a result, there's some areas that we're de-emphasizing. This is not a sea change. This is, I think, managing well around the edges and doing things that are going to position us for even better growth going forward. We have some of the same opportunities in Healthcare. There's, I would call, minor pruning going on in many of the businesses. We think this is a smart year to do it. It's -- we are managing for, positioning ourselves for maximum growth going forward, for maximum profitable growth going forward. And so these are just steps we're taking. I do not expect that it's going to go deep into '14, if it goes into '14 at all. But again, I think on a global basis across the enterprise, it's not going to be a dramatic change in terms of what its impact is on overall sales growth.","Operator","The next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Wanted to talk, Doug, a little bit more specifically about Europe in terms of the renaissance program. Obviously, I know that you've accelerated some things there in order to get the margin benefits. Can you talk about how much you're really accelerating there and a little bit more specifically what you're doing and what the legs are to that to keep going into next year?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, year-on-year and kind of a light way that we've talked about it with the investment community in the past, our margin in the second quarter increased about 160 basis points in Europe, which is in line, maybe a little better than we've talked. We mentioned that we thought we were going to be 100, maybe north of 100. That obviously feels pretty secure sitting here halfway through the year, well on target to do that. So we're going to likely be in the 150, a little better than we've said we would be overall on Europe margin improvement for the year. What's driving it? It's very similar, Nate, to the conversations we have had before. So we made significant investments in consolidating ERP systems, which enabled us to consolidate back office, which means, ultimately, you have the chance to do cost takeout as you move from 30 to several. We have set up centers in East Europe, which enables us to shift some work and have further labor arbitrage on the remaining work. We're also leveraging field technology, which improves our ability to drive improvement in our performance in the field around productivity metrics. So it's a number of things. The brave new world going into '14 is going to be increased focus on supply chain and making sure that we do the right things around product lines, leveraging the new innovations and the like. And that's where we'll start seeing, I would say, follow-on efforts, because remember, we're still pretty early in this process. We talked about 1,000 points as the ultimate goal. We're going to end this year north of 300 in total for the first 3 years. But that still means there's double that in front of us, and so we still have a lot of work, a lot of opportunity there. We're going to stick to it, and we feel good about our ability to continue this path for the next several years.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And just kind of along those lines, Doug, I mean, you guys have done a great job, obviously, internally. And again, even this year, to get up to 160, that's outstanding. How far can you get to before you need the economy and the volume to start coming back to really then leverage the new infrastructure over there as opposed to how much more can you keep doing on your own even without a whole lot of robust growth in Europe?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I don't think we ever anticipated robust growth in Europe because we haven't experienced it. I would say, certainly, as I've mentioned before, I mean, this year, we were going to do this on pretty flat sales, right? Down in the first and improving. Some of it was, as we told you, onetime issues. But we're going to have very strong profit growth, and as a result, very strong EBIT or OI improvement in terms of margin. But we can do it for a while without a lot of tailwind from Europe. Certainly, it's going to be very difficult to get 1,000. So if you're going to tell me Europe doesn't improve one bit from here over the next 7 years, I may tell you it may take us a little longer to get the remaining 700 basis points. I don't think that's really our view. We don't need dramatic improvement, but we do feel like Europe has seen probably the bottom at this point in time, or at least this bottom. And feel we are in a position where we can drive modest sales growth, which is really all it takes for us to realize much of the margin we're talking about.","Operator","The next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Just a couple of questions, if I may. When you provide growth by segments in fixed currencies, you have the overall 1% contribution from foreign exchange. Are there any outliers in the segments, where it would be significantly different from 1% that's for the overall company, outside of the Equipment Care business, where it's probably going to be 0 or less.","Douglas M. Baker","No, I'm -- yes, but the only would be Other, which is principally a U.S. or almost principally a U.S. business. They would have less non-U.S. sales in Other. The rest, it's more or less similar mix geographically. So I wouldn't say it was dramatically different, no.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Fair enough. Second question, we've talked in the past, and I think you mentioned it in this call as well, the challenges that the Healthcare segment continues to face. I understand that this is not going to be a short turnaround or there's not an inflection point necessarily coming in sort of a long-term customer education and market penetration story. So just so that we don't focus on this every quarter, how much patience should we have with this business before expecting to see results that are better than low-single digits, excluding the business shedding -- or single-digit declines, including the business shedding? I mean, at what point is it going to be delivering the growth that justifies your getting into this business 5 years ago in such a meaningful way?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, well, I guess I'd just say at this context, since we \"got into it in a meaningful way\", I think the 5-year top line CAGR of 7%, 8%, and its double-digit OI growth over that period of time. So it's performed. And that, of course, includes '08, '09 and all kinds of noise. So it's performed decently at -- I would say. This year and this quarter, yes, this isn't our best quarter. I'd also say we don't believe this quarter is indicative of how the business is performing. We believe this business will show improved single-digit -- modest single-digit growth for the balance of the year, improved profitability. And I think the team is doing exactly the things it needs to do to set itself up to continue the type of performance we've seen over the last 5 years. So we see Healthcare as a very important part of our business. We believe it's going to have at least Corporate, if not better than Corporate average growth, both on top and bottom line. We see it as an important contributor long term. And also, the work we do in Healthcare is leverageable in other parts of our business. So there's many reasons we like this business, performance being one of the primary ones. And I'd say, Dmitry, we're not going to ask for a lot of patience. I don't think we've really cashed in a lot of patient points to date, to use a double entendre, but as we move forward, I think you'll see this business get back to its historic norms of 8% top line, double-digit bottom line.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Very good. And then final question, your balance sheet after the acquisition is obviously a little stretched at north of 50% debt-to-capital. Your share count has gone up. You had some commitments about share repurchases prior to making the Champion deal. So as we look forward to the balance of 2013 and into 2014, how should we think about the use of cash between share repurchases and debt pay-down sort of not -- ignoring for the moment the opportunistic M&A that may come along?","Douglas M. Baker","So our use of cash priorities remain dividends, there is debt pay-down now for the near term, opportunistic M&A, much more in historic keeping of how we used to execute M&A bolt-ons, et cetera. We did say we're going to finish the $280 million that was remaining from the $1 billion share buyback. We're going to execute that by year end. That's still the plan. Going forward in '14 and '15, I guess our best estimate, and we think for modeling, you should assume that we offset dilution and are able to execute that type of share repurchase program. So we're going to end the year around 307 million shares, and that's probably what you should use for your modeling, certainly for '14.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","So it sounds like dividends and debt pay-down is going to be the primary use of cash outside of serendipitous acquisitions?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, dividends have always been priority one, and we are -- for a short period of time, we said that we want to get our EBITDA metric down 2 and below, below 2, and that's going to take a couple hundred million bucks of debt repurchase, which we plan to do over the next 18 months or so.","Operator","The next question comes from Edward Yang with Oppenheimer.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Piggybacking on some of the earlier questions, in Healthcare, are you seeing any acquisition opportunities or better multiples now that it's a slower environment there?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I would say we continue to have a number of opportunities that we look at in Healthcare. The multiple conversation is, it's hard for us to give any kind of -- or see any kind of average multiple move because we may look at a very small technology, small business that has what appears to be a very large multiple because we have the leverage for it, and they've invested a lot of money getting through regulatory and everything else. So it's a tough conversation. I would say I think it'd probably take a little more time before the average multiple goes down. It tends to -- they go up faster than they come down, because of people's expectations, and especially if it's in private equity's hands and they bought it. You go back 5 years, they still have some expensive goods on their hands, and they're hoping for high prices coming out. We're not going to be doing that.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Doug, you mentioned that the competitive environment in Institutional hasn't changed much. And one of your larger competitors had said they want to reenter the U.S. business. Have you seen any indication of that? Or if they were to actually move forward with that, how long would that process take, you think?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I guess I'd make 2 points. Yes, I mean, we've heard the same comments. They never completely left the U.S. market, so there's a little bit of a misnomer there. And so their plan to rebuild in the U.S. wouldn't be surprising. I bet they've got a plan to rebuild in every -- to build their business in every region, including the U.S. And I would say we respect our competitors. We respect diversity, which we're all alluding to here. And we fared quite well before they pulled out of the U.S., we've fared well since they pulled out of the U.S. We think it'll be incumbent on us to continue to perform regardless of what they do. We can't have our competitors' decisions dictate our fortunes, and we don't plan to put ourselves in that position.","Operator","The next question comes from John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a question with regard to capital intensity. When we take a look at your CapEx as a percent of sales, Ecolab on its own used to be very low. It spiked up a bit with Nalco, and I think you admitted earlier on that Nalco needed some serious investment. I guess how deep through that phase are we on the reinvestment side? How does it compare with how we should think about Champion? And when can we see your capital intensity start to drop down a little bit?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, John, I would say, yes, there was just -- there was a few things that needed to be done, i.e., we're building a plant in Singapore and doing some other things that you would have said maybe should have been done a few years earlier. But there's not a long list. I would say the list is, we are well within moving and marching against that list. On a go-forward basis, the businesses that we acquired as part of the Nalco deal are less capital intensive than, if you will, the legacy businesses, roughly a point of sales if you want to look at it as a multiple of sales. So we don't believe we've at all increased our capital intensity as a company. We probably decreased it on a run rate, plus, going forward, we've got more, if you will, plant capacity than we did pre-deal. So there will be investments that we probably would have made if we hadn't done this, that would have happened earlier than they will now because we've got other capacity that we'll absorb before we have to go build new facilities, other places. So I think we're well through that bubble. I think when you start seeing '14 on, I think you're going to see pretty normal-type capital and the type of run rate that we would expect going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Jeffrey Schnell - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is Jeff Schnell on for Laurence. Can you help us bridge the global oil production estimates to your 12% to 13% volume growth in Energy? And more specifically, can you talk about what you're expecting for EOR growth?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, well, look, I think we've spent time talking about this. One, it's not -- the 12% is not all volume. There's, obviously, price in there, too, as we go forward. I mean, that's what drives our sales growth. It's both, not just pure volume. Number two, as we go through, there's a change in terms of mix within the oil business. As old wells go off and are replaced by new wells, the intensity or usage of our type of services increases fairly dramatically, simply because the oil that's coming on is harder to deal with. It's nastier, more corrosive, usually has a higher water content, so it takes more of our type of services and chemistry to treat, both from an anticorrosion standpoint, from a separation, from a cleaning, from a treatment standpoint. And so as a result, if you just look at that mix change, that pretty flat oil, you're going to see mid- to upper-single-digit type growth in our market. If you start growing the business on top of that, you will see even faster market growth in that. That's the component that excited us about the business. That's the component that really led Nalco premerger, to identify, if you want to call it new oil, as the primary objective because it is such -- it's much more intensive in terms of its need for the type of chemistries and services that we provide. And so that's the underlying, if you will, story that's driving the business forward. And it will be true in a flat oil environment or in a growth environment, obviously, gets accentuated. Certainly, if you have destruction of oil volume over a period of time, it's going to negate some of that benefit, but it's hard to get to a 0 growth story in oil as far as our chemistry is concerned.","Operator","The next question comes from John Quealy with Canaccord.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","First, in terms of the integration of Champion, now that we're calling it same-store sales, if you will, what else should we look for from you folks in terms of metrics, in terms of integration besides dollars? Are we going to hear about different strategies, different activities that you're doing to integrate that business?","Douglas M. Baker","I think what we've laid out to-date is expected combined sales growth. We've talked about $150 million in cost synergies, all combining to deliver $0.50 of accretion by -- in 2016. All right? I mean, that's the story. And those 2 pieces, the sales growth, right, on an increased base and the cost savings, are what enable us to deliver or talk about $0.50 of accretion. We will certainly routinely report out on how this business does, so we will talk about its performance, in its own segment, if you will, moving forward. So we will give specific information on how we're doing against cost synergies, obviously, what the sales growth is. We usually add color, is that being driven by innovation, new business, et cetera. So I would expect that you'll hear all those things going forward, much like you do on our other businesses.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","And as a follow-up, assuming Keystone, the pipeline, gets approved and installed at some point in the next several years, do you need to do anything from a customer face, especially upstream, to help those customers deal with increased flows? Or is it just not material given the scale of your Energy business now?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. No, we would be for the Keystone pipeline, but it's not because it's going to have a dramatic impact on our business one way or another, but it's probably the right thing, we think, for the country and for our customers. So I would not -- there's no calculation to put in for Keystone for our business.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Ashland announced that they are seeking strategic alternatives for their water technologies business. Can you talk a little bit about how much more consolidation is needed in the paper chemicals business, particularly in Europe? And what would be your appetite to be a consolidator?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I guess Ashland announced they're looking at strategic alternatives, which is probably a public statement of what everybody does every day in their business. I guess it's code for we should expect something to happen, but nothing's happened yet. You know what, Mike, I guess what we've said repeatedly on the Paper business, look, I'm quite pleased with how the Paper team and our business has performed. They've done, I think, a very admirable job in difficult market conditions. They've grown -- they've found a way, I think, to get that business focused on the areas where we have the right to compete. They've driven very strong mix improvement, very strong gross profit improvement as a result, and delivered double-digit OI last year and are in a position to do it again this year for the full year. So we said going in that if we were looking at Nalco, and they were separating the businesses, we would have bought water alone, we would have bought energy alone, we probably wouldn't have bought paper alone. And we've also said publicly, and you've heard it, that we aren't the likely consolidators in this business also. So nothing's changed. Will others consolidate the business? I don't know. It's been bandied around quite a bit for the last 5 years. So far, there's a lot of talk, very little action, and I don't know if that's going to change going forward or not. These things are always harder to do than in actuality than they seem on paper. So I guess we'll see. We don't believe we're going to end up impaired from a competitive position. We go to market a little differently. We have a different niche than most people. And honestly, I think we've got a -- as paper businesses go, a darn good one.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","All right. And then on the Food & Beverage business, we've been hearing you talk about weakness in the protein market for some time now. Can you give us some additional details about what's going on there and whether that weakness is going to continue or what could cause it to improve?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, protein goes through its cycles. You had really high corn last year and the last few years. I mean, feed costs are a huge issue in the protein market, and they start taking out, culling herds very quickly when it's too expensive to feed them, right, because they're not going to get it in terms of the growth of the animal. And so we've got small -- you've got a business that's being rebuilt. Now corn prices are way down this year versus last year. It's a boom crop. So the protein business will get rebuilt and will become healthy again over the next couple years. I mean, we've seen this cycle over time. I mean, people shift, make different choices within the protein business based on price. So I guess we don't look at this as any real strategic issue for us per se. It's part of the business. It's part of what we go through. So the Food & Beverage business per se, in total, is not cyclical, but there are elements within it that are cyclical. And you have shifts. And so I think the protein story is a temporary story. And in a couple years, we'll be talking about how healthy that business is and what we're doing there.","Operator","The next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just want to dig in a little bit. It seemed like pretty consistent commentary from some of your emerging markets that they're an area of strength in the quarter. I was just hoping you could give a little bit of color as to -- maybe some more regional -- more specific regional commentary there, and really, what's driving that in the face of really some pretty shaky second quarter growth. Is it share gains or were your end markets maybe not seeing that kind of wiggles in the economic environment in the emerging markets?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, well, we've worked -- we don't think about the emerging markets as like we have a mono strategy that we're applying to them all. We have, I'd say, a more nuanced view, so it's market-specific. Russia is -- primarily, but not exclusively, it's an energy story first, and I would say water story second, and those are the focus areas. Our Russian business continues to progress well as a result. Brazil, our focus is Energy and more on the food side, the Food & Beverage side. Both those businesses have progressed very well. Institutional around it is also doing pretty well as a result. GDP figures are not always a great indicator of how our business is going to perform, because GDP is made up of a whole bunch of areas that don't impact us. We are much more -- we pay much more attention to industrial production, to food production, to rooms sold, to restaurants visited, et cetera. I mean, those and the energy story, we already talked about in an earlier story. India had double-digit growth. That's a market that we're investing in. I would say happy to reinvest our profits from India into that business for the foreseeable future. In China, we've made a number of outsized investments and are seeing a larger business emerge. That business, in total, was just under double digits for the second quarter, and really, that was driven principally by energy weakness in the downstream market, where they just got overbuilt, and then they usually radically adjust production when they get into that situation there. But the core Ecolab businesses in China have recovered very well, are growing at -- handily in the double-digit range. Water business is improving. Paper business is improving there. So some of that is because last year, the industrial production in China was way off and much worse than GDP would have indicated. So in a lot of ways, we saw the bottom last year from an IP standpoint. While this year isn't great, I think in comparison to last year, it's modestly better, just the underlying market conditions there. So that's a quick walk around the world. I think in total, those businesses continue to outpace our other businesses, which you would expect. We think we're positioned well, and we think we've got strategies that work there, pretty much independent of GDP, obviously, not completely independent.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Angel Castillo Malpica - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is actually Angel on for Bob. I was wondering if you could just give me a little bit of detail around your Champion or your Energy performance and maybe how much of that is actually due to share gains versus just existing customers and synergies. Yes, just that.","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I would say we probably have a better handle on the Energy Services business, to peel apart the business. I think if you went back, we would say we believe that market -- half that growth was from market, half that growth was from own efforts. The team, for the last several years, has identified new oil as its primary focus. We want disproportionate share of new oil, because the consumption's much higher there. And that strategy is a strategy that continues to pay dividends as we move forward. Champion had strong growth, too. I think if you look at Champion and Energy Services separately, it's the last quarter we have any ability to do this. So we really don't have a great ability to do it now because we merged the businesses. They're going against very different bases. Last year, Energy grew -- Energy Services business grew around 20%, and Champion grew at about 13% in 2012. And so if you do a 2-year growth rate, they're almost exactly on top of each other as you look at this thing. So I think both businesses have done smart things. The combination, we think, is going to prove very beneficial. And now it's up to us to go execute, and while we're integrating the businesses and putting them together, not muck up the top line momentum. And that's always, right, goal #1, and that's the challenge that we're making sure we keep front and center.","Angel Castillo Malpica - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And just one other small question, just regarding your Global Water. It seems like mining maybe has improved a little bit there just -- or it's less of a headwind. So I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit of color around what you're seeing in that end market.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I mean, mining, as we talked in the first quarter, was down. It was negative growth, single digits, and this quarter, it was flat to up modestly, up 1 point. And so it certainly improved, and a lot of that is a real credit to the team. Our team has done a very good job continuing to drive its new customer efforts in the face of, obviously, a difficult market condition. And so this is kind of play 101 out of the playbook, and they're running it very, very well. And so I'm quite pleased with how the mining team's reacting to difficult market conditions. We expect the mining business to continue to improve throughout the year, but at a fairly modest rate, because we don't think the underlying conditions are going to change dramatically by the end of the year.","Operator","The next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","Eric Petrie","This is Eric Petrie in for P.J. Just quickly on Champion, what was the contribution to sales and EBIT in second quarter of '12?","Douglas M. Baker","Champion in '12?","Eric Petrie","Yes, Champion in '12. Just looking for a mix and then how, in your best guess, would that have changed this quarter.","Douglas M. Baker","Sorry, I'm really not -- you're looking at, what, Champion year-on-year?","Eric Petrie","Yes, so Champion year-on-year.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I don't think -- one, we're not -- here's one, it gets hard to completely take apart this year and attribute, what am I going to attribute to Champion, what am I going to attribute to Nalco in terms of even the synergies, some of the sales and customers we've already put together, so it's not very easy for us to do a very clean dissection, number one. What we would say is if you take out the deal D&A, depreciation and amortization, we know that the business on a pro forma basis improved top and bottom line. If you had owned the businesses last year during the same time period, that margins increased and sales obviously grew. What was the big contributor? Well, volume is going to be a big one because you had pretty strong volume growth. But all the other efforts, synergy efforts and all -- and making sure that we offset raw materials, and all the rest were going to be contributors.","Eric Petrie","Okay. And then any outlook on second half Energy margins, as well as any impact on top line from higher WTI prices?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, the price of oil, unless it's significantly out of, what we've called this $80 to $120 band, and it's got to be significantly out of it, and it's got to be for a long period of time, really, doesn't have a material impact on our business. So whether it's trading at $83 or $108, it isn't going to have a big impact on our volume or the production. So the WTI move, it's really they're able to move the product and meet market demand more so as you're seeing a more natural, I'd say, delta between WTI and Brent now, because of the cost of moving it up to the East Coast, the $3 to $5 delta that you historically saw. We'd expect that to remain the same. It's not an impact on our business.","Eric Petrie","And then anything on margins? I know you commented tough comps in second half last year.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I think we aren't really signaling that there's any big news in Energy margins, if we continue to grow the way that we expect to grow in that business and deliver against the synergies, we will have margin improvement in that business, which we're going to need, because we got to offset the cost of the deal, right? So it's taken on D&A from the deal. It's taken on -- we got interest rates that don't show up in that business, right, cost of money to do the deal. So we expect margins, stripped out of D&A, to continue to improve as we go forward, driven by volume and synergies, if nothing else.","Operator","The last question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Just looking at Water, Doug, you talked about share gain. Could you give us a better feel for which areas you are focusing on? And then I am presuming you are gaining share there. And still within Water, there are talk about 3 new mines opening some time between now and the end of this year. Is that going to help or are those mines that you -- that Nalco is not involved in?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, Rosemarie, there's been what I would call minus -- minor, excuse me, shift in emphasis. But as I said earlier, it isn't a sea change. It is de-emphasizing large-cap, low-margin work that was a bit in the sphere of focus previously. Getting rid of that, increasing focus on probably the light side of the business, where we probably have enhanced reasons to believe that we can succeed there. The Institutional market, hospitals, hotels, as well as light industry, which has always been a focus for the Water business. Where are we seeing the gains right now? Probably mostly in the traditional areas. We've had very strong gains in power. We've had very strong gains in other industrial areas. The team is doing a good job, I think remaining focused on the businesses that we think are going to matter most long term. Paper has had a number of new business wins. Mining has had a number of new business wins. Otherwise, there's no way we would have had flat sales this quarter. So we'll go after, right, the markets that we've talked about historically. So I don't think in the sweet spot of the business that there is a dramatic change. We are continuing to drive 3D TRASAR. We're continuing to drive other new innovation. If anything, we're upping Corporate account investments in terms of manpower and doing other things because we think there is more room to grow and pursue in terms of the largest customers in the industries we go after. That's the focus, and I think it's going to work.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay, no, that is very helpful. And then lastly, if I may, on Healthcare, could you give us a feel for the areas you have de-emphasized? I mean, is it low margin? I think you had bedsheets or bedcovers. Is that the kind of businesses you are getting out of? And is some of the weakness in Healthcare also linked to a certain degree to ObamaCare?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. The decisions we made to get out of pieces of the business, and they've been pretty discrete products that are almost -- they're OEM in nature in terms of the contracts we have. They weren't what we -- they were not in areas that we wanted to invest in, in terms of capabilities long term. And we didn't believe we were going to be the people to compete for that business over the next 5 or 10 years, there weren't great margins as a result of our lack of investment in terms of capability. So it's stuff that we inherited when we bought some businesses. And so it's just clean it up, make clear decisions. We're at a point where we're either going to have to invest or get out. And on some of these, the better choice, we believe, was to get out of the business. It was not specifically related to ObamaCare or any other regulatory move per se. It was much more just a pure business decision, would have happened with or without ObamaCare.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And just one last one. Equipment Care, was it profitable this quarter?","Douglas M. Baker","Why, thank you, Rosemarie. It was profitable this quarter. I figured this is the only time I'd never get a darn GCS question.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Anything I can help -- I can do to help.","Douglas M. Baker","I appreciate it. And as a follow-on question, yes, that's the second quarter in a row that it made money.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","And it will make -- and can you give us a feel for the dollar amount for the full year?","Douglas M. Baker","It'll be in the millions. How's that? Well, at least I gave you the number of commas. All right, that's a start. So that's our forecasting accuracy right now for -- but that team has done a very good job. That business is growing. They made a lot of smart moves. It's making money. So it's good news, and congrats to the team.","Operator","I would now like to go ahead and turn the call back over to Mr. Monahan for closing comments.","Michael Monahan","Thanks.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Michael Monahan","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's Third Quarter Conference Call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO.","A copy of our earnings release and accompanying slides referenced in this teleconference are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor.","Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on Slide 2, stating that this teleconference and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under the item 1A, Risk Factors, in our third quarter earnings release and on Slide 2. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with an overview in Slide 3, we delivered strong results in the third quarter despite continuing global economic headwinds. We leveraged solid sales volume growth, pricing and our synergy and efficiency work to substantially improve operating margins and produce a very strong adjusted earnings per share increase.","Looking ahead, we expect to continue to outperform our markets and show further double-digit earnings gains in the fourth quarter and the full year as good sales growth, appropriate pricing, innovation, synergies and margin leverage, as well as acquisitions, more than offset slow markets and investments in the business.","Moving to some highlights from the third quarter, and as discussed in our press release, reported third quarter earnings per share were $1. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, third quarter 2013 earnings per share increased an outstanding 20% to $1.04. The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by volume and pricing gains, new products and new accounts, synergies, cost-savings actions and the Champion acquisition.","We enjoyed double-digit growth in our Global Specialty business, along with solid acquisition-adjusted gains in Global Energy. Latin America led the regional growth once again and was bolstered by good gains in North America and Asia Pacific. These and other increases were leveraged by good margin expansion.","We continue to be aggressive, focusing on top line growth. We're emphasizing our innovative products and service strengths, as well as our range of solutions to help customers get better results and lower costs, and through these, drive new account acquisition across all of our customer segments. We also continue to implement appropriate price increases to help offset lower -- or higher costs and investments in our business. We remain focused on expanding our margins, emphasizing productivity and efficiency improvements, to help increase profitability, as well as drive merger synergies.","We also continue to make investments in key growth businesses to sustain our technology and sales and service leadership. We remain on or ahead of plan for our Nalco and Champion synergy targets. Europe margins remain on track for strong growth.","Looking ahead, while economic trends present ongoing challenges, we continue to look for the fourth quarter to show further attractive sales gains and margin improvement.","Fourth quarter adjusted EPS is expected to increase 13% to 18% to the $1.01 to $1.05 range and compare with adjusted EPS of $0.89, as business growth and the benefits from synergies and cost reductions more than offset soft economies, business investments, in comparison against a near 30% adjusted EPS gain in last year's fourth quarter. We narrowed our full year forecast for 2013 and look for a strong 18% to 19% increase to the $3.51 to $3.55 range.","In summary, we expect the fourth quarter to show another attractive double-digit earnings growth performance by Ecolab, as we also make key investments to drive superior results this year, as well as for the years ahead.","Slide 4 shows our third quarter results, both as reported and with adjustments for special gains and charges, while Slide 5 shows our sales growth detail. Ecolab's consolidated fixed-currency sales for the third quarter increased 16%. Acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency sales rose 5%.","Looking at the growth components, volume and mix increased 4%, pricing rose 1%, acquisitions and divestitures were 11%, and currency was a negative 1%.","Reported fixed-currency sales for the Global Industrial segment rose 3%. Adjusted for acquisitions, Global Industrial sales also increased 3%.","Third quarter reported fixed-currency Global Food & Beverage sales increased 7%. Acquisition-adjusted third quarter fixed-currency sales grew 4%. Growth was led by beverage and brewing, dairy and agri, which more than offset modestly lower sales in the weak protein market. Regionally, we enjoyed strong results in Latin America, with moderate growth led by share gains in other regions that was -- that were partially offset by soft Europe results.","Global Food & Beverage continues to benefit from its Total Plant Assurance approach to customers, in which we combine our industry-leading cleaning and sanitizing, water treatment and pest elimination capabilities to deliver improved food safety results, lower operating costs and better product quality assurance for customers. This has enabled us to win key global customers and offset sluggish conditions in several of our regional markets.","Looking ahead, we expect accelerated sales growth in the fourth quarter, as we see further benefits from our innovation pipeline, better customer penetration and new business capture.","Fixed-currency Global Water sales increased 1% versus last year. Excluding the impact of mining and the de-emphasized businesses, Global Water sales to the heavy and light industry markets were up 4%. Gains were led by growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific, with North America and EMEA showing slight gains, primarily reflecting soft mining markets.","We continue to drive market penetration with innovative solutions to optimize water usage using 3D TRASAR platform technologies, new commercial solutions for water recycling and reuse and applications for wastewater. We are focused on corporate account enterprise sales, growth synergies and product innovation to build growth, along with the ongoing work to improve the profitability of our account base. We expect Global Water to show a better sales increase in the fourth quarter, as continued growth in our core heavy and light markets is bolstered by favorable mining results, and these more than offset the ongoing de-emphasis of nonstrategic business.","Fixed-currency global sales for Paper increased 3%. We saw double-digit growth in Latin America, strong gains in Asia Pacific and a modest increase in North America, as sales benefited from increased technology penetration and a return to more normal inventory levels. This growth was partially offset by declines in EMEA, resulting from continued low plant utilization. We expect fourth quarter Global Paper sales to show similar growth, led by Latin America and Asia Pacific, reflecting new business and technology penetration.","Fixed-currency sales for the Global Institutional segment rose 5%. Fixed-currency sales for the Global Institutional business grew 3% in the third quarter. Institutional's end markets remain soft, with modest growth in global lodging room demand and still challenging foodservice foot traffic across North America and Europe.","Looking at regional sales trends, Latin America continued to post strong sales growth, North America enjoyed a good gain, Asia Pacific sales were up slightly, and Europe was modestly lower. Sales initiatives targeting new accounts and effective product and service programs continue to lead our results.","To drive future growth and improve on our industry leadership position, we remain focused on executing global sales initiatives, globalizing core competencies and introducing product innovation that delivers increased value with solutions that sustain water and energy and reduce labor costs while also enhancing our customer focus around service intimacy. We're also making further investments in field technology to help drive our service efficiency and have better aligned our local sales team efforts.","Longer term, our new Global Institutional structure is helping to accelerate global deployment of our innovation and technology, which we expect will help improve growth by driving better market penetration and new account gains. We look for fourth quarter Global Institutional business sales to show continued good growth as progress in our global sales initiatives and continued aggressive sales efforts help us outperform challenging markets.","Third quarter sales for Global Specialty grew a very strong 14% in fixed currencies, benefiting from good fundamental demand and new customer rollouts. Global quick service sales increased double digits, as we enjoyed steady growth from both large and small customers. New accounts, along with increased service coverage and additional solutions for customers to drive operational efficiency and food safety, leveraged generally modest industry trends.","Regionally, Asia Pacific sales were led by good quick service foot traffic growth, while North and Latin America recorded solid gains, and Europe saw a modest growth.","Food Retail business showed double-digit sales growth in the quarter, driven by customer additions, new products and increased penetration. We look for our fourth quarter Global Specialty sales growth to be in line with its more normal trend, rising in the mid to upper single-digit range, as it delivers another solid performance in 2013.","Fixed-currency Global Healthcare sales increased 4%, as growth from account gains and new product introductions were slowed by continued soft U.S. and European healthcare markets. Third quarter sales were led by strong growth from patient and equipment rates, contamination control and improving growth in hand hygiene, which were partially offset by soft instrument reprocessing sales.","To grow sales in this challenging environment, we have increased our focus on corporate accounts, built on our sales and service approach and continue to strategically broaden our product lines, leveraging Ecolab's antimicrobial and pathogen expertise.","For example, we recently introduced OxyCide, a disinfectant that kills C.diffs in a record 3 minutes.","We expect Global Healthcare sales to increase moderately in the fourth quarter, as account gains and new product launches in both North America and Europe more than offset a weak healthcare market in comparison to a stronger quarter last year.","Reported fixed-currency Energy segment sales grew 68%. Acquisition-adjusted Global Energy fixed-currency sales rose 9%, as Energy compared to a strong quarter that included the impact of non-annuity dispersant sales mentioned last year. Adjusted for those one-off sales, third quarter 2013 sales would have risen 12%.","Our upstream business saw a further double-digit growth in the third quarter, resulting from share gains and our continued focus on higher-growth energy production sources, including deepwater, shale and oil sands.","Downstream business sales grew nicely, resulting from a pickup in North America refining and strong market share gains. The integration of the Energy and Champion businesses is going very well. We are on or ahead of plan for our integration targets.","Looking ahead, we expect acquisition-adjusted Energy segment sales to continue showing good growth, driven by continued production strength in the deepwater and oil sands businesses and steady growth in the downstream, which should more than offset moderated growth in North America shale and turmoil in the North Africa.","We expect fourth quarter acquisition-adjusted sales growth will be in the upper single- to low double-digit range, as Energy goes up against a strong quarter last year, when acquisition-adjusted sales grew a robust 20%.","Sales for Other segment declined 3%. When adjusted for our Vehicle Care divestiture, sales rose 6% in the third quarter.","Fixed-currency Global Pest sales increased 5% in the third quarter. We enjoyed good growth in food & beverage, health care and restaurants. Regionally, we saw good growth in North America and double-digit growth in Asia Pacific. Europe grew modestly, reflecting the ongoing challenging conditions in that region. We continue to drive market penetration with innovative service offerings and technologies, including the global protect programs Bed Bug Assurance, STEALTH Fly Station, STEALTH Fusion and an expanding solution offering. We expect Global Pest sales to show further good growth in the fourth quarter, led by gains in the Americas and Asia.","Sales for Equipment Care showed improved growth in the third quarter, rising 9%. New account sales, better penetration and improved technician productivity drove strong growth in service revenues, while parts sales also showed strong gains. We continue to see good results from chain account relationships, as we drive sales through their regional and franchise organizations. We expect Equipment Care to show further good gains in the fourth quarter, as continued good service trends, improved parts sales and streamlined operations benefit results.","Slide 6 of our presentation shows selected income statement items. Third quarter gross margins were 46.0%. Adjusted for acquisitions and special charges, third quarter 2013 gross margins were 46.2%, up 20 basis points versus a year ago. Volume and pricing gains, as well as merger synergies and cost efficiencies, offset the business mix impact of higher Energy sales.","SG&A expenses represented 31.5% of third quarter sales. Adjusted for acquisitions, the SG&A ratio improved 120 basis points versus last year. The favorable mix of Energy and Champion, as well as sales gains and cost-savings efforts, including merger synergies, led the improvement.","Fixed-currency operating income for Global Industrial increased 10%, with margins up 100 basis points. Pricing, volume gains and cost synergies and efficiencies led the gain. Margins also improved as we focused on more profitable areas of the business.","Fixed-currency operating income for Global Institutional increased 14%, with margins up 170 basis points. Pricing, volume gains and cost efficiencies drove the increase. As noted in the press release, we moved the intangible asset amortization specific to the Champion acquisition. This change was made retroactively, resulting in $14 million of amortization expense moving to the Energy segment from the Corporate segment for the second quarter of 2013. A table showing the restated second quarter segment operating profits is shown in the appendix to the teleconference slides.","Including this change, reported Global Energy fixed-currency operating income increased 42%. Acquisition-adjusted Global Energy operating income increased 20% in fixed currencies, led by the volume gain, synergies, operating leverage and pricing.","Fixed-currency operating income for the Other segment declined 10%. Adjusted for the sale of Vehicle Care, operating income was flat, as improved results from Equipment Care were offset by Pest Elimination field sales investments and nonrecurring costs.","Corporate segment and tax rate are discussed in the press release. We repurchased 600,000 shares during the third quarter. The net of this performance is that Ecolab reported third quarter diluted earnings per share of $1 compared with $0.80 reported a year ago. When adjusted for special gains and charges and discrete tax items in both years, adjusted earnings increased 20% to $1.04 when compared with $0.87 earned a year ago.","Turning to Slide 7 and looking at Ecolab's balance sheet, total debt to total capital was 51% at September 30, compared with 50% a year ago. Our net debt to total capital is 50%.","Looking ahead, and as outlined in Slide 8, we continue to take aggressive actions to drive both our top and bottom lines. We are expanding our market share and customer penetration of major accounts and leveraging our positions in key growth markets in Food, Water, Energy and Healthcare, as we work to offset continued generally soft global conditions and higher delivered product costs.","We expect to show good acquisition-adjusted sales growth and margin expansion again in the fourth quarter, driven by innovation, pricing, merger synergies and better operating efficiencies. We expect to deliver on these aggressive goals while building growth for the future.","We expect adjusted fourth quarter 2013 diluted earnings per share to increase 13% to 18% to $1.01 to $1.05 range, compared with a very strong period a year ago, when adjusted earnings per share rose 27% to $0.89. We narrowed our outlook for the full year 2013 and now look for adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.51 to $3.55, representing a very strong 18% to 19% growth.","In summary, once again, we delivered on our forecast in the third quarter, with a solid sales gain and substantial margin improvement, while offsetting the weaker economy and investing in our future. We look for further solid acquisition-adjusted sales growth and continued double-digit profit gains in the fourth quarter, as well as for the full year 2013, as we drive to produce yet another strong year and build for our future.","That concludes our formal remarks. And now here's Doug Baker with his comments on the quarter.","Douglas M. Baker","Thanks, Mike. I appreciate the attention. I would sum up the position in this way: Our team and business, I believe, are performing quite well. We're on track to deliver another outstanding year, with a forecasted EPS growth of 18% to 19%. And just as importantly, we're building momentum in the back half of this year heading into next year, setting ourselves up for continued strong results in 2014.","Turning to the third quarter, we had a very strong quarter. The P&L was solid, top to bottom, so reported sales, plus 15%, 5% adjusting for acquisition and FX. Our read on the underlying performance is that it's a bit stronger than the 5%, more like 6%, as we continue to refine our portfolio, on Water in Europe, in particular, to improve growth going forward.","We're driving momentum here. We had our best new business quarter, from a productivity standpoint in Q3, and we're off to a very strong start from a new business standpoint in Q4. Gross margin was solid, with a solid improvement of 50 basis points if you exclude the mix of Champion, that impact. OI was up over 100 basis points if you adjust for Champion, and all of our major initiatives are on track.","Renaissance. Europe margin program delivered 290-basis-point improvement in the quarter. We do not expect that much of an improvement going forward. So it was a bit of an anomaly, but it does indicate that we continue to gain traction here. We continue to expect 150 basis points for the year. Nalco growth and cost synergies remain on track. And Champion, while still very early, is also on track and off to a very strong start. But obviously, we have plenty to do in Champion since we're only 6 months into it.","Going forward, we certainly have a lot to do, but there's a lot of upside remaining from a top line growth standpoint. There's a lot of business to be gained. There's a lot of margin to be grown as well. So all in all, we feel very good about where we are and about the future, and I'm quite proud of the team's performance all year, including in Q3.","Michael Monahan","Thanks, Doug. Operator, would you please begin the question-and-answer period?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Doug, just on the Institutional business, in terms of acceleration for this business, what are your thoughts on this business picking up steam heading into 2014? What do you need to see here?","Douglas M. Baker","Institutional, I would say, is a little bit masked by Europe. And there's a lot going on in the European Institutional business. I would say underlying metrics there are improving. If you take that out, we really have had very strong performance in Institutional. U.S. reported, I think, a 6% growth in Q3. I would say it's more like a 5% and -- a day adjusted, if you take it down, but continued solid performance. If you take Europe out, they have improved from 4% to 5% -- or 3% to 4% to 5% in the last 3 quarters. And so they continue to strengthen quite a bit in their underlying performance. They've had very solid new business productivity. Europe, we expect, will start lapping and improving from a sales growth standpoint. It has been improving fairly dramatically from an OI standpoint, where we expect to see both top and bottom line improvement next year, which again, will quit masking, I think, the overall good performance that you see in Institutional in the balance of the world.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just on Paper, how is Paper profitability in the quarter and looking ahead into Q4?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, Paper continues to be quite strong. I mean, Paper was up 3% on the top line, and it was up, OI, over 35%. So they're doing exactly what we wanted them to do, they're doing a good job.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to tackle a similar question, just shifting over to the general Industrial segment. Doug, you kind of hit on the Water business a little bit, and I know that those trends kind of are in line with the sluggish kind of global growth you have been seeing and trending pretty much similar to the previous quarters. But what do we need to see there kind of getting going? I thought kind of coming out of last quarter, we maybe felt a little bit more of a positive vibe in some of those end markets, and I kind of feel like we're coming down to maybe things still being a little bit weak and doing what we can. Was wondering if you could go through that a little bit and see where we could see some of acceleration there.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I would say there's a couple of components, obviously, in the Industrial segment, but the 2 large ones are WPS, Water, Paper business, and also our Food & Beverage business. So we just talk Paper. Paper has been sequentially stronger from a top line standpoint. And a lot of what's happening is we're starting to lap, if you will, the contract deletions and renegotiations that we went through starting last year in Q3. But what you see is now strengthening top line and continued very strong performance on the bottom line. I think we expect to see modest growth continue in Paper and still strong OI performance moving forward. On Water, if you get -- again, if we walk through and look at our core business and take out Mining for a minute and also the de-emphasized business, we're in very much the same range. That moved up from a very low level in first quarter, to 4% to 5% range in the second quarter, and that's exactly where we remained in the third quarter, and frankly, expect to be in the fourth quarter. We believe that business will continue to improve, as we continue to concentrate on driving the business that's most important to us long term. So the business has increased resources, in particularly the light part of that business, it's going to take a little time for that to manifest itself into sales growth, but we like what that team's doing, and we've got high expectations and expect the Water business to continue to improve going forward. But right now, we would call the 4% to 5% range on the bulk and the important part of the business for our future. And then F&B, F&B has been, I think, a very good story. They've been improving throughout the year. They've been doing a great job in securing new business. That business has got very good top line momentum, and it's a business where you can count on top line ultimately accruing to good bottom line momentum. So we're pretty comfortable with what's going on in the F&B business as well. So I think that sector will take care of itself as we move forward. So we like the fundamentals, and we like the stuff underneath, which is important, the leading indicators, i.e., new business productivity, et cetera, which indicates that we continue to plan on increasing momentum.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Ritzenthaler with Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just trying to drill into the Energy results a little bit more. On gross margins, I think the mix was a bit unfavorable, but that mix component did not necessarily filter into OI. I was wondering if you could elaborate a bit more about the relative importance of pricing and volume versus synergies as that mix drops to the OI line.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I would say a couple of things on Energy. One, when we go through and look at the overlying business, we would say it's growing much more to 12% rate, is our estimated rate. And if you want the parts -- and then I'll get into some of the other, because I think it's important just to lay this out. Our oilchem business is growing around 11%; our OFC business, on a consolidated, was growing around 13%; and our downstream business was growing at 7% in the third quarter. And all those numbers, we think, are very much in line with what we expect everything else. Now they were masked, in part, by the Gulf -- the Deepwater Gulf business went offline faster than we had predicted. This is a result of the DOJ ruling, if you will. So it happened a quarter earlier than we anticipated. Not a big deal in the enterprise history, but it does have impacts on the quarter. And then we have a onetime business that comes and goes, which is dispersants and also gas plant products. And those products were much lower this quarter versus last year same quarter. That will come back, and it's episodic. Gross margin, frankly, was quite strong in this business. The underlying base gross margin, if you take out synergies and the impact of some other things, was up over 1 point. So our gross profit in this business, we think, feels pretty good, and the team's doing a good job there. Our OI was obviously fairly strong, particularly when you adjust, if you will, last year for Champion, we own it, and the depreciation that you have to put on the business. And so our OI, overall, was up 1.5 points, 150 basis points. And so we think we like this business, we think it's doing quite well, and we think, when you look underneath, the performance is quite solid in the third quarter.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Yes, that frames it up nicely. Switching to Specialty. It sounds like from the prepared comments that we're starting to -- it almost sounds like we're starting to see an early peek at the synergies between Food & Beverage and Specialty that you outlined on the Analyst Day versus new customer wins. Clearly, both are important, but is that -- are we starting to see some of those synergies, and is that a fair characterization, and does that give you more confidence in that strategy?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, a lot of what's happened -- I would say a couple of things are showing up in the Specialty number. One, continued very strong success in new business acquisition, and that's been a driver. So big businesses in that segment are our QSR business, our Food Retail business and Pest business are the largest. And then you also have GCS. I would say Pest and GCS continue to improve, particularly in the top line. And absolutely, that's the result of enterprise selling. And they're also benefiting, if you will, from our approach, both with Water and F&B together. We're bringing a lot of Pest business in, as we talked about in our Investor Day. So certainly, that's having an impact there. And I guess I would just say -- you brought up enterprise selling. Yes, I would say since the Investor Day, September, we've continued to have very good success there, we've continued to have a couple of other very major wins, and so we continue to feel quite bullish about that strategy and its ability to continue to impact our top line positively.","Operator","And our next question comes from John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a quick question on -- with regard to your Cleaning & Sanitizing business in general, have you seen any change in approach from any of your competitors in any kind of geographies at all?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, John, I would say it's more the same, more like past practice, than I would say, highly different. But certainly over the history, there's different tactics in different geographies, but I wouldn't say that there's a clear new pattern taking hold. I would say that the typical approach remains, selling price and trying to price underneath us. I'd say most important is this metric, we look at, in particular, the Corporate account arena, wins, losses versus all key competitors in every one of our businesses: Institutional, F&B, Water, Paper, Energy. And in no instance are we losing more than we're taking, i.e., we're taking share in every case against every major competitor that we monitor against. And so I guess we want to continue to focus, be aggressive, go after new business, leverage our new innovation, leverage our strength in the field. We think we've got key competitive advantage, and we want to make sure it translates into top line success. So far, so good.","John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then just as a follow-up, I know when -- I believe when you made the Champion acquisition, you had targeted to -- in a relatively short form, to get your share count back to kind of pre-acquisition levels. Is that something we can expect by, say, the end of '14? Or how should we be thinking about share repurchases going forward?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. We won't -- we announced after -- shortly after the Nalco announcement that we would do a $1 billion buyback, and we -- basically, we asserted that we plan to complete that by year end, which we're mostly there, but have a little to do in the fourth quarter. But by and far -- by and large, we're done. That was the share buyback commitment. I think what we have said is our use of cash going forward for the near term is going to be a little different in that we're going to have some debt payment, which normally is in our cash use, and it will probably slow down share repurchase, but we still expect share repurchase to offset dilution in '14 and '15, at minimum.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Quealy from Canaccord Genuity.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","First, more broadly, a very respectable organic growth number at 5%, yet guidance gets tweaked a little bit from the bottom end of EPS guidance rather than expanding the top. Can you comment, just the puts and takes on why you decided to do that?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I mean, the short answer is it best reflects what we believe we will deliver in the fourth quarter, and we work very hard to guide to what we actually think we're going to go do. So then you ask why more from the bottom than the top? I would say it's good news. I think what's happening is we're firming up, and obviously, we've moved the mean up considerably versus our original guidance by moving the bottom up 3, and I think, taking the top down 1. So I think it's just confidence that we are going to deliver where we expected to deliver. So top line, I would say we continue to do well. I think we've seen a number of things from EPS come through. We made some decisions in the third quarter, which we liked, which we're, frankly, taking some risks off the table. We didn't know we'd be taking these risks off the table in Q3. It's smart long term, but we start reflecting the fact that we've already done this in our forecast because we really didn't know if they're going to happen in Q3, Q4, Q1 or Q2 previously. So it's all those things. So I think that's the best estimate we have right now of where we're going to deliver, and we're into the quarter and feel pretty good.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly, an unrelated follow-up, if I could. You talked at the Analyst Day about moving 3D TRASAR into the clean-in-place market with Food & Beverage. Can you just comment on, under the Water line, how that progress is going and if we should see some tangible market impacts in the '14 or '15 timeframe?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, we remain in -- we would call that in test phase right now. It's going quite well. We're learning a lot. We have a lot of customer interest. The launch plan is next year, so we'll have some impact on '14. But typically, our launches really -- the volume really develops in year 2 and 3 of launches, not necessarily in year 1. So I would expect more of the outsize impact in '15 and '16 versus '14.","Operator","And our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So I guess 2 questions. The first one, just when we plug in the aggregate Nalco and Champion cost savings into our models, it would seem to indicate potential for another year in 2014 well above the 15% long-term EPS growth target. What factors should we be thinking about at this point that could be counterbalancing negatives or things that might be slowing the growth a little bit? For instance, this year, you had quite a bit bigger year-over-year pension contribution. Is that something -- pension expense. Is that something that could happen next year and other than just the macroeconomic stuff, which we all understand? Any other factors we might think about at this point?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Well, we're in the middle of planning, so -- I mean, we've got our scoreboard, and it's not unusual every year. It's -- the other factors that are somewhat out of control that could impact anybody's ability to deliver, including ours, FX and what are people's view, raw materials, though we don't believe that's in place now, but that always seems to show itself late. And then just we're going to continue to invest in our infrastructure and make sure we're doing the smart things during this time period. But we did that this year, and we plan to continue doing that in the next few years, but it's going to be important that we get that right to expect to be, ultimately, a $20 billion business and larger. And we want to make sure we've got the right systems in place to manage at that level. So I would say it's those factors. You've got the underlying business, you're right, we still have synergies positively impacting the business, not only this year but next year, and we'll continue to manage this business wisely. We're doing what we need to do to assure that the business has got the right momentum, and that's the smartest thing that we can do right now, drive top line and do the things underneath that we know drive value long term.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then just a follow-up, can you give us a sense how in Europe or the EMEA region has done, overall, on a revenue basis? I guess, with the new segment reporting, you're not specifically putting in your PowerPoint the different regions. But is the 2% volume growth needed to allow that margin to flow through the next couple years still the case? Have you done that year to date? And how are you thinking about that trending?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, this year, I would say a couple things. So when we break Europe out and split it from Middle East\/Africa, Europe this year is bouncing around negative 1%, 1.5% for the year, I believe, is about what the top line's going to be, is our guess. So it's been about what it is so far this year. It's gotten a little better. First quarter is our worst quarter. I would say we are comfortable with what's happening in Europe right now. But obviously, we can't sustain negative 1%, 1.5% sales growth long term and continue to expand margins. It just doesn't work. So certainly, going forward, that needs to move to the positive side. As I've always said, we don't need magical growth in Europe to drive margin, we just can't have negative growth. So this year, even with the sales forecast I talked about, part because we're managing some of this, we do expect to see 150-basis-points improvement. We've talked going forward to expect 100 basis points per year. We still think that's the right expectation to have. But certainly, it's predicated on our confidence that we're going to flip that from negative to positive next year, albeit fairly modest growth next year.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","What Energy end markets would you expect to generate the most growth for you over the next 2 or 3 years? I'm thinking among, say, the oil sands, shale gas, deepwater exploration, those sorts of markets.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, unconventional oil, broadly, but certainly, deepwater, which has been a focus area for that business for a number of years, and still have a number of large platforms installations coming onboard. But other unconventional is actually a positive, too. By and large, we make more money per BTU in oil than we do in gas. The gas is additive, and so certainly, the gas exploration, the frac-ing, the water treatment requirements, all that is on top of what we think is strong fundamental characteristics coming from the unconventional oil.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then as an unrelated follow-up, can you go into some of the details on the sales realignment in the Institutional business?","Douglas M. Baker","The sales realignment is -- I don't know, I would call this evolutionary, not revolutionary. And a lot of what's been going on in North America is just making sure we continue to have the right focus on the opportunities that we have to consolidate some sales management positions so that we can add more sales positions, right? This goes back and forth and ebbs and flows over time, so I wouldn't -- I don't think this is necessarily a headline. Let's call it continual refinement. We get a little fat in that area, we try to be sure that we understand it, and we want to make sure that we've got enough feet on the street to get after the opportunities. The North American business has been steadily improving, they have momentum, and they've got a number of opportunities they've identified that we want to get after.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions, if I may. You talked about the Paper, operating income in the Paper division being up, I think, 35% and about 3% growth in volumes or growth in sales. So is that a function of the restructuring actions you've taken? Or is that lower raw material costs? Or what's driving such a strong leverage from a 3% volume growth?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I would say it's several things. I mean, fundamental, the Paper business, for a number of years, and we're continuing to invest. It has done a great job creating innovation that matters to its customers. This innovation commands better margins. I think our focus in Paper has been drive and leverage the most advantaged innovation, make sure you get favorable mix, get the pricing you need to sustain this business long term and be smart. And if you end up in contracts with customers that creates an unsustainable economic environment, don't worry about the optics of top line, do the right thing from a business standpoint. So all those things have driven, if you will, this leverage that we've created, 3% and 35%-plus over time. And obviously, you're not going to get, see a 3% and 35% for 5 years running. I mean, sooner or later, you'll run into your base, and you end up continuing to improve OI, but not at a 35-plus percent clip. But that business, I think, and that team has done a very good job managing in a very difficult environment, and they will continue to do it.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","That's helpful. And then if you can just talk about a couple of things. First of all, the, sort of the difference in performance of Pest Elimination in North America versus your international businesses, and then just a general comment on sort of the mining trends that you're seeing that impacted your Industrial business in the quarter. Is that getting any better or worse in any particular region and sort of what's your outlook as -- for 2014?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Well, I'll do mining first. I mean, mining started off like 7% down in the first quarter. And then second and third quarter has been relatively flat, plus\/minus 1 point or 2. We expect it to improve starting in the fourth quarter going forward. But obviously, mining as an industry isn't in full recovery yet. It's just getting -- we just think we found the bottom, and we'll start building back from here. That team, through this whole cycle, has done exactly what teams need to do when you have downturns, they have been on major share acquisition, and they have done a very good job securing new business. So as that business recovers, we expect to see outsize growth as a result of their work. So I think the mining team has managed the situation exactly as we would have them do. So Pest, the Pest business, I would say North America and global are about the same numbers. The real difference in the Pest business, they're growing about 6% in North America. That's a steady improvement over the last few years. You recall 4 or 5 years ago, we were stuck in the 1% to 2% range. And so we've gotten a breakout, for several years now, we're in the mid-single digits. Our expectation for that business remains the same, we expect that business to be a double-digit growth business. We believe they're building the programs, driving the training, doing all the things that we know create that situation. So that's the focus on that team right now. We expect the business to continue to strengthen from a top line, and ultimately, the bottom line follows.","Operator","And our next question comes from Edward Yang with Oppenheimer.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Maybe, Doug, a clarification on the European Renaissance. That seems to be going well. But a 290-basis-points year-over-year margin improvement in 3Q, that was better than the 160 basis points last quarter, but you expect that to moderate for the rest of the year. So what drove the upside in the third quarter?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, some of it is just our base in OI year-on-year and where some charges fall. So I think the second half is going to be right on top of the 150 basis points. Fourth quarter's probably going to be fairly even on margin. It's simply just how the chips fell this year versus last, and we don't look at it, there's no real drama to the story. We feel very good about the underlying performance of that business. We have changed the economic equation in Europe. It's better.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up on Global Specialty, strong growth this quarter, up 14%, you expect that -- I think Mike mentioned up high single digits in the fourth quarter. And it's been kind of alternating between mid-teens and high single digits. And what accounts for the lumpiness there? Is it just -- I mean, you mentioned new customer wins, but are the size of the customers so significant relative to the overall size of the business that accounts for that lumpiness?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, our -- the 2 businesses that are -- the 2 markets that we serve that are really comprised of giants would be our Specialty business, our QSR and FRS business and our Energy business. And so yes, they're big customers. They have outsized impact. So the lumpiness comes when you start comparing against a prior year rollout, where you have to basically move in, put your product in the channel. You've got outsized sales in a given quarter for a given customer as you prepare for a rollout. When you start lapping against that, you start moving from teens to single digits. But what we really look at is consumption, what's going on in the business. All in all, that business is doing very well, remains very healthy, but their growth is going to be predicated on their continued success acquiring new business, plain and simple. And they got a great team to do it, and we're confident they will continue to do it, but that's what's going to determine future success.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Roberts with -- from UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","As you begin your planning here for 2014, how are you thinking about acquisition activity? So in 6 months, we'll kind of roll off. We won't have these acquisition\/divestment adjustment changes. Are we going to go back to a bunch of -- a series of bolt-ons across the company? You used to have a nice steady stream of bolt-on type acquisitions across the Global Institutional segment, and that sort of paused. I don't know if we're going to go back. And now with a bigger portfolio, there are a lot more things to -- of small size that can bolt on a lot more places now.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, John, I would say, yes, back to our historical pattern of a number of smaller bolt-on acquisitions is what you should expect to see, small being anywhere from, I don't know, make it up, $30 million to a couple hundred million dollars. And we have a, I think, rich list of opportunities. We have a number, as you might expect, ready to go, can't even keep track of where they all are in announcement cycle, quite candidly. We've already announced several this year, and we will expect to continue to announce those going forward. So do not expect any outsized deals from us in the next several years. One, we don't see anything on the horizon that we think makes a lot of sense for our company. And two, we want to take this time, as I mentioned earlier, to get our systems right, to do all the other things that we know need to be done to get to the next level of margin enhancement. And so that's going to be the work that we're going to be doing.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","We should expect that M&A line then on Slide 5 to maybe be like a 2%, 3% kind of number on a more continuing basis?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, it's probably back to our old back-of-the-napkin 6% to 8% organic, 2 to 3 extra points from acquisition, and 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion. So that, yes, we'll be back to that formula.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","A question on the F&B business. Mexico is one of the largest per capita consumers of soda. There is a proposal to tax soda consumption there. How much of an impact do you think that could have on the FEMSA business that you recently purchased?","Douglas M. Baker","I don't have a great answer for you. I mean, from a -- I would say you're right, that could negatively impact us in the Beverage business in Mexico. I would say that would be, in total, a relatively small impact, corporate-wide or even F&B-wide. But you're right, it's not one that we're tracking, but I will take the time to go look at it.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Not keeping you up at night then. At your Analyst Day, you had some new floor care products that you were showcasing. As you think about trying to unseat a competitor that has a very strong floor care position, can you talk about whether you're seeing traction with some of the bigger customers with those new products? And then if you do take the floor care business, how likely is it that you win other Cleaning & Sanitizing business as well?","Douglas M. Baker","I'd say in floor care, it'd be like trying to unseat anybody in any industry, you're going to need a significant innovation to take a person in a lead position out. It can't be 5% better, it needs to be dramatically better. I think we have some innovation in that camp. We're somewhat liberated in this area simply because we don't have an entrenched position. So we can innovate in a way that can also be harmful to the category, which is always difficult for companies to do when they have a leadership position. We're not in that position in floor care. So does other business come with it? Yes, but it's not guaranteed, simply because we have many instances where I would say we have the rest of the business and not the floor care business. So I think those businesses typically have to be earned separately, and that's our assumption going in.","Operator","And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just have some kind of technical questions. Just in terms of getting back to Europe and the improvement to 290 basis points, can you talk a little bit more on specifics? Were there some particular cost takeout that you guys had done that were in the progression that you were working towards last quarter that hit all of a sudden this quarter? Can you just give us a little bit more detail?","Douglas M. Baker","No, they'd be in the run rate. I would say that's -- the benefits are coming both in the gross profit line and the SG&A line. The gross profit and SG&A benefits are fairly steady. They increase over time as we continue to reduce the number of people it takes to operate the business and become more efficient. You get lumpiness in an OI line for other reasons. This is a classic -- I just don't want to overcommit and get everybody excited that this 290 is some new magical run rate. It's not. I have other numbers that I'd say look a little worse than they are. I think our 5 is more like a 6 on the sales line. And I would tell you I think this 290 is more in line with our 150 on a going line. It's just favorable for a number of base reasons and onetime reasons. Not bad news anywhere, it just it happens to be how these things fall. The quarters are 13-week periods. So funny things happen, they're not that big, and so you can get some outsize response as a result. For the half, think 150. And I think that run rate for the year, that's really what this business is doing right now, it's good, and we expect to continue that trend, at least at the 100-basis-point level next year.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair. And then just a little bit more detail in Paper. The last couple quarters, you had -- it looks like you're starting to get a decent growth trajectory started over there over last year, it had been kind of bouncing around, some of the quarters were negative. Is it really that you're lapping on the comps, where you had to get out of some of those bad contracts or is there something more specific to that? Did you -- you talked a little bit about innovation. Can you talk just a little bit about the specific points that are driving growth over the last 2 quarters?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Well, certainly, I'd say all those things came to bear. But if you wanted to boil it down to 3 points, it would be, yes, the base got easier; yes, some start-ups came online, particularly in China, that had been postponed but finally came online, so there is net new business in there as well, i.e., more plants consuming; and certainly, innovation continues to play a role, but its role is larger on the gross profit line than it is necessarily on the top line.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","What do you mean by that?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, innovation is one of the ways we've been driving favorable mix, and so its outsize impact is it could be neutral if we flip one technology off for another, on the top line, but it drives a much more favorable gross profit. Your GP in that business is up several hundred basis points.","Operator","And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","Eric Petrie","This is Eric Petrie in for P.J. Just a question on your Energy margins. Could you provide a little color going into fourth quarter and 2014, and now, considering that you've moved amortization expense to Global Energy from Corporate?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Well, I guess I mentioned earlier, first of all, on the amortization, our practice is when a business buys another business, the amortization that came with the business that was bought goes into that segment. We -- frankly, we just made a mistake putting it in Corporate in the second quarter. That's not our normal policy. And we want more transparency for all of our investors. And frankly, the depreciation and amortization of that deal belongs in the Energy segment. Otherwise, I show you an unrealistically favorable view, right, you get all the synergies, but you don't have any of cost of the deal. It's not a smart way to look at a business. So this is our past practice. So we just righted a wrong. We made a mistake, and we fixed it early. In terms of the margin expectations, I think if you get down to the fundamentals, and we've talked about $150 million of synergy expectation, on top of continued strong top line growth, we would have good margin improvement if we had 0 synergies, plain and simple. Simply as volume overwhelms inflation and normal growth costs, you are going to see margin expansion on OI just as a consequence of double-digit growth. When you add on the $150 million, I think that's what you're seeing here. And when we talk about, we think, a fair year-on-year comparison is a 12.2% margin last year, when we -- last year, with both Champion and the D&A. And this year, we're at 13.7%. So it's 150 basis points. We don't think that's going to be unusual performance, while we're realizing these synergies over the next couple years. So my expectation next year is the same kind of top line and margin performance that we'd come to expect.","Eric Petrie","Okay. And then just housecleaning. Is the $14 million kind of similar to what it was last quarter and on a go-forward basis? And then second, your Energy operating income has been running at 2x top line. How sustainable is that?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, that -- what you should expect for depreciation going forward is $19 million a quarter. It was $14 million in Q2 because it was a partial quarter, because we didn't close on the business at the beginning of the quarter. So $19 million -- I think it's $18.9 million if you want to get really precise -- is the amortization rate by quarter going forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Going back to Europe, Doug, are the improvements and the growth on the top line mainly -- solely because of your own doing or are you beginning to see some change in the markets you are serving? And can you give us a feel for what is happening in the underlying markets there?","Michael Monahan","Rosemarie, you broke up in the early part of that question. Was that regarding Europe?","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Yes, yes, the -- what is happening in the market versus what you are doing in terms of helping yourself.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I would say in Europe 2 things. We typically -- when downturns come, we go down late. And when upturns occur, we go up late. We aren't the early guy in these cycles, typically -- just for a reminder, because we always have to remind ourselves. And I would say, so that's one. So the markets feel like they've been stabilizing. I hear a lot of conversation with both customers and other people I know running businesses in Europe who talk about an improving environment. It would -- it is very typical for us to hear this conversation before we feel it, number one. We have not -- we did not feel it yet in Q3. With that said, why is our business down? Some areas we are focusing on, the areas that we believe are the highest priority, we see better traction there than in other areas. Certainly, Equipment businesses, we have seen more negative impact as a result of the downturn in Europe than we have seen in our annuity-related businesses as we go forward. That's not to be -- that's not unexpected. It's what we've seen in the past. But I'd characterize Europe -- I think the best case you can make is we would deserve like a flat to 1% growth, so it's not dramatically different than what we're seeing. What really is happening and needs to happen is we are shifting our focus to top line now. We are increasing the number of Corporate account people. We are increasing the efforts to get after the large customers there. It is early days, but starting to bear fruit because this pipeline has been worked on for months now. And so our expectation is that our efforts are going to start increasing and that we will start seeing better results in the top line going forward, and we need to.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","And does top line growth -- can the margin improvement of 100 basis points annually increase because of the top line and all of the steps you have taken?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I think top line just works to better leverage the reduction in fixed expense that we've created in Europe. So certainly, yes, I would expect a good piece of fall through, which is what we see in the rest of the world when we have volume. Unfortunately, in Europe, we had created just too high of a fixed overhead scenario, where volume didn't translate into much leverage, can't tune up.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And then lastly, if I may, could you give us a little more detail as to what you are doing in terms of what you refer to as field technology investments? What are you giving your guys, so they become more efficient than they already are with their tablets and everything you already have in place?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, we're doing a whole host of things. I mean, one, we're pushing on what I would call lower-cost, higher-performance field technology products, i.e., we could buy iPads at list and be better off than amortizing laptops over a 3-year period. So one, we're changing out the technology which requires us to change how we basically manage the technology, i.e., cloud versus in-unit. So we're doing a host of things. I would say, simultaneously, we're rolling out in Institutional what we call our Global 360 program, which we plan to globalize over the next 18 months. That will be a big benefit for us as we start seeing the benefits that we've realized in the U.S. over the years and the other geographies as well. We have enhanced technology that we're rolling out in WPS, enhanced technology in Pest, enhanced technology in Food & Beverage. So all of those have similar stories in terms of making it easier for our people to gather the information they need, for us to collate the information, for them to place orders, track shipments, do all that stuff, which, frankly, takes too long today.","Operator","And our final question comes from Andrew Wittmann from Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This actually builds a little bit on Rosemarie's question. Doug, in the next, what, 3 years, you've got a commitment for another $163 million of pretax cost savings, and that's all pretty visible because you've kind of scoped that out. But I'm starting to hear you talk more about the $20 billion company and the preparation to have the systems in place to get at that. Can you give us a texture as to what those out-year investments in the systems can do for your margins after you get these kind of discrete programs out of the way? What's your view in terms of what the margins look like in that timeframe?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, Andrew, I'm not ready to give a forecast for 2014, but I'll be liberated and give you one for 2018. Here's what I would say, I think we feel -- one, these investments, many of these are thinking about how we're investing today and repurposing the investment to make sure that we get even more leverage out of it. So I'm not trying to signal some kind of monster ramp-up in spending by any means. What we're really going to do is start channeling the spending. We have a different scale today than we have in the past, and so certainly, what we're going to be able to do is get much more leverage out of the spend that we make in terms of infrastructure. So this is the advantage of the size we are today. So you don't need to start penciling in monsterly different capital expenditures or anything else. We think the numbers we've given in the past are going to be the best indicator of what we're going to do going forward. In terms of benefit, when I was asked earlier about what to expect in terms of acquisitions, do we expect bolt-ons and sort of the traditional Ecolab model, and I said yes, it also referred to the back-of-the-napkin equation that we've had for a long time, which is a 6% to 8% organic, plus 2 to 3 additional growth points from M&A and 50 to 75 basis points a year and just underlying performance improvement in terms of OI and NI, ultimately, margin improvement. That really comes from leveraging these innovations and everything else. So it's not in addition to that, it's how we deliver that. And I think what we're doing is saying, \"Yes, we got a runway. We see a lot of this stuff, and we're also starting now to make sure that we've got and continue the virtuous cycle beyond the synergy period and continue to perform at the level that we expect from ourselves, and frankly, our investors expect from us,\" which is we have a 15% EPS target. As we've told you, we don't manage to cap it at 15%, as this year would indicate. And when we have outsize earnings potential because of synergies and other things, we won't be afraid to have that accrue to the benefit of our investors. At the same time, we know we got to make sure we're doing the right things to prepare when synergies aren't there to give us the extra lift. So that's how we're thinking about it.","Operator","I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Monahan for closing remarks.","Michael Monahan","That wraps up our third quarter conference call.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn the call over to your host for today to Mr. Michael Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Michael Monahan","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's first quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO. A copy of our earnings release and the accompanying slides referenced in this teleconference are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor.","Please take a moment to read the cautionary statement on Slide 2, stating that this teleconference and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our first quarter earnings release and on Slide 2. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with an overview on Slide 3, we delivered strong results in the first quarter, hitting the top end of our forecasted earnings range despite continuing economic headwinds and higher pension and delivered product cost. We leveraged improved sales volume growth, pricing and our synergy and cost efficiency work, along with our lower interest expense and tax rate to produce yet another double-digit increase in our adjusted earnings per share. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to outperform our markets and show double-digit earnings gains again in the second quarter and the full year, as better sales growth, appropriate pricing, innovation, synergies and margin leverage are -- more than offset increased pension and delivered product costs and investments.","Moving to some highlights from the first quarter and as discussed in our press release. Reported first quarter earnings per share were $0.53. On an adjusted basis excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, first quarter 2013 earnings per share increased an outstanding 20% to $0.60. The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by volume and pricing gains, new products and new accounts, which along with synergies and cost savings actions, more than offset higher pension and delivered product costs.","We enjoyed strong gains in our Global Specialty and Global Food & Beverage businesses, and nearly all of our Global segments showed good margin expansion. And we finally closed on our acquisition of Champion. We continue to be aggressive, focusing on top line growth. We're emphasizing our innovative product and service strengths to help customers get better results and lower costs. And through these, drive new account acquisition across all of our customer segments.","We also continue to implement appropriate price increases to help offset higher costs and investments in our business. We remain focused on expanding our margins and emphasizing productivity and efficiency improvements to help increase profitability, as well as drive merger synergies. We also continue to make investments in key growth businesses to sustain our technology and sales and service leadership.","We remain on or ahead of plan on our Nalco merger-related cost and growth synergy targets. We have begun our integration work with Champion, utilizing some of the same people and programs that so successfully led our Nalco integration. And we expect good results once again. As part of our actions, we announced the restructuring of our Global Energy business with expected charges totaling approximately $80 million over the next 2 years. Resulting synergies should increase from approximately $25 million this year to $150 million by the end of 2015. Accretion from Champion is expected to reach approximately $0.07 per share in 2013 and rise to $0.50 per share in 2016.","Looking ahead, while economic trends present ongoing challenges, we continue to look for the second quarter to show further sales gains and margin improvement. Second quarter adjusted EPS is expected to increase 13% to 18% to the $0.81 to $0.85 range and compare with adjusted EPS of $0.72, as business growth and the benefits from synergies and cost reductions more than offset soft economies, higher pension and delivered product costs and the sale of Vehicle Care. We expect full year 2013 adjusted earnings per share, including expected Champion accretion, to be in the range of $3.45 to $3.55, representing 16% to 19% growth. In summary, we expect the second quarter to show another solid double-digit earnings growth performance by Ecolab as we also make key investments to drive superior results this year, as well as for the years ahead.","Slide 4 shows our first quarter results, both as reported and with adjustments for special gains and charges, while Slide 5 shows our sales growth detail. Ecolab's consolidated and fixed currency sales for the first quarter increased 2%. Adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures, fixed currency sales rose 3%.","Looking at the growth components, volume and mix increased 1%, pricing rose 1%, acquisitions and divestitures and currency did not have a significant impact, rounding accounts for the difference. First quarter reported -- first quarter reporting represents our new Global segment structure. Reported sales for the Global Industrial segment rose 1%. Adjusted for acquisitions, the Global Industrial segment was even with last year. Reported fixed currency Global Food & Beverage sales increased 6%. Excluding an acquisition, first quarter Global Food & Beverage fixed currency sales grew 4%.","We enjoyed good growth in beverage and brewing along with gains in agri, dairy and food, which more than offset modestly lower sales growth in the continuing weak protein markets. Regionally, we enjoyed strong sales in Latin America with modest towards moderate growth led by share gains in the other regions.","Global Food & Beverage continues to benefit from its Total Plant Assurance approach to customers, through which we combine our industry-leading Cleaning & Sanitizing, water treatment and Pest Elimination capabilities to deliver improved results, lower operating costs and better product quality assurance for customers. This has enabled us to win key global customers and offset sluggish conditions in some of our regional markets. In addition, we continue to drive merger growth synergies, adding water treatment solutions to our Food & Beverage customers. Looking ahead, we expect sales growth to improve in the second quarter and for the balance of the year as we see further benefits from our innovation pipeline, better customer penetration and new business development.","Fixed currency water sales decreased 2% versus a strong gain last year. Excluding the impact of mining, and the de-emphasized businesses, which declined versus last year, Global Water sales to the heavy and light industries were flat. Regionally, North America recorded good sales growth, which was more than offset by modest sales declines elsewhere due to a challenging comparison period in last year's first quarter.","We continue to drive market penetration with innovative solutions to optimize water usage, using 3D TRASAR platform technologies, new commercial solutions for water recycling and reuse and application for wastewater. We expect Global Water sales to show modest growth in the second quarter as a focus on corporate account management, growth synergies in Food & Beverage and Institutional and continued market share gains more than offset the impact from our work to improve profitability of our account base.","Fixed currency global sales for paper decreased 3%. Solid growth in Latin America and Asia benefited from increased technology penetration and a return to more normal inventory levels. This was more than offset by sales declines in North America, resulting from lower plant utilization. We expect second quarter paper sales to be flat, reflecting continued market softness, primarily in North America.","Reported fixed currency sales for the Global Institutional segment rose 2%. Fixed currency sales for the Global Institutional business were flat in the first quarter compared with 2012. Sales showed strong growth in Latin America, modest growth in North America and Asia Pacific and declined in Europe. As expected, and as mentioned in our last conference call, the timing of distributor shipments in Europe and North America in 2012 hurt first quarter comparison. Institutional's end markets continued to show mixed results, with modest growth in global lodging room demand and challenging food service foot traffic across North America and Europe, with traffic in North America also impacted by the higher payroll tax in the first quarter.","Sales initiatives targeting new accounts and effective product and service programs continued to lead our results. To drive our future growth and improve on our industry leadership, we remain focused on executing global sales initiatives and on new products that deliver increased value and reduced labor, water and energy costs for customers in our restaurant, hospitality and long-term care markets. We also continue to increase our customer focus and service intimacy on a global basis through sales force investments in talent development and standardizing our global service protocols, along with further investments in field technology to help drive our service efficiency and better align sales efforts.","Longer term, we expect our new Global Institutional structure will accelerate deployment of our innovation and technology globally, which we expect will help improve growth by driving better market penetration and new account gains. We look for second quarter Global Institutional business sales to show modest growth as more normal quarterly comparisons and continued aggressive efforts to outperform challenging markets yield improving growth in the second quarter and over the balance of the year.","First quarter sales for Global Specialty, which is comprised of Kay's global quick service, food retail and related businesses, grew a very strong 13% in fixed currencies. Global quick service sales increased nearly double digits as we enjoyed strong growth from both large and small customers. New accounts, along with increased solutions for customers to drive operational efficiency and food safety, leveraged generally modest industry trends. Regionally, Asia Pacific sales benefited from good quick service foot traffic growth, while the U.S. and Latin America recorded solid gains, and Europe saw modest growth.","The Food Retail business showed very strong double-digit sales growth in the quarter, benefiting from customer additions, new products and increased penetration. Growth was strong in all regions. We look for continued good sales growth in the second quarter, though at a more moderate pace, as Global Specialty works to deliver another solid performance in 2013.","Fixed currency Global Healthcare sales increased 3% as good growth in temperature management and contamination control were partially offset by weakness from instrument reprocessing. Soft U.S. and European health care markets continued to impact results. To grow sales in this challenging environment, we have bolstered our corporate accounts team, increased our already strong service levels and continue to broaden our product lines. We expect Global Healthcare sales to show similar growth in the second quarter as improving gains in North America are partially offset by comparison to a very strong period in Europe's second quarter last year.","Measured in fixed currencies, Global Energy sales, as expected, grew 7%. As discussed in our last call, Energy's first quarter reflects a comparison against very strong volume growth in both upstream and downstream versus last year when energy sales grew a remarkable and well-above trend 29%. In the first quarter 2013, our upstream business nonetheless saw further double-digit growth against that high base, resulting from good global market conditions, share gains and our continued focus on higher growth energy sources, including very strong growth in shale accounts and continued good momentum in oil sands. The downstream business declined modestly, reflecting comparison against the unusually strong period last year when strong share gains and start-ups benefited that period's growth.","Looking ahead, we expect 2013 base Energy segment growth, excluding the impact of Champion, to return to its long-term double-digit growth trends over the balance of the year, driven by shale, continued strength in the deepwater and oil sands business and a return to steady growth in downstream as new Middle East capacity comes onstream.","Sales for the Other segment declined 5%. When adjusted for the Vehicle Care divestiture, sales rose 5% in the first quarter. Fixed currency Global Pest sales increased 5%. We enjoyed good growth in Food & Beverage, Healthcare and restaurants. Regionally, we saw double-digit growth in Latin America with good gains in Asia Pacific and North America. Europe grew modestly, reflecting the continued challenging conditions in that region. We continued to drive market penetration using innovative service offerings and technologies, including the global protect programs, Bed Bug Assurance and the STEALTH Fly Station to lead our sales. We expect Global Pest to show continued good sales gains in the second quarter with further solid growth in the second half.","Sales for Equipment Care, the business formerly known as GCS, increased 5% in the first quarter. Improved technician productivity drove strong growth in service revenues while parts sales also grew. We continue to see good results from chain account relationships and also as we drive sales with our regional and franchise organizations. We expect Equipment Care to show further gains in the second quarter as continued good service trends, improved parts sales and streamlined operations benefit results.","Slide 6 of our presentation shows selected income statement items. First quarter gross margins were 45.5%. Adjusted for special charges, first quarter 2013 gross margins were 45.6%. When compared with first quarter 2012 adjusted results, 2013 adjusted gross margins continued to expand, increasing 30 basis points. The improvement primarily reflected the benefits of the volume and pricing gains, as well as merger synergies and cost efficiencies, which more than offset higher delivered product costs. SG&A expenses represented 34.7% of first quarter sales, an improvement of 50 basis points versus last year. Leverage from sales gains and cost-savings efforts, including merger synergies and Europe restructuring savings, led the improvement.","Fixed currency operating income for Global Industrial increased 19%, with margins up 160 basis points. Pricing gains and cost synergies and efficiencies more than offset higher delivered product costs. Margins also improved as we focus on more profitable areas of the business. Fixed currency operating income for Global Institutional increased 9% with margins up 90 basis points. Pricing, volume gains and cost synergies and efficiencies also more than offset investments and higher delivered product costs.","Global Energy operating income declined 4% in fixed currencies when compared to the very strong 53% increase last year. As expected, continued significant investments in the sales and service force, business mix and higher delivered product cost increases impacted results. We expect Energy will show double-digit operating income growth in the remaining quarters of 2013.","Fixed currency operating income for the Other segment increased 4%. Adjusted for the sale of Vehicle Care, operating income grew 17% with improved results from Pest and Equipment Care. Interest expense in the first quarter of 2013 of $62 million compared with $86 million in last year's first quarter. Lower interest expense in the first quarter 2013 primarily reflects a debt extinguishment payment of $18 million on certain Nalco debt in the first quarter of 2012, as well as $6 million from the refinancing of higher-cost Nalco debt last year and other debt reductions.","The Corporate segment and tax rate are discussed in the press release. Reflecting the then pending Champion transaction, we did not repurchase any shares during the first quarter. The net of this performance is that Ecolab reported first quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.53 compared with $0.17 reported year ago. When adjusted for special gains and charges and discrete tax items in both years, adjusted earnings increased 20% to $0.60 when compared with $0.50 earned a year ago.","Turning to Slide 7 and looking at Ecolab's balance sheet. Total debt to total capital was 50% at March 31 compared with 52% reported a year ago. Our net debt to total capital was 46%. About $775 million of debt and about 2\/3 of the larger cash position was in anticipation of funding for the Champion acquisition. Following the Champion close, total debt to total capital was 51%, and net debt to total capital was 50%. First quarter cash flow reflects the normal seasonal pattern where we typically see lower income and smaller cash flow in the first half, with both of them stronger in the second half.","Looking ahead and as outlined in Slide 8, we continue to take aggressive actions to drive both our top and bottom lines, expanding our market share and customer penetration among major accounts, leveraging our positions in key growth markets in food, water, energy and health care as we work to offset continued generally soft global conditions. We expect to show sales growth and margin expansion again in the second quarter driven by innovation, pricing, merger synergies and better operating efficiencies. And we expect to deliver on these aggressive goals while building future growth.","We expect adjusted second quarter 2013 diluted earnings per share to increase 13% to 18% to the $0.81 to $0.85 range compared with the adjusted earnings per share of $0.72 earned last year. We look for continued double-digit growth over the balance of the year and expect full year 2013 adjusted earnings per share, including expected Champion accretion, in a range of $3.45 to $3.55 per share, representing 16% to 19% growth.","In summary, we once again delivered on our forecast in the first quarter while offsetting higher delivered product cost and the weaker economy, while further investing in our future. We look for better sales growth and continued double-digit profit gains in the second quarter, as well as for the full year 2013 as we drive to produce yet another strong year and build for our future.","And now, here's Doug Baker with his comments on the quarter.","Douglas M. Baker","Right. First of all, obviously, a very, very strong EPS quarter, which is what we anticipated, hence, the range we had given. We would characterize the sales quarter, I guess I would, as mediocre. The reported 2% I don't think really reflects our underlying rate. We would estimate that to be north of 4%. The differences between the reported 2% and our underlying estimate has really been driven by year-on-year challenge in terms of comparison. Last year, we had a very strong sales quarter. And even at that time, we talked that it was really driven a couple points higher by onetime events in Institutional and Energy.  We also saw a sizeable inventory reduction this year in Institutional, EMEA in particular, and clearly, overall, the 4% rate, 4% plus is really, I think, partially reflecting a difficult economy. And we expect the economy to remain difficult for the balance of the year.","Good news in the quarter. We saw improving results in both new business and innovation. We know this will drive top line improvement going forward. We closed on the Champion deal, and that is also off to a very strong start from an integration standpoint. So all told, our performance in the quarter has put us in a good position to deliver a very good year. So going forward, our expectations, we expect sales acceleration, better sales reported and continued improvement in the underlying rate. We expect continued strong synergy delivery. We expect good margin performance. Net, we continue to forecast a strong year, made even stronger by Champion. So for the year, our EPS estimate, including Champion, is 16% to 19% growth.","So with that, I'll hand it back to Mike for some housekeeping duties. Then we'll do Q&A.","Michael Monahan","Our remarks. A final before Q&A. We plan to hold our annual tour of our booth at the National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago next month on May 20. Looking further ahead, we also plan to hold our 2013 Investor Day in St. Paul on September 12. If you have any questions, please contact my office. Operator, would you please begin the question-and-answer period?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question does come from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Doug, can you comment on the competitive intensity in the U.S. institutional market in the quarter? Any changes that you're seeing from Diversey or others?","Douglas M. Baker","No, not materially different. I wouldn't say that's what's really coloring the quarter from an Institutional standpoint. U.S., when we look at it, we would say the underlying rate there is around 4% in Institutional in North America. I think that's more a reflection of continued softness in the market. We still continue to win in terms of gains and losses, and are, we believe, gaining share overall. So I think the Institutional business is doing decently in a lousy environment.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just briefly, Doug, how did Champion do in Q1, sales and earnings?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, double digit on both, so in line with where we expected. So I think we've talked about this combined business run rate in the 12%, 13% range and we saw that maybe a little north from Champion. So that's what we expect to see going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Doug, wanted to talk a little bit, you were just mentioning towards the end of your comments expecting some sales acceleration throughout the second half of the year here. Is that just based on the counts being a little bit easier relative to 1Q? Or is there additional new business in the pipeline, particularly maybe in -- within the Energy segment that's going to be coming on? Or just other things that you could provide a little bit more color on there.","Douglas M. Baker","Well, yes, it's certainly both. I think if we just stood still, which I don't think is possible in business, we would certainly see improved reported sales numbers in the out quarters because you do have an artificially high comparison quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter. But I think it's also important that, yes, we see momentum in terms of new business. Productivity, we see that in all of our core businesses. So we feel good about those efforts. We've got a number of new innovations that take time to roll out throughout the year. Yes, specifically in Energy. We would have viewed Energy on a normalized basis to be certainly in the range we talked about in Q1 of 12%-, 13%-type performance, is what we really saw when we look at the underlying trends in energy. So that's going to come through, and that's what our expectation for the year is in Energy, is a double-digit top line and bottom line performance pre-Champion. And then obviously, when you add Champion, you got a bigger base. And we would expect the same on a pro forma basis when you have the Champion on top of it.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then just related to that, how are you guys viewing Europe right now in terms of the environment? Obviously, you mentioned it's still soft. Is it getting a little bit softer? Is it kind of maintaining where it's at? And what are you guys doing to be able to continue to gain share over there?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, Europe's -- Europe, if anything, and I think we talked about this in the last call. I mean, risk -- Europe, we view it as we had a bias that was negative, certainly, going in. And I'd say Europe is softer than last year. No doubt about it. I guess for the quarter, our Europe business is down a couple of points. If we look at the legacy Ecolab business, we were still able to increase margin by over 200 points in the quarter. Some of that is it's a very small quarter in terms of profit contribution. I mean, just in terms of numbers. We don't expect 200 basis points for the year, but we are still quite confident that we're going to exceed the 100-basis-point commitment that we made at the beginning of the year for this year in Europe, just looking at legacy. If I look at Europe in total for the year, I think when we add the WPS and Energy business in there, we would expect modest sales increase for the year and pretty good OI margin increase, north of 100 basis points in total.","Operator","The next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Barclays.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to ask a question on the new segments. Can you give a sense to how, with the Industrial and Institutional segments, how we should think about the mix on a global basis? Is one of them much more overseas than the other? How do we think about Europe versus Asia versus Latin America? Are they pretty similar? Is there any real difference we might think about in forecasting?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I don't have the -- we'll get you a mix breakdown by geography. Institutional is going to be heavier in the U.S. just given the size of the U.S. Institutional business. My guess is industrial and Energy are going to be more on the balance side. In total, we're 50% U.S., roughly, 50% outside of the U.S. So we'll give you a breakdown by area.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then I guess the follow-up, the distributor shipments timing issue, which you'd cited, seems like the big reason that Institutional slowed down. But how do we think about the Industrial business? And given that Water's been struggling relative to the long-term 6%-to-8% targets you've put out there, when do get back to that, I guess, is really the question?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, so I guess the Water business, if we split out what's reported. So we have Water and Paper split out. And within Water, you've got 2 fundamental businesses. You've got, what I'll call core Water and you have mining. Mining in the first quarter going against a very strong first quarter, and I'd also say a tough market, mining was off 7%, and was also off on a like amount on operating income. If you look at the core Water business, it's growing. It's not growing at the 6% to 8%. We do believe that the core Water business is going to accelerate throughout the year. We're having -- we have a lot of momentum on new business in that area right now. We like what we're seeing in a number of areas, but we're also changing the focus, and we have de-emphasized large-cap build projects, which were part of the Water mix previously, because we really didn't like them from a return standpoint. Fundamentally, they took a lot of capital and didn't have much margin. It's not a great business equation. We want more emphasis on the annuity type equation where we know we can have sustained economic growth for the company and frankly, drive great improvement for our customers. So this move, the de-emphasization, if you will, of that business is going to weigh a little bit on the top line but not on the bottom line because we really didn't make any money there. So we adjust for that in the last year basis, which we talked about. Water is growing at about a 4% clip right now and has double-digit OI performance. We think that gets better as we go throughout the year. So we think water is in decent shape. We aren't going to be happy till it's in the 6% to 8% organic, and we think we start building towards that by year-end.","Operator","The next question comes from John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","With regard to pricing, you indicated you had about 1% price kind of on average for the quarter. How does that break out by segment between Industrial, Institutional and Energy, if there is any difference?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. So John, this is Doug. I'm just digging out our pricing chart. So if I look in total, it was a little north of 1% but around 1%, so guess what, it wasn't 1.5%. And as we look at it, a little stronger in Institutional than Industrial, but they're both -- they're not very far apart. There's really not big delta amongst any of these guys, right, 50 basis points. So everybody is north of 1%.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And with regard to raw material pressures and the cost there, how should we think about that by segment as well? And then kind of comparing that to the pricing that you're seeing, which I guess, does look like it's relatively stable.","Douglas M. Baker","I guess how we feel is we're going to be able, in almost every segment, to have pricing more than cover. Basically, we're in a catch-up year right now. So we see very modest raw material pricing pressure for the year, and we believe pricing is going to more than cover that. In total, we see gross profit increasing for the year, and it's really a story principally of pricing swamping raws and catching up versus what we experienced last year. So we don't believe that's going to be, at this point based on our forecast, any kind of headline story for the year.","Operator","The next question comes from Edward Yang with Oppenheimer.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I think you mentioned that you saw some destocking again in this quarter. Was that in the Institutional business? And was that in Europe or North America?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, in the big disk, it was a little bit in both but more material in Europe, which was, I'd say, not all that usual in terms of a percent. And so you had kind of a onetime event. Even with that said, that was principally in the Institutional business, that business is certainly under market pressure. Now we're also, I would say, working very hard on the bottom, the contracts which have the lowest profitability, i.e., where we might even lose money. And so we're doing some self-induced trimming of our sales forecast there, as we are working hard to make sure that we drive profitability in Europe at this point in time. And I think we're having success. So big, big move in Europe, onetime. We don't expect it to see it to repeat. Last year -- in North America, it's more a year-on-year delta. Last year, reported sales in Institutional were like 6%, and I think we talked at that time it was inventory moving in our favor.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And in relation to the earlier question on Europe, qualitatively, it sounded like you were a bit more confident, at least in your own ability to drive margin expansion. I think last year, you had 200 basis points plus of margin expansion, but the decline in the market in Europe shaved off about 100 basis points and you're up 200 basis points, you mentioned, in the first quarter. But qualitatively, you sounded more confident that you could exceed that 100-basis-point target. Am I reading more into it? Or is there anything that's changed that's giving you more control over the margin expansion in Europe this year versus the prior year?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I guess I'm confident that we're going to exceed our 100-basis-point forecast sitting here right now. Part is I'm a little over 1\/3 of the way through the year, or 1\/3 of the way through the year. And as we look at how our efforts are impacting the P&L, I guess we have confidence that we can overcome the softness that we see in the market. Will this year exceed last year in terms of margin improvement? My guess is it probably will. It's not going to be -- we don't believe it's going to be 200 basis points. It'll be probably north of 100. My guess is below 150 but in that camp.","Operator","The next question comes from David Ridley-Lane with Merrill Lynch.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure. Just following up on the comments around gross margins being up for 2013. Does that include the impact of Champion? Or was that on an x Champion basis?","Douglas M. Baker","Included. It's the underlying business pre-Champion. So you're going to have underlying [indiscernible] from Champion.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then have you seen any change among the Energy specialty chemical competitors like Baker Hughes? Or is that a bit too early to see that anyway?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I mean, we closed 20 days ago. I don't -- I think certainly, it's not new news to anyone that we are working to put together Nalco Energy Services and Champion, and certainly competition has had to take notice. We have not seen significantly different activity from a competitive standpoint as a result.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then maybe just if I could squeeze in one more. In the first quarter, the Industrial segment's operating margin was up quite nicely. I'm familiar with the actions you're taking in the Paper subsegment there, but are there other actions you're taking in Industrial that are helping to drive that? Or is it mostly just a story about the Paper segment?","Douglas M. Baker","No. We probably throughout the segment, we had core Water improve profitability, Paper improve profitability, F&B improve profitability. So it was pretty much across the board as you have a number of things. We've got sales growth driving F&B, and I think just smart margin play. You've got core Water. I talked about what's going on there, and I think the way we're managing mix is going to benefit us for the long term. And so that business, I think, has got the right idea. Paper, in a very difficult environment last year, enhanced profitability quite well, and we believe that continues throughout this year. So I believe the strength there is pretty strong and across the board.","Operator","The next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Couple of questions if I can. First of all, just a bookkeeping question. Can you talk about what the share count will be in the second quarter after the Champion deal close? It's going to be in the neighborhood of $308 million -- 308 million shares still?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, 307 million.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","307 million, okay. Second question. If you look at your commentary on the energy market and the upstream business doing well, and the downstream being a little bit soft, from what I remember, Champion is mostly upstream. So aside from just a delta of adding Champion, would you expect, on a pro forma basis, this segment to be growing faster because of the increased upstream concentration?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I mean, I think it's a favorable mix. So Champion is a 100 -- it's 0% downstream because their downstream business, which was quite small, we did not acquire. And so 100% of what we're adding is in the, either the well drilling and additives and\/or the upstream. And so those businesses have been performing and growing at a faster clip. They will be now larger as a percent of the overall Energy and\/or overall percentage of Ecolab. So yes, we think it's favorable from a mix standpoint.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","It's unusual to see the Water business being down in revenues for Nalco in sort of outside of a disastrous economics scenario. You talked about mining being down 7%. Was the rest of the core Water -- you said it was growing, but was it growing just barely? I didn't realize that mining was that big of a part of water treatment. So can you talk a little bit about other markets that may be holding back the growth in Water in the quarter?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I think, Dmitry, you've got funny comparisons. North American water, right, even pre, grew at about 4%, little better and had very, very strong operating income performance. Really, if we do adjustments, we try to look and understand what our underlying rates are. Our belief is the business globally, Water x mining, when we get out of this, stop doing this big capital play and some of the other stuff which we think doesn't fundamentally help drive the business ultimately from a profit standpoint, when we adjust for that and look at the underlying stuff, we believe it's growing at about a 4% clip x mining. And I think that's probably the best measure of it. So if I come and tell you we're growing 3% next quarter, it's going to look like improved on a reported basis. But that would be a slowdown versus where we think we are right now. That's not what I expect to tell you next quarter, by the way. So we think it's in the 4% area. So some of this is a very minor remodel on our part of the business we acquired in terms of changing emphasis. And so we're going to go through a couple of quarters where it's going to look a little worse than it actually is, but we think this is the right move because I really -- we don't like the business that we're de-emphasizing. We don't think it's strategically right. We don't think it's a good return on capital. We don't think it's important to our long-term competitiveness. And so we'd rather go through the optic noise right now because we know this is the right thing to do for the business and what we're trying to do is be transparent on it. So margins are improving, OI performance is very solid in the quarter, and we expect to be solid for the year. So the Water business, we think, will come through this in a stronger profit position and a stronger focus position.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. Okay. The 29% tax rate you reported in the first quarter, what should we think about it for the balance of the year when you add Champion?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I think for the year, we're saying about the same. I think typically, the tax area, we're going to be a little conservative on forecasting. I would forecast the same even with Champion. It takes a while to understand what the tax opportunities are because you've got to dig pretty deep, and you need to be inside the company to understand what smart plays are and sustainable plays.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, but it shouldn't be increasing?","Douglas M. Baker","No.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then final question on just on Paper. You had this business for about a year. You weren't excited about it when you got it. You've obviously done some things to improve the profitability with which makes it potentially a more appealing divestiture. Any updates on sort of how you view this business longer term? And what -- if you are waiting for a decision, exactly what will be driving that decision? Is it growth rates? Is it margin opportunity? At what point will you be satisfied that this business is as good as it's going to get, and it's probably going to be better with somebody else?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I guess the easy answer is we'll leave an immediate decision to make that decision. I would say, the paper business right now is part of our portfolio. We are driving it for long-term benefit. We are making sure that our customer and product mix makes sense for us. I think the Paper team is doing a very good job. So obviously, we haven't been driving for optical perfection. We've been going through and cutting cruddy contracts and making sure that we've got business relationships that will sustain our ability to continue to invest in the business. I think the ultimate answer, I think, on any business in our portfolio on fit, I would say 2 things: if we run this out and look at our portfolio, we think it is, by and large, in very, very good shape. And I will also say if you start mucking around and moving one out or the other, it does not have a material difference in what we think our performance is going to be over the next 5 years. So our real emphasis right now in across the portfolio is execution excellence. Get on new business, get on innovation, get on driving the team to do the things that we know drive performance, and that's the mantra. So we went through a very successful integration year last year. What we really tried to do is minimize outside distractions, and so our whole focus is driving the businesses we own for maximum performance, both near term and long term. And that's really the company focus. And I don't want to do things that are going to detract that.","Operator","The next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions. First, on CapEx as a run rate. How are you looking at the next 2 to 3 years for a CapEx run rate on the integrated portfolio?","Douglas M. Baker","I think if you're doing the model, 5% to 5.5% of sales is in that camp. Pick the midpoint.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And separately, as you look across the portfolio now, how are you thinking about opportunities to improve free cash flow conversion over the next, call it, 3 to 5 years?","Douglas M. Baker","One, I think even this year, it's going to be free cash flow. Our cash flow's going to be very positive compared to net income and all the rest. We talked about last year, first half of last year was a very unusual period where you had this disproportioned amount of special charges and other things hitting a low profit period. So I think as we go forward, I think just, one, drive OI margin. It is the #1 driver of returns and of capital or of free cash. Two, we will be smarter stewards of working capital. And I think there's opportunity there, but I think the big needle mover is driving the business and driving OI and tax rate and those conversion factors.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Doug, without ranting too much about the state of U.S. Antitrust policy, can you just give us some additional details on what was delaying the Champion acquisition for so long? It seems like you agreed to divest the downstream piece pretty early, and then it took quite a bit longer to get to agreement on the deepwater pieces that you had to get rid of.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Well, okay, I promise not to rant. I would say, I don't think businesses and the DOJ are supposed to see eye to eye on all these things. You're naturally set up to have differing views. So I guess that's probably not a big surprise that we had a differing view there. I think that's the way it's set up. With that said, I think the length of time was really that the area of concern for the DOJ was clearly Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, hence, the focus of the remedy. And then it was coming up with a remedy that satisfied, I think, conditions that the Department of Justice had laid out and doing it in a way that fundamentally could work. And that just -- that took some time. And I think we ended up satisfying their criteria and their requirements that they laid out very early and doing so in a way that certainly had an impact in our Deepwater Gulf of Mexico business but didn't have -- didn't resonate outside of that area of concern for the DOJ, i.e. it didn't impair us in other parts of the world or other markets. And that just took longer than we all hoped. I think the resolution, I'd rather not have had to do anything, of course. But I think the resolution has left us with a still very, very favorable deal from an economic, strategic, competitive standpoint.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","All right. And then just on the Food & Beverage side, is the FEMSA acquisition fully integrated at this point? And can you maybe, talk about how that acquisition improves your prospects in Latin American Food & Beverage?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. No, it's not completely integrated. I mean, it's still relatively new. What we think -- the long saga here is we have desired this business for a long, long period of time. We think it improves our position in a very important market. It extends our reach in important customers, enhances our ability to meet customer needs because it gives us a bigger footprint. I think that this is a perfect type of bolt-on acquisition that we seek, when we seek acquisitions like this. So I think this is going to be a very positive move for us. Our F&B team has been doing a great job in Latin America. I just think this gives them a bigger platform upon which to perform. So I would expect great things out of them.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Ritzenthaler with Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just I guess one question for me. If you could elaborate a little bit more, Doug, on Healthcare, which has been a key growth market for you that we've discussed in the past. Is the growth this quarter just optics on strong growth last year and therefore, kind of a temporary air pocket in terms of the long-term positive growth trend? Or is it more of an artifact of breaking through the procurement practices at the health care providers?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I guess what I would say, look, Healthcare is still an important business for us, and we still are excited about its growth prospects. So you referenced the base. Last year was a very good year. Healthcare was up about 12% in sales and almost high 20s in terms of OI last year. It had a very strong year. In '13, I guess, we expected stronger balance of the year than we saw in the first quarter, more of second half than first half. And we expect a decent full year; mid-single-digits growth, which is really reflective of organic growth; double-digit OI performance for the year. And so the drivers here, the health care environment is not ideal, either in North America or U.S. where we've got our large footprints. We think that may be the case for a couple of years. We don't think it is forever. We think we can still drive double-digit OI even in a lousy environment. So we think it's a positive contributor and quite accretive. And so, really, the story is going to be new business has got to swamp lousy environment, and they're on it and driving it, both in Europe and here. We've got very good innovation, brand-new hand care platform going out, strengthening our ability in central sterile and others. So long term, we like the fundamentals. We think this year will be solid, not spectacular. But ultimately, that market starts curing and certainly that market's a little upside down if you look at other health care earnings reports, right? Nobody's knocking it out of the park.","Operator","The next question comes from John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Just one quick question. Can we just review again why the focus on increasing field -- the field sales force in the Energy business line right here? And then how long will it take? Is it more of a productive focus on getting the Champion and the core Nalco businesses done? Or is it protecting some channel conflict? Just trying to get a little bit more color on why you're breaking that out this quarter.","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I think we talked about it. Simply, we've been increasing our field capabilities there. We've certainly adjusted our thinking once we announced Champion, but that was really fourth quarter of last year. So we're talking year-on-year comparisons in terms of field sales and the like. And so I guess I shared with you we've got very strong sales performance in our OFC, in our well business, and it's really muted somewhat by our downstream business. But we're investing in those businesses, and so we think the underlying sales rate in Energy was in the 12% to 13% rate in Q1, but we had a reported 7%. When you got that kind of dislocation, you can have some funny optics in terms of OI. I guess, I would just tell you that it's a 13-week period. That business is in good shape. It's going to deliver double-digit top and bottom line, and it just got bigger.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Doug, just once more on Energy. I guess, it looks like sequentially, you'd see a pretty dramatic pickup to get to that double-digit revenue run rate. So is there something about lumpiness in order trends in that business that expressed itself in the first quarter and comes back in the second quarter? And then you mentioned throwing more cost to the business. Is this purely headcount? Or are there some other costs that you're incurring?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I mean, look, the biggest issue you've got is, we had a reported 29% growth rate last year in the first quarter, and then it was in the teens for the balance of the year. So it's like a 10-point delta versus the next quarter. That is, frankly, the biggest part of the story. The underlying business and the absolute sales growth rate -- sales rate we think are very much in line with a teens-type delivery for the year, if you look at any more normalized year and normalized seasonality patterns. So we don't see any big hockey-stick ramp up or anything unusual. So the pattern is more normalized than it might appear, and it's really an unusual first-quarter comparison.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just -- I can clarify that. I meant last year, you had sequential growth of 2% first to second. If we normalized that first quarter, it would appear to be more of a high-single, low-double digit typical sequential move.","Douglas M. Baker","Sorry?","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'll ask you offline. And then, what about the cost basis in Energy that you mentioned? Is that headcount or is there more to it, the upfront investments?","Douglas M. Baker","No. It's mostly headcount.","Operator","Next question comes from John Roberts [ph] with UBS.","Unknown Analyst","Just a clarification question. Is mining a core part of Water, and it's just down? Or is it lumped with those other questionable areas of Water?","Douglas M. Baker","Mining's a core business, and it's a business that's been quite successful, and we anticipate will be very successful going forward. We only pull it out because mining is certainly more cyclical than the balance of the Water portfolio that you see in there. And so for us, we look at it with and without mining, and so we offer that as an understanding. Mining is under a little pressure, but we believe the business is going to perform well again this year.","Unknown Analyst","And then could you just give us a sense of the dispersion in the sales performance across some of the regional businesses? Was the weakest business European Institutional or was it European Paper? Or what was the weakest and what was the strongest? Was it the Global -- something in the Global Specialty looks like it would have been the strongest in some region?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, if I normalize for oddities in last year, which -- look, we won't talk about it anymore. Last year was our first quarter. You had all kinds of things going on, but I would say that the underlying worst business performance would have been, most likely, Institutional Europe. I mean, just foundational underlying performance. Under the most pressure, probably not a real surprise, but that would have been, if I normalize the other stuff, the red spot on our heat map.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Maybe I missed this is in the prepared remarks, but can you just update us on how you're thinking about the share repurchase now? I know we kind of -- you had to do the Champion deal strategically. But where does the share repurchase fit in? Is that something that you're feeling highly motivated to do? Or do you want to delever a little bit more before you approach that? Can you just give us some -- the philosophy there?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. No, we're committed to execute the remaining part of our share repurchase, which is roughly $280 million. And I think what we've said is we'll complete it by year-end. And we'll continue to work to be smart stewards of that money because it's shareholder money.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And just in terms of Nalco on the revenue synergy side. This year, you've got a much higher benchmark than 0. Doug, I was hoping you could give us some view on kind of what you feel like you've delivered? And how you feel you're tracking for this year.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Our target this year would be $75 million. I would say based on the stronger-than-expected start last year, I'd take the over, not the under on performance against that $75 million. I guess most importantly, we believe we are tracking to the $500 million that we talked about when we did the deal.","Operator","The next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just one question. I wanted to ask from an operational standpoint, with the delay of the Champion acquisition a number of times through the quarter, does that change anything operationally, internally with your guys in terms of impacting any of the growth rates or the way that they plan their time or the way that they're going to execute in their business?","Douglas M. Baker","No, not materially. I would say it's certainly -- I mean, look, we've gotten a delayed start in getting after the activity that drives, right, what we call synergies and\/or OI performance. And so that's always going to be back-half loaded or it takes time to develop, which is why our original $0.12 forecast turned into a $0.07 forecast, because we lost a little over 4 months, right, or 3 months, 3-plus months. And so that's really the story there as we go through it. Otherwise, no, I would say their execution's on. We worked hard to use that time wisely. I think the teams hit the blocks running. I mean, they're doing a very good job, they're on this. We're almost done. We will be this week with the kind of kickoff opening introductory meetings around the globe. And I think we've got a very clear line of sight of what the big activity areas are to drive value.","Operator","The next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","Eric Petrie","This is Eric Petrie in for P.J. Just in Energy, are double-digit sales and operating income sustainable in 2014? Or would you suspect some deceleration? We would think that enhanced oil recovery and upstream investment may slow with lower oil prices.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I would -- I guess our belief, when we look at our portfolio and what we have with Champion now, we expect double-digit sales and operating income next year too.","Eric Petrie","Okay. And then you said Champion was...","Douglas M. Baker","On a pro forma basis assuming we own Champion for the full year here. We're not trying to capture the 3-month gain.","Eric Petrie","Okay. And then you noted Champion was on the higher end of that range. In terms of that growth, was all of that organic? Or did they also partake, historically, in M&A or bolt-on acquisition?","Douglas M. Baker","No. I believe that was 100% organic. I don't believe there was any M&A in there. If it was, it was so de minimis, we haven't figured it out yet.","Operator","The next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli and Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","I will be quick. Just a little clarification. When you look at your estimate for 2013 and the fact that you are planning to complete the $280-million share repurchase by year-end, which amounts to about 3.4 million shares, are you calculating that estimate, Doug, with the share repurchase that you are planning to accomplish? Or is it based on the 307 million shares that you have currently?","Douglas M. Baker","No. The $280-million buyback is in our calculation, is in our EPS estimate.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And then if we look at the Champion contribution, so $0.07 this year. Is it fair to look at $0.15 next year, another $0.15 in '15, and then the last $0.13 in 2016 to get to the full $0.50? Is that kind of a good way of spreading it?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Why don't we redo and give our synergy targets by year. So this year, it's $25 million; '14, we expect $80 million; $125 million in '15; and then realize the full $150 million in '16.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And at this stage, of course, it is too early to know whether that $150 million is kind of the top of what you can get. Correct?","Douglas M. Baker","We're not changing our estimate right now, no. And I think I said when we gave the $150 million, that $150 million as a percent of the deal is a much more aggressive number than the $150 million obviously was for the overall Nalco deal. So our original estimate for Nalco was $150 million, which we quickly took up to $250 million, I mean, within months. I don't -- you're not going to see a move like that here. Whether our estimate is going to change at all, I don't know. It's 20 days.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Lawley [ph] with Barclays.","Unknown Analyst","Just quickly on the balance sheet side, could you maybe the just walk us through what the final financing for the Champion acquisition was? You did your $500-million bond issuance, but given that Slide 7 is as of the end of March, just walk us through what the balance sheet's going to look like, I guess, here at the end of April.","Michael Monahan","Yes, this is Mike Monahan. As you know, back in December, we secured $0.5 billion of 5-year debt. We took down $900 million in bank term loan, and the balance was through commercial paper.","Unknown Analyst","And the total number from cash proceeds, if I'm correct, is $1.7 billion, with the rest being equity. Is that right?","Michael Monahan","That's right.","Unknown Analyst","Got it. And then, again, as of March on Slide 7 or your cash balance, it looks a little bit high. Is some of that because there's commercial paper drawn, and you're going to use some of that cash balance? Just so as we think about the...","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. We were getting prepared to close on Champion.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, great. And then just one last one for me. Could you just, I guess, talk about, again, leverage targets and then just plans for deleveraging as we move through next couple of years? Has any of that changed as we sit here today from your previous targets of single A and 2x?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. They remain the same. It's to get down 2x debt to EBITDA ratio by end of 2014.","Unknown Analyst","And debt repayment remains a very high priority on your kind of cash priorities at this point other than maybe your $280 million of remaining share repurchases?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I would say it's exactly in line with what we previously forecast. So, yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeffrey Stafford with Morningstar.","Jeffrey Stafford - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Now that the Water business and Food & Beverage are in the same segment, I was hoping you could give an update on the cross-selling opportunity between these 2 businesses? I think before the companies combined, Nalco provided water treatment services to something like 20% of Ecolab's Food & Beverage customers. Has that percentage significantly changed now that you've had Nalco for a little while? Or is that still a longer-term proposition?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I guess, actually what we said was Nalco provided to 20% of the total food & beverage universe. That wasn't a complete overlap on what Ecolab was providing in that universe. We would say it's a pretty rich target area. The reason we were ahead on synergy sales last year was principally because this marriage is as attractive to customers as we thought it would be. We are developing technologies where we do an even better job leveraging 3D TRASAR, which is a legacy Nalco technology, which we are building into our core F&B portfolio, which is going to allow, if you will, kind of a synergistic view for our customers across the CIP cleaning in place platform of F&B as it moves towards wastewater, so that we know how to repurpose water, how we can minimize water and how we can do a number of other things. So it's going to end up to be, what I will call as a single offering that gives us much better visibility for our customers. And that's exactly what we're developing. When that's out, I think we're going to see even more dramatic improvement in the synergy sales.","Operator","The next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Barclays.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just one quick follow-up. I wanted to get from you the amortization from Champion. Is that going to be within the Energy segment? Or is that going to be broken out in Corporate like it was with the Nalco amortization?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. We'll break it out in Corporate simply because we want to understand what the underlying business is doing.","Operator","I would now like to go ahead and turn the call over back over to Mr. Monahan for closing comments.","Michael Monahan","Well, that wraps up our first quarter conference call.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Michael Monahan","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's first quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO. A copy of our earnings release and accompanying slides referenced in this teleconference are available in Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor. Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on Slide 2 stating that this teleconference and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our first quarter earnings release and on Slide 2. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release. ","Also, please note that in order to provide a meaningful comparison of our results of operations, where applicable, actual results for the first quarter of 2012 are compared against pro forma results for the first quarter of 2011. The pro forma results are based on historical consolidated financial statements of Ecolab and Nalco and were prepared to illustrate the effects of our merger with Nalco. These pro forma statements are available on our website at ecolab.com\/investor, as well as our Form 8-K filed April 27, 2012, and selected portions are contained in the slides and press release. ","Starting with an overview in Slide 3, we delivered strong results in the first quarter, our initial period including all of Nalco's operations, as we beat our forecast. We leveraged our sales volume growth and pricing, as well as our synergy and cost efficiency work, to offset significantly higher delivered product cost and produced yet another solid double-digit increase in our adjusted earnings per share. ","Looking ahead, we expect to continue to outperform our combined markets and show good earnings gains in the second quarter and stronger EPS growth in the second half and the full year as strong sales growth, appropriate pricing, innovation, synergies and margin leverage more than offset expected moderate increases in delivered product cost as well as offset the impact of higher depreciation and amortization charges from the merger. Further, we expect 2012 will be our 10th year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth in the last 11, and we will do so while setting up strong growth for the years ahead. ","Moving to some highlights from the quarter and as discussed in our press release, reported first quarter earnings per share were $0.17. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, first quarter 2012 earnings per share increased 11% to $0.50, which beat the top end of our $0.46 to $0.49 forecasted range. The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by strong volume and pricing gains, new products and new accounts, which, along with synergy and cost savings actions, more than offset higher delivered product costs. ","We enjoyed very strong sales growth in our Global Energy and Latin America operations, as well as solid growth from Global Water, worldwide Food & Beverage and our U.S. Institutional business. ","We continue to be aggressive, focusing on accelerating our top line growth as we emphasize our innovative product and service strengths to help drive increased market share in our core businesses, as well as new account acquisition across all of our customer segments. We also continue to implement appropriate price increases to help offset higher delivered product cost.","We remain focused on expanding our margins, emphasizing productivity and efficiency improvements, to help increase profitability as well as drive merger synergies. ","We also continue to make investments in key growth businesses, as well as bolt-on acquisitions, to build future growth. Our work to integrate Ecolab and Nalco is going very well. The combination is working smoothly, and we have not experienced any significant surprises since we closed the merger. ","We continue to be focused on our business and excited about the opportunities the combined company offers our customers, as well as our position as the leader in additional high-growth markets that leverage our mutual core strengths in product technology and sales and service execution. We look for the second quarter to show solid sales growth and further margin improvement. This strong business performance will continue to be impacted by the much higher depreciation and amortization expense from our merger. ","Second quarter adjusted EPS is expected to increase 8% to 13% to the $0.69 to $0.72 range and compare with adjusted EPS of $0.64 earned by legacy Ecolab in the second quarter 2011. We expect the quarterly earnings growth rate to accelerate in the second half as the higher fixed depreciation and amortization and interest expense are offset by business growth, the increasing benefits from synergies and cost reductions and by seasonally higher revenues. We continue to look for our full year earnings per share to rise 16% to 20% to the $2.95 to $3.05 range. ","In summary, we expect 2012 to reflect another strong performance by Ecolab as we show accelerating quarterly earnings gains to once again deliver very attractive growth and shareholder returns this year and set the stage for improved results in the years ahead.","Slide 4 shows our first quarter results, both as reported and pro forma, with adjustments for special gains and charges, while Slide 5 shows our sales growth detail. Ecolab's reported consolidated sales for the first quarter increased 85% compared with last year's reported results and reflected the merger with Nalco. When compared with first quarter 2011 pro forma sales, including the impact of Nalco, fixed currency sales rose a very strong 9%. ","Looking at the pro forma fixed currency growth components, volume and mix increased 6%, pricing rose almost 3%, acquisitions and divestitures did not have a significant impact and currency decreased sales by nearly 1%, rounding accounts for the difference in the total. ","Reported sales for the U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing operations rose 4%. Adjusted for the transfer of water treatment-related businesses to the Global Water segment, U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing sales increased 7%. Excluding acquisitions, these sales grew 6%. ","Institutional sales grew 6% in the first quarter. Sales initiatives targeting new accounts and effective product and service programs continue to lead our results and outperform mixed end markets. First quarter sales also benefited by an estimated 1 percentage point from distributor inventory building. Lodging room demand continues to show good growth, while Foodservice foot traffic remains soft. To drive our growth and improve on our industry leadership, we're introducing more new products that deliver increased value and reduce labor, water and energy cost for customers in our warewashing, laundry and housekeeping markets. We will showcase a number of these innovations at the upcoming National Restaurant Show in May. ","We also continue to increase our customer focus and service intimacy through sales force investments, simplified structures, marketing initiatives and improved field [ph] technology. Institutional continues to show very good fundamental trends, leveraging improving markets and market share gains, while the second quarter is expected to show a more modest sales increase than the first quarter, reflecting the expected impact of the first quarter inventory build on second quarter shipments. In comparison to the rollout of new products and programs in the year-ago period, we expect our growth drivers will deliver improved gains in the balance of the year for Institutional and will once again outperform its markets in 2012. ","Kay's first quarter sales increased 1%. As mentioned in our last conference call, first quarter 2012 Kay sales reflected the timing of shipments to major quick service accounts that benefited the fourth quarter but hurt the first quarter. We continue to look for our full year Kay sales to rise in the mid- to upper single digits, similar to the past several years, which have also seen quarterly growth rate variations for similar reasons. ","The Food Retail business rose modestly in the quarter, but it has booked significant new business, which should benefit future periods. We look for the second quarter to show a much better growth and expect continued good new account gains in food retail, along with quick service sales, to drive another solid year of growth for Kay in 2012. ","Healthcare sales increased 24%. Excluding the acquisition of O.R. Solutions, sales increased 5% as good growth from hand hygiene, environmental hygiene and surgical drapes offset continuing soft U.S. healthcare industry market trends. We continue to see steady new account gains from our product innovation and investments in new sales productivity tools. Further, O.R. Solutions continues to show strong growth. Looking ahead, second quarter sales are expected to show steady organic sales gains. ","Food & Beverage sales grew 7%. Sales increased in all segments, led by corporate account wins, pricing and product penetration. Food & Beverage will continue to focus on new account acquisition, pricing and new product sales to show good growth in the second quarter of 2012. ","Sales for our U.S. Other Services rose 4% in the first quarter. Pest Elimination sales continue to improve, rising 4%. Growth was led by stronger gains in Food Processing and Hospitality, improved results in the Foodservice segment and robust growth in add-on service sales. ","We continue to drive new product and program solutions to better meet our customer needs and differentiate our offerings. Recent new program launches like Guardian Plus for full-service restaurants and bed bug treatments for the non-hospitality markets, such as long-term care, retail and restaurants, are showing good results. We're also preparing to launch new offerings for hospitality, bed bugs and large fly services in 2012. We expect our new products and programs, along with aggressive selling and improved service levels, to yield continued sales gains in 2012. ","Sales for GCS increased 4% in the quarter, and profitability once again improved. New account wins and appropriate pricing helped to drive the sales gain. We're seeing good results from the chain account relationships as we drive sales to the regional and franchise organizations. We expect GCS to show stronger sales growth and continued profit improvement in the second quarter and in 2012. ","Measured in fixed currencies, sales for International Cleaning, Sanitizing and Other Services increased 3%. Adjusted for the transfer of water treatment to the Global Water segment, sales increased 5%. Europe, Middle East and Africa fixed currency sales rose 2% in the first quarter. Europe's Institutional first quarter sales showed a modest increase. The business -- new business gains among regional and local customers leveraged new product introductions but were offset by weak demand, primarily in the Mediterranean and in Ireland. ","Food & Beverage sales increased moderately, reflecting market share gains. Food & Beverage continues to focus on corporate accounts and emphasizing the cost savings benefits of our innovative products. ","Fixed Healthcare sales declined in the first quarter, reflecting very weak markets. We are using new products and technology like lower-temperature washing to offset these market trends. Europe Healthcare sales showed good gains, led by contamination control and infection prevention sales.","Pest Europe sales showed a modest increase as the continued focus on corporate accounts and new programs, along with continued operational improvements, yielded the gain. Our work to improve operating efficiency in our Europe business continues to show good progress. Recent projects underway include consolidating offices and facilities in several countries to improve productivity and reduce costs, consolidation and realignment of manufacturing and distribution centers and a further consolidation of raw material suppliers in order to reduce complexity and leverage purchasing. More projects will be launched in future quarters. ","Looking ahead, we expect Europe's second quarter to show continued modest fixed currency sales growth as it works through the softening and very challenging European business environment.","Asia-Pacific sales grew 6% in fixed currencies on a pro forma basis. Accelerated growth in mature markets more than offset the moderate deceleration in emerging market growth. Institutional sales showed good growth. New programs and a focus on restaurant and lodging expansion in the emerging Asian markets benefited sales. Food & Beverage sales also enjoyed good organic growth. New account sales and improved product penetration led the increase. Looking ahead, Asia-Pacific expects continued strong sales growth in the second quarter.","First quarter sales for Ecolab's Canadian operations increased 10% at fixed currency rates as strong growth in the core businesses drove results. Latin America reported strong sales gains, growing 18%. Adjusted for the Brazil Pest acquisition, Latin America grew 15% in fixed currencies as Institutional, Food & Beverage and Pest Elimination each grew at double digit rates. Institutional growth was driven by new accounts and continued success with global and regional customers. Food & Beverage sales reflected continued strong demand in the beverage and brewing markets, as well as the benefits of new accounts and investments in key sales areas. Pest Elimination showed double-digit sales gain and strengthened its growth opportunities through the acquisition in Brazil. Looking ahead, Latin America expects continued double-digit growth in the second quarter.","Fixed currency Global Water sales increased 6% in the first quarter compared with 2011 pro forma results. This includes certain water treatment-related sales transferred from the U.S. and international segments. Adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures, fixed currency water sales increased 8%. Sales growth was led by double-digit gains in Mining, Power, Food & Beverage and Primary Metals, reflecting strong emerging markets growth, market share gains and differentiated technologies. ","Regionally, we saw double-digit growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific, with strong growth in North America and a modest increase in Europe. We expect lower growth in the second quarter as market share gains and steady growth elsewhere are tempered by somewhat slower primary metals worldwide and light manufacturing in Europe and Asia and as the business compares with a strong period last year, which also included a large onetime wastewater project sale. We look for sales growth to pick up again in the second half.","First quarter fixed currency global sales for Paper grew 2%, with price more than offsetting a slight volume decline. Further penetration with differentiated technology offset generally lackluster customer plant utilization rates outside the U.S. Good growth in North America was partially offset by sales declines in Asia-Pacific, which was primarily impacted by packaging customer downtime, and in Latin America, which compared against a very strong period last year. We expect second quarter sales to be flat against the strong quarter last year as new business growth and generally stable market conditions offset slow conditions in Asia.","Measuring fixed currencies, pro forma Global Energy sales grew an outstanding 29%, reflecting continued strong volume growth in upstream and market share gains in downstream. The very strong double-digit growth in our upstream business was a result of robust markets and share gains with deepwater accounts and continued strong sales to oil sands, the Middle East and Africa. Strong double-digit growth in our downstream business reflected share gains in the Middle East and Asia.","We expect Energy segment to be in the high teens for the second quarter as continued strength in the conventional business is partially offset by the temporary impact of unconventional drilling, shifting its focus in drilling assets to oil and away from natural gas, and as downstream growth returns to more typical mid- to high single digits, reflecting moderated global refinery demand. We expect conventional markets to remain very attractive and that Energy will show strong growth over the balance of the year. ","Slide 6 of our presentation shows selective income statement items comparing reported 2012 with pro forma 2011 information to allow more meaningful comparisons. Reported first quarter gross margins were 42.6%. Adjusted for the impact of special gains and charges, 2012 gross margins were 45.3%. When compared with first quarter 2011 adjusted pro forma results, 2012 gross margins decreased 90 basis points. The decrease in the adjusted gross margin primarily reflected the impact of higher delivered product cost, which more than offset the impact of volume and pricing gains from a gross margin perspective.","In absolute dollar terms, pricing exceeded the higher delivered product cost in the first quarter. Reported SG&A expenses represented 35.2% of sales. When compared with 2011 pro forma results, 2012 SG&A expenses declined 180 basis points below last year. Leverage from the sales gains and cost savings efforts led the improvement. ","Reported operating income for Ecolab's U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing segment grew 15%. Adjusted for the transfer of water treatment to the Global Water segment, operating income increased 11% compared with first quarter 2011 pro forma operating income.","Excluding acquisitions, U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing segment operating income rose 6%. Volume and pricing gains more than offset higher delivered product cost in the quarter. Operating income for U.S. Other Services declined 6% as continued improvement in our GCS business profitability was offset by investments made in the EcoSure quality assurance field sales organization. ","International fixed currency operating income increased 10% versus last year. Adjusted for the transfer of water treatment to the Global Water segment, operating income increased 12%. Margins improved as volume and pricing gains and improved cost efficiencies more than offset higher delivered product cost. Global Water operating income grew 11% in fixed currencies compared to pro forma results. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, Water's operating income grew 27%, led by higher volumes and pricing, which more than offset higher delivered product cost. ","Global Paper operating income declined 9% in fixed currencies as pricing was more than offset by higher delivered product and other costs. ","Global Energy operating income grew a remarkable 53% in fixed currencies, led by the strong volume gain, operating leverage and pricing, which more than offset higher delivered product cost. ","The Corporate segment and tax rate are discussed in the press release. We repurchased 1.4 million shares during the first quarter. The net of this performance is that Ecolab has reported first quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.17 compared with $0.40 reported a year ago. When adjusted for special gains and charges and discrete tax items in both years, adjusted earnings increased 11% to $0.50 when compared with $0.45 earned a year ago. ","Turning to Slide 7, Ecolab's balance sheet reflected the impacts of the Nalco merger. Total debt-to-total capital of 52% at March 31 compared with 35% reported a year ago. Our net debt was 50%. ","In April, we made a $150 million voluntary contribution to the U.S. pension plan. Looking ahead and as outlined in Slide 8, we continue to take aggressive actions to drive both our top and bottom lines. Expanding our market share and customer penetration as one company, among major accounts, leveraging our leadership positions in key growth markets in Food, Water, Energy and Healthcare. We are using innovation and pricing to benefit margins and expect to more than offset delivered product cost throughout 2012.","Our merger synergies, along with Europe's transformation work, continues to go well, and we expect to deliver on these aggressive goals while building growth for the future. As also described in our press release, we look for the second quarter results to show mid- to upper-single-digit sales gains led by Global Energy and our Latin America operations. This solid business performance will again be impacted by the much higher depreciation and amortization and interest expense, as well as increased share count from our merger. Adjusted second quarter earnings per share are forecast to increase to the $0.69 to $0.72 range, up 18% (sic) [18%] to 13% compared with the adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 earned last year. However, we expect the quarterly earnings growth rate to accelerate through the balance of 2012 as the higher fixed depreciation and amortization and interest expense and shares are offset by the benefits of growth from the underlying business, seasonally higher revenues, the moderating impact from higher delivered product cost and increasing synergies and cost reductions. As a result, we continue to look for 2012 full year adjusted EPS to increase 16% to 20% to the $2.95 to $3.05 range.","In summary, as noted on Slide 9, we once again delivered on our forecast in the first quarter while offsetting higher-than-expected delivered product costs and while still investing in our future. We look for sales and profit growth to accelerate to 2012's quarter and produce another strong year and make it our 10th year of adjusted double-digit EPS growth of the last 11 years.","That concludes our formal comments. As a final note before Q&A, we plan to hold our annual tour of our booth at the National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago next week on May 7. If you have any questions, please contact me or Nicole at my office. ","And now here's Doug Baker with some comments.","Douglas M. Baker","Good afternoon. Look, I'll make this short, and then we'll open it up for Q&A. I just wanted to add a couple of thoughts. So clearly, we feel good about the start we've had to the year. And as you can see from the forecast, we continue to forecast a very strong year. ","Integration is going very well either on a quantitative or qualitative basis. The teams are coming together well. We are on track on our synergy targets, et cetera. So almost on any metric, we feel good about the progress there. ","Just as importantly, I could even argue more importantly, our team has absolutely kept its eye on the business, with a very good Q1 result, particularly when you look at growth. We had excellent new business results, which you don't see, which really bodes quite well for the remainder of the year and for next year, considerably higher than last year both on legacy Ecolab and legacy Nalco basis, so excellent pace. ","We're also on pace for a record new program launches this year and have a number of large initiatives going out, which also is an important driver, as you all know, for gross profit improvement. ","So as a result, we feel very good about our ability to deliver on the year. Our forecast for the year is 16% to 20% EPS growth. And in spite of troubled economies and raw material headwinds, I think we are again on pace to have an excellent year. ","So with that as a backdrop, I'll open it up for questions and turn it back to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Doug, just on your 2012 guidance, you didn't raise the low end despite beating Q1. Just comment on your thinking about the guidance for the full year given some of the macro headwinds you're seeing in Europe.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Dave, I guess I would call it -- I wouldn't try to read much into this. We have aggressive guidance out there in terms of 16% to 20%. And there's certainly a lot of uncertainty and a lot of time left to play in the year. We feel very confident in our ability to hit, or we would have moved it the other way. We don't raise guidance frequently in this call, and so I really would just say given the nature of the economic situation in parts, raw materials and the rest, we thought discretion was probably the smart play. We are committed to driving this business forward, and we have got a team all over the key issues. So we feel good about the position we're in and what we're going to do this year.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But just on the Paper business, as you get to know that business and the results are pretty weak, is this a long-term keeper in the portfolio in your mind?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, David. The only thing is we don't get into big M&A. I think we have a lot of questions about this post-announcement of the deal and pre-close, and I would say 2 things. One, the reason that we felt Nalco was such a fit was really the real strength in water technologies, and as we all shared, we came to really appreciate and understand the strategic value that Nalco brought historically, and in the future, to energy. Paper is a good business, and we always said that we weren't going to get to evaluating Paper at the onset. Our real focus right now is make sure we continue to drive forward. Get integration right, which I think we're doing a great job on, and making sure we focus on driving the fundamentals in the business: new customers, new innovation, taking care of the team, and all those metrics look good. That's the focus for this year.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just lastly, Energy. I know these results aren't sustainable at these levels, but how much stronger can this business be than it was the last couple of years?","Douglas M. Baker","Energy has been -- if you go back, and we spent a lot of time understanding the history, some 5, 6 years ago, they embarked on a strategy, which has proven to be one, very smart and extremely well-executed. That's a good combo. It was really going after, for lack of a better term, the new oil for a couple of reasons, right? It's easier to get the business at the onset versus trying to kick somebody out of an already drilled well. And number two, new oil is going to command much more of the technology that Nalco sells. So in terms of a smart strategy in driving share, it was exactly on, and that team delivered against it excellently. That story is not over. And so I don't care if it's tar sands or other unconventional oil, right? These areas and this kind of development is going to require more of the technology that Nalco sells. If you look at year-on-year growth last year, they clearly accelerated throughout the year. And as you look at it, the base is going to get more challenging as we go through the year. First quarter last year, organic was around 15%, and the fourth quarter last year for them was around 24%. So clearly, you're going to be climbing a bit of a base. So that business, we expect to continue to perform very well. We do not expect to regularly put up 29% growth there. We never talked about 29% as the target growth rate, and so we don't expect it. But we do expect a long period of double-digit growth, right? And a very, very good growth in the following quarters this year.","Operator","Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit -- you guys recently announced some -- what felt like more aggressive pricing actions to combat the raw material price runup. I was wondering if you could talk about the dynamics there and how that's going in terms of acceptance and kind of flow through to the customers?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, Nate. This is, I guess, a strategy that the Water businesses deployed for a while, which is make sure that the broad customer base understands the raw material implications and the rest. And so it's not new for the Water business, whereas it may be viewed as something unique for Ecolab. But if people have plays that work well, we're not going to get in the way. I'd say it's too early to tell, but pricing in general has been a focus. It was a focus for the Water and Energy businesses last year. They successfully implemented pricing, which is why you're starting to see the margins come back in those businesses and you see the outsized earnings performance. It's exactly what we thought was going on in that business when we talked to the market post-announcement, so we feel good about that. So yes, Water is on pricing. Energy is on pricing. Institution is on pricing. F&B is on pricing. We do not have a business that's not out there, making sure that they are regularly pushing price as they must in this environment. We do not expect raw material inflation to abate long term. We think we are in an inflationary environment raw materials for the rest of our careers. That's our assumption. It's not a bad thing because if you look at our ability, we have grown OI margin in this inflationary period, I think, every year in the last 5, 6 years. So we don't mind the environment. We just have to continue to execute in it. We think the Energy and Water execution last year was quite good, and all they're doing is looking at continuing that execution.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick kind of follow-up here. Minus kind of the pull forward end of the first quarter from the second quarter on some of the distributor levels, how do you feel in general about those inventory levels currently minus that issue at the distribution level? And then I'll turn it over.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I don't think there's any major issue there. It's kind of this quarter-to-quarter stuff. Institutional had a very good first quarter, and I would say if you look at 2 things, importantly, as we've talked, we really focus on the field sales, i.e. consumption. Consumption is continuing to improve there. We had a quarter where the reported was marginally above field sales because there's a little inventory build, but Institutional has gotten itself back in organic 6% to 8% growth range, and we'll continue to see it. Kay has some noise sometimes quarter to quarter. We are not worried about Kay. Kay had an unbelievable first quarter result in terms of new business. And so we know that's exactly what Kay needs to do. They hunt elephants, so you will start seeing that reflected in Kay's results as they go out and install these customers.","Operator","Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess the first question, just any update on the European margin outlook and growth for the legacy Ecolab? Are the targets you've laid out in the past still sustainable? Is the weaker economic activity going to make that more challenging to get this year?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I would. So Gary, we talked about we needed at least 2% growth, right, to see the types of OI margin improvement that we committed to last year in January, when we rolled out what we call internally the Renaissance [ph] program. And that's what we're still seeing. And we still believe that that's the right expectation for the balance of the year is in that range. And so if you look around, not many people had volume increase in the first quarter. I mean, ours is nominal admittedly, but we continue to see some strength, or at least we're holding on the top line. Our expectation for the year is absolutely, we will see year-on-year improvement in operating income margins. Our team there is absolutely committed and continues to forecast in line with our previous commitment of 200 basis points. If I were going to hedge it all, I would say I'm pretty confident the team has got 100 in hand and is fighting up from there. So we aren't really backing off from our commitment. We are going to go drive for 200. I'm absolutely confident we're going to see sizable increases. We hope it's 200.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And how does integrating the Nalco businesses -- I know they're run sort of globally at each of the level. But how does integrating that in Europe help the ability to do this? Are there a lot of synergies there within the total synergies you're talking about for the total transaction?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, there are. They're not going to be -- we also said -- I would say this is more probably next year and the follow-on years. But absolutely, look, you've got office buildings in every major European capital for both businesses. We don't need to -- I mean, it doesn't sound like a lot, but this stuff starts adding up sizably. You got back-office support for both businesses. We're already developing both of these independently, the ability to consolidate these operations, so now we can probably accelerate that. There will be some manufacturing and we already are seeing some purchasing synergies. You've got 2 principal companies in Switzerland, which will go down to one and a bunch of expats in both. So there are real synergy opportunities there that is not in the 100, 200 basis points I just talked about. That would be over and above. But realistically, that's going to be more a story next year, not this year.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last question for me. I wanted to get a sense how you're thinking about returns these days. I know you've always been proud of the decades-long 20% return on beginning equity, and it seems to me that's probably unlikely this year given what the acquisition did to the shareholders' equity. Is there another metric you'll look to? Any sense on how quickly you'd get back to that level or any other return measure that you're using to gauge your success in 2012 or '13?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I'd say a couple of things, Gary. I mean, certainly, we've got a new base, and it reflects a number of accounting charges that we're recognizing, which are noncash. But it's a base, nonetheless. And our expectation is you're going to start seeing year-on-year increases in our returns even from this base. I would say the base certainly isn't reflective of cash returns on the business, which everyone here fully understands. And I think in our disclosure, people are interested in those calculations. They'll have the information from us to go calculate them. Now that's preference. We are going to look at both internally and making sure we're doing what we need to do to get the cash return on these investment as well as, long term, the public return numbers.","Operator","Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","A couple of questions, if I may. First of all, can you talk about the profit improvement at the GLS business -- or GCS business, I should say, whether you want to bracket it off of last quarter or a year ago quarter? Can you give us an idea of where the profitability in that business lies on now?","Douglas M. Baker","I'll be real quick, Dmitry. We lost about $150,000 in that nature first quarter. I think we had signaled, or I had, that first quarter is always, because of the low volume, right, we're going to be right around 0, which is where it ended up. It was considerably better than last year first quarter. And I would say certainly can be in business. It'll make money this year.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So you would expect that to kind of get back up, profitability-wise, to where you start comping positive or continue to comp positive year-over-year at least?","Douglas M. Baker","Oh, yes, I mean, it comped positive even in this quarter versus last quarter. It's just a low-volume quarter, so you're down at the water level, right, basically. Now we fully expect Q2, 3 and 4 all to be profitable and profitable for the year.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. Okay. Secondly, can you talk about the foreign exchange impact by region for the International operations? You provided the ex-FX revenue number. Can you give us the consolidated revenue number or growth, however you want to present it?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Why don't we do this, if you want real details, negative in Europe, positive in the balance, but pretty minor when you get down to it. And if you want some specific detail, Mike would be happy to provide it.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Fair enough. Your corporate exchange rate -- or I'm sorry, not your exchange rate, your corporate expenses, what sort of a magnitude number should we think about quarterly? I mean, is what you did in the first quarter pretty characteristic, or is there a lot of fluctuation in that number? I'm just not that familiar with the seasonality of Nalco's corporate expense portion.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, about what you saw in the first quarter is what you're going to see for the year. I think the forecast for the year is 230, in that range.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So it's basically kind of sort of mid-double digit in terms of millions of dollars?","Michael Monahan","Well, we're saying it'd be around the same level here, around the $50 million, $55 million.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Right, so mid-double digits?","Michael Monahan","Right.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. And then just can you refresh my memory? I must have been -- I don't know what happened why I missed it. But you're no longer reporting the Textile Care and the Vehicle Care performance. Has that been folded into other divisions? Should we be keeping track of it within other businesses now?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, it's in the total. I think it was just frankly how -- we're running out of space on the page. What we're trying to do is make sure we don't knock off businesses, which are, we think, of most interest to our investors...","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Sure, sure, I understand that.","Douglas M. Baker","And everything, but nothing else there. I mean, Vehicle Care business was down in the quarter, but we expect it was really mostly temporary. Here is where good weather hurts. Vehicle Care needs the perfect weather pattern, but we didn't have it. But for the year, the Vehicle Care business is fine. Textile was roughly flat.","Operator","Edward Yang with Oppenheimer.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","The first -- did you buy back any shares in the quarter, and what was the dollar amount?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, we bought back 1.4 million shares.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the inventory build that you saw in the first quarter in Institutional, was there anything that -- why was the customer doing that? Was that in response to any promotions, or were they anticipating price increases?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I would say when they reduce inventory, we don't have terrific answers for you because it's not our decision and I don't have any great ones. It wasn't inducement. I would just say some of this is just kind of year-on-year noise in a quarter. It's a 13-week period. Their measurement of periods don't always coincide with ours, so you get some of this. But we want to call it out when it helps us, when it's favorable as well as unfavorable. The Institutional business underneath has strengthened, like, 5 quarters in a row. We feel very good about the momentum that that business has built, and so we're going to have some of these optic things here and there. But I would say the fundamentals there have improved and are improving, and a lot of it is great work by the Institutional team.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And along that vein, Doug, Pest also continues its improvement 3 straight quarters of acceleration there. Now it's growing 4% again. Historically, it's growing faster than that, so what do you expect out of Pest this year?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. No, I appreciate that. Pest has been, as we've said, one of our frustration points because it took us too long to rekindle top line growth. And we stated a couple of times last year that was the real focus. I think the good news is the team's efforts are starting to show up in top line performance. So I'd say we would expect for the year mid-type of single digit-type growth from them. But I think the fundamentals underneath, they are also improving in terms of lost business ratios versus new business ratios. And so that business, we feel, is starting to get traction and feel better about it. Ultimately, we don't have any reason to believe that it's not still upper-single-digit, low-double-digit type growth business. And we aim to get it back there.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And finally, I know Nalco, in the past, had some issues -- timing issues with propylene and raw materials versus their pricing. That was up -- propylene was up a lot in the first quarter. It looks like it's starting to get back down. Is there a way to quantify the sort of tailwinds from an earnings standpoint that you would see with some of your pricing catching up to the raws and maybe even some benefit from a decline in some of the raw materials sequentially?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I guess what I would say, we go pick on any raw. Propylene is maybe 2% of what we buy in total as a corporation. So you just got a much bigger pool here in terms of raw material purchase. I think if you really want to go in the broad basket, if you look at what we forecast and expectations, by and large, our forecast matches pretty much with what we had planned for the year. We had stated last year that we were going to relook at methodology for forecasting, either we're getting lucky, but really, as we go through the year, we feel we got a pretty good handle on where this is going to be, and we don't expect it to be a real broadcast story.","Operator","David Ridley-Lane with Merrill Lynch.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on the revenue synergy that you're getting from the integration with Nalco. Can you guys provide an update on the cross-selling results?","Douglas M. Baker","We had a very bullish forecast this year of 0, which we've been called a few times probably for good reasons. I guess the point was the gestation period of this type of work is longer, clearly, than cost synergies, so we will be 0. We already have quite a number of wins. They certainly didn't impact first quarter, but we are on this, I would say we have very favorable reception. We are learning how to put these together in a way that makes the most sense for our customer and drives the most value, what a lot of this early sales work is. And I would say that's where we're concentrating right now on is how do you drive maximum value with the combo, and there's great benefit here. And I would say early work is quite positive, but I don't think this is going to determine or have a real bearing on our year. It is going to be important for '13, '14, '15.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure. And then given the operating leverage at Nalco and the strong revenue growth there, I'm just wondering, what does capacity utilization look like for Nalco?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I would say -- meaning, is there a bunch of upside increased utilization? I'm sorry, I'm not tracking.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure, sure. I wasn't clear there. I'm wondering if you're running out of capacity utilization because that division has definitely delivered in the first quarter. And so I'm wondering how much you're running it. Are you running third shifts, or do you still have a little leeway?","Douglas M. Baker","I got it. I understand the question. I'm sorry. Yes, it's a very fair question. I would say we have already approved in February board meeting a new plant for the Energy business as a result of this. And it was a plant that was foreseen for a while. We had talked about it even when we announced the deal that this was capacity that was needed. So the first board meeting we had as a combined company, we approved it, and so it's already underway. I would say we've got, we think, adequate plans in hand to meet the demand needs and capacity needs of that business. There is capacity. The manufacturing teams on both sides have done a good job finding more capacity near term. But long term, we think we're okay.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just one last one, if I could. The pricing momentum we've seen here in the first quarter results appears to me to be pretty sustainable for the balance of the year. Would you kind of agree, or do you see things that would cause pricing to slow in the back half?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I think we expect that we will continue to have success gaining new pricing from customers as we go throughout the year. You start running into a higher base when you start doing percentage comparisons, but aside from that, I would agree. We anticipate and we will continue to build pricing throughout the year.","Operator","Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Lucy Watson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Lucy on for Laurence today. You got into 200-plus basis point sequential improvement in the SG&A to sales metric for Q2. I'm just wondering, I guess, how much of that improvement you would attribute to restructuring efforts in your core business versus synergies or price or maybe other factors that I've not included there.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, you get -- when you got this macro number, you have a number of businesses, regions, all adding up into this number. So we don't have a simple build for you as we go through this. Certainly, you're starting to see some synergies, particularly on the corporate G&A side, no doubt are having an impact here. But we have not stopped driving productivity in our core businesses in any of them, the Water, Energy, Institutional or F&B. In long term, that's the work that's most fundamental to driving improved SG&A ratios. So that is still underway, growing technology, rolling out. If anything, there's going to be real synergies and leveraging each other's technologies to drive further improvement in productivity long term.","Lucy Watson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And going back to the U.S. Institutional business quickly, do you expect to continue to benefit from the distributor inventory restocking that you noted into Q2, or was the lumpiness that you discussed earlier meant to imply that, that was just a Q1 benefit?","Douglas M. Baker","If anything, our guess is that it flips the other way in Q2 and probably gets offset there. It's a guess, it's an educated one, but that's our -- that's what our belief is.","Lucy Watson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one last one, if I may. Your appetite for paying down debt?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, what we've said our focus is right now is make sure we operate the businesses. We still have bolt-on acquisitions. The biggest way we're going to improve the debt ratio long term is by improving EBITDA, and that's going to be the primary focus. Well, we will end up doing some debt paydown. It'll become a focus next year, in '13.","Operator","Mark Gulley with Gulley & Associates.","Mark R. Gulley - Gulley & Associates LLC","My question regards something which may be a little bit in the future with respect to Nalco Energy, which -- it looks like it's hitting on all cylinders, and I'm referring now to ways to play natural gas frac-ing. It involves water. Water is right up your power alley for both sides of the company. And there's a lot of talk now that recycling is going to be a much better solution than reinjection. Can you talk a bit about, Doug, about what work Nalco might be doing there and whether or not what I'm talking about seems real to you?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, we would agree. And I think that's true, certainly, in energy and frac-ing, the example you used. But that is also true in the industrial space broadly that the big initiatives in Water need to be how do you create processes which reduce water use to start and then how do you recycle and reuse the water that's still coming out the back end of whatever process you are, whether it's frac-ing, whether it's an industrial process, across the board. So that is a focus area. The frac-ing, specifically, we agree. I mean, there's a number of things that are being worked on along that line, which is -- a lot of the water is coming back out. How do you manage it and handle it? Most of the frac-ing-related contamination concerns you have are really related to post-use water. It becomes groundwater and seeps down 200 feet. It's not the frac-ing water 5,000 feet down, moving up 40, 800 feet, if you will. And so that's an important area, I think, broadly, for that industry because it addresses a key concern and enables them, frankly, to reduce costs in their frac-ing operations because otherwise, you're trucking water in mostly to these operations, which is quite expensive, and neighbors don't like it. It's a big production.","Mark R. Gulley - Gulley & Associates LLC","As kind of a follow-up, I seem to recall that Nalco had headquartered it's energy operations in the Middle East on the assumption that's where the growth was, and I'm wondering if given what I just talked about here and other factors, whether or not it makes sense to, perhaps, reverse that decision going forward.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I mean, look, Steve Taylor and the management team there are excellent, a broad team. And I would say that's really for that team to go figure out. Steve is the guy on airplanes, and those kind of calls, I mean, we work with them, but really, to me, that's the Energy team's call.","Operator","John Roberts with Buckingham Research.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","The TRASAR monitoring system at Nalco is one of the key synergy things. Will you feature that at the NRA next week? Is that maybe your first opportunity to try to pitch that to your Institutional clients?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, the immediate benefit that we see leveraging TRASAR in what I'll call historic Ecolab businesses is really much more in the F&B space. Then next would be in the Textile Care and some of the other. And so that's the immediate focus, and there's a lot of work being done around that specifically. And so when I was asked earlier about growth synergies, it's really how do you best tie in the technology, leverage the technology and put the service elements together to bring maximum benefit to customers. And TRASAR is at the center of that. It is excellent technology.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So you don't see it for your large hotel customers and so forth who might be at NRA?","Douglas M. Baker","We have it, but it's not -- there are more specific shows. So that is not what we'll be showing there, but we have a number of innovations. Ultimately, we think TRASAR, as we learn how to do it, will benefit Institutional. But that's down the road. Our immediate focus is F&B.","Michael Monahan","And John, the NRA Show is more about the kitchen area than it would be about the boiler and cooling tower. So as you know, 3D TRASAR is already at hotels or in hotels for the boiler and cooling tower, but the NRA focus is much more on the kitchen side.","Douglas M. Baker","Buyers for that are not at the NRA.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","You called out the EcoSure investment. I imagine it's a small step up in the total scheme of Ecolab. But could you maybe talk about what's going on there since you called it out?","Douglas M. Baker","It's really just simple. We're going through a transition in that business, where previously, it's the only business where we conducted service with what you call contracted folks, not our won employees. The business has such a scale, and to move forward, we're moving that into our own employees. And so how you handle these expenses is quite different, and it shows up in SG&A. And it's just as really as much a geography issue on the P&L as anything else. But it's several hundred people migrating over. That's what's going on.","Operator","Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","I was hoping to ask a question on Energy. What were enhanced oil recovery sales in the first quarter and how much growth are you seeing there? Are we at a time where EOR's time is going to finally come that we might start seeing the hockey stick-type growth with the shift to oil shales in North America and presumably, decent oil prices going forward?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, the EOR had big growth rates, but it's a relatively small business in total for us. So it was up probably 50%, but it's the law of small base. EOR and everything else, we expect that to be a very good business long term. It is not dictating the fortunes of the Energy business or Ecolab in total right now.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And then, it's been a little while since you discussed new account adds in the Institutional business. How much improvement have we seen on that metric in the last couple of quarters?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, Institutional had a huge first quarter in terms of new account wins. Legacy Ecolab was up almost 50%. Institutional is leading the pack. So I don't know if I have year-on-year. These are large corporate accounts. They had a very good quarter, which is a lot of work that's been going on for a while. But I would say on a number of metrics, Institutional looks healthy. It is a big business. It's doesn't jump up or down quickly. But you can see strong sequential improvement over the last 5 quarters, and we expect it to have a very good year.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And then kind of a similar question on Kay, you categorize that as a little bit elephant hunting, and it sounds like you bagged an elephant this quarter. Can you maybe give some more details on that?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, we don't throw a list of new account wins with specifics, but most of the new business wins, and it was several, were in the FRS business. Suffice it to say where Kay's growth is right now, it's Fast Food internationally, outside U.S. U.S. is doing fine, but really, where the high growth is, strong double digit, outside the U.S. And food retail still is gaining share at a very, very fast clip, frankly, everywhere.","Operator","Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Can you just walk me through a little bit about the puts and takes on the Global Paper services division? It seems like you guys are doing a good job in getting pricing. And in this division, it's just not catching up in terms of offsetting the headwinds that you're getting from the raws. Can you talk about that? Is that an end market issue primarily vis-\u00e0-vis the other businesses that you've got?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, price in Paper was pretty strong. Honestly, in the quarter, it was up 4% year-on-year. On a dollar basis, it did offset its raw materials, not to the point where it offset it on a margin basis. But the story, as we always said, was really the Paper, Water and Energy businesses is very similar to the Institutional and Food & Beverage businesses, which is year one, typically, you're trying to neutralize, on a dollar basis, raw materials via price, and you'd catch up in subsequent years on margin. That pattern has played out for Ecolab for a while, and as we said, the execution on Energy and Water this last year were excellent, and so we see the same pattern moving there as well. So Paper had pretty strong price performance. Paper's real challenge was volume. That was in 2 regions. It was in China, where we had pretty sizable slowdown in manufacturing, which stops corrugated temporarily. We don't think China is a perma problem. So that's probably a pothole that we're going to get out of. And then you have Europe, which has been much more long-term, secular, and we all know Europe's challenges. And Europe's not going to come back nearly as fast. In other parts of the world, Paper was fine, really, when you look at it. So those are really -- that will be the landscape of the Paper business.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So should we expect that the margins will start improving at the end part of this year on a growth perspective, or are we looking towards 2013 for that?","Douglas M. Baker","I'd say on gross profit across the business, we are going to be showing year-on-year gross margin improvement on every business by Q3 and in most businesses, Q2, right, including Paper. So midyear is where we'll all have this crossing point, where you start seeing year-on-year gross margin spread versus last year. In some businesses, it's a few months earlier. In some, a few months late. But that -- pick July 1 as kind of your demarcation point, you're going to be more or less right.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then just going back to the cross-sell opportunities and the cross-sell synergies, last quarter, you were particularly enthusiastic about where you were after being -- having the business for a couple months. I know it's a long sales cycle. Has anything changed upwards, downwards or you're basically the same? You thought it was strong last time, and you're at the same point as you were a quarter ago.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. No, I still like it. I mean, I would say we feel very good about conversations. We've closed business already in every region, in fact. So yes, no, I think we remain quite confident in our ability to go drive continued growth across legacy businesses but also get after the synergy number that we've talked about.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, what's the free cash flow expectation for this year? And afterwards, what's a good normalized number to think about?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, EBITDA this year, $2.3 billion. CapEx, in the 1.7 -- yes, CapEx is $600 million, sorry. So you can do the math.","Operator","Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Hey guys, I just wanted to ask a couple more on Nalco here. I know this isn't particularly fair, but there was a large contract that was won that's clearly contributing to your growth rate. But excluding that one large contract, can you talk about what the organic growth rate in Nalco's Energy business would be?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. You know what, that contract really wasn't that material to this growth rate yet. It's a long-term contract and is really just starting to come on and so was not that material at all. I'll call it almost immaterial to the quarter. So that business is in front of us. We're not in the middle of it.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So then the fact that you're looking at high-teens growth kind of going forward, is that assuming that the contract kicks in for second quarter, or is that contract even further out?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, more second half. Probably where we start seeing benefits, that would start registering. I think one, it's kind of funny to be apologizing about high-teens growth, so I'll try not to become apologetic. I think the high-teens growth is excellent expectation, and it's fundamentally that, as I mentioned earlier, you start out with your base last year around 15 organic and end up at 24 organic. So you're simply going against a larger base. If you compare it against 2010, you can still see very strong improvement in terms of overall growth.","Michael Monahan","And Andy, that growth in Energy is across all the segments of it. So it's a strong overall business, not led by any one particular contract or piece.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Just to hit more broadly on Nalco, I think before you guys reclassified some of your earnings, you were talking about hopefully delivering around 14% operating margin for that business. Under the new classification, what do you think is a reasonable bogey for the Nalco segment in total?","Douglas M. Baker","All right. OI trivia for 100. I'm getting there. I'm trying to look at the 2 because some of the landscape has changed. It's going to be in the middle teens-type range as a starting point. And obviously, in every one of our businesses, we expect to be able to generate operating income margin leverage going forward. It's the #1 driver for improved returns on capital, right? I mean, it's the happiest part of the equation, and so we would expect -- so that's going to be about the base that we expect to be able to build those margins here on out from here.","Operator","John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a quick question. On the new business that you -- that it looks like you're picking up, particularly for the old legacy Ecolab, is this coming largely from the Diversey business. I know you're starting to see some real share leakage there now that they've changed ownership.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I would say the new business -- I mean, look. Certainly, Diversey is our largest single global competitor in our Food & Beverage and Institutional space. And so certainly, some of the new business success came from a nonexclusive way. And we really don't get into where exactly it came from, but I would say it came from a variety of competitors.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then just for the quarter, what were the European margins for core Ecolab?","Douglas M. Baker","In this quarter, they were negative. I think it was less than negative 1 point. And in our expectation, obviously -- the first quarter for Europe is a very small volume quarter. So it's always the one that's really bouncing around in terms of plus, minus. For the year and each quarter going forward, we expect, one, to make money and, two, to have daylight on a margin basis between this year and last year.","Operator","Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Brian Maguire on for Bob this morning. Just a question on the Global Energy results. Obviously, very impressive. We're just curious how those compare to what you were expecting when you laid out the first quarter guidance. And then just maybe a broader question on that. It's been a long time since we've seen any business at Ecolab grow anywhere near 53% year-over-year. Do you anticipate any additional challenges from forecasting this business going forward?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I would say if you got into -- Energy, it depends what forecast we're going to look at. Energy was stronger in the quarter than forecast. But I would say I wouldn't consider a surprise by how the quarter came in. We had a few positives. Institutional ended up -- a business we've been forecasting for, I think, since 1923 was a little stronger in the quarter as well. I mean, it's an aggregate, and I think the process that we're going through as we do this to make sure that we have a handle on the business. And so we had a little bit better than we forecast in total, which we think is more positive than negative. But I don't think it's a sign that we're having difficulties forecasting.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then another just kind of broad question about the integration. It doesn't seem like you're seeing any signs of strain on the organization based on the results. But just curious below the surface if you're under-resourced in any area? Do you see any kind of potential stumbling blocks down the road from the way the reorganization is coming together?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, first, all I'll say that we never had a team report to me that doesn't think they're under-resourced in every region of the world, so that's like a truth no matter what the situation is. But the straight answer is, look, we're running regular surveys of team, how we're doing, where are we. We're capturing the hearts as well as the minds as we go through this. The surveys have been quite positive about the work that's out there. I think these are important things to understand, and so that part is, right now, quite positive. And I always say right now because we don't take it for granted going forward. We need to continue to earn trust and make sure that we're doing the right things as we go through this. I think the team has done a great job. And the #1 focus for us is don't lose sight of what is important, which is driving organic sales growth. And we can't use integration as an excuse. And if there's a strength in this culture, it is we do not believe in excuses. We have to understand challenges, but we are going to find a way to overcome them and deliver them. And that is core to our culture. And I think the team, all teams, WPS, Energy, Institutional, F&B, have really done a good job keeping their teams focused on customers and growth, while we have a dedicated team and many of the G&A functions are very busy doing very good integration work. And so the division has worked, and we plan to continue to go that way. We got big integration work to do. It is not going to distract us, and I think the first quarter is a good indication of that.","Operator","P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Your global operating margins in Water are about 8.6%, and these are even below that of Paper. So are you happy with these margins? And what's your long-term goal in Global Water margins?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, our expectation on Water -- you know what, first, the quarter is the quarter, and the first quarter is always the droopiest quarter on margin comparisons for us because of the volume, including in Water and the rest. Our expectation and Water forecast is Water will see year-on-year margin expansion this year on OI, as well, I think, virtually every one of our businesses as we go through this. I would say we aren't satisfied with anybody's margin if you really get down to it because we think they all can be improved over time. And so I think coming into it, if you would talk to Erik and Dave last year, they would have said we believe margin in Waters can be improved over time. We share that. We believe the plan they've been following, and we are helping execute now, along those lines, will bear fruit. And we think Water margins, over time, will show improvement, starting with this year.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly, on Healthcare, there wasn't a whole lot of discussion on Healthcare, which was expected to be a long-term growth driver. But it seems that the growth has slowed down due to these pressures on Healthcare costs. So I'm just wondering maybe you can share some more light on Healthcare?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. No, we are still -- we like our Healthcare business. And I think the moves that we've made in the last 18 months or so have been very positive. Healthcare profit, if you start looking at the global enterprise, is now quite attractive. We've made some very smart acquisitions. We've integrated quite successfully. We had ambitious plans, and we're beating them. Our Healthcare team is absolutely all over organic growth and starting to show trend improvement in those areas, too. So I think there's a lot of natural interest in the \"new part of Ecolab,\" but it's not because Healthcare isn't important to us. Now you talked about temporary challenges. Yes, no doubt, you've seen the numbers. Surgeries are down recently and everything else. There's a number of uninsured folks, but long term, we think the trends of aging population trump, right, any near-term trend you have on healthcare costs kind of abating. If we're wrong, Healthcare won't grow as fast. It will just grow a little slower, but we will have peak savings in our healthcare costs. So I know we'll be okay.","Operator","Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Could you give us a feel for the timing in terms of Pest returning to the 10% to 12% type of growth rate? Do you have a feel for it, or do you need -- what more do you need to do than what you have been doing over the past couple of years trying to fix it?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I think, Rosemarie, I mean, it's going to take a while. I mean, this business doesn't just jump. I mean, it's a business -- it's a contract business that you sell customer by customer. So we expect it to take -- honestly, I mean, I don't expect we're going to be there, at the earliest, until 2014. With that said, we expect to see continued improvement in sales, and that's going to also drive continued improvement in operating income. So it's not like there's going to be any sad news between here and there. It's just going to need to build sequentially over time. What do we need? I mean, they're on it. It's going to be driven by innovation and execution. It's the same 2 fundamentals that drive all the rest of the businesses. It's what the team is on. And with the innovation they're starting to drive, it will start enabling them to go command share gains. And without that, you can't sustain growth. And so that's why we put so much emphasis on our product pipelines, what we're doing, what we share, when we're doing well there because we think it is at the heart of our success. And Pest is now on it. They got a good pipeline. They have to go execute.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And then if I may, you talked about the slow demand for Paper in Asia. But Asia is actually the area of the world where you have new paper mills and where the demand for paper overall is growing from almost nothing. So could it be that Nalco does not have enough business in Asia and that most of the bulk of their paper business is in Europe and in North America and therefore, coming down?","Douglas M. Baker","No. Well, as I indicated, we don't expect the issue, and it was specifically China, that the issue in China is -- we don't believe it's a long-term issue. So we agree with you. Is that -- would we like more share there? Well, sure. I mean, absolutely. But the issue was -- there was a temporary issue in China manufacturing. We didn't make this up, right? This is pretty widely discussed across the board, and I think if you start looking at probably results of other places, you'll see some of the same thing. But we do not expect it to be a long-term story.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And then I have to ask, did you see any change in the morale of the Nalco people since Erik left?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I mean, one, he hasn't left yet. I think it's tomorrow, technically.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","When the announcement was made, I correct.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I mean -- I would say broadly, I don't think this was a huge surprise to the Nalco team. So Erik had huge respect in the team, but the team has been adjusting to this and understands this for months now, right? We announced in July of last year. So while the date was probably a surprise, because nobody could predict exactly that, I don't think the staff was surprised.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","So you are saying before we learned about it maybe a month ago, he had already made it known just about at the time of the acquisition or thereabouts?","Douglas M. Baker","Oh, no. I would just say I think the team -- I think there was a broad expectation. Look, this is one of the likely outcomes. We learned the day before quite officially that we announced. We had a legal obligation to announce something like that. No, I'm just saying that, look, we're both of same age. We end up not having co-CEOs in many organizations. We certainly weren't going to have one here. And so I don't think this is a surprise to the Energy or WPS team, so they had months to adjust to this. And so I don't think this is really new news with -- the date was news but not the fact that Erik was more likely not to be here long term. Erik did a great job. I will have to say and I would like to share it in an announcement. He really handled this incredibly well. And so we worked very hard -- we worked a lot together last year, particularly post announcement. He was hugely helpful. One of the reasons I think we're off to a very strong start is the work that Erik's done. And so I appreciate what he's done. So I'll miss him, and I think everybody will miss him, but I don't think it was a real surprise.","Operator","Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Monahan, Senior Vice President of External Relations. Mr. Monahan, you may begin.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's first quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO, and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. As discussed, in our results along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor.","Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides, including estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with a brief overview of the quarter, continued new business gains and product introductions drove acquisition adjusted fixed currency growth in our Global Institutional, Global Industrial and Other segments during the first quarter. These were partially offset by a narrowing sales decline in the Energy segment.","Product innovation and ongoing cost efficiency work more than offset the impact of higher-than-forecast delivered product costs, as well as soft economies and challenging end markets. These, along with lower interest expense, a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding, yielded the first quarter's 4% adjusted earnings per share increase.","Moving on to some highlights from the quarter and as discussed in our press release, consolidated acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales for our Global Institutional, Global Industrial and Other segments grew 3%, but were partially offset by a narrowing Global Energy sales decline. Regional fixed currency sales growth was led by Latin America and North America.","Reported operating margins decreased 20 basis points. Adjusted fixed currency operating margins decreased 10 basis points, as higher Energy segment profits and the price and volume increase were more than offset by the impact of higher delivered product costs, which include a $0.04 per share unfavorable currency hedge year-on-year comparison, representing a 5 percentage point negative impact to EPS growth in the quarter. Adjusted fixed currency operating income rose 2%.","The operating income gain, along with lower tax rate, lower interest expense and fewer shares outstanding, yielded a 4% increase in first quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share. We continue to see sluggish economic growth, higher delivered product costs and gradually improving fundamentals in the energy markets, and we expect these to generally continue through the balance of the year. We are, again, working aggressively to drive our growth, winning new business using our innovative new products and a sharp focus on sales execution, as well as driving pricing and cost efficiencies to grow our top and bottom lines at improved rates.","We expect improving volume growth and pricing across all of our business segments, and look for that to overcome delivered product cost headwinds, which slow as the year progresses, and yield operating income growth. We expect this focus on top line growth and margin expansion will yield full year adjusted diluted earnings per share, which we forecast in the $4.70 to $4.90 per share range in 2017, rising 8% to 12%, with the second half results outpacing the first half. We expect second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the $1.08 to $1.15 range, up 0% to 6%.","And now here's Doug Baker with some comments.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Thank you, Mike. So, the first quarter was certainly not our prettiest, but better than it looks and it does set us up for the full year delivery. Most things are on track, pricing, new business, innovation, investments, industrial business acceleration, energy recovery and FX stabilization, but we did have a few surprises.","Raws moved faster than forecast in the quarter, and we do believe will be net higher for the year. The good news is, our pricing also has traction and we believe will catch up on a dollar basis this year. Institutional sales were also soft. They were softer than expected, but they're better than they look.","So, if you take and adjust the base business for Swisher exits, which we have done because of margin and other issues, we're really growing at about 5% in North America and 4% globally. That's still slower than last year and slower than we expected. The issue primarily is that U.S. restaurant same-store consumption is down. (05:14) you got to go sell more business. We're not going to fix the U.S. foodservice market by ourselves and the division is already all over this driving significant new business campaigns, and we've got the right team to do this.","In total, Q1 was solid, not brilliant, but leaves us in position to deliver the year. The most important perspective on 2017 to understand is that the second half EPS ramp up is not nearly as steep as it appears. We need to do 14% EPS in the second half to reach our midpoint or $4.80. The first half run rate is really an 11% when you control for hedge and other non-recurring install and other expenses. So, we still have a step-up, but it's much more manageable moving from an 11% to a 14% than what may appear to be from like a 4% or 5% to a 14%.","So, the step-up requires sales to move from 2.5% in the first half to 5% in the second half, which I believe is quite doable. Here are couple of facts. Energy trajectory this year, 0% growth really in the first half, we expect them to grow at least at 5% in the second half. If you assume that, then II&O (06:27) needs to go from 3.5% in the first to 4% in the second.","We already have Industrial sales trajectory moving, it's accelerating. Institutional in the second half will lap the Swisher exits, and we've got a clearer view of timing on known wins and losses throughout the businesses, all of which are quite favorable to us. Net, we're making progress. We believe we're on track to go deliver a solid year. And so while Q1 won't win many style points, we do believe we're going to deliver a more Ecolab-like performance in 2017.","So, with that, I'll turn it back to Mike.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","Thanks, Doug. That concludes our formal remarks. As a final note before we start Q&A, we plan to hold our annual tour of our booth at the National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago on Monday, May 22. Looking further ahead, we also plan to hold our 2017 Investor Day on Thursday, September 7. If you have any questions, please contact my office.","And now, operator, please begin the question-and-answer period.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC. Please proceed with your questions.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I guess, I'd love to get some more color on the Institutional business and the deceleration there. If Swisher bleeding off some of the lower margin volumes there is a big piece of it, I would have thought maybe that margins would have been better, and yet they were down quite a bit. So, any more color on the revenue, and any color on the margin to help us think how that trends the rest of the year? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, I think within the Institutional margin, you've got some of the noise I referred to earlier. You certainly have some impact from hedging, not in the U.S. margin particular, but U.S. global or in Institutional global. And you also have investments that have been made, particularly in plant equipment, to enable a new platform for solids, which is now coming online. It's in the margin, but not yet fully or even partially utilized in some cases, as we're rolling that out late in the second quarter. That's also making it a little worse. And then we have a few rollouts, where we've got the mechanical equipment expense or the ME expense in the business, but not the sales yet.","So, I would say if you look at Institutional margin, it looks like it's down, but there's a number of things, which really, I think, mask the underlying trend in their margin. And we expect, over the year, that their margin is going to start showing daylight between this year and last year. Pricing in Institutional was the best performer last year, and they're continuing on a very solid track this year. So, we're not really worried, ultimately, in Institutional margins.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And just the \u2013 any more color on the revenue deceleration?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, Gary, I mean it really comes down to mostly same store's consumption in U.S. restaurant. And that we've dealt with many times in the past. Restaurants come in and out in terms of how successful they're being. I don't think we're the only ones feeling this. We've tended to manage this better than others. The division got on it early. They have a number of what I would call high-energy new business efforts underway that are gaining traction, and that's the only way you sell through this is you got to go gain more business. We, by ourselves, can't force the restaurants to consume more, and they're really just reflecting the softness in their business.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then the quick follow-up. With Energy it sounds like on the verge of rebounding, can you just review for us how you're thinking today about operating leverage coming back to the business? I know there's some cost you'd stepped aside from that's probably come back, but how strong could incremental margins be as we look to the next 18 months and the revenue rebounds there? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Typically, what we've seen in the past and what we expect this year is, let's call this the very early innings of a recovery. And we typically see really margin recovery and a lot of flow-through more in year two than in year one. And that's simply because as you're starting to see volume increase, you're simultaneously seeing some of the raw materials increase, pricing lags a bit. And so you end up with increasing sales, but not significant and sometimes even near-term decelerating margin before it starts expanding again.","You also have some costs you've got to add back. The largest cost this year that we're going to have to add back is compensation. So, it's a business because of performance, it hasn't earned bonus over the last several years. They are on track to earn bonus this year, and so we've got to rebuild that. We're also rebuilding some other comp where it matters because the industry heats up, it becomes much more competitive.","In total, for the year, I think we're pretty much where we thought we would be last call, and that is we're going to have some year-on-year sales growth in this business. Really, it's going to be a second half story as I alluded to in my opening remarks. And we also expect to be about even to have some minor potential accretion on the operating income line, too, as we start rebuilding comp and that somewhat offsets the volume benefit that we're going to see.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Quealy with Canaccord. Please proceed with your questions.","John Salvatore Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon. First question, diving back into the foot traffic topic. Inside Specialty and quick serve, did you also see that foot traffic issue or was it, as you've reported, more of a timing issue off a tough comp last year?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. In Specialty, it's more a timing issue, and it's not even just the comp. We've got a lot of new business that's being put on in Specialty right now. They're going to have a very solid year. The quarter is really just sort of an aberration. We've gone through this. As I've always described, that's sort of a \u2013 the way they feed their village is through hunting elephants, and they've landed several, but they just haven't brought them back to the village. They're coming.","So, even there you've got some of the pressure as a consequence of they've installed a lot of these accounts, but they haven't yet started consuming our product in the first quarter. They're starting to in the second quarter, as they had to run out the old competitive product first. So, that also put pressure on the first quarter margin. There's going to be a little less pressure from that in the second quarter but still some, and all that pressure goes away in the second half as we realize the full effects of the new business volume in Specialty.","John Salvatore Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And as a follow-up, Doug, a broader question, more on people. Sounds like you're adding and rebuilding some channel in the core businesses. Equipment Care seems like it's constrained a bit just trying to get talent for those folks and then Energy, we're adding back some compensation. When you think about broader compensation costs for the platform into 2018 in what could be a rising wage environment, talk about the puts and takes and how you're planning for that. Thanks, guys.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I don't think we're going to see dramatic wage inflation in 2018 versus 2017. I mean, it's been fairly steady even over the last couple of years. I mean, many of the markets that we compete in are pretty full employment. And we've got several things going for us. One, we've got a great employment brand story. We've got great track record of growth. We're on the right stuff, stuff that matters to people who are joining the workforce in terms of our ability to talk about clean water, safe food, abundant energy and healthy environments. It really does resonate with people we're trying to attract.","And in terms of how do you offset the wage pressure, it's really through efficiency programs. So, as we've talked, we've invested a lot in field technology. That's bearing fruit and enabling us to help our team do more and handle more as we take the admin off them and automate that kind of work. We have many more programs like that now that we have the installed base, the field technology in their hands, and that's in the base business or the run rate.","So, those are really the steps we have to take, but I wouldn't be signaling that there's going to be some fundamental shift in wage pressures. We've had wage pressure. We expect to continue to have some wage pressure, but I don't think it's going to be at a dramatically different trajectory.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. Now that you've broken out the Life Sciences business, can you maybe talk about medium-term expectations for revenue growth in that segment? And also, would you describe it as an above-average margin business, a business for you today or \u2013 what are your outlooks on margin as well?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, Life Sciences business chase (16:30) is a big market. It's very well designed for us. It's dominated by large multinationals who have significant hygiene needs, as you might imagine. With a change in their business model, where they're going from long-run to shorter-run drugs and even cosmetics, changeover is important. And so our ability to help manage changeover time, water consumption, hygiene, all fits very much their needs, and our ability to do it consistently across the globe is also important.","So, as we look at this, it already is a higher-than-average margin business. We would expect it to remain so, given the fit for what we do and the critical needs that our customers have in this area. It's going to act a bit like Kay and then it's going to be lumpy, meaning we're going after large customers. They aren't all going to come on smoothly, so I think you're going to see some knockout quarters and other quarters that may be single digits, not double digits.","But in total, our expectation for this business is it's a double-digit organic growth business. We will look to see if there are smart acquisitions to be made. But that's to be seen. We're not relying on it. Fundamentally, we've got the capability we need and we can build what we don't, and we're getting after this. So, we're quite excited about this market and the potential.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. And as a follow-up, Europe appeared to be a pretty weak region for you in the first quarter. Would you put Europe in that category of things that you expect to have a second half improvement? Or is this a bit more macro related and should continue to be sluggish here for the full year?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","No, I think Europe will do better as the year goes on. I mean, Europe is a combination of somewhat the environment, but I would also say, I think, there's some things we can do better in Europe. And certainly, we've got a couple of businesses pulling down the overall. I mean, as it stands, what I would say is, we expect Europe to have modest sales growth and modest OI ratio improvement for the year. And what we're going to work hard to do is improve that outlook as we go forward. I don't think it's going to dominate the news in terms of company performance, and I think the forward quarter is going to be better than this one.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. This is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I just wanted to ask for a little more color on the growth trajectory within Industrial and just any changes that you're seeing in terms of lapping the headwinds, whether it's in heavy or mining.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, I would say heavy, in total, I'll get down to organic, had growth in this quarter and we expect it to accelerate. Mining narrowed its decline, I mean it was low single digits, better than the fourth, which is clearly better than the third. We'd expect mining to start showing growth maybe as early as this quarter, more likely in the third quarter. So, I'm not sure it's all that important, but it's clearly making the progress we expect. And we expect heavy to continue to accelerate throughout the year. The comps for water, for heavy and mining, in particular, improve throughout the year. And so, we'd expect you're going to see overall acceleration in water as a consequence.","Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then I know it's a bit early with the Anios deal, but just some early thoughts on how that integration is going and how you guys are looking at the opportunity set?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Under the heading you got to get the big ones right, we are. So, we really \u2013 we've liked Anios and admired it for a long time and for good reason. I think everything that we're learning is what a quality company and business it is. It's a lot easier to integrate a business that operates well because in all, the new stuff that you can bring to them and also the ideas you can take from them for the other businesses, it's going on a firm foundation. That's certainly what we have there. So, yeah, Anios, it's growing. We're seeing the operating leverage we expected. We're on track. We believe to deliver good synergy numbers. My hope is that we exceed it this year, we'll see. But yeah, we feel very good about it, still early days, but it's off to the right start.","Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Any thoughts on competing against Diversey or GE Water under the new owners? I'm curious whether that's behind the back half of the year new win improvement that you're talking about.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, I would certainly say I think anytime a company goes through a transition like the one that either GE Water or Diversey has to go through, i.e., a big ownership change, certainly causes distraction. We've seen it in the past. We expect to see it going forward, and we aren't shy about working to capitalize on it. We feel it's our responsibility. So, we have \u2013 let's just say, I talked about the Institutional efforts. We have very strong efforts everywhere to get after new business. We had a good first quarter from a new business standpoint. We had a very significant ratio against our key competitors in terms of win\/loss, I would say stronger ratios than we had in 2016, which were quite strong as well, so we're all over this. I wouldn't say that's the reason we're confident we can accelerate, but it's certainly another, I guess, thought to put in the back. So, we'll accelerate.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And then costs are up for caustic, chlorine, propylene derivatives. Is that a big part of the cost headwind that you're talking about in the release? Or is it just one other thing among a lot of things?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, I think caustic and propylene, in particular, caustic's up this year for us. It's a main raw material in our Institutional F&B businesses, in particular. We also have propylene, which is expected to peak in the second quarter as new capacity comes on, as we go forward. And I think propylene run-up was the surprise that we had early in this year versus expectations. Caustic, we expected to see go up, and it did go up.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good afternoon. So, two questions. One, can you give a little bit more detail on the retention issues you flagged with the technicians for the equipment repair services business? And secondly, with the run rate that you're seeing in the back half of this year, to get there, you flagged a bunch of sort of one-off-ish factors that you think will slip away and let the underlying momentum show up. As we're thinking about the bridge into 2018, do you think the back half is a good run rate? Or should some of these one-off lumpiness factors come back into the bridge?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, I'll do the second first question. No, I think the second half, it'd be a more realistic run rate model for what we would expect in 2018 in the first. I mean, the first had \u2013 the single largest impact is hedging, and hedging is going to account for literally like a 4.5 point with a 5-point drag on EPS, 5 percentage points, 500 basis points in the first quarter.","It's going to be 4 in the second, so 4.5 for the first half all by itself. It does go away. It's simply \u2013 these were foreign hedges that we put on in a rising dollar environment. It's really not that there are huge negative costs in the first half. We're just comparing against a year-ago period, where you had very favorable contributions from the hedging activity as the dollar was rising.","So, you got to go \u2013 we normalize, we look at our GP progression ex-hedge to understand really what's going on underneath, and it's all the stuff you would expect, which is why we're very quite confident in the second half. So, we do not expect next year to have year-on-year hedging impacts, simply because we aren't benefiting this year from them. So, there's nothing really to compare against.","The others were sort of oddities, and normally you don't get this many stacked up, but a lot of it's good news. We're investing in new technologies for institutional solids. We have a lot of new business wins, where we have a lot of installs focused on a specific quarter, where we're not realizing the volume from those installs, but you're realizing the cost. We typically don't have this many stacked up at one time and in a couple quarter period. I don't mind it, but it does make GP look artificially low for a period of time, and we know that goes away. Based on our history, this is unusual. If it happened again, I would explain it again and be happy about it again.","In terms of GCS, it's really not a retention change. Retention's always been a bit of a challenge there in the field workforce. We spend more than other people training our team. They get poached at times by competitors. There's not a change in retention of our employee base. What's changed is just how fast we've been able to add on new people to replace those that are leaving. And there, we got a little bit behind in Q4 and are catching up on Q1. I don't think this is going to be an ongoing challenge for the business. It's just a bit of a near-term challenge.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. Your QSR trends were a little slow this quarter compared to last year and some recent trends. Can you talk a little bit about that? A lot of new restaurant chains that are opening up and taking share away from old chains and just tell us how you're positioned with the new chains.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. No, I think our QSR business, I'm not worried about at all. You're right, the quarter was a little bit soft in terms of growth rate, I mean, but it's still growing at what five and change. But it's going to accelerate throughout the year. We've sold a bunch of business in that \u2013 in QSR. And we've rolled it out a lot of it, we're going to start seeing the volume coming in, in the second quarter, and we'll enjoy 100% of it kind of at run rate in the second half. So, it's just a timing issue. It's nothing fundamentally wrong or to worry about our QSR business.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And also, your Energy business, the peak was in 2014. Do you see that business going back to that level at some point? I'm not looking for a year or a date. Or is there something change structurally in that business, where customers are using less chemicals per barrel of oil or something like that? Is it all cyclical or you think there may be some structural change that has happened? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I don't think we've seen the peak sales and OI in our Energy business for all time by any stretch. So, yeah, I think ultimately we'll reach and I would expect to exceed those levels down the road. Has there been change in the industry? Yeah, I would say all kinds. And in some areas, yeah, it's more efficient, we're more efficient. It can take less chemical in some cases, but there are other applications that take more. The net story that we've always talked about, which is easy oil transitioning to harder-to-get oil is still fundamentally the driver and that has not changed. So, that market continues to become more attractive over time as exploration picks up, which really isn't this year, but we think more meaningfully in 2018 and really in 2019.","They're going to have to go after the harder-to-find oil because the easy oil's gone and when they do that, the average, if you will, consumption of our technology per barrel will continue to rise and that's the fundamentals in the business. So, we plan on continuing to gain share. The market will recover. It's not going to be identical to the business that we had in 2014 because that industry continues to evolve and will continue to evolve, but I think we're in great shape to evolve with it and continue to increase our competitiveness.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you. Can you just walk us through the recent improvements in Food & Beverage? And also whether or not you believe you'll see the full benefits of the strengthening North American sales team throughout the balance of this year? Or do you think that's all going to also be a theme in 2018 as well?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, look, I mean, several things. Yeah, I think F&B you saw acceleration. We expect continued improvement throughout the year as we go forward. So, we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half. The team has been investing in more corporate account head count, I think, wisely. That business has been successful over a long period of time, probably analysis the team did said hadn't been expanding the corporate accounting probably as fast as we've been expanding share and if we want to continue to have capacity there, we got to add to it which they've been doing. And I think it's already showing that it was the right move. So, I don't know, I remain \u2013 yeah, I would expect that business to be better this year, and knowing what we know now, I would say we should at least hold that growth rate moving into 2018.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. And just very quickly on the Pest Elimination business, you mentioned you saw strong growth in North America and APAC, but can you just comment on the key puts and takes in Latin America and then Europe in both the short and long term? And also, just the overall longer-term view of that business, is that a segment which you'd consider doing M&A in, as well as any other initiatives? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, well, we love the Pest business, and so absolutely, on your M&A question, and we've done M&A and we would be a happy acquirer of a good business at a reasonable price. It's the second part of that equation that's been hard to find recently. People have been paying, in our mind, too rich of multiples in pest. Pest is attractive for many reasons, but one of its real attractiveness is its return on invested capital. It doesn't require a lot of capital. The only way you screw that equation up is you pay too much for a business. Now you've got too much invested and you've lost the heart or the secret to that business, in a sense. So, we're going to be wise people as it comes to M&A.","In terms of what's going on, it's really more a Europe story. Latin America's a relatively small business, and Europe is just sort of \u2013 you get paid as you serve. Our service calendar was a little out of whack in the first quarter. There's catch-up activity underway in the second quarter, and so I'm confident ultimately that all comes back around and I'm not really worried about the Pest business. I think those guys are doing the right things and they've got good momentum.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions.","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Good morning. I know the drilling business was up double digits in the fourth quarter. How did that do in the first quarter?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. It was up double digits in the first quarter. I mean, grew faster, obviously, than in the fourth.","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Did the completion business, the other part of WellChem, did that follow suit in the first quarter? Is that continuing to improve as well, or is that piece of the business still in kind of a holding period?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, WellChem was up just north of 20% in the first quarter. We expect it to continue to accelerate based on our projection of what's going to happen in terms of rigs and rig activity.","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks. And just one more, shifting gears to your Global Industrial margins. It looked like they took a step back in the first quarter, I think down 60 basis points on a fixed currency basis. Was that driven by the re-segmentation? Or just generally, what are the main puts and takes there?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I would say the big noise in the Industrial business was hedge, particularly in the water business. If you get out \u2013 so in water, I think it was off 70 basis points, and 50 basis points of that was a hedge. So, that's the dominant story there. And that's a little bit just kind of one-time comparison. If you take it out, you start seeing the natural trajectory you would expect to see in our Industrial gross profit margin. They are getting pricing. Pricing accelerated in the first quarter for our Industrial businesses versus what they were able to get last year, so they're on track in terms of doing what they need to do to offset raws. Once the hedge comes off, which is after second quarter, I think you'll see a more natural view of their GP.","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your questions.","Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Doug, this may be the first press release I've ever seen that referred to the Angolan kwanza as a component of the FX impact. Wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about within the Energy business, North America growing faster than international. How does that really affect the business? Is it really just where \u2013 in drilling and completion, where you guys have a significantly higher share within North America or does that extend to the production chemicals as well or the downstream piece? And then also curious about the margin impact of that. Is the international side higher margin than the North American side of Energy?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, there's not a significant gross profit difference one to the other. And so here's what's going on. I mean, you would see this in other Energy-related businesses. So, North America went into whatever you want to call that, a recession, clearly much earlier than the balance of the world, and they're coming out of it earlier than the other parts of the world. So, if you will, the Vs just aren't lined up, U.S. versus international. It's really driven by structure of the industry.","Much of the international business or big hunks of it are owned by governments. It's used to pay their bills. So, when oil dropped, they actually worked to up their production. That works for a while, but without new CapEx, you can't keep at that pace forever. So you're starting to see that curtail and it will continue to curtail until they start drilling again. U.S. business dropped off dramatically in terms of its productivity when the oil price dropped because it's more privately owned, and so it reacts to the market and doesn't chase lower-margin business with more dollars, which other parts of the world will. But now you're seeing it rebound as the oil price rebounds and they're starting to chase the opportunity.","The big picture in the oil market, I would say, is that you're starting to see a rebalance of supply and demand. So, demand this year is projected to be 1.2% growth, and production right now in the first quarter was down 0.4%. So, that's the stuff that everybody needed to see. We're going to see oil bounce around, we always thought, we talked $45 to $55. We didn't expect a big recovery this year in terms of oil price. We think that's more a 2018 story. We also don't see oil falling off a cliff either. And so I think there's slow improvement in activity, which we're seeing is \u2013 what we're going to continue to see until we start seeing prices more in the 60s and north, and there's a great deal of confidence that that's really going to stay.","When you see that, I think you're going to see a big upturn in activity, and that's when you're going to see even faster growth than we're projecting now for our business. Good news is, though, our Energy business, it's no longer a drag on the business. I think it'd be minorly accretive, but just being neutral is a significant improvement over the last two years and going forward, this business can be a very strong piece of our growth story.","Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. And then turning over to the Institutional division, I was wondering if you could comment on the impact of the travel ban as well as the strong dollar on the hospitality industry and the tourism industry in North America.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, I don't \u2013 I would say this. Room demand isn't \u2013 it slowed a bit in North America. It was better in Europe and parts around the world, so I just don't think the lodging isn't really the story. I really think it's what we talked about earlier. What we saw that was unusual and correlates with sort of what we see in our metrics was consumption was down in U.S. restaurants.","It wasn't negative, it was just much slower growth than we've seen in the past. And that's a hole or volume that we thought we were going to see that we didn't see, but we believe it's overcome-able by getting after and stepping on new business activity, which the team's done. And I would just say this, our U.S. Institutional team is very strong, they're very good when focused and they're very focused.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please proceed with your questions.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yes. Thank you. The first question is just around M&A. Given some of the larger assets have changed hands already, maybe just refresh us on your ability or appetite to do a larger deal versus sort of return of cash at this stage.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, on our appetite, we'd be very comfortable doing a deal of size as long as we feel it's going to be a good deal for us. The story about the asset, just as when is quite complicated. So, I would just say that doesn't change my view. I think I even said a year ago, I'd be surprised if we do a big deal in the very near term and quite surprised if we don't do one over the next five, six years. I think that my view still holds there. So, our appetite isn't diminished at all. I think we just go in eyes wide open and try to fully understand what the risks are and the challenges are in any deal and as a consequence, what price makes sense.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And just a follow-up, you mentioned earnings were back-end loaded. Obviously, there's a lag in terms of your pricing. Could you just remind us, how many of your contracts are cost-plus? Is there a greater lag on pricing in certain segments or business lines versus others? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Really in Energy, it's about 30%. Water's just a little south of that in terms of percent. Those are where we have the big cost-plus contracts, there's a few others spattered across the other segments, but they're not significant. But, yeah, those will always lag. I mean, they lag going down, and they lag going up simply because you've got to realize the cost in your business before you're going to be \u2013 before you're able to price for them.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of the questions have been answered, but let me just follow up on the strength that you guys are seeing in Paper and textile, particularly Paper, the market that I know you weren't very enamored with when you bought Nalco. But since they've been doing better and picking up momentum over the last several quarters, so I'm just wondering if it's just better execution or if the market's coming back and kind of what you're feeling about that business these days.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, since all my prior stance seems to have worked, I'm going to tell you I'm still not enamored with the business because it seems to spur them on. Now I would say that's not really \u2013 where we were on that is, I just said as a stand-alone, we probably wouldn't have bought it. But as a business that came along, it was a pretty darn good business in many respects.","We haven't changed our feeling on it. It's got a great team, and I think the team has gotten better. So, how are they growing it? It's called the old-fashioned way. New business, they've had new technology. They're gaining share, they're doing smart things in terms of getting their portfolio to be more focused on where you see growth in that industry like tissue, towel and boxes versus newsprint and other materials, so those have been smart moves. They don't happen overnight, so it's been an ongoing effort.","So, yeah, you've seen sales acceleration. As they keep selling new business, they're going to keep seeing sales acceleration. And I think they've managed the challenges successfully. So, I don't \u2013 that's the story there. Textile is not that fundamentally different. If you sell new business, good things happen, and if you don't, they don't.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","The restaurant comment you made about sort of foot traffic not coming back as strongly or being maybe not down, but certainly slower. We've heard some version of that, not just from you, but from other industry participants. Going back to really the recession, if not all the way back to 9\/11, is there a secular trend here that people are just not eating out as much around the world? And should we start thinking about this industry as basically being a flattish industry, where any growth you guys get is a bonus or not?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, same-store sales, look, I don't think is the singular metric that drives our business \u2013 or, excuse me, traffic. Traffic's been down, I think, every year since 2008. I keep asking the team, is there one person left to walk into our restaurant based on these metrics. Clearly, if you look at the sales in that industry, they were also up over most of those years. And yeah, there are changes going on in that industry. They're not dramatic. I don't think they're going to hit huge inflection points, but we watch them. So, certainly there's higher percent of takeout than there was 10 years ago. I'd expect in 10 years, there'll be even a higher takeout than there is right now. So, you see some of these changes over time.","With that said, the challenges in that industry simultaneously continue to increase. People continue to get into that business, start new concepts, grow their business, food safety, clean labels, i.e., organic food without additives and the like. All these things are also impacting that business and our customers, and our ability in food safety is more important even today than it was 5 years ago and 10 years ago. So, I guess \u2013 I think when I take all of the shifts that are going on in that industry and net it out, it's still quite an attractive market for us, both in the U.S. and around the world. And we have significant share possibilities, not only in the U.S., but in particular, around the world, that we continue to get after.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Last question, sort of, bookkeeping question, what should be the tax \u2013 what's a good tax rate assumption for you guys for the year? Is it the 25% that you did in this quarter?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I think we've said 24% to 25%.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","24% to 25%. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your questions.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on Energy, in particular, around the pricing, clearly you guys have had to concede a little bit of price and I think that was even a bit of a factor in 1Q. Doug, I was just wondering, when the price comps and the healthier customers get to the point where that could inflect at least neutral, if not positive, is that part of your forecast for the rest of this year when you talk about the flat \u2013 the top line being flat to up modestly?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes. So, last year, we talked, we had probably lost about 3 points of top line to price in that business. And it started getting modestly better as we went throughout the year last year. We saw continued improvement in the first quarter. Second half, I would say it would be neutral to positive on price.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Interesting. And then just regarding the double-digit increases on the drilling side of the business, there's just been this trend in the industry to make kind of the fracked wells, in particular, in North America consume more sand and make them much more efficient than they've been even a year or two ago. Does the same go for chemical? Are you \u2013 is your double-digit increases in your drilling revenues driven by the number of wells or the amount of chemical that's consumed by the new technologies being used in the wells?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I would say, right now, it's more a reflection of rig count increase and activity increase. Yeah. I would say several things. I mean, what we've been working on products and programs and have them, that reduces the need for companies conducting a frac in terms of how much water they need, how much sand they need, et cetera, to conduct this. Less is better.","And we'd rather cannibalize ourselves than get cannibalized. Some instances, it takes less chemical, and there are other applications where it would take more of our product to get that same result. I think, over time, I mean, this kind of shifting of how much technology it takes to get an end result, I think, if you look over any long period of time, it typically gets more efficient. We would expect that to continue to be true, but challenges continue to grow. And so the need for technology evolves.","So, I had somebody try to say that fracking's going to disappear, and I do not think that's the way to think about it. It's going to continue to evolve and change, but there are plenty of opportunities for us to introduce new programs that bring great benefit to those conducting a frac that's going to represent new opportunity for us even as others may dissipate slightly.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered. I just have a couple nits I want to ask about. Doug, how do you feel about the organic growth in the Healthcare business? It's definitely on a better trajectory than it's been prior to this Anios acquisition. How do you feel about the existing business and the ability to improve the growth over there over the next several years?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, well, Healthcare, yeah, clearly has improved. I mean, it's a 5% underlying organic rate, if you peel out Anios and the other. And, look, I think the team's doing a very good job. I mean they went through and are doing a lot of integration work that started even before, obviously, the close of Anios. They continue to drive and accelerate their underlying business. So, the work that we did and the work that team did around getting clarity around the program, clarity around the message for customers, adding resources where they needed them, we've continued to add additional talent into that team and it's paying dividends. So, where am I? Yeah, I'm proud that the team's been able to build this up to 5%. And then the other side of me is greedy, and I think that team's capable of doing even more, and it's only because I think they're great. So, 5% is good, 7% is better, that's our focus.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And just a follow-up, where does the Swisher integration stand? We're still calling out costs for the integration and stuff on that a little while after I would have expected.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, us too. It took us longer to exit the hygiene business than we had planned, which delayed our exit from a number of facilities because we had to continue to operate it until we could move it. And so it was a couple quarters after we had thought we were going to be able to move it. So, that delayed a number of things. That's why you're seeing some of the charges come through now versus, say, third quarter of last year, et cetera. In total, I think the Swisher noise is really going to be out of the business come third quarter as we go through. So, then it's just going to be a completely natural part. The exiting and the comparison with hygiene and all the other stuff will be out of the base.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your questions.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - G.research LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Doug, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the different categories in Food & Beverage, mostly trends that you see in dairy, in farms, in protein. Can you help me understand what is happening there?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, the most significant probably underlying change would be in dairy. Clearly, dairy was under a lot of pressure. The market's improved somewhat. I don't know that all dairy producers would call it a victory yet, but it certainly helps as we've gone through. Food continues to be pressured by consolidation. There's a lot of, obviously, big headline acquisitions that have been made in that industry. Some others that seem to be contemplated, but not consummated. And brewery beverage is strong and that's more a continuing story. So, the inflection one would be mostly in our dairy business.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - G.research LLC","Do you see that decline in dairy being impacted by the fact that there is negative advertisement, justifyingly so, about cow's milk? It's not supposed to be good for you. Is that having an impact?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I don't \u2013 you know what, I don't believe so. I honestly haven't seen those advertisements, but of course, I live in a state that borders Wisconsin, so we wouldn't likely be airing them in this market. So, anyway, no, I would say if anything dairy has gotten better because it was so depressed. I have not seen any impact from the advertising you talked about.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - G.research LLC","Okay. And then lastly, you said that the world of energy has changed a lot since 2014 and you expect that it will become substantially bigger over time. How about the margin? Has the change affected the margins in one direction or another?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I don't think we feel that our ability to earn the type of margins that we were earning or targeted has changed. So, the margins have been most impacted near term just by loss of volume on a fixed overhead base, particularly in plants. And so I think as this business comes back, which we expect it to, as we continue to roll out technology and the needs for technology continue to grow as old oil becomes new oil, which is harder oil and needs more technology, we think we'll continue to see margin expansion.","Now, that's all predicated on us being a great value-added supplier to our customers. Only reason people are going to pay margin to us is if they get great value, and I think our team understands that. Stuff we have on the drawing board, we are quite pleased with. Stuff that we're launching, we think has got great runway. So, I mean, we remain bullish about this business.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - G.research LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, Doug. This is Chris Evans on for Bob. I was wondering if you could describe some of the strategic rationale for carving out the Life Sciences division. Earlier you gave some pretty favorable organic growth estimates. I was just wondering if you could also add in maybe some of the industry structures, the competitors you'll be going against and maybe your thoughts on inorganic opportunities in that new sub-segment.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, the reason we broke it out is it creates focus. So, previously, we've been serving the Life Sciences industry in part from the F&B business and in part from the Healthcare business. And both were doing a good job with the tools at hand, but neither had a complete set of tools. So, if anything, once we decided to do it, we wondered why it took us so long. That's a shot at myself. So, getting focused, I mean, think the Kay business going after QSR, textile, going after textile, we have many examples of this. That's how we succeed. So, now we've got a freestanding business. It was a significant investment last year and we're still paying some of the incremental investment this year in the first half before we fully lap it.","And the second, has enabled us to have dedicated corporate account teams, dedicated marketing teams, dedicated corporate account finance teams to really understand how to develop and position programs to specifically meet this industry's need.","The structure is multinationals, which is what we like, fragmented competitive set, which is what we like. So, by and large, what we're competing against is a lot of regional folks who are offering services to this industry.","And so our ability to put together a global program we believe will give us the same kind of advantage here that it does in other industries we serve because certainly the pharma need for consistency, you might imagine, would be fairly high in areas that we're serving. So, I don't know if that helps give you color. Big business, plenty of opportunity. We can grow without doing M&A. If we see M&A that works, we'll certainly be quite open to it.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great. And then just you cited higher delivered cost across to your segments. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on this specific breakdown on 1Q and maybe the cadence of expectations, how you'd plan to address those for the remainder of the year.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I think if you look at \u2013 it's kind of a combination of just underlying commodity costs starting to rise and then transaction costs and foreign currency that \u2013 because a lot of these are U.S. dollar denominated, so if I'm buying them in reals, et cetera, I got to pay a higher price given the devaluation over time. We see that rising, ironically peaking around the second quarter. Part of this is the propylene conversation we had earlier, but still being somewhat a year-on-year drag in three and four, which is not at the same level, but overcome by pricing.","And I talked earlier that we have pricing traction. Pricing is never easy. We're getting it. Institutional, I think was ahead on ramping up its pricing activity last year, trying to get in front of the caustic moves and some of the other stuff they knew was coming. And you see the Industrial businesses now accelerating their pricing activity, which they need to do, given the increased raw materials facing them. So, I guess, we're confident we're going to end up with some daylight between the costs we realize incremental on raws and FX related to raws and the pricing that we're going to get.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is from the line of Dan Dolev with Instinet. Please go ahead with your questions.","Dan Dolev - Instinet LLC","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about, is there any chance that some of the weakness in Institutional could be because of a tougher competitive environment? I mean, specifically, we know at least some companies that used to be traditionally in other businesses like uniform rental are starting to make a bigger push into like hygiene and some of your legacy product. Can you maybe talk about that competitive environment? Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, I guess \u2013 no, I would not say \u2013 I mean, look, we do a lot of analysis on our business to understand retention, new business, acquisition and sort of current customer consumption. Retention really \u2013 I mean, if you look at our historic retention rates, I mean, we're under \u2013 we're better retention rates than we've been historically in that business.","So, if it was competitive activity, you would see it in worsening retention rates, and that's just not what we're seeing as really the story. The big dip is in kind of same-store consumption. It's not a loss of product placements, if you will, in those units. It's a loss of consumption across those products. And that's the story. So, we aren't \u2013 we don't believe that we're infallible or unbeatable or anything else, we pay a lot of attention to competition. I just don't think that's the story.","Dan Dolev - Instinet LLC","But do you even see that traditional uniform rental competitor in \u2013 when you compete for business, or are they not in the same categories?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, I don't know that that's really a huge piece of emphasis for them, to be quite honest. I mean, they just made a large acquisition. They've been quite successful in the businesses they're in. I just \u2013 I don't know that that's really an avenue they're going. I don't know that it lends itself. I mean, that's a little bit \u2013 they're a much better executor, I would say. They're a good company, does a very good job in the businesses they're in, but it's hard to take people in one set of business and make them kitchen hygiene people just because they're in the back of the restaurant. That was Swisher's play. It wasn't very successful, although I grant you, and I think the company you're talking about is a much better executor.","Dan Dolev - Instinet LLC","I agree with that. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to Mike Monahan for closing remarks.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","Thank you. That wraps up our first quarter conference call. This conference call and the associated discussion to slides will be available for replay on our website. Thank you for your time and participation.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Michael Monahan","Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's fourth quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO.","A copy of our earnings release and the accompanying slides referenced in this teleconference are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor.","Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on Slide 2, stating that this teleconference and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected.","Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section on our most recent Form 10-K under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our fourth quarter earnings release and on Slide 2. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with an overview on Slide 3. We delivered strong results in the fourth quarter despite continuing global economic headwinds. We leveraged solid sales volume growth, pricing and our synergy and cost efficiency work to substantially improve our acquisition-adjusted operating earnings -- or operating margins and produced a very strong adjusted earnings per share increase.","Looking ahead, we expect to continue to outperform our markets and show outstanding 18% to 25% earnings gains in the first quarter and strong double-digit growth for the full year as good sales growth, appropriate pricing, innovation, synergies and margin leverage more than offset slow markets and unfavorable currency effects.","Moving to some highlights from the fourth quarter and as discussed in our press release. Reported fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.93. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, fourth quarter 2013 earnings per share increased a very strong 17% to a record $1.04.","The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by volume and pricing gains, new products, account gains, synergies, cost-savings actions and the Champion acquisition. We enjoyed double-digit growth in our Global Specialty and Global Energy businesses. We also saw good performances in Global Food & Beverage, Global Water and Global Paper.","Latin America led the regional growth once again and was bolstered by good gains in North America and Asia Pacific. These and other increases were leveraged by good margin expansion.","We continue to be aggressive focusing on top line growth. We're emphasizing our innovative product and service strengths, as well as our wide range of effective solutions to help customers get better results and lower operating costs, and through these, drive new account gains across all of our customer segments. We also continue to implement appropriate price increases to help offset higher costs and investments in our business. We remain focused on expanding our margins, emphasizing productivity and efficiency improvements to help increase profitability, as well as drive merger synergies. We also continue to make investments in key growth businesses to sustain our technology and sales and service leadership. We remain on plan for achieving our Nalco and Champion synergy targets, and our Europe margins remain on track for further strong expansion.","Looking ahead, while economic trends and unfavorable currency exchange rates present ongoing challenges, we look for our first quarter to show continued attractive sales gains and margin improvement. First quarter adjusted EPS is expected to increase an outstanding 18% to 25% to the $0.71 to $0.75 range and compare with last year's adjusted EPS of $0.60.","Business growth and the benefits from synergies and cost reductions should more than offset moderate economies, the effects of unusually severe weather on our customers and an estimated $0.02 from unfavorable currency. In addition, the quarter will compare against a strong 20% adjusted EPS gain in last year's first quarter.","For the full year 2014, we look for a very strong 16% to 19% increase to the $4.10 to $4.20 range.","In summary, our fourth quarter performed very well. And we expect fourth quarter and full year 2014 will also show very strong gains, earnings growth as we more than offset challenging economic conditions while we also make the key investments to drive superior results this year, as well as for our future.","Slide 4 shows our fourth quarter results, both as reported and with adjustments for special gains, and charges while Slide 5 shows our sales growth detail. Ecolab's consolidated fixed-currency sales for the fourth quarter increased 18%. Acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency sales rose 6%.","Looking at the growth components. Volume and mix increased 5%, pricing rose 1%, acquisitions and divestitures were 12% and currency was a negative 1%.","Reported fixed-currency sales for the Global Industrial segment rose 4%. Adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures, Global Industrial sales increased 5%.","Fourth quarter reported fixed-currency Global Food & Beverage sales increased 9%. Acquisition-adjusted fourth quarter fixed-currency sales grew 6%. Growth was led by beverage and brewing, dairy and agri, which more than offset modestly lower sales in the weak protein market. Regionally, we enjoyed strong results in Latin America with moderate growth led by share gains in the other regions.","Global Food & Beverage continues to benefit from its total plant assurance approach to customers in which we combine our industry-leading Cleaning & Sanitizing, water treatment and pest elimination capabilities to deliver improved food safety results, lower operating costs and better product quality assurance for our customers. This has enabled us to win business with key global customers and offset sluggish conditions in several of our regional markets.","Looking ahead. We expect further good organic sales growth in the first quarter as we develop further benefits from our innovation pipeline, better customer penetration and new business capture.","Fixed-currency Global Water sales increased 5%. Gains were led by good growth in the heavy, light and mining businesses.","Regionally, we saw strong growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific with modest increases in North America and EMEA.","We continue to drive market penetration with innovative solutions to optimize water usage using our powerful 3D TRASAR platform technologies. We're also developing new commercial solutions for water recycling and reuse, mining and wastewater.","We are focused on building our Corporate account enterprise sales, our growth synergies and product innovation to drive revenues. We expect to show another good gain in the first quarter as continued growth in our core heavy and light markets is again bolstered by favorable mining results and these more than offset the ongoing de-emphasis of nonstrategic business.","Fixed-currency global sales for Paper enjoyed a strong quarter, increasing 5%. We saw double-digit growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific with flat results in EMEA and a decrease in North America, resulting from continued low plant utilization and customer closures. We expect Global Paper to show modest sales growth in the first quarter as new business and technology penetration more than offset the challenging paper market conditions.","Fixed-currency sales for the Global Institutional segment rose 4% -- fixed-currency sales for the Global Institutional business grew 3% in the fourth quarter. Institutional's end markets remain subdued with modest growth in global lodging room demand and still challenging foodservice foot traffic across North America and Europe.","Looking at regional sales trends. Latin America continued to post strong sales growth, North America showed good gains and Asia Pacific sales were up slightly and Europe was modestly lower.","Sales initiatives targeting new accounts and effective product and service programs around our core segments continued to lead our results. To drive our future growth and improve on our industry leadership position, we remain focused on executing global sales initiatives, globalizing core competencies and introducing product innovation that delivers increased value with solutions that sustain water and energy and reduce labor costs while also increasing our customer focus around service intimacy. We are also making further investments in field technology to enhance execution in sales and service, and we have better aligned our sales team's efforts around our global value proposition.","Longer term, our new Global Institutional structure is helping to accelerate global deployment of our innovation and technology, which we expect will help improve growth by driving better market penetration and new account gains. We expect continued progress in the first quarter as these growth drivers, new sales initiatives and innovations in key platforms enable Institutional to show solid sales gains throughout 2014, and once again, significantly outperform its markets.","Fourth quarter sales for Global Specialty grew 11% in fixed currencies. Global quick service sales increased double digits as we enjoyed steady growth from both large and small customers. New accounts, along with increased service coverage and additional solutions for customers to drive their operating efficiency and food safety, leveraged generally modest industry trends.","Regionally, the U.S. and Latin America recorded solid gains. Europe saw good growth from new accounts and additional customer solutions. And Asia Pacific benefited from good quick service foot traffic growth.","Food Retail business showed solid double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter, benefiting from customer additions, new products and increased penetration.","We look for similar good sales growth in the first quarter as Global Specialty works to deliver another solid performance in 2014.","Fixed-currency Global Healthcare sales increased 1%. Excluding the impact of low-margin business we exited, Global Healthcare sales rose 3%. Growth from new account gains and new product introductions was slowed by continued soft U.S. and European health care markets. Growth from contamination control was partially offset by soft instrument reprocessing sales.","To grow sales in this challenging environment we have increased our focus on Corporate accounts, our integrated value proposition, as well as continued to strategically broaden our product lines, introducing new hand care products, new infection barriers and a surface disinfectant that kills C. diff in record time.","We expect Global Healthcare sales growth to improve in the first quarter as account gains and new product launches in both North America and Europe more than offset a continued weak health care market.","Reported fixed-currency Energy segment sales grew 78%. Acquisition-adjusted Global Energy fixed-currency sales rose 12%. Our upstream business saw further double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, resulting from strong international performances in onshore, deepwater and oil sands. Downstream sales were strong, resulting from a pickup in North America refining and global market share gains. The integration of Energy and the Champion businesses has gone very well.","Looking ahead, we expect acquisition-adjusted Energy segment sales to continue showing good growth, driven by continued production strength in the deepwater and oil sands businesses and steady growth in downstream, which should more than offset moderated growth in North America shale. We expect first quarter and full year 2014 acquisition-adjusted sales growth will be in the 10% range.","Sales for our Other segment increased 1%. When adjusted for the Vehicle Care divestiture, sales rose 6% in the fourth quarter. Fixed-currency Global Pest sales increased 5% in the fourth quarter. We enjoyed good growth in the food and beverage, health care and restaurants.","Regionally, we saw double-digit growth in Asia Pacific with good growth in North America and Europe, reflecting solid execution in spite of the continued challenging conditions in that region. We continue to drive market penetration with innovative solution -- pardon me, with innovative service offerings and technologies, including the global protect program, Bed Bug Assurance, STEALTH Fly Station, STEALTH Fusion and expanding solution offerings. We expect Global Pest sales to show further good growth in the first quarter led by gains in the Americas and Asia.","Equipment Care sales grew double digits in the fourth quarter, rising 11%. New account sales, better penetration, pricing actions and improved technician capacity and productivity drove strong service revenue growth while parts sales also increased. We continue to see good results from both chain account, headquarter relationships, as well as by our work to drive sales through their regional and franchise organizations. We expect Equipment Care to show further strong gains in the first quarter as continued good service trends, improved parts sales and streamlined operations benefit results.","Our presentation -- Slide 6 of our presentation shows selected income statement items. Fourth quarter gross margins were 44.8%. Adjusted for acquisitions and special charges, fourth quarter 2013 gross margins were 45.4%, 30 basis points below last year.","Volume and pricing gains, as well as merger synergies and cost efficiencies were more than offset by the business mix impact of higher Energy sales, which, on average, have a lower gross margin when compared to our Other businesses.","SG&A expenses represented 31.0% of our fourth quarter sales. Adjusted for acquisitions, the SG&A ratio improved 120 basis points versus last year. The improvement reflected sales gains and cost-savings efforts, including merger synergies, as well as the mix of higher Energy sales, which, on average, have a lower SG&A ratio when compared with our other businesses.","Fixed-currency operating income for Global Industrial increased 5% with margins up 10 basis points. Pricing, volume gains and cost synergies and efficiencies led the gain.","Fixed-currency operating income for Global Institutional increased 6% with margins up 30 basis points. Pricing, volume gains and cost efficiencies drove the increase.","Reported Global Energy fixed-currency operating income increased 54%. Acquisition-adjusted Global Energy operating income increased 31% in fixed currencies and acquisition-adjusted margins expanded 230 basis points, led by the volume gain synergies, operating leverage and pricing.","Fixed-currency operating income for the Other segment declined 6%. Adjusted for the sale of Vehicle Care, operating income declined 2% as improved operating results were offset by a deductible of an insurance claim and on the write-down of certain field software.","Corporate segment and tax rate are discussed in the press release.","We repurchased approximately 700,000 shares during the fourth quarter, completing the 1 billion share -- $1 billion share repurchase we committed to following the Nalco merger close.","2014 repurchase activity will be made under our existing board authorization, which had 12.7 million shares remaining to be purchased at December 31, and we'll focus on offsetting the impact of share-based benefit plans. The net of this performance is that Ecolab reported fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.93 compared with $0.77 reported a year ago. When adjusted for special gains and charges and discrete tax items in both years, adjusted earnings increased 17% to $1.04 when compared with $0.89 earned a year ago.","Turning to Slide 7 and looking at Ecolab's balance sheet. Total debt to total capital is 48% at December 31 compared with 52% a year ago. Our net debt to total capital was 47% with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 2.5x.","Looking ahead and as outlined in Slide 8. We continue to take aggressive actions to drive both our top and bottom lines. We are expanding our market share and customer penetration among major accounts and leveraging our positions in key growth markets in food, water, energy and health care as we work to offset continued challenging market conditions and unfavorable currency exchange rates, which could negatively impact sales by a percentage point or 2 in 2014.","We expect to show good acquisition-adjusted sales growth and margin expansion, driven by innovation, pricing, merger synergies and better operating efficiencies. We expect to deliver on these aggressive goals while building growth for the future.","We expect adjusted first quarter 2014 diluted earnings per share to increase an outstanding 18% to 25% to the $0.71 to $0.75 range despite weather impacts on our customers and expected $0.02 of unfavorable currency. Further, the first quarter will also compare against a very strong period last year when adjusted earnings per share rose 20% to $0.60. We look for full year 2014 to show very strong growth as adjusted earnings per share are expected to increase 16% to 19% to the $4.10 to $4.20 range.","In summary, we once again delivered on our forecast in the fourth quarter with solid sales gains and continued margin improvement while offsetting market challenges and investing in our future. We look for further solid acquisition-adjusted sales growth and continued double-digit profit gains in the first quarter, as well as for the full year 2013 as we drive to produce yet another strong year and build for our future.","That concludes our formal remarks. And now here's Doug Baker with his comments on the quarter.","Douglas M. Baker","Well, hello, and good day. I just make the following thoughts or share them with you.","First, clearly Q4 was a good end to a very good year with EPS in the quarter of 17% adjusted EPS and that gave us 19% adjusted EPS growth for full 2013. I would say the most important point would be we left the year with solid top line momentum. We had over 6% organic sales growth. That was our best organic sales growth of the year. We had very strong new business results again in the quarter. They have continued into Q1. And we have real traction on our new product innovation launches, which also is very key to us continuing to drive margin expansion.","For 2013, we expanded margins about 110 basis points at the OI level. We delivered 150 basis points OI expansion in Europe. And we're on or above our plan in Champion and Nalco regarding our synergy commitments.","So as we indicated in our release and as Mike just finished with, we expect 2014 to be another very good year. Our forecasted EPS for the year is between 16% to 19% growth. It's going to be driven by continued strong organic growth and a continued OI leverage.","We're going to drive it the way we always do. We'll be nimble. We'll react to whatever the world throws us. We will make sure that, while reacting, we maintain our focus on new business and great innovation, disciplined operations and synergy realization. So I would say more of the same. We feel we're in a good position. We know what we need to do, and the team is doing a great job executing.","So with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for questions.","Michael Monahan","Thanks, Doug. That concludes our formal remarks. A final note before we start Q&A. We plan to hold our annual tour of our booth at the National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago on May 19. If you have any questions, please contact our office.","Operator, would you please begin the question-and-answer period?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Ritzenthaler with Piper Jaffrey.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I'd like to drill down a little bit more into the Energy results. We've seen a couple quarters in a row where we were in the low teens, kind of 12% growth, but it sounds like your expectations are a little lower than that looking at '14. Does that exclude the lumpier pockets of demand like the disbursants or -- I guess I'd just be interested in your thoughts there.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I guess, if you looked at fourth quarter growth, I think what we've said is expect low double-digit growth in the Energy business. And when you adjust for onetimers, i.e., the disbursements either in third quarter or fourth quarter, that's what we grew at in the second half and I think that's what you should expect moving into 2014. So the reported was 12.5%. If you take out some of the onetimers, we would have been 11% in the fourth quarter. If I remember, it's high single digits reported in the third quarter. And then when you adjust it for onetimers in the base, you got it -- you're back into the low double digits.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. On Renaissance, real quick. You had been talking about a moderation in the margin expansion in Europe and it sounds like that's come to fruition with the 150 basis points this year. So as you look at '14, do you expect the cadence to be more or less consistent with that -- with your 100 basis point target going forward?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I think 100 basis point has remained our target. We indicated, I think, in the second quarter that we expected to do about 130 to 150 basis points in 2013 in Europe. Some of that was a catch-up because we were a little behind our pace early in the program as a result of raw materials. So we caught up a bit on pricing. So we had more expansion in 2013 than the 100 target. I think 100 target is the right thing to think about. Our plan, of course, is for more. But I think the right way to think about it is 100 basis points a year and we are confident we can continue to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Doug, just on U.S. Institutional. What was the top line growth in Q4? And what's your expectation for '14? On the same front, Europe is still lagging. How much do you think that can grow, if at all, in 2014 on Institutional?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, U.S. Institutional all year has hung in there at 4% to 5% growth and it remained in that range in the fourth quarter. So U.S. Institutional continues to do the right thing. It's expanding margins. It's growing the top line. So that business is performing as we would expect. Europe, we've had soft sales, but we've had strong margin expansion. We certainly, if you will, inverted our equation for a bit of time, which is we are prioritizing in Europe broadly and in Institutional Europe, in particular, margin expansion over growth. But that equation's going to change and it's starting to change now where we are going to reprioritize growth as job #1. I would expect you to see steady improvement in terms of top line improvement. It's not going to be a big inflection point. So flattish for this year, accelerating through the year and starting to grow next year. With that said, it will be accretive. We will make more money in 2014 in Institutional Europe than we made this year, and the team's doing the right things to get that business structured the right way for long-term growth.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And Doug, just on Paper. Are you happy with the 2013 results? And what are your expectations for 2014 in Paper?","Douglas M. Baker","Since, I guess, after acquiring Nalco, everybody was -- kept inquiring why we would want the Paper business. We ended the year -- the Paper team, I think, has done a great job, certainly in the time that we've -- they've been part of our team and they ended the year with very strong top line growth of 5% in obviously an industry that's not the healthiest industry. But they're positioned well. They focused on selling the value-added technology. It's the most advantaged technology from a margin standpoint, too. They've had 2 years of outstanding operating income growth. So that business has performed quite well. I think that team's done a great job.","Operator","Our next question is from Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Hey Doug, wanted to talk a little bit and this is much bigger picture and maybe a little bit even too far to look beyond right now. But you've done a great job getting the energies, as you said, with Nalco and Champion and I know there are still a little bit of ways to go there, but as we look a little further out beyond just the good old Ecolab playbook of blocking and tackling on innovation and new products, where do you think the next big opportunities are going to be? I mean, is that like China becoming more consumer oriented? Is that Water or is that really still Energy for the next foreseeable future in terms of just new developments across the globe? Just wondering kind of where you think the next kind of big opportunities are that kind of move the needle beyond the everyday.","Douglas M. Baker","Oh, I guess I would start with this perspective, Nate. We chase a $100 billion market and we're only $13 billion. So without any \"big change or big win\" behind our back, we've got huge opportunity and blocking and tackling will take us a long way for a long time. So I would say that's point number one. Point number two, our markets are going to grow. I think they grow faster than GDP because of the macro trends around safe food, clean water, energy demand and the position that we have in the Energy business, as well as just environmental hygiene. And all of those are moving forward at a very, very rapid pace. So in China, if you look at their 5-year plan, you clearly have food safety and clean water, as well as clean air, but we don't participate in the air part. But those are big, big priorities. We have food safety legislation in the U.S., which is now just being enacted. And you have changes going on in other markets around the world. Water is going to become a bigger issue, not a smaller issue. So we think that propels us even in spite of the fact that we already have $87 billion in front of us without any growth. So I don't -- we do not feel like we're sitting here. We think the moves we made entering the Water and Energy business in a material way were smart moves. We think they have long legs. We have a lot to do to fully leverage that move going forward, and our historic business in the food safety business has also got a lot of legs. So I don't feel I'm sitting in a position where we have to make any radical moves to position ourselves for growth. We are a faster growth profile company than we were before we did these acquisitions with Champion and Nalco. And right now, the team's focused on executing, leveraging, making sure we're well positioned to capture all the trends that I just discussed.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Now that's great. And then just one smaller one, just in terms of the weather impact. Obviously, that's impacted a lot of businesses, particularly in the U.S. Could you -- I mean, is there any way to kind of quantify in terms of maybe the headwind on the top line results that, that might have caused either in the fourth quarter or kind of now into the first quarter?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, it's going to be more a first quarter impact and it's foreseen in the still fairly hefty growth target that we gave for the first quarter. But yes, I mean, look, we live in Minnesota. So of course, we don't complain about the weather here. Otherwise, that's all we would do so -- but the rest of the team that lives outside of Minnesota, I hear from them that the weather's been quite difficult around the country. And I guess, I would say it's going to have an impact in the first quarter. It's foreseen there. It's a onetime event. We don't believe it's really anything to worry about for the year. There's going to be some positive offset in the year that, of course, we won't talk about that will offset or neutralize whatever we realize negatively in the first quarter. We'll deal with it.","Operator","Our next question is from John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","First, in terms of Latin America and some of the currency changes that have gone down there, have you seen any change in local currency demand? I'm not interested in the translation effect, I think you guys covered it. But across the business lines, what are you seeing now in terms of that environment?","Douglas M. Baker","You mean in consumption? I guess, I want to make sure I understand.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Yes -- no, you're exactly right. In terms of your customers' consumption, how is their currency as maybe inflation picks up in some locations. Is that changing demand patterns for your products and services down there?","Douglas M. Baker","We haven't seen that. We've been through a lot of these in the past. They're never much fun because you end up, if you're going to go manage this correctly, doing a lot of things that you don't normally do in business. You want to make sure you shrink receivables before you walk into this. You're on a big, big pricing jihad right after it. And you got to make sure that you manage your customers in the right way for the long term. We were taking all those steps. I would say, typically, we come through these just fine. There's always an unfortunate immediate impact that you really can't avoid completely, and I think the teams have done the right things preparing and managing in the aftermath and we'll continue to do it.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","And then the follow-up. On mining, it looks like it came back as expected and it looks like it's going to spill over into Q1, some of that goodness. Can you quantify it for us or just give us a little bit more detail around the snapback in mining?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, we expect mining to be about the same in '14 as it was in '13, maybe modestly better, but not dramatically. And I would say mining is going to -- it's a good business. We have a good position. It has got a cyclical component to it. We'll ride it. It's a very small piece of the overall portfolio, so it's not going to have any material impact on us overall. But the mining team's doing the right things during this period of time, which is securing more share.","Michael Monahan","That's how we're growing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess, Doug, you cited the best revenue momentum this quarter of the year, and a lot of the numbers look like they ticked a little higher. Can you give us just any incremental color on what's driving that? Is that real momentum in the business, the new business you talked about? Is there anything, any onetime-ish stuff or easy comps anywhere that's driving that? Or should we think that business has really gained a bit of momentum in the last few months?","Douglas M. Baker","I think we felt like we gained momentum through the year last year in virtually every business. Second half was better than the first half in terms of sales. And certainly as we talked all last year, we had a very strong year in terms of new business productivity, as well as a strong innovation pipeline. So those things, we think, they started bearing fruit through the year and so we left the year, we believe, with better momentum than we, frankly, entered the year last year. So yes, that should pay dividends as we go through this. There'll be some probably near-term noise on what the numbers look like as a result of the weather. But fundamentally, we have more customers. They will buy more stuff this year, and that's the key to making sure you grow the top line and I think we've done a good job in those areas.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And how much of the better sales performance is new products versus just better execution? Or maybe the macro getting a little easier? In the past, you've given us the vitality index or you might call it something different, but has that changed meaningfully?","Douglas M. Baker","No. The vitality index has remained in the same camp, but I would say some of the new innovation, much of which was launched late last year and will probably be a bigger impact this year from a sales standpoint, is right in the core of what we offer to customers, be it new technology in the Water space base, new technology in F&B, new technology in Energy and in Institutional are all in the biggest categories we sell and have the most influence on yes and no from customers. Last year, I would say you probably had more impact from just good old-fashioned securing new customers. This year, it'll be a little more balanced. We expect to secure more customers and have higher productivity and sales, but we also expect to see bigger benefit out of new innovation, simply because the launches that we made at the end of last year will bear more fruit this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Yang with Oppenheimer.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Doug, I was just wondering what your thoughts are","now that a few months have passed regarding the US Foods-Sysco merger. I know you have -- both are customers of yours. And are there any puts and takes? I've heard from some restaurant customers that if they use both, maybe they'll pick up a smaller distributor just to keep them all honest. But what are your thoughts there?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I mean, I think 2 things. This stuff happens all the time and one of the reasons we typically want to be with the biggest players in the industries we serve is they tend to be the acquirers, and that certainly proved true here. We've got great relationships with both. We will have a great relationship with the new entity once it emerges or post-close. We don't know what the puts and takes are going to be between now and then in terms of any requirements from the government. We've lived that first hand, so we know it's tough to predict. But I guess, I would just call this as probably not something that we're particularly worried about because we think our position is solid and we're in good shape and we'll manage through it. Our goal will be to help Sysco, the new Sysco, succeed as much as we worked to help the old Sysco succeed.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Your pension and postretirement liabilities went down quite a bit. It was down 34% year-over-year. Is that going to have any benefit for you in terms of Corporate and Other? And what drove that improvement? Was it just plan returns, et cetera?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Well, yes, absolutely. I mean, pension gives a discount rate change, in this brilliant accounting move that we have at a point in time at the end of the year. So yes, it's favorable this year after being unfavorable for a number of years. So I would just say we're clawing back some of the money that we coughed up over the last few years. I would still say pension charges are high relative to actual pension costs because the discount rate, while improved from a P&L standpoint, is still relatively odd given history. So that's the view. I would say the benefit this year, most of it is going to be completely chewed up by FX, puts and takes.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Ridley-Lane with Merrill Lynch.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure. So for the first time in 10 years, Diversey grew its revenue in North America, albeit modestly, and the company has a goal of building critical mass in the U.S. Have you seen any impact on Ecolab's U.S. Institutional business? Did the win-loss rates change? And are you approaching new accounts with perhaps more competitive pricing?","Douglas M. Baker","Look, no. We've not seen any material change certainly in results vis-\u00e0-vis, frankly, any key competitor, including Diversey and including Institutional in the U.S. So we continue to take much more business from every competitor, including Diversey than we give up. We're growing at, at least double their rate and we're double their size. So in absolute dollars, it's a considerable growth advantage and we will work hard to maintain that type of advantage going forward because that's what we've worked to do all the years. So it's a big market. It doesn't necessarily mean if Diversey grows that it's going to be at our expense. So as I said, we have a 13 share, and we're the biggest guy. So there's plenty of room in the market. But right now, no, we don't see any impact on our business from Diversey.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up, Ecolab's had really great operating leverage in the Industrial segment as you've exited some lower-margin customers and products in both Water and Paper. Are you comfortable with the client product mix today? Or some of these actions will continue on in 2014?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, there's a little more in the base. So most -- I would say the vast majority of the actions have been taken in Water and Paper. We do like the product line. We think those businesses are well positioned. We think the team is doing a very good job. I already talked Paper, but I would say that's true in Water. Water sort of started coming out, if you will, from the shadow of some of those exits in the fourth quarter. Hence, you saw a 5% growth rate, which is not that different than we've been telling you Water's been growing at, the change is, you're starting to get out of the shadow. And so we would expect Water and Paper to continue to perform well moving into 2014. And really they are focused on securing new business, getting after leveraging the new technology that they've developed, et cetera.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a quick one. Are you seeing in any regions or niches more difficulty taking share or customers starting to shift -- introduce any menu shrink that would be more of a theme into late 2014 and 2015?","Douglas M. Baker","Not -- I would say -- you probably did ask me this in '08, '09, and I would have had a different answer then because, of course, we did see, in particular, foodservice and lodging as we were going into the '08, '09 crisis, you typically get guys pushing back on the number of products the buy. I don't -- no, I don't think that's the environment that we're looking at right now or facing. I think what's critical, though, to succeed is you have to really have a very sharp economic story as to why your program makes sense. So what's it going to do from a process standpoint? How is it going to help them make money? How are you going to help reduce Water footprint and Energy footprint? And how does that all add up to a good business proposition for customers? If we do that successfully, we have a very good success rate; and where we get a little sloppy in that equation, it's not a great environment to be sloppy.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.","Bill Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is Bill Carroll on for John. It looks like you paid down about $350 million in debt in the fourth quarter. And based on your interest expense guidance, it looks like your overall debt level will stay about the same in 2014. Is that the case? Or are you expecting that you'll continue to pare debt if you don't see any meaningful bolt-on acquisitions that you like, and if you repurchase shares to offset options dilution?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Well, I think you covered it. Debt will go down maybe a couple hundred million dollars this year but not -- won't have a big dramatic impact on debt. We will end this year with an EBITDA-debt ratio of about 2 and we're starting to get into the range that we talked about. So this is, if you will, the last year where we will have debt paydown as a priority moving through this other than when debt comes due. And so you'll see share repurchases here, as you just stated and I think Mike indicated in his comments, to neutralize any option redemption, et cetera, so we have a constant share base. But clearly, as we move into '15, '16 and '17, share repurchase will move back on, if you will, the cash used chart as to how we'll think about using cash. In terms of acquisitions, we have money in our plan for acquisitions this year. We are out actively looking for what I would call our traditional bolt-on type opportunities, not just in our traditional businesses, but obviously in Water and in Energy as well. And we would expect that we will start, if you will, rebuilding that pipeline, which we're doing and you'll start seeing the fruits of that in the second half.","Bill Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And also you noted that integration progress on Nalco and Champion is outpacing your own time lines. Is that the case in terms of dollar amounts as well?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I think we said, we're on or modestly over plan in terms of dollar delivery versus our $150 million target overall. What we're ahead of in a number of areas are the steps that we needed to actually realize these, and also the changes we have to make in terms of benefits and compensation and all the other stuff, that work has been done. It's been introduced. And so as a result, you take a lot of risk off the table when you move through that quickly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Doug, I'm impressed by the way you guys keep delivering on the Energy side. I was wondering -- a couple of questions around that because I haven't seen that from a lot of other chemical suppliers into that market. Is there something special, some secret sauce you can share with us in terms of market share gains? Have you completely overlapped the customer bases of Nalco and Champion and done the cross-selling, at least, awareness and acknowledgment of what you could do there in executing against that? And are you getting any price in that market? And lastly, what do you think that, that end market is growing at? Obviously, you guys are growing, I assume, at some multiple.","Douglas M. Baker","I think as we walk through it, the end market, we think, is growing in the high single digits and that's really a function of, if you will, new oil, which commands much more of the types of products and services we sell displacing old oil. And as a result of that, we have market growth even in a relatively flat oil environment. And I mean, that's a big heart of the story. So you'd say secret sauce, a big piece of it is our position vis-\u00e0-vis new oil and old oil, and that we have outsized share in new unconventional oil, in offshore, in other places where it takes more of our types of services than in the wells that are going dry. And just that move and that shift in mix is a big part of the growth. With that, we continue to work hard to secure new business. I think the team's done an excellent job managing clearly a big integration and keeping their eye on the ball. We have lost virtually no customers as a consequence of this other than those that we were forced to exit as a result of the DOJ ruling. And so I think the team's done a very good job. As we manage going forward, we've talked about this. We're in the production phase of this business. It's not the highly cyclical phase of the business. Hence, you do see fairly steady patterns in this business, which is what we saw historically when we looked at it and what we predicted we would have after we secured the business. And I just think that's what's playing out here. We will have quarters where we will be high single digit, not low double digit like the third quarter, and everybody wondered have we given up the ghost on double-digit growth. We think we'll bounce around high single, low double, but average low double-digit growth in this business for the foreseeable future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just 1 or 2 questions here, 2 quick ones. To complete the picture on the cash flows and the debt deleveraging, I didn't hear a CapEx kind of guidance number for the year. Do you happen to have what you're just looking to spend?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, 5.5% of sales would be the CapEx model guidance.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got you. And then, Doug, just in terms of the price cost curve, I think you gave maybe a couple of comments on raws, but can you just talk about -- I kind of think of '13 was the year where you were recovering price. Are we still recovering price? Is that the expectation for '14? Or can you talk about what your outlook is for raws and for pricing versus those for the year ahead?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Walking in, I would say we thought it was going to be a benign raw market. If you asked me, third quarter last year, our forecast for '14, I would say we think it's going to be not as benign as we had thought. So we're assuming that we're going to have some raw material pressures throughout the year and we're taking the actions to get after that. But again, I would say that's built into our forecast. So to do what we say we're going to do, we need to continue to get after pricing. We have, by and large, recovered, if you will, from the last raw material run-up. And we are confident we'll offset any raw material run-ups that we see from a dollar standpoint and we'll see on the margin side. But we're pretty confident we have the game in hand and we're assuming probably less favorable raw environment than we thought, if you will, third quarter of last year. But we need to think that way, otherwise, you're not going to get on pricing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a quick question on Energy again. It seems like you had strong upstream business with deepwater oil sands. Can you just compare your upstream business with downstream in terms of growth and margins?","Michael Monahan","P.J., you kept fading out. Could you repeat the last part of your question?","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, sorry. Can you compare your upstream versus downstream business in Energy in terms of growth rates and margins?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Well, the downstream business has improved all year. It's not a double-digit growth business, though its growth rate in the fourth quarter -- I'm looking at a chart, I think it was 8%, okay? It was 8%. So that business is performing well, but obviously, it's part of the total portfolio there and that overall business grew at 12.5%. So the rest you can figure out is growing at a faster rate. And I think that's what we'll continue to see, that both our well chem business, which is drilling and additives and our OFC business have been performing quite well. And we would expect to see that trend continue. The downstream business on a stand-alone basis is a very good business and very well run.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just all the water that is used in frac-ing, is there a significant opportunity for your water treatment business?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I think there's a significant opportunity for -- definitely all kinds of technologies there. Certainly, you can think about how do you treat water post frac so that they can reuse it again and we are deploying technologies there. I mean, even some of the antimicrobials I've talked about that Energy took from F&B is being deployed for that purpose in retention ponds and the like. So there are mechanical ways to do it. There are chemical ways. There are new treatments that have been developed that basically create a situation where you could use a lot less water to create the same advantage via the frac. That's probably even more impactful for those running frac-ing operations because they don't need to truck in the water to begin with and they have less to deal with post frac. So there's a host of technologies that we're working on to take advantage of the frac-ing opportunity and the challenges that our customers in that business face.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just 1 quick follow-up. Can you give us a sense what the FX rates for a couple of the major currencies are that you forecast for 2014 in terms of the segment revenues?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. What's your favorite rate, Gary, the euro?","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, sure, sure.","Douglas M. Baker","1.35 is our management spot rate, is our forecast. It should be about 1.36 is what we've got the forecast at","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay.","Douglas M. Baker","Any others you like?","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Well, I mean, you tell me what are the next, say, 2 biggest?","Douglas M. Baker","Most people miss this. The second biggest impact we have is, Ecolab trivia for 100, the Canadian dollar. Can you guess that? So there, we've got a spot rate of 91 5.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. So with -- I believe in your comments about the outlook for energy in 2014. You had indicated deepwater and oil sands were going to be the big drivers and it was going to help to offset weakness on the North American shale front. Can you walk us through what weakness you're actually seeing there and if it's -- is it negative or is it just more moderate growth out of that business?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, a moderation of the growth rate, not negative growth by any means. So no, I mean, it continues to grow. It continues to be -- I even think that outlook's changing with $5 gas and other things that are going on right now. So yes, I would say look, all businesses have their challenges. I think as we look at the Energy business, they're certainly more in the positive ledger than the negative.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. No, that definitely makes sense. And then just one follow-up. I know there was a large-scale water and paper transaction that happened in the market in the last week or so. And I guess I'm wondering if you looked at that and whether it was an attractive opportunity to you or it was just something you just didn't even look at.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Look, we shy away from commenting on that. But I think we've said before, I mean, a big piece of that was Paper. We like our Paper business, but we don't plan to get bigger in that area. So that's just not where we're going to go fish. We think we are -- we have a great team, great technology in the Water business, in the Paper business. We don't feel we're subscale or missing anything. So that's -- we're happy where we are.","Operator","Our next question is from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli and Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","Following up on the paper side, Doug, I was wondering as your business is growing at 5% and there is still shrinking in North America and Europe is not going anywhere, what is the percentage of your business in Asia Pacific where growth is actually quite substantial? And what are you doing in terms of increasing that share?","Michael Monahan","We're looking.","Douglas M. Baker","Rosemarie, you sent us into a deck. The sales? Yes, okay. Asia is about 20% of our Paper sales in total and is growing faster than Paper on average, how's that?","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","Okay. So do you have any programs in place so it can eventually become, let's call it, 50% of your Paper sales? Asia Pacific, and I mean by that, India, as well is growing if you look at that region.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, we're fairly well positioned in Asia. The program I, mean, it's going to take a while because we want to grow all regions. And so the fastest way to flip a mix is to have a disaster in another region. So our plan is to continue growth in all regions, but have outsized growth in Asia Pacific. So I don't think you're going to see 50% anytime soon, but I do think you'll see continued increase in terms of size of AP relative to the whole Paper business.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","And is the profitability of that business higher in Asia Pacific than it is in North America and Europe?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, we don't disclose profitability by region. But what we would focus on there, Rosemarie, is not necessarily OI. What we care a lot about is gross margin. If you have your gross margins right, then over time, scale will work for you. And we want to make sure that the business we're securing in these new regions is at a gross margin that will ultimately enable us to make a very handsome OI. And so we are very disciplined there. But for periods of time in these markets, we will go with negative OI or very low OI as long as it's just high SG&A and not a lousy GP.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","Okay. No, that is great. And I have a question regarding Textile Care. Obviously, it seems to be the only one of your operations that has a negative top line growth, which is, to a very large degree, related to the industry. But I was wondering if you were to exit that, not offer Textile Care to your existing customers, would you lose business in other areas? In other words, you are kind of stuck with it?","Douglas M. Baker","No, I wouldn't say that. I think we've been in the business because we're good at it and over periods of time, we think this business works for us. But no, I wouldn't call this like there's some kind of strategic pull and you would be penalized in other businesses. So with that said, I mean, the textile business we expect to perform much better in 2014 and it's predicated on understanding of what our new customer pipeline is, both already secured or nearly secured. And so I think that business will do much better in '14.","Operator","Next question comes from Eugene Fedotoff with Longbow Research.","Eugene Fedotoff - Longbow Research LLC","Doug, just wanted to follow up on severe weather impact in first quarter. When you look at the portfolio of your businesses, can you share your thoughts where you think you'll see the most of the impact of weather?","Douglas M. Baker","Oh, weather would impact. Look, it's going to be U.S. It's going to impact -- our business is exposed to foodservice, food retail and energy, right? Energy, to some extent, not a huge extent, but Energy is going to be impacted, too.","Eugene Fedotoff - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then a question on the equipment and repair business. It seems like the business has been growing top line over the last couple of quarters, mid-single and even double digits this quarter. Was that business profitable in 2013? And what's happening with operating profits there?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, no. We were -- first of all, I should thank you for the question because I got this question for 12 straight years and I was not able to say this. So we made money in 2013, not just cash, but actual profit, fully loaded. We expect to continue to drive that business and expand its margins in 2014. So the business has been accretive for quite a while and continues to be so. The business is doing well.","Operator","Our next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Doug, just I noticed you talked about the change pretty soon in Europe that you're going to switch from the focus on more cost-cutting over there to kind of driving the top line a little bit more. Is that sensing a change in the end markets? Or is this sensing a change in the cost-cutting opportunities? And what time frame are you talking about there?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I think the time frame's over this year. I mean, it's not on Tuesday. So it takes some time to enact this shift. You can call it right away and we have called it. What's driving it? I would say it's where we are in the development. A lot of the cost-saving activity is going to be shifting into the product supply arena, but doesn't have the same direct impact on the organization that some of the other work did. So the organization shift can occur right now and I would say in some of the markets, you're going against a pretty easy comparable. So the market looks a little steadier than it did, say, a year ago.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just given where we are right now in the global economy and what you see, where do you feel your opportunity is for your organic growth rate in the current environment over the next few years? You guys have talked about like 6% to 8%. Does the low end of that sound right? Does the midpoint, the end? I mean, where does -- how does that sound?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Look, we're in the low end of our range right now and that's with Europe down modestly and it's 20% of our business. You start getting Europe to move just a point or so, it starts kicking it quickly into the middle of the 6% to 8% organic range and plus. Without Europe, we're already at 8%. So I think that range is a way to think about it. We're going to have businesses that go through some rework at any one period of time. I think the 6% to 8% is sustainable for us. I think you'll see with some bolt-on acquisition work that we may trip over that in terms of reported numbers. But organic 6% to 8% is our target. We think it's the right one. There's opportunity in almost every region in almost every business. And I guess when we start getting pinned in a business where we don't think we can grow it, we start becoming less enamored with it.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Got you. If you don't mind, just a kind of housekeeping. What was the free cash flow for the year, and how should we think of that for 2014?","Douglas M. Baker","Free cash flow was basically $900 million for the year, up substantially from last year, and we would expect it to be up substantially again in '14.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates.","Richard O'Reilly","On the margins for the Energy business, the footnote says the adjusted was up 230 basis points. That's up from the 17.4%? Is that what we should be comparing against?","Michael Monahan","Hey, Richard. That's acquisition adjusted. Pro forma.","Douglas M. Baker","Right. So yes. It's as if we owned Champion in the fourth quarter as well. So what we're comparing there is saying if Champion and Nalco were a combined business in Q4 of '12 where we compare Q4 '13 versus that pro forma, we're up 230 basis points.","Richard O'Reilly","Okay, fine. Okay, okay. I don't know if we have the absolute [ph] number.","Douglas M. Baker","In that business, we're seeing the synergies roll through. We can talk synergy numbers. But if I don't see them show up in the P&L, you're not very confident in the addition.","Richard O'Reilly","Right, and does that include the Champion goodwill amortization, too, the $19 million?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. It's in both.","Operator","Our final question comes from Mr. Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Had a question on the 3D TRASAR solid technology that you just announced. Obviously, looks like a nice example of you cross-pollinating the Ecolab and Nalco technologies in that field. Can you talk about some of the advantages or new applications that the solid technology gets you into versus the legacy 3D TRASAR for cooling water? And is there going to be any cannibalization there? Or is this not really something that you -- where you can migrate legacy customers over to the new technology?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, Mike, you could migrate existing customers over to it, but the focus is going to be on securing new business. So what this does is it positions water in a unique way to go after the Institutional or the light water market. And it gives them a way to compete that no other competitor could compete. So the solid benefits in that industry are very similar to the solid benefits in all the other industries we apply them: easier to handle; much safer; high, high control of costs; lower plastic; bigger sustainability benefit. I mean, it goes on and on. I would say the reaction of customers, once we put this together, has been very favorable. And interestingly, premerger, Nalco worked along an initiative like this, sort of like Ecolab worked on an initiative to duplicate or replicate 3D TRASAR. Ecolab got pinned by the IP. We couldn't quite get there. Nobody else has been able to either. And on the solids, know-how is very important in how you do this, and Nalco didn't have solidification knowledge within their R&D. Clearly, we do now as a combined organization. So what we've really done is, to your point, marry great technologies from both companies to create a new offer. The great thing about the light industry that we're going to go after is high margin, high retention. This used to be big area of emphasis for Nalco if you go back in the '90s, pre-Suez and the rest. And everybody's quite excited about our capabilities there. And clearly, there's great cross-selling because we've got very good share and established relationships in those industries. So it's spot on to what we thought we would do when we made this acquisition, and so this is the type of work that we want to get after because it will grow the business.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","All right, sounds good. And just one last one. You referenced the gross margin, maybe seeing some pressure related to the increasing mix of the Energy business within the overall margin picture. How much lower than the 46% gross margin number you're pointing to for next year for the whole company? How much lower is the energy gross margin?","Douglas M. Baker","I guess we don't disclose it, but here's how -- I'll just share this, how we think about it. I don't care if our reported gross profit is going down because of mix if all of these subcomponents of the gross profit mix are healthy, which is really the case here. If you looked at fourth quarter and you took out the Energy mix component, we're up about 20 basis points on GP year-on-year. So what's important to us is how's the Institutional GP doing? How is F&B doing? How is Specialty doing? How is Pest doing? How is Water doing? How is Paper doing? And how is Energy doing? If all those GPs are moving the right direction then I don't care if mix because, one's growing faster than the other, has a dampening effect on the reported GP because it doesn't have anything to do with the health of the business. Our equalizer is OI. And OI is a metric that we look at because you have different places. You've got different geographies of the P&L of a pest versus a soap business, et cetera. And OI is the one that we really make sure that we focus on and want to see drop through of all good efforts, and you saw that. You saw it in Energy. Virtually every business we were in last year had nearly a triple-point basis point improvement in OI. And to us, that's really the strong measure we look at. Are we successfully growing top line and creating more leverage as a result of both volume and good efforts inside the business.","Michael Monahan","All right. That wraps our fourth quarter conference call. This conference call and the associated slides will be available for replay on our website.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Mike Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Mr. Monahan, you may now begin.","Mike Monahan","Thank you. Hello everyone and welcome to Ecolab's third quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. A discussion of our results, along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor.","Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements in these materials, stating that this teleconference and the associated supplemental materials include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed under Risk Factors section in our most recent Form 10-K and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with a brief overview of the results, pricing, new business gains and product innovation led the third quarter sales, and along with productivity improvements and cost efficiency actions yielded the third quarter's 12% adjusted diluted earnings per share increase.","Moving on to some highlights from the quarter and as discussed in our press release, acquisition adjusted FX currency sales increased 2% as the institutional and Other segments shows steady sales gains and more than offset a modest decline in energy and moderately softer industrial markets.","Adjusted fixed currency operating income margins increased to 140 basis points, consuming their steady improvement. Income growth was led by double digit gains in the Industrial and Energy segments. Adjusted earnings per share increased 12% to a $1.71, representing another quarter of double digit adjusted EPS growth. Currency translation was an unfavorable $0.03 per share in the quarter. Progress continues on the spin-off of our upstream energy business, we continue to expect a spin-off to be completed by mid-2020.","Looking ahead, we will begin rebuilding our sales momentum in the fourth quarter as the moderated delivered product costs environment has enabled us to re prioritize new business development as our sales team's primary objective. As always, we will drive our new business wins by focusing on our innovative products, sales and service expertise, and our value proposition of best results and the lowest total operating costs for customers. We will also continue driving productivity and cost efficiencies.","Our digital investments are developing well and we look for them to add new actionable insights for customers to improve their operations, increase our sales force effectiveness, and enhance our market differentiation. We narrowed our forecast with the full year 2019. We now look for adjusted diluted earnings per share to rise 10% to 12% to the $5.80 to $5.90 range, as price and volume gains and cost efficiency benefits more than offset the impact of moderated delivered product cost increases and business investments.","Currency translation deteriorated $0.02 and is now expected to be an unfavorable $0.13 per share in 2019. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the $1.64 to $1.74 range of 6% to 13%. In summary, we expect good fourth quarter earnings momentum in 2019 to more than offset moderated delivered product costs and unfavorable currencies exchange, and along with cost efficiency actions yield 10% to 12% adjusted earnings per share growth. As we continue to make right investments in key areas of differentiation including product innovation and digital investments, we expect to develop superior growth this year and for the future.","And now, here's Doug Baker with some comments.","Doug Baker","Thanks Mike. So, I'll this offer my take on the quarter. There's a lot to likes in this quarter and there are some areas that we're addressing. The good news is as we leave the third quarter moving into the fourth quarter, we're in a very good position in this year successfully, while I'd say importantly building momentum as we head into 2020. So, the positive in Q3 will certainly 12% adjusted EPF growth.","We have very strong cash flow with a Q3 conversion rate of over 100% as we reduce inventories pulled our supply chain SAP roll out in North America, year-to-date cash flow is up 29%. We also continued our strong pricing helping drive the 140 basis points OI margin improvement Mike reference.","Our team is executed really well across the board. They continued to drive the business performance improvements. They're also managing in North American SAP rollout, which has moved from supply chain into the commercial arena and they're also managing a spin of upstream all this they're doing while improving the business.","So, we also talked that we've shifted our sales team priority focus, as raw materials stabilized and some market has softened. We've moved our field team focus from what I call pricing and growth to growth and pricing, meaning growth is primary. That's the only thing we asked him to do, but you always have to have something as number one priority and right now we believe it's smart to have growth as the number one priority.","So, this shift moves this team back to what I would call their natural state, and we're seeing strong results in all of our leading indicators. Net business is accelerating. It was virtually flat year-on-year in Q1, up 10% in Q2, was up over 40% in Q3. We really need roughly 15% year-on-year to continue the growth trajectory that we'd like to see.","At the same time while we're accelerating our net new business, the team has continued to deliver on pricing which excluding upstream in Q3 was up 3%; and very importantly, our customer retention has improved throughout the year as well, so our pricing efforts are not leading to declining retention trends.","Finally, I feel very good about our priorities, our plan and the execution. So, we got on cost early, we remain on cost, we've got a great job securing the needed pricing as we've discussed, we've also shifted successfully to driving new business; and as I mentioned are starting to see those results while continuing to secure pricing. We're also driving the critical investment for sustained advantage like digital, like SAP, like people development and like the upstream spin.","So now, let me turn it back to Mike, who will open up the Q&A session.","Mike Monahan","That concludes our formal remarks. Operator, would you please begin the question-and-answer period.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO capital Markets.","John McNulty","With regard to the reprioritization around new business development versus pricing kind of moving the volumes sort of front of I guess of the queue. I guess, how quickly can you get that shift to start really working on the volumes? And I guess also, how should we be thinking about what this means for price mix as we look to 2020 as well?","Doug Baker","Yes, it's a little different by business. I would say in industrial, there's usually a couple quarter lag between securing significant new business and when you start seeing it show up in the P&L. Institutional, that lag can be a bit shorter call it a quarter and a half. So, there's always a takes a little time for what I would call accelerating new business trends to show up in the growth trend and make a difference.","We would expect to have one I think historically good pricing. Next year, we're going to enter the year with very good carry in momentum. We will continue to price in this environment. It's just going to be and we just -- I mean, honestly, it's about as simple as it sounds. We were late getting on pricing. Sales teams hate doing pricing. It's a contentious discussion with customers who are they who they're trying to be like us.","And so, this is always a hard thing to get sales teams excited and motivated around and you've got to make a call. We rang the bell little over a year ago on pricing. They started making very material difference as a consequence of that, and we now know given the situation where they can raw markets is broadly economically, it's smart to get on volume. So, I think what you'll see is an increasing volume trend going throughout the year, but we'll take a few quarters for you to see material change.","John McNulty","And then maybe just a quick question on the Industrial segment and the overall growth actually looked relatively robust considering some of the macro back drop. I guess can you speak to the condition of the end markets that you're seeing and, and what that means in terms of some shared gain that it looks like you may have been picking up?","Doug Baker","Yes, I think our industrial business I would agree, I think it's fared pretty well. I mean, it shows up for instance water looking like it went from an eight to five we really probably think it went down two points and this is several factors. I mean, certainly some markets are softening but it's not stopping across the board in the industrial areas. There is a number of places where it's still quite strong and we see those areas.","So the F&B business, chemical plants, commercial buildings, life sciences is example those markets are really an impacted whereas steel, auto and paper which I think there is a lot of noise around and we would also say we see some of that softening there as well.","But with that said, I think we view this market. I mean if this is a conditions wherein we think ultimately our new business efforts will overcome a lot of that song thing maybe not 100% of it, but we can still grow it a very good clip in that business and obviously if it gets dramatically worse then we'll have to update our forecast, but that's not what we see right now.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews","Maybe, if you could just help us unpack the volume performance as we strip out energy and then the low margin businesses you exited, if you can just kind of walk us through the segments and where you were happier where you think there's more work to be done?","Doug Baker","We would -- I don't I've ever had a quarter where I thought I was happy with our volume growth. And this would include it, meaning we have aggressive targets that we go chase. But if you unpack it your take away, paper was down this year and in the Energy segment, we probably lost a point in total. So without those, we will be up a point, but that's not where we need to be, which is really why sort of this shift in emphasis.","We have very good trends in pricing and other things. We know we're going to have good carry-in. We've got to get moving on adding even more share. I would point out against every one of our major competitors, we track wins and losses we've gained share against all of them, but you've got to go on a really major share gain strategy when you have softening markets.","Vincent Andrews","If I could, just as a follow-up to that into the pricing pivot, are there specific new business initiatives that you're putting in place, is it product-specific or is it digital new technology, ERP system driven? Or is it just basic blocking and tackling?","Doug Baker","Well, we all use innovation as one of the primary, if you will, means to the end i.e. we bring additional benefit to customers, new and our existing and that's absolutely critical to equipping the sales team to have good success in new business. So certainly, the new digital efforts that we've had are starting to bear fruit. We're seeing it in a number of accounts, in QSR where we really led in the Institutional side, we're seeing it in food retail as well and water was one of the early adopters and we've seen very strong efforts around there as well.","But with that said, there has been clear new target established for the last four months of the year, what we're trying to achieve, what kind of momentum we're trying to drive. I think the sales teams love these initiatives, they're all over it it's clearly tracked, clearly monitored it's led by Christophe Beck, our COO and that initiative will also, we're quite confident, help us gain volume momentum as well as pricing momentum.","Operator","Next question is coming from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your questions. Mr. Bisbee, your line is open for questions. Moving on, our next question will be coming from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","My first question is just also just to follow up quickly on the pricing shift. What changed between I guess today and the prior quarter, is it just any backdrop that the -- weakness in the Industrial side or was it just -- may be just a little bit more color on why the decision was made today?","Doug Baker","Well, it wasn't really made today. It was obviously made several months ago. And as we start moving this shift, I mean you got to -- it takes little time to enact it. This is like a natural occurrence for us. Sooner or later, our natural bent is growth then pricing, and so what I would call, it was a call to get back to natural state versus sort of a -- abnormal state where it's pricing over growth.","And as we look at the situation we saw a rise, if you will, stabilizing in terms of market, in fact, we had a little daylight in Q3 year-on-year i.e. raws were slightly cheaper this year than they were a year ago in total when we net everything out And so that condition certainly, you know, what's we had forecast, we started to see that, in fact, it was true. And it takes a little time for these shifts to start bearing fruit.","So you got to be a little bit ahead of the curve not behind it. There is no doubt that all the pricing actions that are in flight are going to be completed by the sales team. We continue to monitor that I'd point out that we had still strong new business growth, even when pricing was in front. So we'll continue to have good pricing effort even when growth is in front.","Manav Patnaik","And then just your comments on the net new business, the acceleration from 0 to 10 to 40, I guess in the fourth quarter or broadly just some thoughts on how we should interpret that into growth next year because I think you said all you need is really 15%. So that 40% sounds a stand-out there?","Doug Baker","Yes. And it's not a relatively small number right in terms of the whole P&L. So, I mean if I wanted to give you a very simplistic example if you've got a business in a $100 million and it loses 5% a year in attrition. Then if you want to grow at 7% you're going to need to add 12% new business. Somehow let's pretend it only comes from net new gains in corporate accounts, we have some businesses like that. Kay, would be like that really the only sell corporate accounts, well as you go through this, you start doing the math that 12%, it's got to continue to grow each year, roughly a 15% rate, if you want to continue to grow at 7%.","And so that's how we look at this and so we measure this very closely, we like to be more around the 20% rate, so that we have some wiggle room if you will, in our numbers and those are the types of things that we look at because they're good forward indicators for us. But as I mentioned, I think John had asked the question. It doesn't, it's not like an immediate show-up.","So if we land, a new contract, we will count it as new business that day, it may take us three to four months to fully install and to realize that volume, but at the same time we are counting losses, the day it's announced, even though it may take four to six months for that loss to fully see itself into our P&L, and we think that's important. And so really this whole number is really a measure of our of our large wins and losses, principally in corporate accounts.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. Let's see if this works this time, I guess, Doug, one more cut at the revenue. There is a number of areas where the comps were actually quite a bit tougher. F&B, paper being too. You talked about timing at Life Sciences. We know you walked away from some low-margin business that at Institutional recently, like how much of the sequential deceleration is sort of those factors that can normalize relative to actual change in the underlying trajectory like, because of weaker macro conditions or other items?","Doug Baker","Yes, I think in Industrial, I mean I think when you normalize you get like this, I mean, if we were going to just to kind of top size this thing, it's a there's like a 2 point apparent deceleration. I mean we are still going to grow on our higher base. We would call it 1 point market and 1 point is sort of gear shift from pricing to new business. And that's why we know we get on this new business, we're already starting to see the results, we know we will end up, if you will, gaining back some of that sales momentum.","Now we aren't going to be able to cover any market condition. Nobody's ever expected us to nor will we promise that we can, but if the conditions remain more or less like they are today. We think this is still a relatively good market for us to continue to perform in the fashion that we're performing.","Gary Bisbee","And then a quick follow-up just on pricing, you said you expect to enter 2020 still having pretty solid pricing, but obviously, the comps get more difficult as we move out because you start lapping the bigger price increases you've gotten. What's reasonable to think about over the next year? I mean is it sort of like the 1% or so that's been the long-term average or 1% to 2% or anyway to help us.","Doug Baker","Yes, I would say, it's not going to be at the current rate, which really when you strip out as I mentioned, Upstream averages up, right, it's a little over 2.5%. It's about the rate that we expect in the fourth quarter and it is going to slow through the year, but we will be significantly above our normalized 1% calling almost terminal rate that we have. So I think we're in a position next year where we don't forecast inflation really in our raw material base to still have benefit from pricing.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Doug, can you discuss the competitive dynamics in U.S. institutional and any concern that -- may be more aggressive view on the new business development might elicit some price response from your large competitor?","Doug Baker","Yes, David, I haven't, we haven't seen huge change in their behavior really anywhere, I would say, as we look at our wins and losses against our main Institutional F&B competitor, it's 4 times more wins than losses. And so our advantage, I think in technology and feet on the street and ability honestly to deliver great value I think continues to show up.","So I mean, I'm just -- the numbers that we have, we don't see it. If we look at retention kind of ex the large margin walk away situation, we have very good retention, and so we're not seeing it. We're not getting nickels and dimes with small, medium accounts. Our retention has actually improved in Industrial throughout the year, which is terrific given the very strong pricing performance that they've had. So that's what we know.","David Begleiter","Very good. And just on buybacks, Doug, you bought back no stock in the quarter, is that due to more active M&A pipeline and how is M&A pipeline today?","Doug Baker","Yes, we've got a large pipeline I've mentioned this and we're obviously going after a number of what I'd call middle to smaller deals. I think we also have larger folks that we'd be interested in, but there you got to be pretty, pretty price disciplined. Typically they're longer -- they're companies with the history and your ability to improve them is X, but not X times three, and so we need to make sure that we're going to get a return for our shareholders over any reasonable period of time.","I would say I never really want a recession, but I mean if there is an upside and there is a recession coming, I just can't tell you what year it's going to be, it will be a better M&A environment. ","Operator","Next question is from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. ","John Roberts ","Doug, thanks. In the Institutional SBU, for the business that was exited, was that business that Ecolab never should have been in, or was it business that you've got in and then the customers eroded in that business? And then if you can characterize for us the businesses that you are exiting? ","Doug Baker ","Yes. No, we were in that business a long time, the value equation we had was favorable. The offers that were put on the table for the customers were dramatic decreases on what I would characterize as lower margin business for us before we ever would consider meeting those deals. And so while it was good, it was going to be upside down if we met those like bids. And so, we chose not to do that. We of course continue to try to secure the business at a much different price than was being offered and the customers made a choice. This has happened. I mean, this isn't the first time, I wish it would be the last. And as I mentioned before, we've been through -- we went through a wave of this in F&B for a number of years, I would say we secured almost all of that business back. I can't really think of one that we have and I'm sure there is one. We've had in Institutional over years. It kind of moves by region. And in many cases, we've re-secured that business as well. So we've got to maintain price discipline. Going -- selling customers for a cash loss just doesn't make any sense to us. And I -- we do not believe our cost advantage or we have this monster cost disadvantage, I think we just understand the cost of doing the business quite well. ","John Roberts ","And then post-spin, will you put the downstream energy business into the Industrial segment? And are the margins about the same as the overall industrial segment currently? ","Doug Baker ","Yes, downstream will end up in the Industrial segment. In fact, their margins are higher. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. ","Dan Rizzo ","Hi guys, this is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. How are you? So with the pricing and the shift to growth for next year, is there a certain threshold with external factors that would kind of make you shift your policy again. I mean would be a spike in oil or I mean how do you think about it if things were to change in terms of the input cost environment? ","Doug Baker ","Yes, well absolutely, I mean you can draw a scenario where it would be smart to re-prioritize again, input pricing had a growth. We aren't anticipating that environment obviously but should it happen, we could pivot quickly there. ","Operator","Next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. ","Christopher Parkinson ","Your results in F&B continue to do pretty well on enterprise selling across water pest elimination among a few other substrates. Can you just give us an intermediate to long-term update on where these initiatives stand? Where they could go in 2021? And just are there any other glaring enterprise selling opportunities within Industrial comparable to F&B? Thank you. ","Doug Baker ","Well, yes, I would probably characterize it as -- why don't I say within water just because it's really water and F&B partnering very successfully. And honestly, there are a lot of legs left in that partnership. There is many customers where we may have small penetration of the combined concept, but not full enterprise and there are others where we haven't penetrated yet at all. So I would say I think the team has done a great job. But there is still plenty of room left to go even there. With that said, if you look at the water match up with Institutional, particularly in the hotel segment and with healthcare and the hospital for acute care segment, there is a significant upside. With water and life sciences is, pharma continues to make sure that they create really sterile boundaries even external to they're building et cetera. So there are a number of initiatives and opportunities as we go forward. The data that we're getting and the new capabilities to digital just enhance our capability to what I would say it, marry these solutions to create outsized impact for customers. ","Christopher Parkinson ","Got it. You've also -- lot more with products and service programs in healthcare over the last 12 months to 18 months, including some stuff internationally. Can you just quickly walk us through the two to three key growth drivers for our 2020 in both the U.S. and abroad just given the strategy evolution? Thank you. ","Doug Baker ","Yes, look, I would say, number one, continue driving the program, selling initiatives that are already underway. They continue to have success. We know long-term that's one of the smartest strategies and the team continues to work to pull what I would call some commoditized segments and wrap them with digital capability to create additional programs moving forward. The other, as we discussed at the Investor Conference that we had is OEM Solutions. A lot of this is marrying our capability and other med-tech device companies' capabilities and creating joint solutions that really gives both sides an advantage and these can be quite sticky as well. Those would be two big initiatives that we continue to push. We continue on Anios to push internationally and geographic moves outward using their technology where we don't want to build, if you will, a ground-up Ecolab healthcare business and we continue to build out countries like Australia, China et cetera with more traditional Ecolab full service approach. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with G. Research. Please proceed with your question. ","Rosemarie Morbelli ","Doug, looking at downstream energy, you mentioned the timing of new business start-up and timing of also maintenance. Could you give us an estimate of the impact on the downstream growth? And then, is that a business that you can catch up in the fourth quarter or do you have to wait until the spring of next year because of weather? ","Doug Baker ","Yes, no, I mean the downstream business will we think be much better in the fourth quarter, because of the timing issues that we discussed. So mid-single-digits type performance. I would say, downstream is not that much different than some of the other businesses. They have been clearly all over pricing as well and have done a very good job securing pricing. It's helped them drive significant enhancement in margin, because they had to rebuild margins as well as a result of raw material price inflation. And so, they are also in a shift to make sure that they get on and have growth and pricing but growth first, as they start driving share gains and they've got plenty of opportunities to do that. ","Rosemarie Morbelli ","And then quickly if you could touch on how much business overall you may have lost because of your pricing strategy? And then if you could update us on the transaction, the Holchem transaction in the UK, where do you stand? ","Doug Baker ","Well, the Holchem, I mean I think it has been announced, we have a disagreement with the anti-trust authorities. Unfortunately, the power in this disagreement is asymmetrical. Just the same, we plan to challenge it through the legal channels that are available to us. But clearly, it's not a positive. And so, we just have to let that and move through the courts. In terms of -- customers we lost because of pricing. I mean aside from the conversation we've just had around those two customers in Institutional, which is now well over a year old story in terms of when we got the news, we don\u2019t know -- I don't know of -- I'm sure there is a few but not material and the best evidence is the evidence I cited earlier, which is what we call our retention, which we measure very carefully by business. Our retention corporately is better and it's improved throughout the year in Industrial. So we don't really see the pricing has had an adverse effect on our customer base. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question. ","Mike Harrison ","Was wondering about the water business, you mentioned some softening in autos and steel. Can you talk a little bit about how those markets were trending during the third quarter and into Q4 were they worsening? And I guess kind of the heart of my question is that autos have been weak for some time. So is it that they're shut down activity that happened in Q3? And I guess why didn't -- why haven't autos looked weaker earlier in the year, because they've been under some pressure for some time? ","Doug Baker ","Yes autos I think as you know well publicized scenario. So I don't think we see a situation where that turns around by any means in Q4. I mean you might have GM. It was a specific customer because strike on and strike off. But aside from that I mean autos weakened throughout the quarter and we would expect them to remain weak in Q4 as we go through. ","In terms of steel, we got more of mixed message as it goes. I mean we secured new business in that area. But overall, I mean the steel business as a consequence, in part because of autos and other Industrial is down. But we don't look at that one as hopeless as that business continues to grow. We would expect it to grow in the fourth quarter. ","Mike Harrison ","And then a question on the F&B business, just looking for an update on the protein market. You mentioned that, that market grew moderately during the quarter, but was wondering specifically if you can comment on what you're seeing related to African swine fever and the impact that that's had on protein markets? ","Doug Baker ","Yes, I don't think that's going to have a material impact on us, given most of our exposure in protein would be beef and chicken. So we've seen the protein business continues to grow. It's low single-digits. We would expect more of the same. ","Operator","The next question is from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. ","Eric Petrie ","Good afternoon, this is Eric Petrie on for PJ. Doug, your volume and mix was flat in the quarter, how do you think that compares versus underlying industry trends? ","Doug Baker ","Well, as we mentioned earlier that's heavily influenced by Energy, right, which was off considerably and also paper. I think even those declines were very much in line with industry trend. You might even argue we held sort of our gain share in those markets. And then on the balance, I think now I mean how many -- I've got a lot of industries to walk through, but I would say, I think if you look in total, I think we're -- if you look at our net wins and net losses what we think is actually going on in the markets, I would say we feel we are gaining share, but not at the rate that we want to or need to in the market environment we're in right now. ","Eric Petrie ","In healthcare, your team has been innovative with product launches including digital dashboards, predictive analytics, and core temperature fluid management. Do you think that's enough to get the top-line growth higher? ","Doug Baker ","Well, we're bouncing around the low to mid-single digits, right now. I think it's going to take us a while to move out of that range. So I think those things are going to enable us to do it. But as we talked in the Investor Conference, I mean we need to continue if you will, evolving the portfolio much more to grow. Some of that we do by taking things that have been commoditized and putting them in the growth category. And some, it's just over time, the stuff in the growth category grows faster than the stuff not and we start seeing a natural shift as we go. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wittmann with Robert W Baird. Please proceed with your questions. ","Andrew Wittmann ","Yes, there's been a lot of questions on kind of the top-line, I wanted to dig in a little bit more into the margin profile. I mean if you look over the course of the year, the SG&A margin has been falling each quarter sequentially around here from like 29%, 27%, this quarter about 25% and you're guiding 25% SG&A in the fourth quarter. I guess as we look at that 25% in the quarter and then guidance for the fourth quarter, is there anything unusual in that, that makes that unusually low or anything or is that kind of the way to be thinking about it as we head into 2020? ","Doug Baker ","Yes, there is no big news in there that would say makes it look artificially low. I mean certainly, we work on productivity routinely. We still believe there is productivity in front of us as we leverage more effectively new tools, i.e., we need to equip our teams with capabilities to enable them to manage more business successfully. And we are working on those tools all the time, they are always in flight. And so we do not believe by any means that we're at the end of like our productivity journey, but we've got to do it in a way that makes sense i.e can people adopt the new technology, does it work, does it truly enable us to continue to serve customers the right way? And I think we've done a good job doing that as evidenced by both retention, which is good and continued decline in SG&A ratio. ","Andrew Wittmann ","Great, thanks for that. I guess my follow-up question would be, I guess similar on the gross margin side. Obviously, there's a lot of factors that have -- that go into this. In the last couple of quarters, you're starting to see some gross margin leverage from the pricing, which is great to see. I was just wondering what the bigger puts and takes are Doug that you're looking at on the gross margin side? Obviously raw materials has been the story for many, many years now. Are there other factors that come out of your cost efficiency initiatives that you've got in place, which I think were largely SG&A based, but are there other puts and takes besides the raw material complex that could factor into your gross margin performance as you head into 2020? ","Doug Baker ","Yes, no, I think there is a number. I mean, one, we got on a lot of formulation work and what I would call is optimizing where we make what in particularly the Energy business, they were impacted by the SAP roll-out that we had. That was really more on what I would call legacy Ecolab plants primarily. So as a consequence they were liberated, they weren't frozen. And so you see even there in tough volume situation good gross profit and very good leverage that is both SG&A and a lot of the work in the plants et cetera. That opportunity exists across the board and the supply chain SAP work is largely done. We got a few plants left to do, but it's really not material, and now those plants are leveraging the new tool, understanding and having more clarity about what's happening in terms of all the way through freight, but making -- we do a batch process should we be rethinking formulation structure and the rest. And so a lot of this work is still in front of us and I would say greatly enhanced and enabled by the work we just did with SAP. There is also clearly work to be done on SG&A. And so this is why we still believe, delivering double-digit EPS is really the right path and the way to think about it going forward, because we can grow and we can also grow while obtaining leverage, not just through volume but through efficiency work both in plants and in SG&A.

At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I\u2019d like to turn over the call to Mr. Michael Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Michael Monahan","Hello everyone. And welcome to Ecolab\u2019s Third Quarter Conference Call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab\u2019s Chairman and CEO. A copy of our earnings release and the accompanying slides referenced in this teleconference are available on Ecolab\u2019s website at ecolab.com\/investor.","Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on slide 2, stating that this teleconference and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q item under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our third quarter release and on slide 2. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with an overview on slide 3, we delivered strong results in the third quarter. Sales volume growth was strong, improving from the second quarter rate. We leveraged that growth along with pricing and our synergy and cost efficiency work to substantially increase our adjusted operating margins and produce a very strong adjusted earnings per share increase.","Looking ahead, we expect to continue to outperform our markets and show strong 13% to 17% adjusted earnings gains in the fourth quarter and upper-teens EPS growth for the full year as good sales growth, appropriate pricing, innovation, synergies and margin leverage more than offset weak international markets.","Moving to some highlights from the third quarter and as discussed in our press release, reported third quarter earnings per share were $1.19. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, third quarter 2014 earnings per share increased a strong 16% to a record $1.21. The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by volume and pricing, new products, account gains, synergies and cost-savings actions.","Our fixed-currency acquisition adjusted sales growth rate improved from the second quarter, rising 6% and was led by our Energy, Specialty and other businesses. Latin America led the regional growth once again and we enjoyed good growth in North America and Asia-Pacific.","We continue to be aggressive, focusing on top-line growth. We are emphasizing our innovative product and service strength, as well as our wide range of effective solutions to help customers get better results and lower operating costs and through these, drive new account gains across all of our customer segments. We also continue to implement appropriate price increases to help offset higher costs and investments in our business. We expanded our adjusted fixed-currency operating margins a 110 basis points in the quarter, as we continue to emphasize productivity and efficiency improvement as well as drive merger synergies.","We also continue to make investments in key growth businesses to sustain our technology, and sales and service leadership. We remain on plan for achieving our Nalco and Champion synergy targets. And our Europe margins are on track for further strong expansion again this year.","Looking ahead, while end markets present ongoing challenges, we look for the fourth quarter to show continued strong sales gains and margin improvement. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS is expected to increase 13% to 17% to the $1.18 to $1.22 range and compare with last year\u2019s adjusted EPS of $1.04. Business growth and the benefits from synergies and cost reductions should more than offset lackluster global economic trends. In addition, the quarter will compare against a 17% adjusted EPS gain in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. For the full year 2014, we continue to look for a very strong 18% to 19% EPS increase to the $4.16 to $4.20 range.","In summary, our third quarter performed well. And we expect the fourth quarter to also show strong earnings growth as we more than offset challenging economic conditions while making the key investments to drive our superior results this year, as well as for the future.","Slide 4 shows our third quarter results, both as reported and with adjustments for special gains and charges, while slide five shows our sales growth detail. Ecolab\u2019s consolidated fixed-currency sales for the third quarter increased 6%. Acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency sales also rose 6%.","Looking at the growth components. Volume and mix increased 5%; pricing rose 1%; acquisitions and divestitures and currency were not significant. Reported fixed-currency sales for the Global Industrial segment rose 3%; adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures sales increased 2%.","Third quarter fixed-currency global Food & Beverage sales increased 4%, growth was led by dairy and agri with the moderate sales growth in beverage which more than offset lower sales in the weak protein market.","Regionally, Asia-Pacific and Latin America led results with the other region showing modest growth, driven by share gains as we more than offset plant closures and weak volumes. Food & Beverage continues to benefit from its Total Plant Assurance approach to the customers, in which we combine industry-leading Cleaning & Sanitizing, Water Treatment and Pest Elimination capabilities to deliver improved food safety results, lower operating costs and better product quality assurance for customers. This has enabled us to win business with key global customers and offset difficult conditions in our North America and Europe markets, where lower volumes, as well as customer capacity reduction and plant closures, have impacted sales.","Looking ahead, we expect modest organic sales growth in the fourth quarter. We look for further benefits from growth synergies, better customer penetration and new business capture, as well as leverage from our innovation pipeline, including 3D TRASAR for clean-in-place systems in Food & Beverage plants to more than offset tough industry conditions.","Acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency water sales increased 3%. The heavy and light businesses showed good growth and mining recorded slight gains as industrial markets generally weaken during the quarter. Regionally, we saw a good growth in Latin America, moderate growth in North America and modest gains in both EMEA and Asia-Pacific.","Introduction of 3D TRASAR for hotel and other institutional cooling systems, utilizing solid chemistry and advance dispensing is going well. We also continue to drive better penetration in our other water markets using our innovative solutions to optimize water usage. We remain focused on building our corporate account and enterprise sales team, delivering our growth synergies and improving product innovation to drive revenues. We expect to show further moderate growth in the fourth quarter as market share gains drive our heavy and light businesses to outperform end-markets.","Acquisition-adjusted third quarter fixed-currency paper sales declined 3%. Latin America recorded double-digit growth. Elsewhere we saw a sales decline resulting from continued low customer plant utilization and customer closures. We expect Paper to show a modest sales decline in the fourth quarter as we drive new business and technology penetration to offset the difficult paper market conditions.","Fixed-currency sales for the Global Institutional segment rose 4%. Turning to the businesses that make up the segment. Divestiture adjusted fixed-currency sales for the Institutional business grew 4%. Institutional\u2019s end markets remain mixed with moderate growth in global lodging room demand and still soft foodservice foot traffic across North America and Europe.","Looking at regional sales trends, Institutional posted solid sales growth in North America, Asia-Pacific and Latin America, while Europe\u2019s ongoing business declined slightly. Sales initiatives targeting new customers and effective product and service programs around our core markets continue to drive our results. We also continue to leverage our global technology through the rollout of Apex, our next-generation warewashing platform in Europe.","To drive our future growth and improve on our industry leadership position, we remain focused on executing global sales initiatives, globalizing core competencies and introducing product innovation that delivers increased value with solutions that reduce water, energy and labor costs. We\u2019re also making further investments in field technology to enhance execution in sales and service. And we have better aligned our local sales team efforts around our global value proposition.","We look for Institutional to show further good sales growth in the fourth quarter as we make further progress in our global sales initiative and continue our aggressive sales efforts to outperform challenging global market.","Third quarter sales for Specialty grew 9% in fixed currency. Quick service enjoyed strong sales growth. New accounts, along with increased service coverage and additional solutions for customers to drive their operating efficiency and food safety, leveraged generally modest industry trend. Regionally, the U.S. and Europe saw a good growth from new accounts and additional customer solutions, while Asia-Pacific benefited from good quick service foot traffic growth.","The Food Retail business saw solid gains in the third quarter, benefiting from customer additions, new products and increased penetration. Fourth quarter Specialty sales could see steady progress in comparison to last year\u2019s strong period may moderate the recorded growth.","Fixed-currency Global Healthcare sales decreased 1%. New account growth and new product introductions were more than offset by continued weak hospital trends and delayed buying decisions in the U.S. healthcare markets. Growth sales in this challenging environment, we\u2019re strengthening our corporate accounts approach and our integrated value proposition, as well as improving our product portfolio. We expect modest Global Healthcare sales growth in the fourth quarter as we continue our work to strengthen our business and succeed in North America and Europe healthcare market.","Fixed-currency Energy segment sales grew 14%. Our upstream business saw a robust foot growth in the third quarter led by a strong international performance and good North America results. Downstream business saw a good increase led by strong international performance and share gains in North America.","As a side note, Russia represents less than 5% of our Energy sales. Since the bulk of our business in Russia is in conventional wells, [print] sanctions have little impact on that business. In addition, while oil prices have declined in recent weeks, we believe they are still at levels that support continued industry investment in exploration and production. Further, with our business model heavily weighted to more recurring revenue, production refining business were minimally impacted by short-term changes in oil prices.","Looking ahead, we expect acquisition-adjusted Energy segment sales to show a fourth quarter and full year 2014 sales increase in the 10% range as new business resulting from ongoing share gains and new production coming online drives growth.","Sales for our Other segment increased 7%. Fixed-currency Global Pest sales increased 6% in the third quarter. We enjoyed good growth in Food & Beverage and milder growth in restaurants. Regionally, we delivered double-digit growth in Latin America and Asia-Pacific and solid growth in EMEA and North America.","We continue to drive market penetration with innovative service offerings and technology to make progress in globalizing our market-focused capabilities and field technologies. We expect Global Pest sales to show continued good growth in the fourth quarter led by gains in all markets.","Equipment Care sales grew 10% in the third quarter. New account sales, better penetration, pricing actions and improved technician capacity and productivity drove strong service revenue growth. We expect Equipment Care to show further strong gains in the fourth quarter as continued good service trends, pricing initiatives and streamlined operations benefit results.","Slide 6 of our presentation shows selected income statement items. Third quarter gross margins were 46.7%. When adjusted for special charges, third quarter 2014 gross margins rose 10 basis points above last year. Volume and pricing gains, as well as merger synergies and cost efficiencies more than offset higher cost input and the business mix impact of higher energy sales, which on average have a lower gross margin when compared with our other businesses.","SG&A expenses represented 31% of third quarter sales. The SG&A ratio improved 100 basis points versus last year. The improvement reflected sales gains, merger synergies and cost savings efforts as well as the mix of higher energy sales, which on average have a lower SG&A ratio when compared with our other businesses.","Consolidated operating income margins were 15.5%. Adjusted for special charges, fixed-currency operating income margins were 15.7%, rising 110 basis points over last year\u2019s comparable margin. Fixed-currency operating income for Global Industrial increased 2%. Acquisition adjusted operating income grew 1%, with margins off 10 basis points. Good improvements in Water and Food & Beverage income were partially offset by volume driven decline in Paper.","Fixed currency operating income for Global Institutional increased 5%; results benefited from pricing, volume gains and cost efficiencies, which more than offset higher delivered product costs and investments in the business. Fixed-currency Global Energy operating income increased 39% and margins expanded 290 basis points. Volume gains, operating leverage, synergies and pricing led the increase.","Fixed-currency operating income for the other segment increased 15% and margins expanded 120 basis points. Improved operating results offset investments in the business and higher costs. The Corporate segment and tax rate are discussed in the press. As before, please note that our tax rate assumptions for the full year assume passage of the R&D tax credit in the fourth quarter. The net of this performance is that Ecolab reported third quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.19 compared with $1 reported a year ago. When adjusted for special gains and charges and discrete tax items in both years, adjusted earnings increased 16% to $1.21 when compared with $1.04 earned a year ago.","Turning to slide 7 and looking at Ecolab\u2019s balance sheet. Net debt to total capital was 46%, with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 2.5 times. Looking ahead and as outlined on slide eight, we continue to take aggressive actions to drive both our top and bottom line. We\u2019re expanding our market share and customer penetration among major accounts and leveraging our positions in key growth markets as we work to offset weak economies and unfavorable currency exchange rates, which will likely negatively impact fourth quarter reported sales by a couple of percentage points.","We expect to show good acquisition-adjusted sales growth and margin expansion, driven by innovation, pricing, merger synergies and better operating efficiencies. We expect to deliver on these aggressive goals while building growth for the future. We expect adjusted fourth quarter 2014 diluted earnings per share to increase 13% to 17% to the $1.18 to $1.22 range. Further, the fourth quarter will also compare against the strong period last year when adjusted earnings per share rose 17% to $1.04. We continue to look for the full year 2014 to show very strong growth as adjusted earnings per share are expected to increase 18% to 19% to the $4.16 to $4.20 range.","In summary, once again we delivered on our forecast in the third quarter with a solid sales gain and continued margin improvement, while offsetting market challenges and investing in our future. We look for further solid acquisition-adjusted sales growth and continued double-digit profit gains in the fourth quarter, as well as for the full year 2014, as we work to deliver yet another strong year and build for our future.","And now here\u2019s Doug Baker with some comments.","Doug Baker","Hi, good afternoon. Well first on the quarter, we had a very good quarter. We saw the improvement in the underlying business that we expected and predicted. Sales accelerated to 6%, new business was again very strong, up significantly versus last year\u2019s record year. Our innovation is on track; we\u2019re getting all synergy in Europe renaissance calls. And energy is back to double-digits growing 14% in the quarter and on track to deliver double-digit growth for the year. This all occurred in extremely turbulent environment globally. This is an environment we don\u2019t expect to change, but this is a challenge our team and business I believe is well equipped to manage. ","So, looking forward, we expect to finish the year in a strong way. We forecast EPS growth for the full year of 18% to 19%. We expect in Q4 similar sales growth driven by continued strong new business results and double-digit energy growth, which leads me to the topic of the day if not the week and that\u2019s oil price and its potential impact on our business.","Let me talk two scenarios because it\u2019s easier than trying to go through every potential scenario. I am going to talk about $80 and above oil, WTI and then also the $74 scenario which seems to be the popular scenario given Goldman Sachs\u2019 recent call.","For $80 and above, I would just say it\u2019s same as it ever was, meaning oil production is on; healthy industry, we like it close to $80 because also while you have full production in the oil and gas business, you also have economic benefits and favorable raw materials.","If price falls below $80 depending on how far and for how long, it would likely be a drop in activity. There isn\u2019t any clear consensus on a simple number, but if it\u2019s $70 over an extended period, we\u2019d certainly see a pull back. At $75 we would expect a modest pull back. The impact on us, so we\u2019d say double-digit energy growth would likely turn into high single-digit growth as less than 25% of our energy business is exposed to the parts of the industry most impacted by pricing at that level.","So, this is of a small if any impact on the overall company operating income as we would take a number of steps to offset this top-line impact. Energy itself would shift from full on growth to growth and cost savings initiatives they would balance their portfolio if you will of activity. Lower raw materials would probably occur across the company as we see lower oil prices. And three we would also likely see improved institutional market particularly in U.S., if consumers would have more discretionary dollars to spend as a price of the pump continues to lower.","Now when you look at our business, we\u2019ve got a business well positioned to manage through either scenario and or other scenario. I\u2019d say most importantly we have a team that\u2019s quite good at reacting to a ever changing environment. I think we have proven that over the years. So, my expectations that we\u2019ll continue to grow and perform in any of the reasonable scenarios I have seen so far this year and beyond.","So good quarter, we\u2019re in good position. We like what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re going to continue to do it going forward.","Michael Monahan","Thanks, Doug. That concludes our formal remarks. Operator, would you please begin the question-and-answer period.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I guess the question is if we look at the Global Industrial and Global Institutional businesses, profit growth remains fairly low and energy I think at some point in the next two or three years is likely to slow quite a bit as the synergies are more fully achieved. The question is what\u2019s it going to take to drive faster revenue and particularly profit growth from the legacy Global Industrial and Institutional segments? Is it just better global economic growth or what else that you can control can drive better growth in those? Thanks.","Doug Baker","Yes. Gary, I would say two things. Institutional underlying a number of things are going well. I would also say in Europe in particular we\u2019ve taking a number of steps to get that business, what I would say right and get focused on the core Institutional business. While, we\u2019re going through the steps, it\u2019s I would say having an impact on reported operating income to remains leverage in the Institutional business particularly in our AP, LA and European businesses as we go through and continue to drive volume. So by no means, do we feel like we\u2019re pinned on Institutional profitability going forward. I would say while you\u2019ve got a couple of engines really firing, you often start working on the other engines to make sure that they\u2019re going to be in good position as you move forward.","On the Industrial side, it is more a function of sales volume. And the sales volume in Industrial, which I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll end up having a conversation about, we\u2019ve got a pretty mix result when you look at our Industrial businesses. We have our core Water business, which is up 5% globally, our F&B business which is up 4%, Mining is roughly flat and then you had Paper down 3%.","These businesses are ones that are probably most not knocked around economically. For the year, we\u2019ve seen losses in the neighborhood of $50 million from plant closures in these businesses. And those closures have disproportionately impacted Mining and Paper.","With that said, I think we\u2019re in very good position. We\u2019re nearing if not any bottom of a cycle. And as we start moving out of that cycle and we start having volume leverage, you\u2019re going to start seeing I think good OI returns as we move forward.","So, the good news is we think we\u2019re near the bottom. We think for sure closures are slowing. So at least we aren\u2019t if you will running against our current. And going forward, we would expect pretty similar results in Q4 as you saw on Q3 in Industrial, but significantly improved results as we go through 2015.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets","Great. And then the quick follow-up just what exact impact has the European weaker economic environment had like this quarter on results versus two or three quarters ago because I did note in the press release that it did say that there was a slight decline and I believe that was the Institutional segment in Europe. And I think you\u2019ve been talking about flattish. So, did it get a lot worse or is that more just that hasn\u2019t gotten better? Thank you.","Doug Baker","Yes. It\u2019s significantly degrade. I think in total our European businesses were up 1% for the quarter. I mean it\u2019s not a number we\u2019ll celebrate, but there wasn\u2019t any big degradation as a result of the European economic situation. We would anticipate that European situation is going to remain challenging. We believe we\u2019ll continue to keep our nose above water and we believe we\u2019ll continue to show OI improvement as a result of all the efforts that we\u2019ve undertaken under the Renaissance program.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Ritzenthaler with Piper Jaffray.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray","Yes, good morning. Question on Food & Beverage, which continues to post a very resilient growth. I was just wondering on the challenges that your customers are seeing from closures and things like that, is that -- is the growth for Ecolab mainly new product launches, is it account wins or something else?","","Doug Baker","Yes, it certainly total plant assurance program which enables us to do more for existing customers but has also secured new business. I would say across the board we\u2019ve had great success securing new business. I mean it\u2019s the only way you\u2019re going to accelerate the economic situation we find ourselves in, and that\u2019s true for F&B as well as the other businesses. And I think F&B is well poised to continue to perform well. So our expectation is that we continue to grow in spite of the economic condition. We expect that we\u2019ll still see some closures as the customer set tries to make sure that they economize wherever they can because it\u2019s the tough environment for them. But this makes sense that our total plant assurance programs, our efforts to lower energy and water costs are particularly important in difficult times which is why I believe we\u2019re having such a good success securing new businesses.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray","Okay. And then a follow-up on institutional is a bit harder to quantify, but are your customers noting anything whether it\u2019s the order book or just anecdotally on the slowdown in foot traffic or occupancy that on these Ebola fears?","Doug Baker","No, I don\u2019t, I mean outside of the obvious hotspots in West Africa, I mean no, we have not that anything I have heard of seen any impact. I mean Ebola conversation in United States is probably overblown to what we anticipate the real impact will be as we move forward, but we have not seen anything.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray","Fair enough. Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Good morning. Just wanted to -- or I guess it\u2019s afternoon, sorry. I found it interesting that in several of your businesses you talked about Latin America and Asia-Pacific as being the growth drivers. We\u2019ve seen Latin America struggle as a region for a lot of companies in various businesses in this sector and obviously the slowdown in China and in Asia-Pacific countries in general has got people concerned. So you seem to be sort of sailing against that tide. Can you talk about what\u2019s allowing you to actually have these territories be the driver of better performance rather than sort of an explanation for why the performance wasn\u2019t quite so good?","Doug Baker","Well, I guess in Latin America, we continue to drive shares successfully in that market. And I don\u2019t think there is any magic formula that we have. Some of our businesses are probably exposed to the challenges, but I would anticipate we\u2019ll continue to perform well in Latin America. We\u2019re not completely immune from economic impacts, but we still believe we\u2019re going to have healthy growth in Latin America moving forward.","Asia, I think clearly on the industrial side, you\u2019ve seen and we\u2019ve seen and felt impact from slowdown particularly in China. And so in our mining and paper business in particular, you can -- we clearly felt the slowdown in China. China tends to drop quickly and rebound quickly. And third quarter was not a great quarter for us in China. I would still say we remain quite bullish in China overall and expect that that market is going to be a very important market for us long-term. So we don\u2019t plan to play any differently there. We\u2019re doing quite well in institutional, quite well in F&B; and the industrial business we expect to rebound as we start having new business offset shutdowns and the like.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Okay, Doug. That\u2019s helpful. Switching gears to the two businesses that continue to give you guys problems as far as getting consistent growth and that\u2019s healthcare and paper. Paper sort of came to you via the Nalco acquisition and you\u2019ve talked many times about it but not necessarily being a business that you\u2019re interested in being longer term. But healthcare was sort of an internal initiative, got a lot of promise and sort of expectations that haven\u2019t been materializing over the last couple of years. Anything changing either with the hospitals getting religion about disinfection with Ebola or anything else that you can point to on maybe perhaps some of your own initiatives that will give us comfort that healthcare at some point is going to be at least a mid-single-digit grower for you?","Doug Baker","Yes. Our ambitions for healthcare are higher than that. I would -- I think if you go back to conversations we\u2019ve had throughout the year, we basically said we\u2019re putting healthcare in the shop for the year and that we had work to do on the healthcare business particularly around how do we better package our offering and talk about and merchandise our offerings. And that work has been ongoing and I think moving along at a very good pace. We really said not to expect any great change in healthcare metrics throughout this year, but we would expect a change starting in 2015 and that\u2019s still our view. So that hasn\u2019t really changed from the conversation we had in the first quarter.","So healthcare, we still believe is a great growth opportunity for the company. We think what the healthcare market needs we\u2019re in a unique position to deliver. I do believe that you see slowly and open this in the healthcare arena to different tactics to get after our healthcare acquired-infections. Certainly I think Ebola shows how serious you have to be in a very serious predicament. And so, as we move forward we expect to gain traction there and have upper single-digit type organic growth in that business.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","","Thank you, Doug. Just on energy how did the Nalco and Champion businesses do back in \u201808 when oil dropped quite a bit as well?","Doug Baker","Yes. Well, in \u201809 which is really the year, it was like 140 mid \u201808 and then it drop down to 40 and changed in \u201809. Volume was off in the Nalco energy business by 3% in \u201809 versus \u201808. In total, I\u2019m looking at going back. In total the combined sales would have been down 6%. But you had a pretty dramatic drop in price one that I don\u2019t think anybody is predicting.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","And any concerns that this current oil price that you can grow double-digits in energy in 2015 on top-line?","Doug Baker","As I said, my preamble I think certainly it depends on the price, David, is what I would say. I don\u2019t think there is any reasonable scenario that says we\u2019re not going to go grow. We believe the price is going to be north of 80 bucks. I would say is consensus is north of $90 at this point in time. If it stays in this range, we believe we\u2019re going to grow double-digits. A drops in the mid-to-low 70s, growth is going to be impacted somewhat, but I think you\u2019re still talking upper single-digits.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair","Good afternoon, everyone. Hey Doug, I wanted to go back to kind of a little bit of an earlier discussion regarding just like the portfolio and some of the puts, natural puts and takes. But as you said, you\u2019ve got a great team in place to kind of react quickly as some of these different events change and economies do this or that. Could you give us some examples of how things change like all of a sudden, and granted I know that you have the Renaissance program, they already gave you better OI profitability in general. But what are some of the actions that you take when markets do kind of move on you pretty quickly in terms of moving maybe from offense to defense and how the business is naturally set up that way?","Doug Baker","Yes. I would say two things; traditionally and what I would call tough economic times. We have a very strong emphasis on new customer acquisition. Customers are more open to change when times are difficult because they\u2019re seeking answers to their own internal challenges. I think that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019ve been so successful with our net new sales success both last year and this year because of the difficult time and our emphasis on new business.","Second, we also have I would say a larger portfolio of cost savings initiatives and efficiency initiatives and if you will kind of our workflow during difficult times. We will ramp these up as times become more complicated, simply because you\u2019re not necessarily chasing new volume and having to build new volume or capacity. So, we have a pretty strong portfolio right now, but there are number of initiatives that frankly aren\u2019t on green light right now that if they got worse, we would green light and start upping our capacity in terms of what kind of cost savings we could generate if we need to.","So, it\u2019s shipping the portfolio of work based on the economic environment. I think we\u2019ve got room on either side, if the economy turns to the positive which is not my prediction. I think we\u2019ve got a number of very good initiatives that we would turn on. And if it gets a little worse on the other side, we\u2019ve got plenty of initiatives there as well. And this is exactly how we\u2019ve run the business over a long period of time.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair","And that makes perfect sense but thanks for that added color. And then just one more question on the energy business and given a lot of the great different examples here to support where you are at. But could you give us a little bit of like terms of current discussions with some of your customers or potential customers regarding any new projects that might be coming on and whether there\u2019s any apprehension there in terms of I know there\u2019s a long sales cycle and these projects have long upfront lead times to it, which helps create that recurring revenue on the production side, but could you just talk about maybe some current examples of where those discussions are?","Doug Baker","I would say there has been zero discussions with people who are talking about major changes in their capital deployments or anything else. I would say it\u2019s consistent with what we read in transcripts of other people in this industry. So, at this point in time, I would say there is no hard indications of any slowdown whatsoever. I think what you have out there speculation that if in fact Goldman\u2019s prediction of 74 is more accurate than their 08 prediction of 200 comes true that what might occur then. I would also say this is going to occur; these things don\u2019t stop on a dime. There\u2019s momentum in this business, capital is being deployed that even if there was a shift in thinking, it\u2019s likely not going to impact for several quarters.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair","Great. Thanks for that.","Operator","Next question comes from John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity","Hi, good afternoon folks. First, back to energy if I could. Doug, thank you for the sensitivity analysis and detail you gave us. In terms of moving forward, I think in the quarter you talked about some customer capture on the downstream side. How quick or what is the desire to potentially protect against slower E&P activity by moving to the downstream? That\u2019s my first question.","Doug Baker","Yes. John really the way we\u2019re structured is we have focused business team, focused on downstream and oilfield than on WellChem, the upfront. And these teams are kind of on the gas the whole time. So it\u2019s not as simple as flooding downstream, it\u2019s folks out of OFC that up activity; while it\u2019s in the industry, it\u2019s a different business and it\u2019s got different needs and different technologies.","So I would really say the way we look at this is our OFC folks are going to be on share, no matter what the environment is; they may start adding a component of cost savings if the market turned against them, ultimately oil is a cyclical business. Our business that\u2019s positioned here is not a cyclical business. And we\u2019ve gone through chart after chart showing this. We really believe our exposure of the production phase and downstream is going to mute any impacts that are going to occur either in the near-term or long-term in this industry. So I don\u2019t -- this is probably the best answer I can give you.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity","Okay, thanks. And then as a follow-up, switching gears to the 3D TRASAR introduction, I think you talked about it more in that sort of 15ish timeframe. Can you give us any anecdotes in terms of customers that have got 3D TRASAR in the industrial or institutional markets? Have they just deployed the first onsie twosie units? Have they started to deploy throughout their fleets? If you could just give us some flavor or your objectives for that in the next year or so? Thank you.","Doug Baker","Yes, this year is really making sure that we underpin how to fully leverage the technology for our customers benefit. So I mean it\u2019s nominal sales this year and it\u2019s on track and doing what we had expected it to. But that will grow over the next few years. Typically for us to realize full annual sales potential and a technology like this, it takes like five years. It takes a while for adoption. These are very sticky technologies. We build them for the long-term. We like what we\u2019re seeing but this is going to be a ramp up over the next several years. ","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity","","Great. Thanks.","Operator","","Next question comes from John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So first question, with regard to the pricing that you saw, the 1% that you reported on a consolidated basis, can you give us a little bit of color as to how the pricing is working from segment to segment if there are any meaningful differences from one to the next?","Doug Baker","They\u2019re pretty similar. I mean our strongest pricing activity across the board would be throughout institutional, energy be next and industrial would be third. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a real surprise given where the significant economic pressure is on the industrial side but all are rounding to the same numbers.","John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","","Okay, great. And then with regard to the oil price drop, it sounds like you\u2019re not overly worried about it, which I think makes sense in this environment. That said there are a lot of stocks that have gotten clobbered because of it. And I guess I am wondering with your balance sheet having been cleaned up a bit since the Champion acquisition, are you seeing opportunities for M&A that might be interesting to Ecolab just given kind of some of the price moves that we have seen in some of the stocks?","Doug Baker","Well, I can\u2019t comment on M&A in particular, I guess I will say that we\u2019d rather buy things that are cheap than expensive. So that goes to real words of wisdom.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","All right. Thanks very much for the color.","Operator","Next question comes from David Ridley-Lane with Merrill Lynch.","David Ridley-Lane - Merrill Lynch","Good afternoon. A few months ago a competitor of yours sold their water business to a private equity firm. Do you think this is an opportunity for potential market share gains and more broadly than not how would you judge Ecolab\u2019s water segment versus its competitors, i.e. are you gaining market share?","Doug Baker","Yes. We believe we are gaining market share in the water space against our key competitors. I don\u2019t have the pleasure of saying I built this water business by any means. So, let me say this objectively, I think it\u2019s the crown jewel of the water businesses. The Nalco business has been the leader in the water business not only from a share standpoint, but the technology standpoint. And we planned to help strengthen that not diminish that. So, we\u2019d like that business.","In terms of -- I would say the earlier part of your question, anytime there is change usually brings opportunity because certainly when companies are bought or sold there is distraction and when we buy companies we work to minimize it and move forward as quickly as possible because we don\u2019t really want to be taking advantage of during those periods of transition. Certainly, we\u2019ve gone through this in a lot of industries and we work to go capitalize on transition like anybody would.","David Ridley-Lane - Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then just staying with water for one second, I hear you that it takes time to build up for the new products in terms of 3D TRASAR for hotels and hospitals and for food and beverage plants. But as you look at your other end markets, the heavy and light industries, are those feeling like they are getting a little bit of strength or are they continuing to sort of trudge along here in terms of the end markets?","Doug Baker","Yes. I guess two things. As I said earlier, combine the heavy and light business, we strip out the piece of it that we\u2019re exiting on the P&L grew at 5% this last quarter. We call that good below our target growth rate. I think it certainly reflects challenging economic times, but we\u2019re doing a pretty good job in that business offsetting it. As they\u2019re having a lot of success securing new business.","We recently introduced new technologies in that business through some acquisitions that that teams made. We\u2019ve got other technology being injected as a consequence of being part of the overall Ecolab team.","I think that team is a very good team. I think they are managing very well in a tough environment. Our expectation is that they grow in the 6 to 8 organic range as well, particularly in the core water business, which isn\u2019t knocked around in the same degree as say mining and paper are economically. I think we were on track to get there.","David Ridley-Lane - Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS","Good afternoon. I\u2019m interested in how the water business for commercial buildings with the solids in TRASAR will scale. Is it the janitor in the building that will be actually doing the dispensing of the solids? And are these going to be monitored by the Nalco center back in India like the other Nalco TRASAR systems are?","Doug Baker","Yes. One, I think there is every one of these large commercial buildings is going to have an engineering staff. So, we would have the capability of monitoring and if we choose to do that and that ends up to be a route that makes sense and is important. But this system I would say has huge advantages versus the systems that they\u2019re using today, which is I think the comparison that you\u2019ve got to keep in mind, the solids bring a lot of advantage in both safety and convenience in terms of adding product and moving product around buildings, the capabilities that 3D brings to this in terms of using water and cooling towers, more cycles and reducing fresh water and flow and the resultant savings that this brings to these building, both at sustainability story but is outright lower end-use costs are quite material. I would say the reception that we\u2019ve had here, both from our customers and I\u2019d say just as importantly from the sales team has been outstanding.","And so we are ahead of our projection; this will ramp up likely faster than 3D TRASAR and Food & Beverage simply because you don\u2019t have the same food safety legislation covering these areas that you do or using 3D in the CIP arena. So, we\u2019re quite bullish on what this is going to do in terms of equipping our light team to get after important business that has higher margins in any of the other water business areas that we compete in. And it\u2019s historically been quite sticky if you have the right program.","John Roberts - UBS","And if the TRASAR system signals an alert, is it a Nalco person that\u2019s going to go check that out, or is it one of the Ecolab institutional salespeople?","Doug Baker","No, it\u2019s going to be a Nalco person, somebody with water technology background.","John Roberts - UBS","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies","","Just a quick question on the institutional business. Are there any areas where you are seeing a noticeable change in your ability to take share? I mean you have talked about accelerating different parts of the business over the last three quarters. Are there any areas where that trend is looking like it\u2019s getting more difficult?","Doug Baker","Well, I think our ongoing lament is that taking share is never as easy as you wish it was. I don\u2019t -- I get that reflect in your question, I don\u2019t have any areas that I would define as materially different in terms of competitive environment, i.e. a big change in terms of either much easier or much harder to take share. I think throughout the segment, I mean we continue to do well in QSR, we continue to do well in Food Retail; we continue to do well in full service restaurants and hotels. Regionally, the business is getting healthier, across the region it remains healthy in North America; it\u2019s improving in Europe clearly as we look at the underlying trends; it\u2019s doing well in Asia-Pacific and Latin America. So I don\u2019t know global chains are doing well. So, I don\u2019t have a point I would single out for you.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Baird.","Andy Wittmann - Baird","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to take a step back and kind of reflect on the cost synergies that you\u2019ve outlined through the years with Nalco and then Champion. It sounds like things are generally on track. Maybe from here Doug, can you give us a sense about I think 2014 was going to deliver $110 million of synergies and a similar amount in \u201815 and then falling off of a bit in \u201816. But can you just give us a better sense of kind of where you are, has any of that been pulled forward, pushed back and where you see the biggest chunks of that being allocated to or coming from as we look ahead into \u201815?","Doug Baker","Well, the early chunk and as this goes, the early chunks were from one, purchasing; two, a lot of the G&A and regional overhead overlaps that we had. And we always said that the later in stage is going to be in the supply chain. That takes longer and it\u2019s more difficult to get after. Next year, we would expect again another about I think 105 is the number that we have used externally, it\u2019s not materially different than your number. And a lot of that is still going to be if you will carry on effects from the work that we\u2019ve done this year in procurement in G&A. But increasingly as you go out in the later stages, it\u2019s going to be in the supply chain, i.e. reducing plant footprint, warehouse footprints and the like.","Andy Wittmann - Baird","Got you. So as you look at these numbers, that level of cost savings is about 70 or 80 basis points of improvement so far, you\u2019re about 90 basis points year-to-date of margin expansion. Is the 10 to 15 basis points of underling operating leverage, do you feel like this is the right amount for this economic environment or do you have a vision that it should be more that you could have delivered more or less from that. I\u2019m just curious as to how you feel like the underlying leverage of the business is performing against that?","Doug Baker","Yes. Andy I would say, we\u2019re doing a little over a 100 this year on $14 billion. We\u2019re going to be up a 110 basis points sort of north of that for the year and I think that\u2019s what we had for the quarter. So, I would say I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019d say that indicate more like 40 plus outside of synergies. I think you\u2019ve got to also recognize that when you have this level of synergies, you are taking a number of resources that would be against cost savings initiatives that may not be labeled synergies, but that would still be generating saving.","So, the synergies aren\u2019t completely additive because we don\u2019t have resources that are completely distinct to work on synergies, these are up and a lot of the same people who end up working on cost savings.","So, getting back to our model, the back of the napkin model, I think when we talk about 68 organic, we talk about called 75 basis points of operating income leverage. We think that\u2019s quite realistic and consistent with what we\u2019re doing right now. When you take an account, some of the people that are working on synergies would be working on other cost savings.","Andy Wittmann - Baird","Got it. Maybe if I could just do one final question. You have alluded to a few times the potential that raw materials could be a benefit if oil prices come in. Are you seeing any or having any discussions on that already today? It seems like it would be early for this, but what could that magnitude look like and what have you seen so far year-to-date on the raw?","Doug Baker","Well, early returns I mean fairly the only thing we\u2019re probably seeing that everybody else is seeing is lower gas prices. It\u2019s not one of our most significant if you will input costs. Yes, I would say it would be fairly pretty mature. I think if our customers try to start talking about the impact on $35 oil, we might point out that oil on average around the world is trading in the 80s because that target gives away what we haven\u2019t realized. And I think we would have the same conversation with raw material suppliers at this point in time. The raw material markets have been I don\u2019t know fairly steady moving up. And we would say we would expect that we\u2019re going to continue to see modest inflation going forward.","Andy Wittmann - Baird","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question comes from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Mike Harrison - First Analysis","Hi. Good afternoon. I was a little bit surprised to hear you say that you had seen better foot traffic rather in Asia-Pacific given some of the issues that some of the fast food restaurants and chains have seen with food safety there. Are you guys seeing the issues in China there as a challenge or an opportunity?","Doug Baker","Yes. I guess you\u2019d have to -- China is a big, big market with a lot of restaurants. And while, you\u2019re right there were some big food safety scares that had a real negative impact on a couple of large players. They\u2019re large in the world, but they\u2019re not really large as it pertains to all of China. And our business in China is up double-digit in the food service arena, traffic is fairly strong, I think our traffic remark across Asia-Pacific which obviously encompasses a number of other markets. And that\u2019s the data that we have.","Mike Harrison - First Analysis","And then looking at the energy business, can you talk about what the Champion business saw in terms of volumes from \u201808 into \u201809? I think of that as maybe a little bit more sensitive on the onshore side than the Nalco business, which is more offshore.","Doug Baker","The number I have right here is the combined sales were down 6% of Champion and Nalco \u201809 versus 2008. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a dramatically a different result.","Mike Harrison - First Analysis","And then just real quickly, on the Nalco intangibles that $45 million in the quarter, do those start to decline anytime soon, or how long are those amortized?","Doug Baker","Yes, not for quite a while, never soon enough.","Mike Harrison - First Analysis","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","Next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Good afternoon and thank you. Looking at Europe, Doug you talked about a 2% impact on revenues from FX. Since that particular business has lower margin than the U.S. or North America, is it fair to estimate that on the EBIT line, it will have a substantially smaller impact than the 2% on sales?","Doug Baker","Rosemarie, I apologize. Yes, it\u2019s going to be a 2% overall obviously. Non-U.S., are you saying where is the impact going to be most significant?","","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Yes, I was just wondering looking at Europe specifically. I thought that 2% negative impact on revenues was going to be on the European business, so since it is overall, could you touch on the Europe only?","Doug Baker","It\u2019s on our whole basket of currencies as they roll off. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve got that the FX impact, so large as Canada and it\u2019s a tie between Russia and Europe.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay.","Doug Baker","Sales impact, absolute dollar, which means Canada would be as a percentage much higher.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","All right. And then sticking with Europe, when you are discussing business and expectations with your customers, is anyone thinking that they are going back into a recession or is it just more no growth?","Doug Baker","I think I don\u2019t know that -- I don\u2019t know if this has got any bearing on what\u2019s actually going to happen. I think broadly I think people are fairly bearish on the European economic situation. But I can\u2019t really remember last time they were really bullish. So, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s going to -- I guess our outlook on it is we expect to remain challenging given the share upside and the other. We\u2019re not forecasting miraculous sales turnaround but we do expect to be able to continue to keep our nose above water i.e. modest growth going forward is what we think we\u2019re going to be able to do. So we do not see a huge material if you will spiral down in the European economic situation. I\u2019d just say it\u2019s weaker, softer but not dramatically.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","That is helpful. And if I may ask one last question, on the protein market, given the lower cost of feed, do you anticipate that particular side of your business will pick up in 2015, or does it take until 2016 before the herds can be built back up?","Doug Baker","Yes, I would say it\u2019s typically that\u2019s kind of a long cycle, because we\u2019ve got to build herds up. It will take a while. It\u2019s not a huge piece of our business, but my expectation probably strengthens back half of \u201815 or \u201816.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","Hi, thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions, one just from a modeling perspective. Can you remind us of how we should think about the FX currency exposure? And then the second one is just around to dig a little bit more into the healthcare business. What is really sort of the roadblock if any in that business for you to sort of take it to the next level, like do you need an M&A or a deal to get that going, just curious on your thoughts there?","Doug Baker","Well the model question FX impact in the next quarter, we expect to be $0.03, but it\u2019s built into our outlook. So, that\u2019s what in our outlook right now. Next healthcare, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re missing any big pieces. I think this is a question of how we put the pieces together in terms of what our offer is and how we better articulate our offer. How we think about going to market, most of the things that we\u2019ve been working on and modeling and testing this year. And that\u2019s the work that we\u2019re undergoing.","I guess what we said is we expect a change in performance beginning in 2015. And I think once we get out there proof is going to be in delivery. If we start seeing improved results, you know we\u2019re on the right track. If we don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to have to continue to work. But I believe that business will be a very good business for us for the long-term.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","Excellent. Thanks for your patience guys. Two quick ones. One is there any scope for fuel savings and can it become meaningful if oil stays down here? And then secondly, can you talk about the specific markets in Latin America that have been so healthy. It seems like somewhat of an anomaly to what a lot of industrial companies face, so maybe it is more consumer-oriented that is helping you there?","Doug Baker","Yes. I would say Bob the fuel costs benefit or kind of loss in the wash of all the other input costs. We\u2019ve got pluses and minuses. They\u2019re certainly incorporated in our outlook for the balance of the year.","In terms of Latin America, we\u2019ve got the -- it\u2019s hard to pay, this is a single industry. And I have friends who are running other companies and there have been obviously in the capital business a very different time and some of the markets down there that\u2019s not exactly the business we\u2019re in. We continue to do well on most businesses down there.","Our Food & Beverage and our Institutional businesses, our position decently we have a lot of upside in share. We have done a good job I think in F&B in particular aligning our sales with some very important customers and we\u2019re growing as a result in terms of water. I think there has been additional talent put in the water team over the last year and a half which has proven to be a wise move and that team is performing well and continues to gain steam. And the Energy business is doing well down there. I would say the outlook in that market particularly with changes in Mexico over the long haul remained quite positive.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. Thanks for the help.","Operator","Next question comes from P. J. Juvekar with Citi.","Eric Petrie - Citi","Hi, Doug. This is Eric Petrie on for P.J. Based on your experience with past health epidemics like bird flu and sars, how do you think Ebola may impact your businesses?","Doug Baker","What we saw on past sars and bird flu was you certainly -- you see an uptick most notably in healthcare. That impacts a bunch of division. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be an impact that\u2019s going to shine through the total number. But it will be an uplift for maybe some of our business segments.","It typically comes in more broadly distributed disease. It\u2019s fairly limited I think it\u2019s fairly easy for them to diagnose potential folks who\u2019ve been impacted. And if we\u2019re smart, we\u2019ll continue to do the right types of quarantine when people are actually infected and that kind of work. So I don\u2019t know that this is going to have a huge boon to our top-line.","Eric Petrie - Citi","Okay. And then my second question is you noted of your energy portfolio less than 25% is impacted from lower prices below $80 per barrel. Is there a difference in profitability of your stimulation and enhanced oil recovery versus production?","Doug Baker","No, I don\u2019t think, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d go make that case, so this kind of across the portfolio and it\u2019s less than 25 and which is to say even if that impacted fairly significantly even on the overall energy business but still going to allow pretty healthy growth. And I think energy would probably take a lot of steps to even mute the impact you would see on their specific P&L. And as I talked about there would be other if you will benefits from lower oil that would impact our other business\u2019s P&L through lower raws and potentially more consumer spend in the more consumer facing businesses like institutional.","Eric Petrie - Citi","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Richard O\u2019Reilly with Revere Associates.","Richard O\u2019Reilly - Revere Associates","Thank you, thank you guys. Two quick questions, the first, did you by any of your common shares back this quarter?","Doug Baker","No.","Richard O\u2019Reilly - Revere Associates","The first time you haven\u2019t done that in some time, am I right?","Doug Baker","Yes, I think that\u2019s right.","Richard O\u2019Reilly - Revere Associates","Okay. Second question on reverse of the raw material cost deflation. In your slide you said the institutional segment had higher delivery costs and no comment on any of the other segments on that, what went up in the institutional cost wise?","Doug Baker","Yes, that have been more common about freight rate which in spite of I\u2019d say lower diesel have been under pressure across a lot of industries, in some markets like U.S. shorter drivers et cetera so there is just pressure broadly on freight rates.","Richard O\u2019Reilly - Revere Associates","Okay, broader than just fuel cost, the diesel cost. Okay, all right. Do you see that reversing in the near term, or is that more secular?","Doug Baker","I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s secular, we don\u2019t see a reversing in the near term.","Richard O\u2019Reilly - Revere Associates","Okay, good.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Thank you, Mr. Monahan. You may now begin.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","Thank you and hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's first quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. A discussion of our results along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor. Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on those materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion, and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described under Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our most recent Form 10-K and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with a brief overview of the results, Ecolab's strong growth momentum continued in the first quarter. Further new business gains, pricing, and product innovation drove strong acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales growth in all of our business segments. That solid top line growth along with cost efficiency, lower interest expense, and a reduced tax rate yielded the first quarter's 14% adjusted earnings per share increase. These results were in line with our prior forecast as adjusted for the new accounting standards. For more information on the impact of those standards, see our April 18 Form 8-K.","Moving to some highlights from the quarter and as discussed in our press release, first quarter 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $0.91. This compared with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.80 a year ago. Consolidated sales rose 10%. Acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales increased 6%, with strong growth in all of our business segments. Regionally, sales growth was led by North America and Asia Pacific.","Adjusted fixed currency operating margins decreased 60 basis points as pricing volume increases were more than offset by rising delivered product costs. Adjusted fixed currency operating income rose 2%. The operating income gain along with lower interest expense and a lower tax rate yielded a 14% increase in first quarter 2018 earnings per share. Adoption of the new revenue recognition standard had a $0.01 per share favorable impact.","We continue to work aggressively to drive growth, winning new business through our innovative new products and sales and service expertise as well as driving pricing and cost efficiencies to grow our top and bottom lines at improved rates. We also see continued good underlying sales volume and improving pricing across our business segments and look for that to more than offset continued delivered product cost headwinds and yield stronger income growth.","We raised our 2018 earnings forecast. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to rise 13% to 18% to the $5.30 to $5.50 range, with second half earnings growth outpacing the first half as volume and price gains increasingly offset the expected impact of higher delivered product costs and systems investments that will have a greater impact in the first half. We expect strong second quarter sales growth with lower operating margins as improved sales momentum and accelerated pricing are more than offset by higher delivered product costs and systems investments. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the $1.23 to $1.29 range, up 10% to 15%.","In summary, we saw continued strong momentum in our business as we began 2018 and expect further improvement over the balance of the year to deliver 13% to 18% adjusted earnings per share growth.","And now here's Doug Baker with some comments.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. So our first quarter was a good start to what we anticipate will be a very good year. We had strong top line across the board, 10% reported, driven by 6% organic sales. We had good Industrial results; strong Energy; and other, i.e. Pest results; and much improved Institutional sales results. The leading metrics were also solid. New business was up double-digit versus a year ago with strong new product portfolio performance. And pricing continues to progress, and it needs to, because inflation will be even more significant than originally forecast but we believe it's well in-hand and will be well-managed. Q1 represented the high point on a year-on-year basis for raw material increases. We have increased our pricing targets and pricing will continue to build through the year and provide margin leverage beginning Q3 onwards. Separately, we're putting together a comprehensive plan to leverage our system investments, further enhancing SG&A efficiency over the next several years which will provide an added large margin lever, too. In short, we have strong underlying business momentum, pricing overcoming inflation, competence in our ability to navigate the uncertainties, all of which led us to raise our full year forecast.","So with that as an overview, I'll turn it back to Mike.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","That concludes our formal remarks. Operator, would you please begin the question and answer period?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Our first question today comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. Good morning. Wanted to ask a longer-term question on Energy. Assuming crude prices are stable in the $70 or so range, is it a reasonable expectation to believe the segment could return to prior levels of profitability circa 2014 or do we need to see a sustained increase in oil prices to reach back into the mid-teens operating margin?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well I would say we believe that if oil prices did happen to be stable for the foreseeable future, i.e. the end of the cycle, that you would ultimately get back to the mid-teens but it would take a little longer than if you had a, let's say, continuing rise in price. But we would look at that as a favorable environment, though I would also consider probably unexpected just given the history of oil and the likelihood that we haven't seen the last cycle. What we're seeing in oil is balance, if you will, in terms of supply and demand and a lot of political risk, most of which everybody suspects is baked into the price. But the political risk feels more real than not. Ultimately, there's been a lot of CapEx taken out of this business and there's going to need to be more put in just to meet the increased demand and the inability of current supply to meet that demand because it flows off. So that means new oil, and we like new oil. New oil commands more of our technology than the oil it replaces, and that even in a fairly flat environment drives market growth for us. So that's why if you said stable at $70, we would see that it's a growing market. Our ability to grow would be fairly significant over a period of time and we do believe we'd get back to mid-teens.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just a quick follow-up on any potential risk from tariffs. If you've done any work on that either directly on Ecolab or indirectly through tariffs on raw materials. Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. We don't believe we have outsized risk on tariff. Our strategy has always been to try and make where we sell, i.e. make product, secure raw materials, et cetera in the currencies that we're building in to mitigate both currency risk from a strategic standpoint and\/or trade risk. And so that will serve us well as we go through this. So I think the tariff impact for us specifically would be fairly nominal. The larger risk of course on tariffs is what to do with the overall economy which of course we wouldn't be completely shielded from, but we would share in that pain with everybody else. And historically, I'd say in difficult environments we perform well, at least relatively well.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe just to follow-up on the Energy question. Like I think you talked about earlier on trying to decyclicalize or make less cyclical I guess the Energy piece. I know WellChem is a smaller piece but any update there in terms of your portfolio review on that side?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, we've exited a couple of small businesses that were in the Energy portfolio that were particularly cyclical. They were almost completely related to drilling activity. They were equipment-related or capital equipment-related, so that occurred both fourth quarter and first quarter. So that's a little bit of a beginning of moving on a review we've performed. But that's the only thing that's occurred right now.","I'd say within the portfolio and in WellChem, we continue to look for growth in what I would call the more stable part of that portfolio and emphasizing those technologies versus those that might be closely related to drilling activity, and that work has also begun. That would be the two current updates.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. And then I was just hoping if you could you just address the Healthcare performance this quarter. I mean, that was way below expectations I guess on our end. It sounded like you were getting things back, and now is it just a timing quarter blip? Can you just address that?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, we agree. I mean, Healthcare had a weaker than expected quarter. We expect it will probably continue through a portion of the second quarter. We do remain confident that the balance of the year post that is going to be back more in normal range.","Europe, particularly France, is slower than anticipated. Some was just underlying market growth. We were also going against a fairly strong performance year ago in the first quarter.","But we had a technology delayed by regulatory issues. Those issues have been resolved. The product is now shipping.","And in the U.S., we were lapping a couple of large initiatives last year around intuitive and room hygiene rollouts. So the rollouts that we have, the new business that we have gives us confidence that this is going to be a temporary issue, and it will be back to growth.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it, all right. Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. How is the M&A pipeline looking? And are there more discussions underway, say, in one market area than another?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, I would say we're a fairly constant driver of M&A and have been for a number of years. So the activity doesn't really wax and wane, it's fairly consistent. And I would say our pipeline remains rich.","I think we've talked before that the businesses we're in, we're in because we believe they're growth businesses. We're open to acquisitions in virtually all of them. There are a couple of exceptions that we cited. Paper and probably the WellChem area would be the two most notable. With those as exceptions, all others we would be open to driving growth via acquisition if it makes sense.","Pipeline looks good. We would expect to have other deals done this year. Obviously that's going to be dependent upon another party agreeing with us on valuation and all the rest. And we'll continue to work hard to be good stewards of the shareholders' money and not force things by paying too high a multiples.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And then, Doug, as you roll out more digitally-enabled offerings in the future, do you accelerate obsolescence on the installed base of dumb equipment? And does capital spending accelerate, since I think that's a large part of your CapEx budget? Or is it \u2013 it's something that will be immaterial? It'll be upgrading stuff, and we won't notice it?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I don't think it'll be a material change. We are working in much of the equipment that we have installed that, say, isn't connected to the Internet. And so we don't have the ability to get information from the device that's collecting it to the cloud, per se. That, we're working on retrofit items that are fairly cost-effective that will enable us to move it from the current device to the cloud, cost-effectively.","So it's not going to entail a whole retrofit, like rip out and replace with all new, which would add significantly to capital over the near-term. So I don't think it's going to be a big noise.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Maybe you could talk a bit about the ERP investments. It sounded like you were a little more comfortable on some of the returns, particularly on the margins. Maybe you can provide a little framework for us. Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Well, the ERP investments in particular are more loaded in the first half than the second half. And we're sitting here in May 1, I would say it's going as well as these things go, meaning there's no news to report on the call.","We put in a new finance package across the U.S. That turned on effectively and on time and we've got crudely 30% of our U.S. supply being run on this system. And we'll be rolling out in other waves the balance of the U.S. And that plant went on and we're manufacturing effectively, billing, shipping, collecting, all the things that you would hope would happen.","So I don't think this is going to be real noise this year. If anything, it was a little better than our worst fears in the first quarter. And I would expect you would see the same thing in the second quarter as we move forward.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah, good morning. It looks like the Institutional division has picked up, some of which I think is maybe distributor restocking but also probably some fundamental improvement as well. Is that a function of stronger retention or pricing or customer traffic trends? Would appreciate just any details on what's happening in the Institutional division specifically.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I would say things played out much as we foresaw during our last call. And if you recall, during that call we discussed our offense really wasn't sufficient given soft market conditions in that our offense has been impacted in particular by a delayed warewash launch which was occurring in December. So I'd say markets are marginally better. I'm not sure it's the huge driver but it certainly it's better. The offense execution I think is materially better. So while the underlying market was good globally it was decent in the U.S. Our retention results, which you brought up, continue to be very good and kind of in the best-in-class range versus our history. So there wasn't a lot of room for improvement there.","What really happened is we had improved new business driven by a strong SMARTPOWER launch which is the big warewash launch I referred to earlier that had previously been delayed. I think we're also leading the shadow of the Swisher and field technology introductions that we've talked about in the past. Our view, so we had a reported 5%; really that's a 4% underlying and probably 100 basis points of that growth from channel refill. And the 4% underlying growth compares to really 3% underlying growth in the second half last year. So it's ticked up, it's ticking up as we anticipated and I would say we expect continued good execution through the year, a decent market, foresee 4% underlying growth in Q2 as well and that accelerating to end the year at a 5% underlying growth rate.","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Doug. Maybe switching gears to your Food & Beverage business. In your supplemental you highlighted that new business wins are offsetting continued challenging industry conditions in the food and beverage industry. You guys had great results here, so can you just expand on what you mean by challenging industry conditions and what you expect there?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I would just say many of our customers are in a difficult environment. So large food processors and, in some cases, large beverage or brewer situations are more challenging than normal, and that always has some impact. It could lead to plant closures, consolidations, et cetera. With that said, I would say we remain quite bullish about our F&B business. We've managed through these issues over time quite successfully; expect to do the same this year. We've had a lot of net new gains in that business, many of which will start driving I think even enhanced sales performance for the balance of the year. So I think we sit in a pretty comfortable place at least as we can see right now from a Food & Beverage standpoint.","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","Scott Goldstein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. This is Scott on for P.J. If we can just talk about some of the margin pressure year-over-year, the 100-basis point decline year-over-year. Can you perhaps give more color on how much of that came from maybe higher raw material prices versus some of the compensation rebuild in Energy and any other product costs that we can separate out?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. So are you referring to OI or are you referring to GP?","Scott Goldstein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Operating income.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. So operating income, if you adjust out acquisitions and currency and the rest, was off I think 60 basis points. And I would say a couple of things. If you go up, I mean clearly as I mentioned earlier you're dealing with the largest year-on-year raw material impact. That will dissipate the year-on-year impact. We do not expect raw materials to become cheaper. They're simply going against an easier base because it was a more difficult situation a year ago, and that really began in Q2 last year. And so that's the comparison that eases for us.","Pricing will continue to accelerate as we go through this. But at the end of the day, pricing is going to rise we think throughout the balance of the year, moving now from kind of around 1% but obviously a little north of 1% to about 2% for the balance of the year; sometimes rounding up, sometimes rounding down but building as we go throughout the year which will enable us to start seeing improved both gross margin and OI margins beginning in Q3, in some businesses as early as Q2. The real build here is mostly raw material, maybe there's (21:53) some one-time noise. There's a little bit compensation build in some businesses but that's not the big news. We have investments that are predominantly in the first half versus the second half, so it's raws, it's investments both of which ease throughout the year.","Scott Goldstein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, thank you. And on the Colloidal Technologies business that you separated out, can you just provide some background on that business and why did it makes sense for you to start reporting it as a separate line?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Our plan is to start reporting it this year prior even to the Equipment Care divestiture. I mean, truth is it takes a while to unpack all of the businesses that existed in the formal Nalco business. I think Colloidal was sort of in and buried. I mean, we knew about the business. But as we learn more about it, it's really we would consider it. It's a good business. It's more a Specialty chemical business. Doesn't have the same service component that virtually all of our other businesses have, so it's managed a bit differently and is a little different than the balance. So the decision was really made late last year that we'd be moving this into the other category as a consequence of its uniqueness.","The business, basically we got into this business, if you will \u2013 I'm saying the royal we, saying Nalco history in the 1940s and 1950s \u2013 it used to be technology used in the water treatment area that was supplanted by technology in other areas. But they learned over time that this technology made a lot of sense in other industries, polishing metal, polishing glass, molding, et cetera. So it's a business with pretty solid customers, very good margins. It grew double digits last year. We anticipate it'll probably have slower growth this year as we focus on margin there as well because raw materials are pretty much a pressure in every business. So it's a good business for us but that it belongs in other.","Scott Goldstein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you. You hit on this a little on the cost side, but in terms of price cost on neutrality can you just walk us through the current pricing initiatives and just how you expect them to roll through the balance of the year? It sounds that in terms of magnitude that you have a pretty solid base case and that pricing is still linked a lot more service-level or value proposition and not necessarily cost. Is that the best way to think about it over the long-term? Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, getting pricing is always difficult. I would say we work hard to be sort of continually on the price program, if you will, with customers simply because we work, if you will, to smooth the ups and downs in the raw material market with our customers. We can because raws represent, I don't know, 20-some odd percent of our total P&L, and all businesses would prefer sort of steady impacts versus sharp shock impacts. So when there's an inflationary period we obviously up the amount that we seek and secure from a pricing standpoint. Certainly, having an inflationary environment gives you a better backdrop for pricing discussions. We don't want to lose out on that. It also drives frankly more critical need to get it.","We have very many different pricing scenarios with customers. Some have quarterly pricing clauses. At worst, we have annual pricing clauses. We have worked very hard to get out of any fixed price contracts, and we really started that work back in 2004. And as far as I know, we don't have any or any that are really material. I'm sure I could find one somewhere, but that's how we view pricing. Obviously, you have different price pressures in different businesses because raws don't all move in lockstep, and Energy and our Water businesses have more price pressure than other businesses as a percentage of raw increase and are, in turn, seeking, if you will, larger price steps from their customers to cover these; in an Energy case, also to cover price concessions given over the last few years during the downturn in the energy market.","So this is a real work for our team. They've been on it. We've seen very steady sequential improvement in pricing starting in the first quarter of last year. We expect to see continued sequential improvement this year as we move through the year, and that is the numer one tool we're using to offset the raw material inflationary environment which I'd also say includes freight by the way, and it it's critical that we get this done. I'm confident we will but it is real work by the team which is appreciated and that's how we have to set ourselves up moving into next year.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. And just can you talk a little more about Institutional growth as it pertains to full service restaurants versus your solid growth in QSRs? Just what's your overall expectation in the intermediate to long-term for full service foot traffic? And given that you positively expanded the delta of your growth versus some challenging industry trends, is that positive gap sustainable if foot traffic, let's say, stabilizes or even turns positive based on new initiatives and new products? What's the best way to think about that? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I think this 4% to 5% range, 5% when things are little bit better, might reach into 6% at times, I think is a range that is sustainable from Institutional alone, even given what I would call modest market or semi-challenging market conditions.","So look, we continue to make sure that we secure share and secure great positions in all market segments. It's the best way we can predict \u2013 or, I mean, protect our ability to grow in almost all environments. We've done a good job there. We've always been after the emerging chains. We worked very hard in fast casual segment and done a good job securing share there as well.","We do a good job partnering when it makes sense for customers between QSR and Institutional, as QSR increasingly looks to develop labor-saving devices, read warewash machines and other technology in their units because of the pressure on labor wages via both healthcare and just rising wages and the pressure on $15.","So all of these things come to play. So I think I was very clear. For a while, Institutional was growing at the 7% rate, and I said it's not our terminal rate of growth. Don't bake this in. It's faster than we're going to see for the foreseeable future. And when we were at 3%, I was also saying, don't bake this in. This is lower than we anticipate and believe that we're going to see.","Getting back in this 5% range is I think quite achievable and reasonable, and it's a reasonable expectation going forward.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good afternoon. Can you talk a little bit about sort of the demand trends in Energy? I mean, you're going back so close to the energy crash (29:55) to get back the price concessions you gave. Can you talk a little bit about sort of is there any regional difference in where you're seeing traction or any customer mix issues that are complicating that effort?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Sort of it's the mirror and, I mean, it's opposite of what we I guess experienced in the downturn. WellChem is moving quickest and U.S. is moving quickest, and it did in the downturn and it is in the upturn.","And so clearly WellChem is the fastest growth business, but it also had the largest decline. It's also we're seeing the earliest largest price traction, which you would expect because it had had the most price degradation as well as we went through.","The good news is, as we went through the decline we would swap out technology when we had the lower price so that we protected, in most cases, our most efficacious technologies from taking big price declines. We are now reintroducing that technology because of needs of the market, i.e., to get more out of existing holes in the ground. That's working.","I would say you're seeing in OFC better pickup in terms of sales in North America, again mirroring what we experienced before, i.e., U.S. went down fastest, it's now recovering quickest. We would expect to see recovery broadly around the global regions, starting more like next year. So there's still more in front of us we think even in this current price environment.","So I don't know if that helps. Those are the areas. Downstream was more steady, I think you're seeing more steady. It's going to be mid-single digits this year. But there again we're getting pricing, because we had some concessions and we have raw material impact. So pricing is a focus in all three of the areas, but you're seeing the most dramatic pickup in WellChem.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","And then in Institutional, are there any areas where you're looking at increasing the rate at which you're expanding the sales force, given the wider competitive advantage that you've been developing over the last few years? Does it then make sense to grow the sales force faster or to see growth after 2020?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, I would \u2013 I think given the size of Institutional, I mean, you certainly get into this equation in many businesses where you need to hire sales people in advance of growth, given where they are in terms of development, particularly if you're smaller and you have a more underdeveloped sales team that \u2013 I mean, if you think at the very beginning of a business, if you don't hire anybody in sales, it's going to be hard to grow.","Institutional is at a point of maturity where we're a little bit out of that mix globally on average. There are markets, read China, parts of Southeast Asia, even in cases in East Europe and some other specific areas, where we do have to add sales in advance of growth. And we are doing that and we'll continue to do it.","But I would say in the more mature markets, i.e., U.S. and\/or Western Europe, that's not really the situation we're in. We much more try to add almost as a percentage of growth or expected growth as we go through. We are adding but not at a dramatic rate.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. As price achievement goes from 1% plus or minus to 2% plus or minus, could you just help us understand how much of that's going to come from customers that are already giving you price increases, that are giving you more, versus customers that haven't? And are there any sort of deltas or differences that are important to understand between the segments? Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I'd certainly think there'll be very few customers at the end of a two-year period who haven't been touched on pricing, i.e., last year and this year. And some in fact will have been asked for several price increases. It's very dependent upon the business and the raw material pressures in a given area and\/or their product mix. So it's hard to generalize, but I'd just say many will have two. I mean virtually all will have one.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just as a follow-up on raw materials or just inflation in general, are you at all affected by what's been going on with truck freight expense and things like that? Or do you have it completely within your own control?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","No, we're impacted clearly. We use a lot of common carriers for both shipments in between facilities of our own shipments as well as customer shipments. Freight is a real challenge and we're doing a number of things. We're looking at our freight policies. We're looking at our freight breaks. We're reevaluating minimums and all the rest of the stuff. I mean, the best way to reduce freight is reduce shipments, and I don't mean reduced tonnage. So we've got to look at ways of economizing and being smarter here, and it's in our customers' best interest too. I would say everyone that's in business in the U.S. fully understands this and is experiencing it first hand. So it's not new, it's not real news, and nobody can pretend this is a made up issue.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Mario Cortellacci - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi, guys. This is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. In the European Institutional business, could you give us an update on what you're seeing in the competitive environment?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. That's always been our most difficult competitive environment. It remains so. That's a truism for the last several decades. We don't expect it to change dramatically. I don't know that we've seen dramatic change in the competitive environment there. Our largest competitor is Diversey. They're with a new owner now. They remain quite price aggressive but they've been price aggressive for as long as I've been at the company, and that's almost three decades now which is tough to admit. So I don't know what to say. I mean, it's not our best performing business in that region. We've stabilized sales. We would expect based on leading indicators that we'll move to growth in the second half, be relatively flat to minorly up in the first half but nothing significant, but improved in the second half as it looks right now.","Mario Cortellacci - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Perfect, and just one more and I'll turn it over. Could you update us on how you think about the timeline of reaching your 20% margin target?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Well I'd say the FX gods have finally coughed up a few points which we greatly appreciate. I would say this. I still believe this is a 20% OI business. And even when we rolled out that target, we were fairly clear to say it wasn't going to occur by 2020 but we got a little hung up on alliteration or at least the magic of 2020 and 20%. So I would say it's going to be in the early 2020s. I would certainly hope before 2025, but it's a goal that I think is achievable and is reasonable for this company to pursue. We look at other companies with the advantages that we have in technology and capabilities with customers. They achieve it. I don't see any reason why we can't also. The key isn't, from a customer standpoint, your margin; the key is the value. And if we continue to do a great job bringing great value to our customers, they're going to measure this not on what we make but on what benefit it brings to them, and that's how they calculate value, i.e. what they're willing to pay. So for us to do it, we've got to keep delivering and developing great new technology. I like what we've got in the pipeline. We'll see.","Mario Cortellacci - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. Doug, can we focus on Water for a minute? Could you just speak to \u2013 kind of compare and contrast end markets, geography, how the pricing objectives are going there, and then maybe any thoughts on margin as we progress first half to second half? Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. So I would say the Water business had really pretty strong results in virtually every region. And if you look at sort of that core heavy\/light Water business accelerated and its organic growth rate in the first versus the fourth, so it continues to strengthen in a number of areas. The only region and the only place that we are still recovering in in the core Water is really China heavy industry, and a lot of that has to do with what's been happening in China heavy industry, i.e. they've been shutting down plants and facilities and obviously you don't sell a lot when the facility goes out of business. That too will pass. I think we're in good position there to accelerate that business moving forward, so we feel good about where we are in Water broadly. From a pricing standpoint, I would say generally we're having good success in pricing. Asia is always a tougher environment to get pricing than the other markets but we are also pushing very hard to make sure that we secure pricing there as well. But I guess our Water team and I remain confident that we are going to secure the pricing we need to start seeing margin leverage in that business beginning in Q3 as well.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks, helpful. And then a little unorthodox on the follow-up question, but over \u2013 it's been about two years since Venezuela was deconsolidated, and clearly and unfortunately things have not gone better in that geography. Is that probably a never again for Ecolab or how should we think about that? Obviously it's been quiet and will probably remain so for the near-term, but just thinking longer-term is that something that probably will not return?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well every one of my either private or public predictions around Venezuela and the regime change and everything else have been completely wrong. So based on my track record, I would take all this with a grain on salt. Someday I got to imagine things will change politically in Venezuela. I have no idea when that's going to occur. We did have to deconsolidate. We no longer had control over that business in any reasonable way, and I think you've seen that play out for a number of companies over the last few years. We are still operating in Venezuela. It's not easy. We have literally 50-year customers in that market that we've worked very hard to continue to support as we go forward. They were customers before this regime. They will likely be ongoing entities post this regime. And so what we've worked very hard to do, and I'll just describe it because I don't think it's going to happen in the near-term, is preserve the option for the company by making sure that we support this business without investing more dollars, and that's a trek, so far so good.","But it's important that we maintain, if we can, the support for these customers. They've been very important to us over a number of years and we want to make sure we do everything we can for them within reason. We won't do anything illegal. We won't put anybody in harm's way, et cetera, but it's a very, very challenging situation. So I wouldn't count on it and I certainly wouldn't buy the stock based on a Venezuela turnaround but we do work to keep the option open for the company.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","All right. Thanks for sharing that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. It's Chris Evans on for Bob. I was hoping maybe we could get a little more color on the other income line that showed up in the quarter. I assume that's a consequence of some of the accounting changes you made. I just want to know what kind of margin impact for the segments that may have had and what to expect going forward.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I'm going to \u2013 Dan gets to handle this because it's pension and the new accounting changes.","Daniel J. Schmechel - Ecolab, Inc.","Right. So, yeah, what shows up now below our reported operating income is what I'll describe as the sort of non-service, which means the good guy part of the pension reporting. So on that other income line you basically have the expected return on pension assets and plus a bunch of other pluses and minuses, but I would think of it as primarily being the expected return on the pension assets. And as you can tell, it's up pretty significantly year-on-year just based on strong performance of the asset last year. The impact of pulling out the favorable aspect of pension out of operating income corporately is about a 50-basis point depression to reported operated income margins and I would think about that as breaking pretty evenly across the public segments plus or minus.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks and appreciate that. And then maybe just going into Energy for a minute. You've previously guided to some of the comp rebuild kind of ending here in the first quarter, some of the raws pressure sort of lapsing a bit. So as we get into the second quarter is that maybe the first time you'll actually see the margin trajectory turn positive after a couple tough years?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I would say Energy is going to turn margin-positive year-on-year potentially Q2, it won't be dramatic. Q3, we're quite confident it will be positive by Q3. So I'd say over the next couple of months it's going to be turning positive from a margin standpoint. I don't know what the math is exactly is going to be in Q2 but I will tell you it will turn in Q2.","Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Hello, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to touch on a couple of your businesses that are maybe smaller but have seen some difference in growth and I just want to make sure what's going on there. Number one is on your Pest business. It was up 8% excluding acquisitions. Should we continue to expect this high single-digit growth to continue and is it driven by you're getting more scale and better business in Europe or is it both domestic and European expansions? And also, when can we expect the 6% or so contribution from acquisitions to anniversary in that SBU?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Dmitry, I think the Pest business has been really performing at a very high level for several years now and we expect it to continue this year, so high single-digit type growth is I think a fair expectation. I certainly have it as we look at the business. And, yeah, they're doing it the old fashioned way. I mean, they're keeping customers and selling new ones. It's strong U.S. performance but also good performance in our Europe businesses which are other businesses of scale. So it's fairly uniform. They're doing a good job on some of the smaller international businesses as well and have improved those businesses. We had, if you went back a few years, couple businesses there that weren't performing in a satisfactory manner certainly from an operating income standpoint and they've improved as well. So I feel good about where we are in Pest.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","And the acquisition anniversarying, is that a second quarter event?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","For Pest?","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Yes.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","The Pest acquisition, I mean, what we internally call triples, fourth I think, second half.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Second half.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I don't remember the exact date sitting here, but in my head I want to say October, December \u2013 I don't \u2013 fourth quarter.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So it'll continue to be a driver through the next couple of quarters.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, but acquisition-adjusted growth, right, is very favorable too. We take it out of that.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Right, which is why I wanted to differentiate the two. Okay. And then as a follow-up, I know you mentioned Paper as one of the areas that you're not looking to invest but it is a mid-single-digit grower for you lately and it hasn't all been every quarter but it certainly has been a low to mid-single-digit grower fairly consistently. Sort of how do you do that without making the investments or without making above minimum investments I guess? And what does this business have to do to change your mind about viewing it as a long-term contributor to your P&L and to your value proposition?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, to be clear, we too like the Paper business, and our desire not to add to it through acquisition is not a statement that we don't like it. I don't plan on adding onto my home but I still like it.","So I would say in the Paper standpoint, we do invest in it. We invest in R&D. We do not pull punches. If we're in a business, we're in it to win it. And we need to make sure that we stay in the inv1estments needed to meet customer needs today and tomorrow.","And so we have a very active R&D portfolio. In fact, we have several real breakthrough items that have come through the Paper R&D development that frankly we think are going to be quite positive in other parts of our business as well.","So I want to differentiate that comment. And so as long as we own a business, we're on the gas. We're working to grow it.","There's some portfolio management about where do you really want to go put incremental dollars, and that's a diff1erent decision.","So I'm with you. I like the Paper business. We've invested. It's done quite well for us. We always said it was maybe the third most attractive business, but it was still attractive when we purchased Nalco, so a lot of this is that history that goes back now seven, eight years.","But since then, Paper EBITDA margins and all the rest have improved handily. And we're proud of what that team's accomplished and look forward to what they're going to accomplish going forward.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Hey, Doug, that's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thank you \u2013 or good afternoon, thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Doug, we've had two quarters in a row of 6% organic growth in each of the quarters. There's some talk about things that might be a little bit more one-time-ish, but it seems like you've gotten to that level. Should we think that that's kind of a high water mark for the near-term in terms of being at 6% growth? Or is that something that you think could be a sustainable number, given the improvements that you're seeing within the business and the momentum? Can you talk about what could put that up versus down and where you're co with right now?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. No, I think the 6%, we've talked for a long time that we believe that's kind of a going rate for our business. I believe it's a going rate for the balance of the year. Whether every quarter exactly at 6% or some number right around it, could be above, could be below. But I think for the year our expectations would be in that range for organic sales growth.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. And just to follow-up, can you give a little more details about this comprehensive efficiency initiative? What exactly is it? Is it multi-year? What's meant to accomplish with this versus what you generally do in a kind of day in, day out, looking for efficiencies in the business?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Well, the difference is that we've had sizable investments in systems. And we've talked about it, and we've talked about high water marks and that this has been important to us and we think setting the stage for the future.","Well, whenever you're justifying those internally, obviously there's a return on that investment. And the return is typically driven by efficiencies. So we're getting at a point where there's some maturation on these system implementation plans. And it is now time to start putting in place the plans to specifically harvest, if you will, the efficiencies that these enable.","And these aren't overnight efficiencies. These are efficiencies that you build over several years, but you've got to get after kind of a start date and get pushing on this fairly aggressively, or you never quite realize your full potential.","And so what this is about is sort of declaring that it's time now to switch from investing to also implementing the efficiency benefits that we're going to see, and that's what we're talking about. So there'll be more conversation about this going forward. This will be another important lever in our arsenal. We always talk about continuing to drive OI margin over periods of time and certainly this is going to be one of the tools that enables us to do that.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon. Maybe building on the last question a little bit, the new customer installation and innovation investments that you referenced in the Institutional business, what's the timeframe for when we should expect to see you leverage those costs? Is that something that we kind of see the cost get covered over a couple quarters and then several quarters later you really start to see the return and see the leverage kind of accelerate from there?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, typically we end up covering a lot of the cost. What happens is when we have large installs and so, if you will, big new business, you end up with fairly significant install expense, some of which is depreciated, some of which is just taken to the P&L.","And we've chosen to do that over the years, but that can get outsized on \u2013 when you do 13-week reporting, it can look and make that specific period look a little odd. That's the only reason we're talking about it. If it was just in the context of a whole year, it sort of gets smoothed out. But since we have quarterly reporting periods, we need to reference it so that people understand why we may have near-term margin impact.","Once it's behind us and customers start consuming at going rates, you quickly end up smoothing any of that distortion out of your P&L, and so that certainly happens within a couple of quarters max, that you start getting at more going rate, if you will.","But there's a little pain upfront. Now this is good pain. We like this. We'll take this all day long. A lot of this, this is in the Institutional segment, much of it's in our Specialty business in particular. But it's good news, but that's how this shows up and why.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. And then can you reference some delays in the rollout of SMARTPOWER, and you also mentioned that Europe was soft in Institutional. I'm just wondering are those two things related? Were we rolling out SMARTPOWER in both North America and Europe and that was supposed to happen over the past couple quarters and it was delayed?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","The SMARTPOWER delay was principally in the U.S. It was supposed to go early in 2017. It went very late in 2017. So it's sort of old news but I referenced it last quarter and talked about it as one of the impacts and also one of the reasons we were confident that we were going to see a pickup beginning in Q1, which we did see.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. But is SMARTPOWER being rolled out in Europe this year?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","It's being rolled out. It's rolled out in Europe and it's not rolled out in the U.S. too.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli. Please proceed with your question.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I was looking at pricing, Doug. I mean, as a general rule year-in and year-out your price increases by 1% to 2%. So we are now in an inflationary environment and raw material costs are still going up as we speak, and so I was expecting a higher increase in pricing. Am I missing something? Are you doing something different?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well I would say typically, Rosemarie, when we're in a, let's say, a non-inflationary or even a deflationary, we'll continue to seek price. We may round to 1% but we're not getting 1% typically in those environments exactly. I would say we're talking about now moving up. This isn't corporately close or even over 2%. It's not exactly the same in every business. You have different pressures so some are going to be above that, some below. The other is, as we've talked in the past, pricing is one of the tools that we use to offset this; the other is new technology. And as we rollout new platforms, the new platform is typically priced double-digit ahead of the old platform if you equate it to a price per pound, kilo, or liter basis. And so that's I would say historically our number one tool. So it's all of these working together. But when you have inflation like this you can't only rely on new technology; you have to make sure that you're driving just, as we call it, naked pricing as well, i.e. you're getting $50 on this stuff and now I need $51, $52.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Sure. And on the freight side, in addition to that probably 2% price increase, are you setting up surcharges which are not showing up in the pricing?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well we certainly are utilizing surcharges in certain businesses and geographies around freight because it's the fastest way to go start securing additional revenue to cover some of those costs. So we are doing that.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. And then if I may on the Colloidal Technologies. Could you share with us the size of it? And have you separated it in order to dispose of it or in order to really pay a lot of attention to it and grow it profitably?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well it's about $85 million or was last year. No, I mean, this isn't a big strategic move. It's more a move of how do you manage what's in what segment based on accounting rules amongst other things. So it's where it belongs. I mean, it's been managed well. Last year it grew double digits, so I don't have any real issue with the focus that's in place on the business at all.","Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thank you","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi, guys. Just on the guidance raise of $0.05. Was there anything more than just the fact that you beat the midpoint by, like what, $0.03 or $0.04 here that contributed to the range? Is there anything fundamentally in your outlook that changed?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well we didn't. As I always say, we focus on our range, not consensus since it moves around all the time. So it wasn't really because we had a beat versus the average or the consensus number. I think it was really looking at our underlying business strength. We're obviously much further in the year than we were when we have to give the initial range and it was based on underlying strengths. A lot of the other factors sort of neutralize each other at this point in time, so it's really looking at sales trends, et cetera.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Monahan. Thank you, Mr. Monahan, you may now begin.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's second quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO.","A discussion of our results along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor. Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion, and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described under Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our most recent Form 10-K and in our other posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with a brief review of the results, Ecolab's growth momentum continued in the second quarter. New business gains, pricing, and product innovation drove strong second quarter acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales increases in all of our business segments. That solid top line growth, along with cost efficiency and a reduced tax rate, yielded the second quarter's 13% adjusted earnings per share increase.","Moving to some highlights from the quarter and as discussed in our press release, second quarter 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13% to $1.27. Consolidated sales rose 7%. Acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales increased 5%, with good growth in all business segments. Regionally, sales growth was led by North America.","Adjusted fixed currency operating margins decreased 20 basis points as price, volume, and efficiency increases were more than offset by rising delivered product costs in the quarter. Adjusted fixed currency operating income rose 3%. The operating income gain along with lower tax rate yielded the 13% increase in second quarter 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share.","We continue to work aggressively to drive growth, winning new business through our innovative new products and sales and service expertise, as well as driving pricing and cost efficiencies to grow our top and bottom lines at improved rates. We also see continued good underlying sales volume and improving pricing across our business segments, and look for that to more than offset continued delivered product cost headwinds and yield stronger income growth.","We continue to expect 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share to rise 13% to 18% to the $5.30 to $5.50 range, with second half earnings per share growth outpacing the first half, as volume and price gains increasingly offset the expected impact of higher delivered product costs and business investments.","We expect strong third quarter fixed currency acquisition-adjusted sales growth, with adjusted diluted earnings per share in the $1.49 to $1.57 range, up 8% to 14%. The efficiency initiative we have begun will leverage our recent technology and systems investments. We expect these actions to make Ecolab better, faster, and more profitable as we simplify our structures, improve future sales growth, and increase operating efficiency while delivering better customer outcomes.","In summary, we expect further strong momentum in our business over the balance of the year to deliver our forecasted 13% to 18% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth this year, while at the same time we are making the right investments and taking the right actions to develop superior growth for the future.","And now here's Doug Baker with some comments.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Thank you, Mike. Hello.","A couple comments on our second quarter, we feel good about our business. Our position is strong both near term and long term. If you look on a macro basis, our clean water, safe food, abundant energy, and healthy environment positioning is as relevant as ever. While the news of the day in various positions seem to change frequently, the fundamental trends that we are betting on are constant. Population is growing globally. It's aging in developed markets. The middle class is growing, particularly in Asia. A bigger middle class increases disproportionately demand for food as their diets shift and for energy as their expectations shift. Food and energy are the two largest users of water, and water is already scarce. The aging population also drives travel and consumer healthcare spend.","So in total, we see solid demand for our food safety, energy, water, and healthcare businesses now and over the mid and long term, and this is reflected in our results. We are executing well. We are seeing accelerating growth in all of our large businesses. Industrial has moved from 3% in 2017 to 5% organic first half and expect 6% organic in the second half. Institutional moved from 3% organic in 2017 to 4% organic in the first half, and we expect 5%-plus in the second half; Energy from 5% organic in 2017 to upper single digits this year; and other, led by pest, from 7% organic in 2017 to 8% in 2018.","In total, we expect to move from 4% organic sales growth in 2017 to 6% organic in 2018. This is certainly above market growth and reflects share gains, as evidenced by our net new corporate accounts business, which was up 22% in the first half of this year versus last year's first half.","Now not only are we building top line momentum, we're building margin momentum too in spite of inflation. So it's no news that we're in an inflationary environment, with raw materials and transportation increasing by $0.45 for the year. This is plus $0.17 since our last call on May 1. The dollar has also strengthened since that last call by $0.08, giving us a $0.25 challenge since May Day.","The good news is we have overcome this primarily through increased pricing and volume. In fact, margin recovery is already evident, with Q2 gross margins in line with a year ago, where Q1 was significantly off a year ago. So given our strong and consistent volume and pricing trends coupled with good management of SG&A, we feel confident we will deliver within our $5.30 to $5.50 range.","Let me take, though, a moment to address our second half, which looks a little lumpier than it actually is, with implied adjusted EPS growth of plus 20% in Q4 compared to low double digits in Q3. Mike already alluded to this. The story is one of continued strong volume plus accelerating pricing and cost savings catching up and overtaking the forecasted second half step up in raw material cost. This takes some time. Our volume forecast over the second half reflects current trends while the cost savings forecasted in the second half are in hand, and we've already secured 75% of the incremental pricing needed as well. All of this leads to our confidence in the forecast.","Finally, we also formally announced the efficiency program we referred to in our last call. This will generate $200 million in run rate savings by 2021. The program leverages our $600 million investment that we've made the last five years in technology. We are driving efficiency in G&A by leveraging our Workday and SAP platforms, by consolidating systems, by consolidating back offices, and by consolidating third-party vendors.","New field technology, which is tied to new customer digital programs like SMARTPOWER, 3D CIP and 3D TRASAR, new QSR and FRS digital safety platforms, and the like allow us to continue to improve field efficiency and customer service and capability. So all told, this will be additional fuel to drive continued mid-teens EPS growth beyond 2018.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Mike, who will open it up for questions.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","Thanks, Doug. That concludes our formal remarks. Operator, please begin the question-and-answer period.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. I think you started to see a pickup in the full-service restaurant part of your Institutional business. Are you seeing investments by the customers that might confirm that and reinforce it will be longer-term rather than a temporary uptick here?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I would say the full-service restaurant segment has got two things. Sales have been consistently growing in almost all segments. What's been weak in the past and continues to be modestly weak is foot traffic. With that said, I would say we don't consider that segment impaired or horribly unhealthy, meaning it's strong enough for us to continue to drive share growth and drive sales growth. I think what we've seen is that we've started to gain more traction. We talked how we had to delay last year a large platform introduction, SMARTPOWER. We launched it late, late last year, and it's doing what we expected to and starting to lead to more share gains, which is why you're seeing really a recovery in Institutional first half of this year versus 2017.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And then could you characterize the M&A pipeline that's there? I think we've had some big transactions that you weren't involved with. I don't know if there are a number of things that you are thinking about right now.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","We never go into specifics for obvious reasons. I would say we still have a healthy list of targets that we're looking at. We're going to remain careful, I would say, or smart with shareholder money. I think we've proven to be in the past. We'll continue to be going forward. With that said, we've closed a number of deals this year and would expect to close several more before year end.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. So I just wanted to check. Based on your revised expectations around raw material prices, would pricing be catching up to raw material costs on a dollar basis in the fourth quarter? Did I hear that right? And what would you expect in terms of pricing into 2019?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Well, we're going to continue to accelerate pricing through this year. We've seen solid acceleration in each of the last six quarters in total and really across the board by business, and we're going to continue to need to accelerate pricing through the balance of the year. That's going to leave us with a lot of carry-in into 2019, just simply by the math. You don't capture it all specifically on the last day of the year, and these agreements extend typically several years out.","So we would expect to see pricing continue to grow. I think you would see pricing up in 2019 under almost any scenario as we look. You'll see gross margins, they're already flat year on year. They're going to remain around that range for the balance of the year. You'll see OI margins expand, particularly in the fourth quarter.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just a very quick follow-on, how disruptive would a new deal Brexit be to Ecolab's UK business, including perhaps some follow-on effects to your clients there?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well I think the direct effects to us would not be monstrous. We've already \u2013 that's how we calc'd it. It basically resorts to WTO duties. We've looked at that. We've already taken some steps to mitigate that potential; i.e., moves that would be good under almost any scenario. With that said, I don't think it's going to be a big conversation piece for us if that's where it ends up. But the economic impact is probably the impact that everybody will feel.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. With regard to the $200 million cost-cutting opportunity, I guess can you help us to think about the major buckets that you see those cost savings and efficiencies coming through and how we should be thinking about them phasing-in in 2019 and 2020? Is it relatively even or straight-line through, or is it lumpier than that?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I would say that the trajectory over the time period is fairly straight-lined. It's going to be close enough if you do a third, a third, a third.","I would say in terms of buckets, it's going to be a little bit more on the G&A side, but it's going to be both on the G&A and the S side. These things come from initiatives around Workday, which has allowed us to take 176 payroll systems down to one. We had 52 onboarding systems for people and exit systems for people. We've taken those down to one around the globe. This certainly is a lot simpler and a lot more cost-effective.","If you look at SAP, we're already rolling out looking at both tank monitoring upgrades, which is going to lead to route efficiency. Often, these are our carriers \u2013 our contracted carriers, our own people dropping off tank loads of product, putting it into the plant tank. If we know exactly where they stand in all these tanks, you can route differently. You don't have any outages and it's a heck of a lot safer.","Logistics, we already now because of what we've done with SAP in the United States, where we have roughly a third of our production up, we already have better visibility and understand that 12% of what we thought were full trucks aren't actually full. And the best way to reduce shipping costs is to reduce the number of trucks it takes to ship the same amount of volume. So we're all over this stuff. We have better cost visibility; i.e., you can start driving and understanding where it makes sense to maybe go direct and where it makes sense to partner with distributors in a more collaborative way.","We'll have a number of other opportunities. Field technology, we're moving to online ordering. We're creating a portal so our customers can do online ordering today. Frequently, they phone us or even still fax us. And let me just say, fax machines aren't the most efficient way to take an order, as you can imagine.","So there's just a whole host of things that are going on, and these tools are being deployed now. And so you'll see it, both on the S side, but disproportionally on the G&A side early. We always drive S efficiency. We'll continue to do that, and these new platforms will enable us to do that for a longer period of time.","John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great, thanks very much for the color.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah, good afternoon. You guys typically get 50 to 60 basis points in operating margin expansion on higher volumes and net of pricing. And I'm calculating a 30 to 40 basis point expansion over the next three years from the restructuring plan. So adding that together, thinking about over the next several years, I'm looking at 90 to 100 basis points in operating margin expansion over the next three years, I guess. Is that how you guys are thinking about this?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. It's designed to be additive. So by and large, that's the math that we would get to too.","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then looking at your free cash flow for the quarter, I guess it was lower than expected. Was there a large working capital adjustment in the second quarter?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I'll let Dan have this one.","Daniel J. Schmechel - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. It was, well, not an adjustment, let's be clear. The second quarter followed what I would say is a very strong first quarter cash flow performance. But yes, it was \u2013 taking the first half in total, it was below last year, which is not a typical outcome for us. And you put your finger on it. So on a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow behind last year is something like $75 million, essentially all of that was in working capital.","I would break it down for you maybe into a few drivers. Of course, good news increased pricing and increases, also the uncollected receivables balance. So that's a chunk of it. There's also some payment timing, I would say in North America, which we watched it carefully at the end of June and saw accelerated payments in July.","So the net of it, I would say growth of Energy likewise, which has higher days or cash invested is good news, but it has an impact on working capital. So the net of it is I think there's some timing impact that will reverse in increased pricing. We'll have some impact for the full year as will strong Energy performance. But look, the net of it is I feel very good about our cash flow performance for the full year and expect that we'll be delivering very good cash conversion from our reported net income.","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Dan, just even with higher working capital, is it safe to assume free cash flow grows faster than EBITDA in 2018 given the benefit from tax reform?","Daniel J. Schmechel - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, I would think that that would be right, okay?","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Group. Please proceed with your questions.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good afternoon. I was just curious if you could share any color around customer churn. It feels like it's run slightly below 10% for a bit. Any room to improve that, or does it structurally just \u2013 is that maxed out for you?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","The customer churn numbers or retention on the positive side is really different by business. I would say in a number of the businesses, we are at historic low levels, which is good. It's a strong economy. This is what we look for as we go through these periods. I don't think that's where you're going to see dramatic improvement because we're typically best-in-class in most of the businesses we compete in.","Where we look for improvement, if you will, from a sales driver standpoint is, one, just more new business. We talked about how we had a lot of success in the first half this year capturing a number of large pieces of business. It was up 20% or over 20% versus same period year ago. That's a great number for us. It's our best leading indicator of sales acceleration in the past and we believe still is. That's where we're going to focus our effort in terms of improving the top line.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And just a follow-up question, on Institutional, anything relative to your expectations you're seeing in the European business? I guess it was flat. I know it's more competitive and your scale isn't as big versus domestically, but just curious as to how you're thinking about that segment.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Institutional overall, the underlying sales growth in the first quarter we cited as 4%, even though the printed number was larger and said we would expect maybe the printed number to be lower in the second quarter as distributor inventories balanced. We had some distributor inventory build in Q1. Our underlying growth again was 4%, a little north of 4% in Q2. And we continue to expect that we're going to expand that to 5% in the second half and as an exit rate in 2018. So the business is I would say globally improving, accelerating at about exactly the pace that we thought it would. We would have loved to have it go faster, but that's exactly what we thought we would see.","In terms of Europe, we thought Europe was going to be soft in the first half. We believe it's going to be a little stronger in the second half, still do. With that said, it's probably the toughest business environment that we compete in, in the Institutional business globally. With that said, we should be able to overcome it with better execution, which is exactly what we're focused on. So we don't believe it's a 1% growth business forever. But right now, the business is not performing to our expectation. It's low, it will be low single digits for the year.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you, good afternoon. My first question is just on Healthcare performance. I guess it sounds like Europe was the weak area. I was just wondering. I know you said there's obviously continued challenges in that business overall, but just some more color there in terms of maybe if you have the right portfolio mix, if you need more changes to make there.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I would say Healthcare, clearly of all \u2013 I would say all of our businesses are outperforming the market, the exception being Healthcare. With that said, the market is a little dicier in Europe than it is in North America. North America has some challenges. But in Europe, France in particular, they went through some changes in healthcare. I think we've adjusted well. We're going to have a slow first half and expect to have an accelerating back half. I think there are a lot of reasons to believe we'll have an uptick in reacceleration starting in the third quarter and moving throughout the year.","In North America, I would say it's as much execution on us as anything. We have improved significantly our program efforts, things that we put around room cleaning, hand care vectors, operating theaters, central sterile, and the like. Cumulative they're growing by double digits, so they're doing well. It's the non-program sales which are softer than expected, and we're simply going to have to do a better job managing both. I don't know what else to say. The team is on it. We expect to have a better second half. It's not going to be what I would call robust, but it will be improved.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, got it. And then just tied to your efficiency plans, I guess when you think about your 20% margin target, are there other opportunities that would be additive, like you said, to just the operating leverage you have in the business that you feel like you can touch on in the coming years?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, I think we're moving into a period \u2013 we've been in a recent period of fairly significant investment in our business, even while we were going through FX headwinds and oil market headwinds. We did not blink on what we thought were critical investments for the business, and these are backbone technologies like one HR system and what we call Catalyst, which is SAP North America. But most importantly are also digital expenditures to improve our ability to serve customers. All of this is paying off, and we've had significant investment there.","And so I think what you're now going to see is probably increased focus on harvesting these investments as we go forward, the natural order of things. And so we do expect that we're entering a period where you're going to see more expansion in terms of SG&A margins, for the simple reason that we're done upping investments. We may stay at this level for a while, but we don't have to increase investments year after year after year. And you're going to start seeing the fruits from the investments already made.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good afternoon. I guess two quick ones. One is can you characterize the trends in the Life Sciences business, very strong growth there? But also just following on the last point you made, if you look out say four or five years, do you see a bridge as your productivity \u2013 as you flex the productivity and your pricing catches up to raws to get 200 \u2013 250 basis points of margin expansion, or is that more challenging?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","On Life Sciences, yes, Life Sciences is a business we created a couple years ago ,and we took a hunk of it out of the Healthcare business and also a little bit out of the F&B business to create this. We wanted more focus on Healthcare, probably isn't perfect for the optics, but it's the right thing to do for the business. And Life Sciences is doing exactly what we hoped it would do. It's going to grow by probably mid-teens this year in terms of top line as a percent growth. The bottom line follows. It's a very attractive margin business, as you would expect. Our technologies are highly valued in the pharmacos and cosmetic industries. We make a big difference there.","Why we haven't been after this for the last 30 years, I have no great answer to, but we're on it now. And the team is doing a very good job. This is an industry that's characterized by large multinationals. They're looking for consistent service around the globe in all their areas. They need cleaning-in-place technology. They need water reduction technologies. All the stuff that we do is what they need. And so it's a perfect match for us, and so we're going to go after it.","In terms of how much margin improvement we see, I guess we've talked. We're here for the year at 14%, just under 15% margins, and we've talked that we believe 20% is real. I still believe it is very real. And we're now starting to lay out, because we can go harvest the investments that we've made, they're going to start adding fuel to margin accretion. We'll catch up on this pricing raw math. We always do. We will here again, and you'll start seeing more significant margin accretion over the next few years. So I don't believe we're anywhere near running out of margin room.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Doug, you mentioned some market share gains and some business wins. Are these benefits from some of your competitor disruptions this year as they get acquired, or is this normal Ecolab winning at the customer?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Given the history I seem to have with competitors and disruption, it seems more like a constant than anything else. So I don't know if it's because people are disrupted or not. We tend to gain share and have obviously over a number of years because we outpace our major competitors in terms of top line growth and have for a long time.","And we hold ourselves to a high bar, and we want to continue to do that. So we're gaining share in all of our major businesses across the board. The teams are doing a very good job. They're leveraging innovation that they've invested in and rolled out. We feel like we are \u2013 we really had a very strong first half. We had a very good quarter. Sometimes you have a dip after that because you just get a collection of new wins that happen. They all just say yes at the same time, but we followed it up with another very strong quarter in the second. So we're doing well in that area.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And just on that second half volume acceleration that you're pointing to, Doug, I guess in Institutional, is there one or two drivers of that, or is it a multitude drivers for the acceleration you're talking to?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Are you talking Institutional specifically or broadly?","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I'm really broadly speaking here.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I would say if you \u2013 our forecast for the second half, really the sales volume trend and the pricing trends are very straight-line, consistent with the trends that we see right now. There's no bend to them. And so we have fairly good visibility, and I would say the very solid new business experience we just had in the first half makes us quite confident that we're going to continue to see acceleration through the second half and even into early next year. And that's typically the type of visibility that metric gives us.","The pricing, same thing, we're not looking for all of a sudden going from 2% to 4% in a quarter. It's very consistent with the type of acceleration that we've seen over the last six quarters we expect to continue in the next couple. And as I mentioned in my preamble, we have visibility and have already secured 75% of the pricing that we need this year, which would be a little ahead of our normal trend in terms of timing of securing during \u2013 as we're looking to this. So those are not unique. And obviously, cost savings are the easiest thing to codify and to understand simply because they're all under your control.","So none of those trends are what I would say unique. They're very straight-line as we go through. That's what's going to drive the acceleration.","What it's offsetting is really a step function change in raw material costs third quarter to second, which basically stays roughly at that level through the balance of the year. It does not accelerate all through the year. And this is \u2013 we're using outside indices. They actually call for a let-up in the fourth quarter versus the third. We have a very modest one, but it's really only $0.01 or $0.02. It's not a big deal. If it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen. We'll manage it. But those are the fundamental factors that drive our forecast.","So when you look through it, there's not a hockey stick in this thing. But it does mean that we've got to continue to accelerate as we've been on volume, continue to do what we've been doing on pricing, and deliver the cost savings. But those are all things that we're good at.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks and good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to ask in the Energy segment, in the quarter you had very nice margin expansion year over year. And as I recall from the call three months ago, you didn't really expect that to happen till the second half of the year. So what made it happen earlier?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I'd say a couple things. One, we did \u2013 I think OI was up 28% I think in the second quarter for our Energy segment. There were some beneficial one-timers in there. With that said, it would still have been 15% if you control for those, which still obviously indicates good margin recovery.","Look, we're getting pricing. We've had very solid volume. The team is doing a good job. We're emphasizing profit recovery. We're being very disciplined on RFPs. We aren't going to chase really low-margin deals or deals that could turn cash negative if you're not careful. We don't want to play that game and we're not. And they're all over pricing, rolling out new technology, and recovering the profit that we know that business can deliver. And so I think you see that work coming through.","The Energy business base is a little lumpy, and so we're going to see changes throughout the year. But our expectation remains now what it was when we entered the year, which is high single-digit sales and low double-digit OI, so the beginning of margin recovery. We think going out a few years, we're going to continue to see high single-digit sales, but better profit recovery in the out years as pricing overtakes raws, if you will.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just as a follow-up, I think this was a big quarter for the ERP implementation. It doesn't sound like there have been any hiccups or anything like that. But separately from that, within the \u2013 are there any plans to install any of the pricing modules, other things like that with ERP that might be down the road or any opportunities there at all?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, there's a whole commercial piece that you put on this system. A lot of it is our own because we've been running SAP in a number of parts of the world and have configured a lot of this work. We rolled out Canada first because it's going to run exactly the North American design, if you will, and it's been running now for a little over a year. But yeah, those will be follow-on implementations on this system. But we've done it many times.","I would say \u2013 I can't say that you never have hiccups as you roll out SAP. SAP is always difficult to do. We've just done it a number of times. And as I say, none of these events and we've managed through a bunch, our team has done an excellent job. And I would say the big risk is more behind us than in front of us, but there's never zero risk with an SAP implementation.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, guys. You hit on this a little, but just given the composition of just your outlook for global energy market growth over the next few years, can you just walk us through some top level outlooks for your three sub-segments, your comfort with the existing cost base, and just any quick thoughts on your ultimate ability to reach prior peak margins? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Look, we had a mid-teens margin in the Energy sector as a total, and I'm quite confident we'll reach that again. I don't believe that's the ceiling for that business.","If you want to go by segment, WellChem continues to re-expand fairly quickly. It falls fast and recovers quickly, and it's doing exactly what we would expect it to do. It grew around 40% in the first half and will slow a little bit just because it's starting to go against a bigger base. But for the year, it's going to be north of 30%. And you're seeing significant OI recovery in that business as well as they, one, feed off higher sales and also have margin expansion because they're getting price and driving new technology doing exactly what they need to do to recover.","Downstream is the steadiest business. Downstream also has pretty solid top line growth. Mid to upper single digits this year is our expectation. We're seeing margin recovery there as well, as they're starting to recapture price that they gave up through the downturn. That business, though, is what I would call acts much more like a traditional Ecolab or Nalco Water business in its characteristics. And so you're seeing that play out through all parts of the cycle.","And then OFC, OFC is always a little bit of a laggard versus WellChem in terms of recovery, but you're starting to see recovery now. We'll have very modest margin recovery this year. Sales are going to be mid-single digits this year. We expect that business to accelerate next year, and it's really a tale of two cities. The U.S. is closer to double-digit growth where you've got strong unconventional recovery. And international lagged, it lagged falling in and it's lagged coming out. None of this is unexpected. Next year, we would expect to have both North America and international be positive contributors.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great, and just a quick follow-up. Can you just give us a little more color on the new selling initiatives within Healthcare and how you're ultimately progressing? I understand it's the early innings, but just any color on how to think about these and the effect on growth and margin in 2019 versus 2018 would be helpful. Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","As I mentioned earlier, our program efforts around room hygiene and central sterile and operating turnover, et cetera are doing quite well. They're growing double digit year on year. We continue to have success. We have a good pipeline. The team's on that. We like the margins. We like the trade with the customer. Obviously, the customer likes it too.","In terms of \u2013 we have a host of products. Many of them are even included there, but they're also sold in non-program formats, sometimes through GPOs or through other distribution arrangements. And there we just had weaker sales than we expected. And we need to up our focus on that area as well because you can't just \u2013 you don't want to just sit there and fill the hole with great work on the program side. We need more stability on the other side, which we're quite confident we can obtain. So I don't know what to tell you. We expect to move off the floor, which is where we're right now. The team has done a good job I think rethinking their plan for the balance of the year, and we expect to see accelerating growth in the third and fourth quarter this year leading into 2019, which we believe will be a stronger year.","Christopher S.

I was just hoping to get a little bit more context on some of the volume trends that you've seen in the business. I know we're going to get detail on this in the 10-Q. But for the discussion today, volumes did decline sequentially. Obviously, the Institutional thing we've talked about a couple of times already, but I don't know if that's enough to explain the full 2 percentage points decline in rates. So I was hoping you could just maybe, Doug, go through the segments a little bit and talk about where the other reasons for the sequential decline was at. I think one that might stick out to me would be potentially that the comparison in Energy. But is there anything else there that explains and helps us get context for the volume decline sequentially \u2013 volume rate decline, not decline?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, it's really two things. It is Institutional in Q1, where you had a distributor upping inventories and in Q2 distributors taking down inventory. The, if you will, consumption of Institutional products was very consistent and improved versus 2017. It was more around the 4%, so you have that.","The second factor was we had I would call unusually large Q1 Energy volumes, which we talked about in Q1, and some of it came out of Q2. So Q1 was a little hotter than it indicated in terms of actual consumption, and Q2 was a little lower than actual consumption would indicate. That stuff stabilizes, and what we expect to see is volume growth and recovery, acceleration in the second half much more on a straight-line basis because we know what's going on underneath, if you will, the reported volume numbers in terms of inventory impacts and one-time, where stuff fell in Energy. We have shipments at the end of the quarter at times that fall on one side of the day or the other. And we know they're really designed for the next quarter consumption.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","That's really helpful. Thank you, that's all I had.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. You guys paid down about $200 million of debt between the first and second quarter. I'm just wondering if there is a goal for end-of-year debt level. Or how should we think about that versus share repurchases given that your share count did go up? So obviously you didn't repurchase as much shares as you did previously. So in terms of capital deployment absent M&A, how should we think about between debt paydown and share repurchases?","Daniel J. Schmechel - Ecolab, Inc.","Hi, Dmitry. This is Dan. So yes, you're right. We did not repurchase shares in the second quarter. However, let me just say we got off to a pretty good start in the first quarter. So we did about $200 million I think in the first quarter. I would think about share repurchase for the full year sitting here today to be in line with what we did last year, which is about $550 million, as always and as we talked about consistently, and certainly there's no change in our thinking about capital deployment.","So from a free cash flow perspective, we will continue to pay the dividend. Of course, we will make investments in the business. We will pursue accretive M&A. And I would really think of share repurchase as being the balancing act in the deployment of free cash flow. So no change in our thinking, and if you look across the full year, I think it will be very much in line with last year and expectations.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","If I can paraphrase you, it looks like you're going to be spending $550 million in share repurchases this year or somewhere in that neighborhood. My model tells me you're going to generate a little bit north of $1 billion in free cash, more like $1.2 billion. So absent M&A, if I assign that difference to debt paydown, I won't be terribly off?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I would think that you would not be terribly off. So we've targeted A-range metrics in terms of how we think about the capital structure. I've asked for an allowance, we say it's about two times net debt to adjusted EBITDA number. We run a little bit north of that. We should be in line Q2-Q3, by the end of the year. And I'll accept your free cash flow number. I think we can beat it by a little bit, but you're thinking about it the right way. Okay?","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, thank you. Most of my questions have been answered. I was hoping to just, Dan, maybe pin you down a little bit more in terms of the free cash flow expectation for 2018. You touched on that a little bit, but do you have a more specific goal? Should we think $1.4 billion? If you can, just give us a little guidance on that for my follow-up.","Daniel J. Schmechel - Ecolab, Inc.","So I said I would accept the $1.2 billion number and think we can beat it by a little bit. I think that $1.4 billion is pretty good estimate of where we would expect to land the full year, okay?","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, that's good. Thanks.","Daniel J. Schmechel - Ecolab, Inc.","Give me a little leeway, but yes.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Doug, I just wanted to ask. What do you see? It seems from your comments that you think you're shaping up to have pretty good organic growth year in the context of the last say four or five, and then 2019 to be able to build on that. What are some of the components that would in your mind have to work right in order to make 2019 be better than 2018? Or I guess another way, is what are you most concerned about in terms of not being able to achieve a better organic growth rate next year than this year?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I think the fundamental drivers of our growth don't change year to year. And so we need to continue to take share, make sure that we're doing the right thing with customers, and deploy technology, which we're in the midst of, which also enables us to grow our business with our existing customers.","And so the investments we've made on digital technology have already grown borne fruit. I would say that we're probably ahead of where I thought we would be at this time. If you went back a year, we've had two big wins in digital with big large customers of ours. We're in the midst of rolling it out. I think these are going to lead to a host of new follow-on opportunities for us simply because it's going to give us all more visibility in how can we continue to improve operations, how can we continue to improve food safety, carbon reduction, water reduction, et cetera. And all of this is exactly how we drive our business, how do we help our customers operate better. So I think it's all in that camp.","I don't sit here right now seeing a lot of metrics that make me worried about our organic growth rate next year. Now almost anything is possible in this world, as we're all learning. And my expectation is that we're not going to all play tariff roulette to a point of huge destruction. I just don't think that's how it's going to play out, but I don't know. We aren't directly in the bull's eye of tariff problems; i.e., it's not going to lead to big cost increases specifically for us, because of our strategy of making our products where we sell are in the same currency. But it could have an impact on the global economy, which obviously has an impact on us as well.","Barring that, I think we're going to be in good shape moving into the year with very strong momentum on the top line and very strong momentum on the bottom line, as pricing starts overtaking raws clearly in the fourth quarter and strong momentum leading into 2019 for margin recovery.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. I have two questions. The first is your intention is to knock out $200 million in costs in SG&A, and your SG&A base is about $4 billion, so that's about 5%. And you want to do it over three years, so that's 1.5% per year. So does that mean that instead as a base case of your SG&A growing 5% per year, it will grow 3.5% per year? Is that generally the right way to think about it?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","It's a curve bend. Yes, you have inflation, which is a natural part of this. Often, I think these discussions become almost binary, where if you have $4 billion and take $200 million out by 2021, somebody wants to model $3.8 billion, which just isn't realistic. We expect to continue to grow this business from a top line simultaneous to this. But I would say if you modeled our traditional margin accretion that comes from volume, you're going to have additional margin accretion on top of that, which is going to come from pricing, raw favorability; i.e., that formula goes. And the third component will also be getting more efficient at the same time, which is represented by this efficiency program.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And in your discussion during the call, I think you referred to some one-time items in the Energy business. Can you describe and quantify what those were?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","There are some one-time large sales of specific products that are even close to commodities in some cases. They have big volume. We sell them. There's very little SG&A associated with it. And so it's just not business we count on routinely, but we captured a very large couple of orders in the second quarter. So we back that out on run rate looking at it, just because that's how we get from 28% to 15%. We'll take if it we find more, don't get me wrong, but we don't think it's \u2013 it's not right to indicate that that's our trend.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question is from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Goldstein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, good afternoon. This is Scott on for P.J. So I guess I was looking at the business investments you made in the Institutional business. I think you started some growth initiatives that you announced late last year. Is that still ongoing now that you started with this efficiency program?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Oh yes, absolutely, a lot of them were designed for growth. But yes, they will continue.","Scott Goldstein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up, can you remind me where you were adding, what cost bucket you were adding to in Institutional? Was it head count, or was it more on the IT side?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","We were adding, one, you've got SMARTPOWER, and the new technology takes enhanced merchandising equipment or dispensing equipment that you put in customers. Two, we had G360 rolling out. And three, we added manpower specifically in the corporate accounting area.","Scott Goldstein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, good afternoon. I was just curious. The industrial acceleration of growth, could we speak, Doug, I guess granularly in each of the subcomponents of what's going to be driving that? I think you've given a good overview of the call. But could we delve in a little bit to the sub-segments in Industrial on how that's going to progress? And I think it was in Shlomo's question you addressed tariffs, but maybe specifically in each of those categories how that could influence one way or the other? Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Our Industrial business has been doing great. Thank you for asking about it. So I would say a couple things. If you look at our F&B business, it's clearly benefited over the last few years and you're seeing a lot of the culmination of that work right now and its partnership and marriage with Water technology. So the Food & Beverage, food safety program, and the Water are very interlinked. And those together bring outsized value to our customers.","And so we've had a lot of success really across the board, and so our F&B business is really performing quite well everywhere. The only exception where it's got any negative \u2013 it doesn't have negative pressure, but tough pressure is on the agri side or the dairy side simply because of the kind of pressure in the milk market. So that business, beverage, brewery, protein business, processed food, all of those areas are doing quite well. And I would say that's in the face of a number of customers who are having to close operations, consolidating and everything else. So it's in the face of what I would call a difficult underlying situation for most of the industry.","The reason we're succeeding there is because we're bringing great value, world-class food safety I would say probably the best capabilities in that area at significant lower use cost because of the reductions in water and energy that come with the combination of those programs.","And that also leads into Water Light. So the Water Light business, which focuses on really all but the heaviest industries, so the Institutional business, the F&B business, even auto manufacturing et cetera, has done I think a great job identifying the best opportunities. They're creating brand new, very exciting programs around legionella prediction and specific programs because people need increased help in that area. They've done a whole host of things. And so that business has really been very steadily in the mid to upper single-digit growth profile and is accelerating as we speak.","And then the heavy has been more in the recovery mode. And the heavy business is really set to have a very good year. I think you see two things. One, industry broadly is doing fairly well, so we don't want to skip that part of it. With that said, where we had specific challenges in the heavy business was in China. And while not every place was glowing as a hotspot, China was a bit of a problem. And China is really flipping around now. So we've done a good job I think getting down to the portfolio we need in China. We sold some pieces of the business there that didn't make sense for us to operate, which has allowed us to focus on the pieces that we can operate best. And so you're starting to see real uptick in China, which we think is going to continue from an organic growth standpoint, and it's a big opportunity for us. Water is a big challenge in China. It's part of their five year plan, and our technology helps there.","So it's pretty much across the board. Mining is recovering. Paper had a very strong quarter. We expect to have an improved second half versus first half. Again, they're driving new technology, and China recovered in paper as well, which is very important for us for that business given all the high percent of the market that exists there now. So Industrial across the board very strong, really moved from 5% last year to a 6% this year and we expect to even do better in the second half in terms of organic growth in Industrial.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That's great. Thanks for the comprehensive answer. Just a quick follow-up, it's been about 1.5 years that you've had Anios in the portfolio. It's a really sizable acquisition. Just give us observations at this juncture. Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","We just had our first year review on Anios, and it was above all of our internal metrics and projected to stay that way. Our next big review is year three. We watch the business every month, but we always do specific look-backs on every acquisition at 90 days, at one year, and at three years.","And so the business is performing. The first quarter and part of the second quarter notwithstanding, we were way ahead of sales in the first year in a number of areas. What we're doing in terms of expanding the Anios business globally, particularly in markets where we don't want to build, if you will, a street-up healthcare business, that strategy has worked quite well and the business has been well led, and that's growing at double digits and continues to. I would say we have a lot of untapped opportunity there that Anios can unlock for us. We also have new technologies from Anios that were acquired with Anios that we're now, one, looking to expand to some of the other markets we're in and also considering expansion in the U.S. and starting the registration process.","So Anios I think was an excellent acquisition. It's performed very well. We have high bars in terms of what our expectations are for businesses that we acquire, and it met or exceeded all of those in its first year.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your questions.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could give some detail on the $200 million restructuring program in terms of the savings by segment. Is it going to be pretty evenly divided across the three major segments, or will it have an outsized impact on one or the other?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Mike, here's what I would say. It's too early to go into that much detail. We have very specific, but we're going to have to go make a few calls in terms of which projects we do first. So it's certainly not going to be falling evenly across all three every quarter simply because that's not how the projects work. With that said, I think by year end we'll be able to give you more insight as to what we expect when across the segments.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right, and then a question on the margin improvement that you saw in the Energy business. You talked about the positive mix that you saw of products there. Are you introducing new products, or are you taking actions to shift customers toward higher margin products? I'm just trying to understand what exactly is going on there and how sustainable those mix changes could be.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, well, we're doing both. One, we held back a number of our new technologies during the downturn because we knew we could never price appropriately for them. And if you go out too low of a price, you'll never recover. And so some of those are being introduced now. If you will, you can have a heavy up portfolio in the near term, but there's a lot of mix change going on in that industry.","I would also say what you're starting to see is customers turning back on the technologies they turned off like anti-corrosion technologies in a number of the fields. When they were basically trying to conserve every dollar so that they could survive to the next quarter, they're not really worried about corrosion, which may eat a hole in the pipe in three years. So they are worried about it now because they know they've got a much more stable environment. So a lot of these technologies they're turning back on. These are higher-margin technologies for us. And you start seeing, if you will, more sales per site, which obviously is always highly accretive. So it's a number of those factors. I would expect that we will see continued margin recovery over the next few years, which is why I mentioned we would expect to be back in mid-teens by 2020.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli. Please go ahead with your questions.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for going past the hour. Doug, you emphasized the focus on digital technology. Does that mean that you are no longer increasing by the same 2% to 3% annually the size of your sales force? And linked to that, is the growth we are seeing coming from market growth or by the fact that you have more feet on the ground, or are they becoming less important given the technology issues and other issues that progress?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, well, we have different parts of our sales team. We've been certainly adding even at a faster rate than 2% to 3% to our corporate account team. They are full-time sales professionals who are focusing on the largest opportunities around the world. And so that's been a steadily \u2013 we've been investing in that arena steadily for the last few years and a lot faster than 2% to 3%. So that's going to continue to be an important part of our strategy.","Field service capability is going to be vital. I would say what we've learned with the digital capability is we are getting enhanced visibility. One of our great attributes and winning propositions is not only can we identify challenges before they become problems, but we can fix them because we've got the field team to get into restaurants, food plants, hospitals, hotels, et cetera, to actually make a change and change what might be an alarming trend or a concerning trend before it turns into a real challenge. And so that capability is going to become, I would say, more important.","How that manifests itself down the road, I think two things. I think we are going to be able to continue to increase our team's ability to handle more business. We'll do it by continuing to offload admin work, other work, make setup easy, make ordering easy, even do automatic ordering, do all this work that today takes their time and free up time to solve problems for customers and identify opportunities. That's the job.","And how that shows up in terms of head count I think really depends on how successful we are using the increased capacity that we're creating for sales. If it shows up as increased sales, we're going to love adding people at the same rate. If it doesn't, then we'll harvest it as margin.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay, that's very helpful. And then I was wondering if you could talk about pest elimination. We have turned the corner. It is now growing in line with expectation organically. Any potential acquisitions, are there opportunities out there and at a reasonable multiple?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","As you might expect, we are very active looking at potential acquisitions all the time. And we're finding a number of them and we're closing on them. They all seem though to be on the smaller to medium size. Part of that is just valuation today. Valuations for a number of these businesses is high. And if they're relatively small, a high valuation doesn't really get in the way of generating return because we have such a large footprint, we could leverage the technology or whatever they do over our large footprint and more than compensate for maybe a high multiple. If it's a large business, that opportunity doesn't exist in the same way. And if you pay a lot of money for a large business, it's often very hard to generate reasonable returns for your shareholders over a period of time, and we're quite cautious about doing anything in that area.","And I would say the landscape is rich of M&A opportunities. We don't need to buy anything to make ourselves competitive to grow the business, I even think to hit 15%. So we're going to do it opportunistically and do it when makes a heck of a lot of sense for our shareholder.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","All right, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Michael Monahan","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's second quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO. A copy of our earnings release and the accompanying slides referenced in this teleconference are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor.","Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on Slide 12 -- or Slide 2, stating that this teleconference and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under Item 1A, Risk Factors, and our second quarter earnings release and on Slide 2. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Also, please note that in order to provide a meaningful comparison of our results of operations where applicable, actual results for the second quarter of 2012 are compared against pro forma results for the second quarter of 2011. The pro forma results are based on the historical consolidated financial statements of Ecolab and Nalco and were prepared to illustrate the benefits or the effects of our merger with Nalco. Those -- these pro forma statements are available on our website at ecolab.com\/investor, as well as our Form 8-K filed April 27, 2012, and selected portions are contained in our slides and press release.","Starting with an overview on Slide 3. We delivered strong results at the top end of our earnings forecast in the second quarter despite currency and economic headwinds. We leveraged our sales and volume growth, pricing, as well as our synergy and cost efficiency work to offset significantly higher delivered product cost and produced yet another strong double-digit increase in our adjusted earnings per share.","Looking ahead, we expect to continue to outperform our markets and show good earnings gains in the third quarter and for the full year as solid sales growth, appropriate pricing, innovation, synergies and margin leverage more than offset expected moderating increases in delivered product costs, as well as offset the impact of higher depreciation and amortization charges from the merger. Further, we expect 2012 will be our 10th year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth in the last 11, and we will do so while setting up strong growth for the years ahead.","Moving to some highlights from the quarter and as discussed in our press release. Reported second quarter earnings per share were $0.62. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, second quarter 2012 earnings per share increased 13% to $0.72. The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by volume and pricing gains, new products and new accounts, which along with synergies and cost savings actions, more than offset higher delivered product costs.","We enjoyed very strong sales growth in our Global Energy and Latin American operations, as well as solid growth from Kay and Healthcare. We continue to be aggressive, focusing on top line growth. We are emphasizing our innovative product and service strengths to help customers get better results at lower cost and, through these, drive increased market share in our core businesses, as well as new account acquisition across all of our customer segments. We also continue to implement appropriate price increases to help offset higher delivered product costs. We remain focused on expanding our margins, emphasizing productivity and efficiency improvements to help increase profitability, as well as drive merger synergies. We also continue to make investments in key growth businesses, as well as bolt-on acquisitions to build future growth. Our work to integrate Ecolab and Nalco is going very well, and we are delivering on our cost and growth synergies. We continue to be focused on growing our business and excited by the opportunities the combined company offers our customers, as well as our position as the leader in additional high-growth markets that leverage our mutual core strengths in product technology and sales and service execution.","While economic trends and currencies present increasing challenges, we continue to look for the second half to show solid sales growth and further margin improvement. This strong business performance will continue to be impacted by the much higher depreciation and amortization expense from our merger. Third quarter adjusted EPS is expected to increase 11% to 16% to the $0.83 to $0.87 range and compare with adjusted EPS of $0.75 earned by legacy Ecolab in the third quarter 2011 as business growth, the increasing benefits from synergies and cost reductions and seasonally higher revenues more than offset the higher fixed depreciation and amortization interest expense from the merger. We narrowed our forecast range for 2012, recognizing exchange has cost us $0.05 per share since the last forecast while our efforts to gain share and improve efficiency will be used to offset weakening economies. We expect full year 2012 earnings per share to rise 16% to 19%, the $2.95 to $3.02 range.","In summary, we expect 2012 to reflect another strong performance by Ecolab as we show accelerating quarterly earnings gains to once again deliver very attractive growth and shareholder returns this year and set the stage for improved results in the years ahead.","Slide 4 shows our second quarter results, both as reported and pro forma, with adjustments for special gains and charges, while Slide 5 shows our sales growth detail. Ecolab's reported consolidated sales for the second quarter increased 74%. When compared with second quarter 2011 pro forma sales, which include the impact of Nalco in both years, fixed currency sales rose a strong 6%. Looking at the pro forma fixed currency growth component, volume and mix increased 3%, pricing rose 2%, acquisitions and divestitures did not have a significant impact, and currency decreased sales by 3%. Rounding accounts for the difference in the total.","Reported sales for the U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing operations rose 1%. Adjusted for the transfer of the water treatment related businesses to the Global Water segment, U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing sales increased 5%. Institutional sales grew 3% in the second quarter. Sales initiatives targeting new accounts and effective product and service programs continue to lead our results and outperform mixed end markets. As expected and mentioned in our May teleconference, second quarter sales growth moderated from the first quarter rate, reflecting the impact of an inventory build by distributors in the first quarter, as well as by comparison to the rollout of new products and programs in the year ago second quarter period. Total shipments, meaning direct plus distributor shipments to our end use customers which we closely track, showed a consistent trend as in the first quarter, growing around 5%. Looking at our end markets, lodging room demand continued to show steady gains, while foodservice foot traffic remained soft. To drive our growth and improve on our industry leadership, we're introducing more new products that deliver increased value and reduced labor, water and energy costs for our customers in our warewashing, laundry and housekeeping markets. We launched our next-generation warewashing platform called Apex2 and showcased a number of other innovations at the National Restaurant Show in May. We also continue to increase our customer focus and service intimacy through sales force investment, simplified structures, marketing initiatives and improved field technology.","Institutional continued to show very good fundamental trends and share gains. We expect Institutional to continue to deliver solid growth over the balance of the year and once again outperform its markets in 2012.","Kay's second quarter sales increased 10%. Quick service sales enjoyed strong growth in the quarter from both large and small customers. The food retail business grew double digits, benefiting from several new customer additions. We look for continued good sales growth in the third quarter and another strong performance for Kay in 2012.","Healthcare sales increased 7% as good growth from hand hygiene, environmental hygiene and surgical drapes were offset by continuing soft U.S. health care industry market trends. We continue to see steady new account gains from our product innovation and investments in new sales productivity tools. Looking ahead, third quarter sales are expected to show solid growth.","Food & Beverage sales grew 6%. Sales increased in all segments led by corporate account wins, pricing and product penetration. Food & Beverage will continue to focus on new account acquisition, pricing and new product sales though we expect third quarter sales growth to moderate due to slower industry trends and the annualization of recent customer wins.","Sales for U.S. Other Services rose 4% in the second quarter. Pest Elimination sales continued to show good trends, rising 4%. Growth was led by stronger gains in food processing and hospitality, improved results in foodservice segments and robust growth in add-on service sales. We continue to drive new product and program solutions to better meet our customer needs and differentiate our offerings. Recent new program launches, like the Expanded Large Fly Program and a new HotelProtect program with bedbug assurance offering are showing good initial results. We expect our new products and programs, along with aggressive selling and improved service levels, to yield continued sales gains in 2012.","Sales for GCS increased 4% in the quarter, and profitability improved once again against the year ago period. New account wins and appropriate pricing helped to drive strong growth in service revenues, which were partially offset by soft part sales. We are seeing good results from chain account relationships as we drive sales through their regional and franchise organizations. We expect GCS to show stronger sales growth and continued profit improvement in the third quarter.","Measured in fixed currencies, sales for International Cleaning, Sanitizing and Other Services increased 3%. Adjusted for the transfer of water treatment to the Global Water segment, fixed currency sales increased 5%.","Europe, Middle East and Africa fixed currency sales rose 2% in the second quarter. Europe's institutional second quarter sales were flat versus last year. New business gains among regional and local customers leveraged new products but were offset by weak demand primarily in the Mediterranean and Ireland. Food & Beverage sales rose modestly over last year, reflecting market share gains, a focus on corporate accounts and an emphasis on the cost savings benefits of our innovative products, which work to offset slower customer volumes. Textile Care sales declined in the second quarter, reflecting very weak end markets. We're using new products and technology, like lower temperature washing, to offset these market trends. Reported Healthcare sales in Europe was strong, reflecting the Esoform acquisition. Excluding the acquisition, Healthcare sales showed good organic gains. Pest in Europe sales showed good progress, reflecting a continued focus on corporate accounts, new programs and continued operational improvements. Our work to improve operating efficiency in our Europe business continues to show good progress. We're on track to deliver more than 200 basis points of structural margin improvement in 2012 though the weak economic environment and raw material increases in Europe will offset about half of those gains and operating income. We continue to expect to improve margins to the lower teens in Europe over the coming years though the current turmoil there is slowing the pace of our progress. Looking ahead, we expect Europe's third quarter to show continued modest fixed currency sales growth with good profit improvement as it outperforms the weak European business environment.","Asia Pacific sales grew 5% in fixed currencies on a pro forma basis as sales recovery in Japan helped to offset moderate growth in China. Institutional sales showed good growth. New programs and a focus on restaurant and lodging expansion in the emerging Asian markets, along with a recovery in Japan from last year's devastating tsunami, benefited sales. Food & Beverage sales also performed well. New account gains and recovering sales in mature markets led the increase. Looking ahead, Asia Pacific expects continued good growth in the third quarter.","Second quarter sales for Ecolab's Canadian operations increased 6% at fixed currency rates. Strong growth in core businesses drove the solid results.","Latin America reported continued strong fixed currency sales gains up 20%. Adjusted for the Brazil Pest and Institutional acquisitions, Latin America grew 14% in fixed currencies as Institutional, Food & Beverage and Pest Elimination continue to grow at double-digit rates. Institutional growth was driven by continued success with global and regional customers and new growth opportunities in Brazil. Food & Beverage sales reflect continued strong demand in the beverage and brewing markets, as well as the benefits of new accounts and investments in key sales areas. Pest Elimination continued to deliver double-digit gains. Looking ahead, Latin America expects continued double-digit growth in the third quarter.","Fixed currency water sales increased 1% in the second quarter compared with 2011 pro forma results. Both periods include certain water treatment-related sales transferred from the U.S. and international segments. In addition, 2012 compared with the year ago period when sales grew a very strong 12%. Second quarter 2012 saw a good growth in food and beverage, power, manufacturing and mining. These were offset by lower sales in wastewater, where we compared against a large onetime sale last year, and in heavy industry including primary metals where destocking, especially in Asia, hurt results. Regionally, we saw a strong growth in Latin America and a modest increase in North America and Asia. These are partially offset by lower sales in Europe, reflecting the weak economic conditions in that region. We expect sales growth to improve in the third quarter, led by North America and Latin America, as new account wins resulting from our differentiated technologies and appropriate pricing more than offset lower volume gains, lower volume trends at existing customers.","Global Paper also compared against a strong period last year. Second quarter 2012 fixed currency global sales for paper declined 2%, compared with a very strong 11% increase in the year ago period. Growth in Latin America and EMEA was more than offset by sales declines in North America and Asia Pacific. Lower customer plant utilization rates, especially in Asia Pacific packaging, and a strategic elimination of certain low-margin business in North America more than offset the use of innovative technology to drive sales. Excluding the elimination of that low-margin business, paper sales would have grown slightly. We expect third quarter paper sales to be flat as the paper market stabilizes.","Measured in fixed currencies, pro forma Global Energy sales grew an outstanding 19%, reflecting continued strong volume growth in upstream and market share gains in downstream. Very strong double-digit growth in our upstream business was the result of robust markets, share gains and continued focus on higher growth energy sources. We saw a strong growth with deepwater accounts, as well as continued strong sales to oil sands, the Middle East and Africa. High-single digit growth in our downstream business reflected share gains in the Middle East and Asia. We expect the energy segment to grow -- to remain very strong in the third quarter as continued strength in the conventional offshore businesses and upper-single digit growth in downstream largely offsets the temporary impact of unconventional drilling shifting its focus and drilling assets to oil and away from natural gas.","Slide 6 of our presentation shows selected income statement items, comparing reported 2012 with pro forma 2011 information to allow more meaningful comparisons. Reported second quarter gross margins were 45.6%. Adjusted for the impact of special charges, 2012 adjusted gross margins were 45.7%. When compared with second quarter 2011 adjusted pro forma results, 2012 gross margins decreased 20 basis points. The decrease in the adjusted gross margin primarily reflected the impact of the business mix impact of higher energy sales and exchange, which more than offset volume and pricing gains from a gross margin perspective. In absolute dollar terms, pricing once again exceeded a higher delivered product cost in the second quarter, and we expect third quarter gross margins to exceed prior year levels.","Reported SG&A expenses represents 33.2% of sales. When compared with 2011 pro forma results, 2012 SG&A expenses declined 140 basis points. Leverage from the sales gains and cost savings efforts, including merger synergies and Europe restructuring savings, led the improvement.","Reported operating income for Ecolab's U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing segment rose 19%. Adjusted for the transfer of water treatment to the Global Water segment, operating income increased 17% compared with second quarter 2011 pro forma operating income. Volume and pricing gains and cost innovation more than offset higher delivered product costs in the quarter.","Operating income for U.S. Other Services increased 16%, benefiting from sales leverage and improved efficiency. International fixed currency operating income increased 19% versus last year. Adjusted for the transfer of water treatment to the Global Water segment, operating income increased 21%, with EMEA operating income up 33%. Margins improved as volume and pricing gains, our European margin transformation efforts and improved cost efficiencies more than offset higher delivered product costs.","Global Water operating income grew 5% in fixed currencies compared to pro forma results. Pricing more than offset higher delivered product costs. Excluding a large project sale in last year's second quarter, profits would have risen 8%.","Global Paper operating income declined 9% in fixed currencies as pricing was more than offset by lower volume and the higher delivered product and other costs.","Global Energy operating income grew 18% in fixed currencies led by the strong volume gain, operating leverage and pricing, which offset higher delivered product costs, investments in the business and product mix.","The Corporate segment and tax rate are discussed in the press release. We repurchased 1.3 million shares during the second quarter. The net of this performance is that Ecolab's reported second quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.62 compared with $0.53 reported a year ago. When adjusted for special gains and charges and discrete tax items in both years, adjusted earnings increased 13% to $0.72 when compared with $0.64 earned a year ago.","Turning to Slide 7. Ecolab's balance sheet reflected the impact of the Nalco merger. Total debt to total capital was 53% at June 30, compared with 32% reported a year ago. Our net debt was 51%.","Looking ahead and as outlined in Slide 8, we continue to take aggressive actions to drive both our top and bottom lines, expanding our market share and customer penetration as one company among major accounts, leveraging our leadership positions in key growth markets in food, water, energy and healthcare. We are using innovation and pricing to benefit margins and expect to more than offset delivered product cost through 2012. Our merger synergies, along with Europe's transformation work, continues to go well and meet or exceed expectations. And we expect to deliver on these aggressive goals while building growth for the future. As also described in our press release, we look for our third quarter results to show mid-single digit sales gains led by Global Energy and our Latin America operations. This solid business performance will again be impacted by the much higher depreciation and amortization and interest expense, as well as increased share count from our merger. Adjusted third quarter diluted earnings per share are forecast to increase 11% to 16% to the $0.83 to $0.87 range compared with the adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 earned last year. We expect the benefits of growth from the underlying business, seasonally higher revenues and moderating impact from delivered product costs and increasing synergies and cost reductions to more than offset the weakening global economies, unfavorable currency and higher fixed depreciation, amortization, interest expense and shares from the merger. As a result, we continue to look for 2012 full year adjusted EPS to increase 16% to 19% to the $2.95 to $3.02 range.","In summary, we once again delivered on our forecast in the second quarter while offsetting higher than expected delivered product cost in the weakening economy while still investing in our future. We look for sales and profit growth to accelerate through 2012 second half to produce another strong year and make it our 10th year of adjusted double-digit EPS growth out of the last 11 years.","And now here's Doug Baker with his comments.","Douglas M. Baker","Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon. Well, I just want to offer a couple of thoughts and also talk a little bit about the pattern in the second half.","So overall, I feel very good about the progress we've made as a company and the position that we're in. The integration work that we've undertaken has gone quite well. Our cost synergies are tracking above plan. We're already seeing effective transfer of technology from business-to-business, and it's already making an impact in our ability to serve customers. Growth synergies are ahead of target, and our people are onboard. The integration also, while it's going quite well, is not getting in the way of growth. So our underlying business continues to move ahead.","Our second quarter new business results and corporate accounts were again ahead of last year by double digit. So the first half corporate account new business gains are up over 25% versus last year. That is a huge metric for us and very important. New product launches, one of the key drivers for gross margin recovery and expansion, are also on target this year. And our Europe renaissance project, the restructuring project, is delivering improved margins, as Mike outlined. So the legacy Ecolab EMEA sales are up 2.5%, OI was up 34%, 120 basis point improvement versus second quarter last year. So we are on track for 100-plus basis point improvement for the full year. As a result, we remain on our path to deliver very, very good EPS growth for the year. Forecast indicates 16% to 19% growth for the year. And importantly, we will exit the year with real momentum.","The last point I'd like to touch on is the pattern of our EPS growth in the second half, which is different than our pre-merger pattern. Specifically, Q3 was typically a larger absolute EPS quarter than the fourth. And this year, post merger, we are forecasting a $0.06 to $0.07 higher Q4 than Q3. So what drives this is the following: First, our seasonality as a combined entity has changed particularly between Q3 and Q4. So while it used to be lower in Q4, now Q3 and Q4 in a typical year are going to generate roughly equivalent absolute EPS earnings. So the base is changed when you look at the quarters sequentially. Number two, we anticipate a significant and continued ramp-up in quarter-to-quarter synergy savings and renaissance restructure savings in Europe. In total, these will be $0.05 or even better, higher if you will, in Q4 versus Q3. And finally, we also get roughly a $0.01 boost in tax in Q4 versus Q3 this year due to the U.S. R&D tax credit, which, since it hasn't passed, all falls in Q4 versus in typical years when we smooth it out over 4 quarters.","So importantly, our expectations around our sales, pricing and raws are very consistent with current trends, meaning there is no expected hockey stick ramp-up in either markets or underlying performance trends in our business. Net, we think we have a very good handle on the forecast and on the business. Our expectation this year is for a very good performance for the full year, 16% to 19%. Importantly, it's accelerating double-digit EPS growth every quarter, all driven by excellent integration work, outside synergies and continued excellent underlying business performance, driven by great new business gains. Most importantly, not only does this set up for a very good year in '12 but means we are building momentum leaving the year, which bodes well for 2013 as well.","So with that as an opening, let me now open it up for questions. And so I turn it back to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just on the same track, energy, how do you expect the back half of the year to look versus the first half of the year on an EBIT basis?","Douglas M. Baker","For energy specifically?","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, for energy.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I think our call was pretty much as it was at the end of Q1, which is our expected rest of the year performance at that time and this, is high teens sales growth and I would say improved EBIT margin. If you look at Q1 and Q2 EBIT margins in energy, they look like they're different. If you really understand some one-timers between the 2 of them, they're very smooth and around 15% for those 2 quarters. We expect that they will be greater than 15% in the back half.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Excellent. And just on the $0.05 increase in synergies Q4 versus Q3, can you provide some more detail on what's driving that $0.05?","Douglas M. Baker","It's a whole host of initiatives, David, but it's getting down to fundamentals around indirect procurement savings, a number of which are contracts which we've been renegotiating or just going into place mid third quarter. So they haven't delivered any savings year-to-date. We'll get full quarter savings for these in Q4. We have continued reductions in G&A and in headcount around the world, particularly in corporate and G&A overlap positions. So those are more fully realized in Q4 than they are. We're closing offices around the world, which are taking place mid to late Q3. So you're going to see full impact of those in Q4. And I can go on, on another list of initiatives then you get into the restructure programs in Europe. There have been a number of things that have been in the works for 18 months, which are coming onboard in Q4. We'll start delivering savings there as well. So a lot of this is just natural timing, and they're quite consistent with what we said at the beginning of the year that we wanted the majority of this work done the first year, which really means that it's going to be back half weighted.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just lastly, would you expect the price versus the materials gap to increase in the back half of the year as raws come off?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I think, always, we had anticipated -- first of all, the base gets easier in a sense because last year, the raws really increased, ramped up in the second half. And we've had consistently, I think, pretty good performance on pricing. So as we just mentioned in Q2, pricing overtook raws. In Q3 and Q4, we're going to have a greater gap as we move on.","Operator","The next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Doug, just to follow up on that last question a little bit. Obviously, we've all seen the decrease in fuel and I know that the raws don't necessarily always 100% follow that. But could you talk to us about the direction there in terms of whether you are seeing some sequential relief? And as you said then, as you put forward their pricing, we should see, as you mentioned, an even greater gap there?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I mean, I think we have said -- I mean, no doubt that we are going to have improved gross profit year-on-year in the second half. It's going to be much greater than we saw in the first half, right? We were behind in Q1. We're about even in Q2. Q2 with a gross profit issue was really a mix issue. And we will have improved, and you'll see daylight in 3 and 4. Certainly, some of that is continued pricing. And then also, raws have abated. So our forecast for raws has come down from Q1, where we looked at the year to be quite over our plan to more in line with our plan quite frankly, but it has lowered over the course of the year.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, and then just kind of a follow-up to that, Doug, I mean, whether it's correctly perceived or not. And I know that during like kind of the roadshows and in terms of the acquisition with Nalco that you did the kind of chart where the earnings with Ecolab and Nalco were actually pretty close in terms of volatility. So it might be a little bit of a misperception. But I was wondering, like in terms of the raw material impact and volatility, do you feel like you have your hands around that now a little bit better on the Nalco side than maybe they did before?","Douglas M. Baker","I don't know. I guess we are comfortable we have good visibility and understand what's driving the ultimate business performance. And certainly, our understanding of the energy and WPS business is expanding as time goes on, but I think we're comfortable that we've got a handle on how raws impact that business. It's not dramatically different how we see raws impact our business either in size of impact, timing of impact, how long it takes any of these businesses to recover, big raw moves in terms of pricing activity. I think the story we've told historically is Year 1, we recover absolute dollar impact. Year 2, we recover margin. And I think that formula works quite nicely as you start thinking about WPS and ES [ph] as well. And I think that's what's played out. They have executed in both energy and water and paper quite well in terms of pricing to recover the raws. And so you've got some abatement on the raw materials on that side. I think we've got a handle on what that means and how it impacts the business. Certainly, that's going to bode well, and that's in our forecast for Q3 and Q4. But we had some $60 million in negative raw year-on-year in the first half, and it's going to be modestly positive, i.e. we'll pay less for raws in the second half than we did a year ago. So that's in the forecast, and I think we've got a good handle on it.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then just one last quick one on the sales side, just in terms of what you're seeing in Europe. Obviously, you have a pretty high recurring revenue stream and I know the majority of the mix is to countries that are still doing okay. But can you talk a little bit in terms of what you're seeing there in terms of just trends and any significant deceleration?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I mean, actually, we had modest -- I guess Q2 hung in there quite well. Our anticipation is we are going to hang in there in Q3 and Q4. I think we've got good reason to believe that. I think the pain is where you would expect it, that you go down to Italy, Greece and Spain, and we have negative year-on-year sales growth in those markets. And it is fully offset by growth, albeit modest growth in the balance of Europe. I think we're somewhat favorably disposed given that our big weight is in Germany, France and some other countries which aren't in great shape, but they're not nearly as adversely impacted by the crisis as, say, Greece, Italy or Spain, where we have relatively smaller shares.","Operator","The next question comes from John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. First of all, on the business that was transferred out of Institutional into, I guess, the Nalco businesses, the water piece, was that about $35 million? And on that, can you walk us through what the margin impact would have been to either help or hurt Institutional and the water businesses?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, the business came out. It was our water business. It was in U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing, and some of it was in our AP reporting to a business in Australia. It wouldn't impact in Institutional at all. It was moving out of -- it didn't have any impact there. I would say in total, as we look at it, it had a modestly negative impact on Nalco in Q2 because there is a big onetime sale in Q2 last year in that business. So the WPS business results would have been modestly better without it if you exclude it like a point higher in sales and a couple points in OI.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the -- with regard to some of your businesses, whether it's F&B or some of the Nalco businesses, is the drought having any impact on those businesses either positively or negatively at this point that you can tell?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, it wouldn't -- not yet. We've been through many of these cycles in the past. This clearly is going to increase feedstock. It will ultimately increase protein prices, then we will have the typical switching among protein sources. We're fairly well represented across protein segments, but I don't think this is going to make our future conference calls -- I don't think it's going to be worthy of a mention. We'll just probably move through the cycle. It's a bigger impact on other people.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question. With regard to Europe and the margin improvement, it sounds like it's going to be coming in maybe a little bit lighter, which I guess is a little bit surprising given that you're still seeing growth there. So I guess what are some of the things that are really holding back the potential for margin improvement there this year?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I think, John, what I would say is what we signaled -- or I worked hard to signal into the first quarter was that we would not see 200 basis points this year of margin improvement mostly because the underlying market isn't as healthy as we anticipated. But with that said, we expected 100-plus basis point improvement. I would say we still believe that's the right forecast one more quarter into the year. And I think the fact that we had a very strong performance in Q2 indicates that, that forecast is pretty good. The real change, if you will, from 18 months ago when we first gave it is, obviously, we anticipated modestly better underlying economic conditions in Europe than we're seeing now. I think we're performing quite well given the European conditions. I mean, OI is going to improve dramatically this year. We're going to make more money in Europe in spite of the economic crisis. We're offsetting this. We're doing a good job on new business gains, getting pricing, doing a bunch of stuff that I think bodes well for not only this year but for next.","Operator","The next question comes from Ed Yang with Oppenheimer.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Doug, just following up on the European renaissance again, you're looking for 2% margin expansion this year, now 1% with the economy. How confident are you that the 1% will hold? Or what would -- how much would growth have to slow further or deteriorate to see that change? And the outlook for 2013, I believe you were looking for, long term, another 100 basis points per year going out. Does the slow growth this year entail that you have to trim those out of your expectations as well?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. So look, I'm confident we're going to do 100-plus basis points this year. I think we're on track. Certainly, it's sensitive to sales. So sales fell off or occurred differently than we are forecasting, but we're not expecting a big ramp-up by any stretch. That would be negatively impacted. I think though, we've got a good handle on sales expectations. So we feel good about the forecast for the year. In terms of outlook for '13 and '14, we would expect to continue to increase margin performance. We expect to have our highest margin in Q4 this year, which gives us very good momentum going into next year, leaving the year. So, yes, at least 100-plus again next year would be our expectation, and I think that's probably what we'll be forecasting when we get down to it.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on the energy side of the business, you spoke about the margin comparisons between the first and second quarter and it sounded like there were some one-offs as well, but did you see any -- I expected somewhat of a bigger boost from raw material relief, for propylene relief in the second quarter. Did that help -- was that helpful at all in the second quarter for energy?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, it doesn't flow through immediately, right? Usually you've got inventory and other stuff you've got to get through. And of course, that convention is different by different geographies. Certainly, it was welcome news. And as I -- I think the best thing to hang your hat on is we feel good about the margin progression. And if we look at any more normalized time period, the second half could be better margin than the first half on -- I would call it very good growth, high teens growth in the third and fourth quarter. But that business, we feel, is quite healthy.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe a question for Mike. How much revenue was eliminated in the paper business?","Michael Monahan","It's about $5 million.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And are there any other businesses as you've gone through with the integration that make sense to take another look at as well?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I'd say we're kind of constantly purging. One of the things we like our businesses to look at is, we won't use the word we use, their worst 10 contracts and maybe the worst performing parts of their business, and just make sure we have a handle on -- things change when we do these contracts. We want to stay up on them. There are still contracts out there that we don't love, that we are on and after not only in, say, the W, the paper business or the water business, but some of the businesses, the legacy Ecolab businesses, too.","Operator","The next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You've talked a lot about the risk to Europe and how you're doing there, but can you just give a comment on the legacy Nalco businesses in Europe? I know those sell off quite substantially in 2009. Are you seeing pressure there? Are they doing about what you expected? How should we think they'll trend in the back half?","Douglas M. Baker","We're trying to get a sheet to pull out because it's got a breakout by even specific region. All in all, the WPS business for total Europe is performing. I would say it's in the 3% range, and the energy is in 30% range. Total, if you combine all of our businesses, Europe growth would step up to the 4% range. So they're growing at a faster rate and have better margin than the legacy Ecolab business. One of the reasons we have the whole renaissance restructure was that we were not satisfied with the legacy Ecolab business margin performance and wanted to move that into the double-digit range, which is why all the conversation around it. I would basically say in terms of how we view Europe, it certainly isn't going to be a bright spot in terms of sales performance for us. We believe it will continue to grow. We do believe it's going to be a fairly bright spot in terms of operating income performance as we continue to drive margin in spite of all the bad news coming out of Europe. So the fact that we started this restructure 18 months ago is frankly quite good news for us because it's enabling us to manage through a tough situation in a pretty effective way.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then I wonder, are you still planning to do the billion dollars of buybacks that you mentioned at the time you announced the Nalco deal or shortly thereafter. I think you did $0.5 billion in Q4, but it seems like first half of this year, you're well below the pace to do that second $0.5 billion.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, we're actually almost 3\/4 of the way through the buyback. If anything, we feel like we've made very good progress there. We did put it on what I'll call a hiatus as a result of the European crisis noise just to make sure we understand how the financial system is or isn't impacted as we go through that, because we've made such significant progress in a pretty short order.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, and then I guess just a last one. What about the growth outlook in Asia? I know China is still fairly small, but things seem to be decelerating there and some other places. Are you still confident that, that business is positioned to get solid growth in the back half of the year?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I would say in total, in Asia, yes, we think we will be building momentum as we exit the year going this year. And China is probably one of the major stories there. And our China business, not surprisingly, like everybody else's, has slowed as the year's gone on -- slowed down. And we do expect to start seeing sequential improvement in Q3 and Q4 as we exit the year in China, which has a fairly significant impact on the overall Asia business.","Operator","The next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","A couple of my questions have been answered, but I still want to get back and talk about the European business. You've talked about Europe profits, I think you made a comment, were up north of 30% year-over-year in operating income but the overall international operations were only up about 16%. So was this a currency headwind that we're seeing here or the profitability of some other operations in Europe declined to offset the international piece?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, so around the international reporting segment for Ecolab?","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Right. So my question is your overall international cleaning and sanitizing operating income was up about 16% if my calcs are correct. And I think you mentioned in your comments that European profits in dollars, your operating income, was up north of 30%. So since this is the biggest part of international, I'm just wondering where the offset is. Is it foreign exchange or did profitability deteriorate in some other geographies?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. We're talking -- typically, when we're giving, say, the European 34% number, that's in fixed currency. And so you got it right. In fixed currency, we had very good performance across our international operating segments. And that report out is legacy Ecolab international operations. And it's -- then currency is the major, right, negative as you go through this on a reported basis.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","So currency was negative 2% for international operations for Ecolab legacy?","Michael Monahan","What's that, Dmitry? It didn't come through.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Was currency a negative 2% contributor to top line in international operations for the legacy Ecolab business?","Michael Monahan","Well, it's 3% total for consolidated Ecolab, and so international is about half of that, so it's been bigger impact on international.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, I'll have to get back to you on that offline then.","Michael Monahan","We'll get you the numbers from the public to the fixed because as you know, we always report and manage to a fixed currency. So I'll have to check on what the public dollar was.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Right. No problem. Can you talk a little bit about the GCS business progression in terms of profitability? I know you lost a little bit of money in the first quarter of this year. Had that -- was that business slightly profitable or still losing money in the second quarter?","Douglas M. Baker","Second quarter -- we lost about $0.5 million in the second quarter. We anticipate that we will more than recover Q1, Q2 losses and make money for the year Q3, Q4.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, very good. And then was there an acquisition component in your Healthcare reported results up 7%? Or is that -- have all the acquisitions in Healthcare anniversary-ied by now?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, they've anniversary-ied in the second quarter in the U.S. There was an acquisition in the European Healthcare, which we called out, which was Esoform, but not in the U.S. number.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","And what was the contribution of that in the quarter if you just look at the European business?","Michael Monahan","It was a few million dollars, Dmitry. I can get you the number after the call.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","About 1% or so, nothing super major. Okay, and then final question, just to get back on the European margin growth story. You talked about 200 basis points-plus in conversations that we've had. The issue of growth in Europe was supposed to be impactful of the magnitude of the plus but not necessarily the 200 basis points initially, which were just cost removals, if I remember correctly. Now you're talking about offsets because of slower economy and yet you are growing in Europe. So your business is not seeing volume declines. Can you sort of reconcile your progression and your thinking about profit improvement in Europe 12 months ago versus today?","Douglas M. Baker","Dmitry, I think consistent with the conversation we had at the end of the first quarter that -- or even when we announced the restructure program in Europe, we basically said, \"Look, it's predicated on modest growth, not a huge ramp-up in growth, but modest growth. And the other underlying assumption was probably a fairly favorable raw material environment.\" What we've -- and so with that underlying assumption, we basically said we would expect to see 200, 200 and 100, 100 and ultimately get to double-digit margins in Europe. What's changed probably since we initially went out in January of 2011 is the fact that one, we had significant ramp-up in raws, which we're now catching up to with pricing. The pricing catch-up is probably a little slower than our normal 1 year 1 year formula I articulated earlier because the economic conditions there are so dire. And growth is a little worse than we anticipated when we announced it. Not terribly worse, but look, it's a combination of those 2 that basically have gotten us to say we still expect to get to double-digit margins but it's probably going to take a year or 2 longer than we initially forecast simply because the ramp-up's going to be a little slower. We are coming off the fact that we think this business ought to be a 12%, 13%-type margin business. And we still believe we see a clear road to get there. It's just a little longer road than we anticipated in January of 2011. So the forecast this year of 100-plus is certainly lighter than the 200 we went out initially. But I think given the environment, I feel the team's doing a very good job offsetting the raws and maintaining some sales momentum in a very difficult environment. So we think we will end up the year much improved in Europe and most importantly, I think, with good momentum going into '13 so we can see continued margin improvement as we go into '13 and '14.","Michael Monahan","And just to be clear, Dmitry, the work that we're doing, the cost takeout, I mean, that is coming along as expected and we're well ahead on that. Simply, the other costs are the issue.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","I understand that. So it sounds like you're being maybe a little bit less proactive on pricing given the soft economic environment. Perhaps, it's costing you a little bit more to get the incremental sales than you thought it would and then plus the raw materials, which, at least for the first half of the year, are comping negatively even though in the second half of the year, we'll keep our fingers crossed that you're going to get a little bit of relief.","Douglas M. Baker","Our pricing has been improving in Europe, but there is no doubt that pricing is a negotiation with a customer. And we've got to make some trade-off decisions based on where people are economically. It is always much more difficult to get pricing in a very difficult economic situation. Certainly, I would consider Europe right now a difficult economic situation. With that said, pricing has been accelerating there for us, but not at the pace that the raws would have dictated in what I will call normal economic times.","Operator","The next question comes from David Ridley-Lane with Merrill Lynch.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On a constant currency basis, did SG&A decline from the first quarter '12? And then in your guidance, do you forecast a similar constant currency decline in the third quarter?","Michael Monahan","We're taking a look.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Certainly, the part that we got to go look at is a variable component to our SG&A, which is commission and some bonus which are based on growth. I would say -- certainly, I can say confidently that the G&A component is coming down sequentially quarter by quarter by quarter as we go through this. There is no variability there. So we're doing a little math on the S part as we go through this. So give us a second to come back.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then any numbers you can put on the Nalco synergy savings in the second quarter as you're progressing towards your run rate target of $250 million a year?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, we had $21.5 million of synergy savings in Q2.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Perfect. And then just a final question, how did the Nalco revenue trend as you went through the quarter?","Douglas M. Baker","I don't have day by day. Here's what I would say. We believe if you want to go -- what's our expected business trend? So we basically already said energy. We expect continued high teen sales growth consistent with what we saw in Q2. We expect the water side of the business to show sequential improvement from 2 to 3 and 3 to 4. And we expect the same on the paper business. So strength and through the year, not weakened.","Operator","The next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions. First, with the acceleration in the synergies, should we be thinking about -- are you pulling forward synergies from 2013? Or should we be thinking of a widening gap over the quarters versus your prior trajectory?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes -- no, most of the -- there aren't a lot of onetime synergies. I mean, I will say we are getting to maximum synergies on a faster path than we originally forecasted when we announced the deal last July. But with that said, I think there is going to still be, as the path unfolds, sizable synergy increase '13 to '12. We raised the number, but we're also working hard to move along this path quickly.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And secondly, can you talk a little bit about what's going on in the free cash flow? I mean, Nalco was usually a fairly robust free cash flow generator. And can you just walk through a little bit what's happening there?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I'd say the free cash flow is in line with what our expectations are. So it referred nicely to the last question you asked. Part is we certainly are spending more and at a slower [ph] rate on our restructure effort, which is one of the reasons that we're forecasting higher numbers than originally stated when we announced the merger and at a faster pace. So that takes more restructure money early. So you've got that coming out. We made a fairly large pension contribution. And then you naturally have working capital expansion. But working capital, if you compare it to Ecolab numbers, right, a year ago simply because we've got a bigger business, the pro forma working capital that we're operating with now is quite consistent with what the business was utilizing last year, if you will, on a pro forma basis. But those are the big moves. We've got share buyback and some of the other things that we've talked about. But mostly, it's going to be pension and the restructure.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And I realize this will be in the Q, but do you have a rough sense for how much is just restructuring so we can back out what normalized free cash flow is looking like?","Michael Monahan","Lawrence, I'd have to get back to you with that number.","Operator","The next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I thought I heard -- Doug, I thought I heard you talk about some outperformance in the growth synergies, and I was wondering if you can talk about that a little bit more, where you're seeing that and what specifically are you pointing to.","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I'll take a shot at myself. Since we had this very ambitious goal of 0 for the year, it wasn't hard to have outperformance. But with that said, I would say we feel very good about the uptake and the real focus initially has been on marrying the water technology and the Food & Beverage opportunity. And so there's work along 2 fronts: One, obviously, selling the existing water technology and also developing, if you will, enhanced capabilities as a result of leveraging the 3D TRASAR technology and applying it in some traditional F&B arenas in the F&B space. And both of those efforts are going quite well. The one I'm most excited about is the latter, the technology marriage, because of what it means long term for the business and our ability to meet customer needs. So we've had very good progress in the quarters. We've already -- we're in the 20 plus million. We expect to be much greater than that. We've got a lot of prospects and think we'll make very good progress here.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Then the top end of the EPS guidance came down by $0.03. Is that all currency? Or is there anything else that's in there? Is there some macro in there? Can you just give us a breakdown?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I guess the simplest math would be we mentioned earlier that currency since last quarter impacted us a negative $0.05 and we took the top down by $0.03, so currency mostly. I mean, there's a lot of moving parts in the business, but currency would have been the outsize impact.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's what I was looking for. And then from a high level, when do you expect to be finished with a lot of the acquisition noise so that this business can really exhibit the free cash flow potential that it has? In other words, are we looking at mid 2013, 2014, when should I think about that?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I would say I think by and large, it will be behind us by the end of '13.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So 2014 should be where we start to see a breakout?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. From a cash flow standpoint, I think we'll have very good EPS results through this integration period. But obviously, cash flow is going to be negatively impacted with restructure expense. And that's really a '12 and '13 impact.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just wanted to get a little bit more clarity on the guidance as well. It looks like the assumption underpinning the share count change from last quarter from this quarter looks like it actually went up a bit. Is that -- by my calculations, that's about 3 more cents that were impacted there. If we've got $0.05 of a change in the FX, maybe $0.03 in the share count, I guess operationally, what are you looking at? What are you seeing in the business which is helping you get back there? What segments in particular do you think are going to help you get there? It sounds like energy is one of them, a little more optimistic there. But is there anything else, operation, is helping you get these offsets?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Well, I would say, one, the share impact is not a couple of pennies. It would be $0.01. That's just given timing of shares and other -- the work that we've already done there. So it's not as dramatic as it might look otherwise. I would say the pluses -- certainly, we've talked. I mentioned raws abated from first quarter in terms of what we forecast for the year to some degree. But then we've got continued improvement in synergies, other cost savings and the underlying business is hanging in there and doing quite well. So I'd say it's a combination of those things that allow us to have confidence in what we're forecasting, which is a very good year.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then just in volumes, it looks like there's a sequential downtick a little bit in the volume side. Can you just talk about -- I mean, you mentioned tough comps in some of the business, but how much of that is tough comps versus macro? If you could just help us get a little bit of color into how the volume's been trending here.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I guess the way -- looking at it over the last -- I've been looking at these numbers for a while. The simple thing, if you're talking about your 9% in Q1 to 6% in Q2, it really breaks down into probably 3 distinct pieces. One certainly is energy growing at 19% versus 29%. That's about a point of growth. That was expected. And we expect energy to continue in the high teens. So that point, if you will, should be kind of built into how we think about the business going forward. The second piece was -- I'll characterize it as somewhat inventory. There was year-on-year comparisons on inventory. And just basically, as the industrial businesses slowed down, there is always inventory takeout first. So they get hit pretty hard and then have a little bit of a recovery. Call that a point. And then there's just, I think, economic slowdown, which is probably worth another point. So 2 of those points are going to be with us. So while we went 9 to 6, I think as we looked at the second half, we think we're 6-plus going through, so better than second quarter, not at first quarter run rate, if that helps.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","You guys have talked in the past about -- or you talked a little bit about Southern Europe being weaker. In the past, Q3 has been very important in terms of the vacation season. Do you have any early read on how that season is shaping up in Southern Europe?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. It's not great, but we don't think it's going to be a material driver in Q3. So I think we've got a good handle on what the expectations are, particularly in Italy, as we go through it. It's not a monster piece of our European business. So I think we're in good shape even with the lousy holiday period in Italy.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","All right. And then within the energy business, you mentioned that mix was something that hurt, I think, both the quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year margin comparison. What's hurting you in mix? And maybe as we look forward, do you see anything that reverses the mix or changes the mix? I'm thinking maybe deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Any thoughts on that?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I would basically say the first half performance of energy in terms of margin, we think, is a very good indicator of how the business performed. I would probably say there is some favorable stuff in the first quarter worth maybe 50 basis points and some unfavorable in the second. And so we think 50 is probably the best proxy for how that business performed in the first half, which was the first half cumulative number. So it wasn't huge swings in either one. It just happens on these 13-week periods, right? Energy's got some big shipments and big deliveries that occur. And so you're going to have some impact in 13-week periods. But all in all, we think that business is fine and moving in the right direction.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And then last question is on the paper business. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics that you're seeing, such that North America was soft in Europe and showing growth? And then maybe just quickly, on Asia, is that mostly packaging that you're seeing contribute to softness there?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, packaging, where we had the softness. Europe somewhat was -- it went into the swamp earlier. And we've been fighting through in Europe a little longer. So I would just say it hit the low point earlier and it's starting to move back, right? I mean, North America, I think you saw the slowdown in this quarter from an industrial output standpoint. And China is fairly clear, too.","Operator","The next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Just following up on the paper business a little bit, I am surprised at your expectations of growth in the second half as both in North America and in Europe, you actually have paper mills shutting down. What are you doing that is not affected by that particular factor?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Rosemarie, some of it was the businesses, I'd say, impacted by destocking, which is somewhat behind us now in these other places. I guess I'd underscore the word modest expectations in terms of growth. So we're using the most liberal definition. We don't expect a big bounce back in paper in Q3, but we expect it to improve, and so be positive in Q3 but quite modestly, flattish to positive, and then better than that in Q4.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And then looking at the share buyback, usually, you actually buy enough to offset the dilution. Based on the number you are giving us, there will be dilution in the third quarter. So have you stopped the buyback program altogether until next year when you have a better picture of the global economy and what you are doing?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes -- no. I don't want -- we don't want to signal that. I think what we have said is once I think the Europe crisis showed its full hand and the fact that we had made such significant progress in a fairly short period of time, we thought discretion called for what I'd call kind of a hiatus period. We haven't put a set timetable when that would end. But certainly, we would like to understand what, if any, financial impact in the financial system we may see as we come through this as we also went and talked about the remaining shares have a somewhat a negative impact if they're not executed this year. But we think it's a manageable impact as we go through. So we think the plan that we have in place is a smart plan for shareholders and for the business.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","By negative impact, are you only talking about the higher number of shares translating into maybe your lower EPS? Or is it another negative impact that you are referring to and that I am missing?","Douglas M. Baker","No, it's that impact. A little higher share count has a little negative impact on EPS. But we think the smart play right now is make sure we understand the situation before we continue to move forward.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay, so not because there would be some kind of a penalty if you don't go through the full program.","Douglas M. Baker","No. There's no penalty.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","And then lastly, if I may, were you disappointed or happily -- or unhappily surprised by some of the Nalco results and, of course, this addresses predictability of the Nalco business, which everyone was worried about at the onset?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I think the only way we're going to ever answer the predictability question is, are we able to continue to forecast successfully and continue to drive earnings growth. I would say we feel like we are positioned to demonstrate that as we move forward. And I think that's going to be the ultimate answer to this question. And I think it's the only fair answer to the question. As we look at the business in total, I would say like the businesses that we've been managing for a long period of time, there are always pluses and minuses in all these businesses. I don't think that we've been \"surprised\" by the Nalco businesses. If there have been surprises, they have been as many positives as anything else. I mean, certainly, energy has been a business we liked very much moving into this and performed quite well. We knew that paper was more cyclical than the other businesses. We knew Nalco in total was slightly more cyclical than Ecolab, but we always said that was a very high bar because we are very uncyclical. And we think this is manageable as we go through. When you take the total weight of the business, we think we would still characterize the total business as certainly manageable in terms of any cyclical nature and feel quite predictable, which is, I think, really what the hallmark of our business was as we work hard to deliver against the forecast we give so that there can be confidence in what we say going forward. We think that's important.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","And lastly, if I may, what is -- can you remind me of the total synergy dollar amount that you're expecting for 2012?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Our original forecast for cost synergies -- and so these would include tax. For cost synergies, our original forecast was $150 million at the time of announcement, July 20, 2011. We, in January, upped that to $250 million on cost synergies. And again, that excludes tax.","Operator","The last question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Doug, when I look at your returns, the -- if you add up all the Nalco operating profit, I think it was up $10 million year-over-year roughly in the quarter. And your synergies were $21 million that you captured. So there's a question there. It seems that in the quarter, all the returns or the 80% of the returns came out of the Ecolab business and that the incremental margins in your U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing were close to 70%, and in your international business, maybe they were close to 40%. So did the synergies in fact come out of the Ecolab side? And did Ecolab capture it? Or why is there such disproportionate operating profit growth on the Ecolab side and so little on the Nalco side given the synergy total?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, well, I would say 2 things: One, allocations and how we allocate dollars. The synergies are going to show up on not only the energy and WPS businesses, but also the Institutional, F&B, Kay, et cetera businesses, the way that we allocate, so that they're not going to flow specifically or only to WPS and to energy as we go through that. So I don't think you can look at it that way and expect that they're only going to be there. With that said, if you look at the energy and WPS businesses together, their first half performance was quite strong. I would say our business was quite strong. And so year-to-date, they're up 16% NOI if you exclude the business that we transferred to them. So the underlying business performance has been very solid there. The synergies were built considerably quarter by quarter. So you take the $20 million run rate at $80 million, it's nowhere near the $250 million that we're forecasting. So we know that's going to get better over time. And you'd also have to look at tax over time, where we've had sizable cash impacts as well as we've already brought down the combined rate to Ecolab's historic rate of around $30 million, right? They were running, at I think, at about $34 million. And so we've already brought that down considerably. So I think you'll see sizable cash benefits as the story unfolds as well.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So if you took your $20 million in synergies or $21.5 million in synergies, how would you allocate them across the divisions in the quarter?","Douglas M. Baker","I don't have the specific allocation here. We're talking 20 businesses in a bunch of countries. But that's how we set up the P&L.","Operator","There are no other questions at this time. I'll turn it over now for closing comments.","Michael Monahan","Well, that's it for us. Thanks, everyone, for your time. And if there's any questions, please give me a call to follow up. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference call. The call has concluded. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time."],"7915":["Ecolab Inc.

At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I\u2019d like to turn over the call to Mr. Michael Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Michael Monahan","Hello everyone. And welcome to Ecolab\u2019s Fourth Quarter Conference Call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab\u2019s Chairman and CEO. A copy of our earnings release and the accompanying slides referenced in this teleconference are available on Ecolab\u2019s website at ecolab.com\/investor.","Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on Slide 2, stating that this teleconference and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in the section of our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q item under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our fourth quarter release and on slide 2. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with an overview on Slide 3, strong new account growth and new product introductions drove a solid sales increase in the fourth quarter. We leveraged that growth along with pricing and our synergy and cost efficiency work to substantially increase our adjusted operating margins and produce a very strong adjusted earnings per share increase.","Looking ahead, we expect to produce another year of superior growth despite 2015's mixed macro-economic and market trends, as well as substantial currency exchange and pension headwinds. Lower oil prices should benefit our consumer related customers and our delivered product costs, while slowing growth in our Energy segment. Net we expect the positives and negative to about offset each other and we look for strong growth from operations before currency effects. We expect currency exchange and pension will represent a headwind of about $0.35 per share in 2015.","In this environment we expect to continue to outperform our end markets and show 5% to 12% adjusted earnings gains in the first quarter and 8% to 12% EPS growth for the full year as continued good fixed currency sales growth, appropriate pricing, innovation synergies and delivered product savings more than offset the challenges.","Moving to some highlights from the fourth quarter, and as discussed on our press release, reported fourth quarter earnings per share were $1.10. On an adjusted basis excluding special gains and charges in discreet tax items from both years, fourth quarter 2014 earnings per share increased a very strong 15% to a record $1.20 despite a $0.04 headwind from currencies. The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by volume and pricing, new products, account gains, synergies, cost savings actions, and the benefit from the passage of the R&D tax credit.","Our fixed currency acquisition adjusted sales growth rate remains strong, rising 6% and was led by our Energy and Specialty businesses. Latin America led the regional growth. We expanded our adjusted fixed currency operating margins 110 basis points in the quarter as we continue to emphasize productivity and efficiency improvements as well as drive merger synergies.","We also continue to make investments in key growth businesses to sustain our technology in sales and service leadership. We remain on plan for achieving our outgoing Champion synergy targets and our Europe margins are on track for further strong expansion again this year.","Looking ahead, energy markets and some regional economies will present challenges in 2015 along with an expected $0.35 per share headwind from currency exchange and pension. However we also see favorable tailwinds for our more consumer facing customers and in our raw materials. In this mixed environment, we will drive new business gains and lower costs as we maximize the benefits and minimize the challenges. We will once again use our product innovation in service strengths to help customers get better results and lower operating cost and through these drive new account gains across all of our customer segments.","Also as announced in our press release, as our balance sheet leverage ratio is returning to our preferred range and with our strong free cash flow, we intend to repurchase $1 billion of our stock. We expect to complete the repurchase by mid-2016.","We look for the first quarter 2015 to show solid fixed currency sales gains and margin improvement. First quarter adjusted EPS is expected to increase 5% to 12% to the $0.78 to $0.83 range and compare with last year's very strong first quarter when adjusted EPS grew 23% and was $0.74 per share. For the full year 2015, we look for an 8% to 12% adjusted EPS increase to the $4.50 to $4.70 range with that wider than normal range reflecting the dynamic currency and commodity markets.","In summary, our fourth quarter performed very well. We expect 2015 to also show strong operating performance for the Company despite the challenges in energy and more than offset the significant drag on EPS growth from currencies and pension. We remain confident in our business, our markets, our people as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years while also delivering attractive returns for 2015.","Slide 4 shows our fourth quarter results both as reported and with adjustments for special gains and charges, while Slide 5 shows our sales growth detail. Ecolab\u2019s consolidated fixed-currency sales for the fourth quarter increased 6%. Acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency sales also rose 6%.","Looking at the growth components. Volume and mix increased 5%; and pricing rose 1%. Currency was a negative 3% and acquisitions and divestitures were not significant. Reported fixed-currency sales for the Global Industrial segment rose 4%. Adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 2%.","Fourth quarter fixed-currency global Food & Beverage sales increased 2%. We enjoy good growth in agri and moderate sales gains in dairy, food and beverage. Regionally Asia-Pacific and Latin America led results with the modest gains in North America and a modest decline in Europe. Food & Beverage growth was primarily driven by share gains and we used them to more than offset ongoing customer plant closures and generally weak volumes.","Food & Beverage continues to benefit from its Total Plant Assurance approach to customers, in which we combine our industry-leading Cleaning & Sanitizing, Water Treatment and Pest Elimination capabilities to deliver improved food safety results, lower operating costs and better product quality assurance for customers. This has enabled us to win business with key global customers and offset difficult conditions in our North America and Europe market, where lower volumes, as well as customer capacity reduction and plant closures have impacted sales.","Looking ahead, we expect improved organic sales growth in the first quarter. We look for further benefits from growth synergies, better customer penetration and new business capture, as well as leverage from our innovation pipeline, including 3D TRASAR for cleaning plate systems in food and beverage plants to more than offset continued tough industry conditions.","Fixed-currency water sales grew 7%. Adjusted for acquisitions water sales grew 5%. Fixed-currency core water sales grew a very strong 8%, widely outperforming in its end markets. Reported fixed-currency mining sales rose 8%. Adjusted for acquisitions fixed-currency mining sales were off slightly. Regionally, we saw good growth in Latin America, good growth in North America and EMEA and flat Asia-Pacific growth.","The introduction of 3D TRASAR for hotel and other institutional cooling systems, utilizing solid chemistry and advanced dispensing is going well. We also continue to drive better penetration in our other water markets, using our innovative solutions to optimize water usage. We remain focused on building our corporate account and enterprise sales teams, delivering our growth synergies and improving product innovation to drive revenues. We expect to show further improving growth in 2015 as market share gains drive our heavy and light businesses to outperform soft end-markets.","Acquisition-adjusted fourth quarter fixed-currency paper sales declined 3%. Latin America recorded double-digit growth. Elsewhere we saw a sales decline resulting from continued low customer plant utilization and extended customer shutdowns and slowdowns. We expect Paper to rebound to a modest growth in 2015 as we drive new business and technology penetration to offset the difficult paper market conditions.","Fixed-currency sales for the Global Institutional segment rose 6%. Turning to the businesses that make up the segment, fixed-currency sales growth for the Institutional business improved in the fourth quarter rising 5%. Institutional\u2019s end markets remain mixed with continued good growth in global lodging demand, positive signs in North America food service but still challenging foot traffic across Asia-Pacific and Latin America.","Looking at our regional sales, we continue to outperform our markets. Latin America once again posted strong sales growth, while North America and Asia-Pacific turned in solid sales gains improving over their third quarter growth rate and ongoing EMEA sales rose modestly. Sales initiatives targeting new customers along with effective product and service programs around our core markets continue to drive our results. We also continue to broaden leading technology across our global regions.","To drive our future growth and improve on our industry leadership position, we remain focused on standardizing and executing global sales initiatives, globalizing our core competencies and introducing product innovation that delivers increased customer value with solutions that reduce their water, energy and labor cost. We\u2019re also making further investments in field technology to enhance execution and efficiency in sales and service and working on other areas to improve better customer value and through that improve our sales growth.","We expect Institutional to show continued good fixed-currency growth in the first quarter and the full year as we make further progress on our global sales initiatives and continue our aggressive sales efforts. Fourth quarter sales for Specialty grew 8% in fixed currencies. Quick service sales were solid as we enjoyed steady growth from most customers. New accounts, along with increased service coverage and additional solutions for customers to drive their operating efficiency and food safety, leveraged generally modest industry trends. Regionally, the U.S. and Europe saw a good growth from new accounts and additional customer solutions, while Asia-Pacific benefited from good quick service foot traffic growth.","Food retail business showed continued good sales momentum in the fourth quarter, benefiting from customer addition, new products and increased penetration. We look for good sales growth to continue in the first quarter, especially works to deliver another solid performance in 2015.","Fixed currency global healthcare sales increased 4%. Growth was driven by new accounts, better penetration and new product introductions. We continued our work to strengthen our corporate accounts approach and our integrated value proposition, as well as improve and leverage our product portfolio. We believe we are on the right track and look for global healthcare sales growth to improve in the first quarter.","Fixed-currency Energy segment sales grew 11%. Our upstream business saw a robust growth in the fourth quarter led by a strong international performance and good North America results. Downstream business sales also saw a solid increase, also led by strong international performance and share gains in North America.","The drop in oil prices will yield slowing energy segment results through 2015, however we believe our business model, which is heavily weighted to the more recurring revenue production and refining businesses will moderate much of that impact.","Looking ahead we expect energy segment sales for the full year 2015 to show flat to low single digit growth. First quarter energy sales should be up in the mid-single digit range, reflecting momentum from the prior year. We expect quarterly growth to ease through the year and show modest first half growth and a softer second half as new business resulting from ongoing share gains is offset by declining rig count and some modest pricing decreases. We remain confident in Energy\u2019s long term growth prospects and expect it to emerge from this unprecedented period in stronger shape and return to double digit growth once again.","Sales for our other segment increased 5%. Fixed-currency Global Pest sales increased 6% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted for acquisitions, fixed currency sales grew 5%. Food & Beverage and restaurants led the growth. Regionally, we enjoyed double-digit growth in Latin America and Asia-Pacific and solid growth in EMEA and North America. We continue to drive market penetration with innovative service offerings and technologies and make progress in globalizing our market-focused capabilities and field technology. We expect Global Pest sales to show further good growth in the first quarter led by gains in all markets.","Equipment Care sales grew 3% in the fourth quarter. New customer additions continued at a solid rate and productivity improvements from our technology investments and strengthened execution work continue to pay off. However, fourth quarter sales growth was impacted as we exited some low margin accounts. Because of the continued strong underlying business growth trends, we expect equipment care to return to upper single digit growth in the first quarter and to see that growth improve over the balance of the year.","Slide 6 of our presentation shows selected income statement items. Fourth quarter gross margins were 46.2%. When adjusted for special charges, fourth quarter 2014 gross margins were 46.4% and rose 50 basis points above last year. Volume and pricing gains, as well as merger synergies and cost efficiencies more than offset higher cost inputs and the business mix impact of higher energy sales, which on average have a lower gross margin when compared with our other businesses.","SG&A expenses represented 31% of fourth quarter sales. The SG&A ratio improved 60 basis points versus last year. The improvement reflected sales gains, merger synergies and cost savings efforts, as well as the mix of higher energy sales, which on average have lower SG&A ratio when compared with our other businesses. Consolidated operating income margins were 14.1%. Adjusted for special charges, fixed-currency operating income margins were 15.4%, rising 110 basis points over last year\u2019s comparable margin. Fixed-currency operating income for the Global Industrial segment increased 9%. Acquisition adjusted operating income grew 7%, and margins rose 70 basis points. Good improvements in Water led the gain.","Fixed currency operating income for Global Institutional increased 13%; and margins expanded 130 basis points. Results benefited from pricing, volume gains and cost efficiencies, which more than offset higher delivered product costs and investments in the business. Fixed-currency Global Energy operating income increased 13% and margins expanded 20 basis points. Volume gains, operating leverage, synergies and pricing more than offset investments in the business and other costs. Fixed-currency operating income for the other segment increased 22% and margins expanded 240 basis points. Improved operating results more than offset investments in the business and other higher costs.","The Corporate segment and tax rate are discussed in the press release. We repurchased approximately 720,000 shares during the fourth quarter. The net of this performance is that Ecolab reported fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.10 compared with $0.93 reported a year ago. When adjusted for special gains and charges and discrete tax items in both years, adjusted earnings increased 15% to $1.20 when compared with $1.04 earned a year ago.","Turning to Slide 7 and looking at Ecolab\u2019s balance sheet, net debt to total capital was 46% with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 2.2 times. Looking ahead, and as outlined in Slide 8 we will take aggressive actions in 2015 to drive both our top and bottom lines.","We will work to leverage the benefits and offset the challenges of lower oil prices as we capture the lower raw material cost, leverage the expected consumer spending tailwind and gain share in the Energy markets. We will also continue to drive organic growth through further cooperate account wins, depth [ph] up innovation work and improve field productivity. We will ramp up our acquisition work targeting bolt on acquisitions that strengthen our offerings and we will continue to deliver on the business improvements we are making in our healthcare and Europe businesses.","Slide 9 shows an EPS bridge for the first quarter and the full year 2015 that details our outlook. We expect improving fixed currency sales growth combined with good margin improvement developed through new products, better productivity, cost efficiency work and raw material savings will yield strong fixed currency earnings growth from our institutional, industrial and other segments.","We look forward to the energy's segment to show slower sales and profit growth in 2015, as it outpaces its end market. Combined our businesses should deliver a strong operating performance shown here, and expect that slightly lower tax rate, lower interest cost and share repurchase will add to the robust operating performance to yield upper teens growth.","However the strong dollar and higher pension cost will provide significant headwinds for us in 2015. We expect that combined impact will be $0.35 per share. As a result we look for EPS to be in the $4.50 to $4.70 range for 2015, up 8% to 12%. We expect our first quarter to show good fixed currency sales growth with currency negatively impacting reported sales by about 5 percentage points. We look for our first quarter earnings to increase 5% to 12% to the $0.78 to $0.83 range. Further the first quarter will also compare against a very strong period last year when adjusted earnings per share rose 23% to $0.74.","In summary, we once again delivered on our forecast in the fourth quarter with a solid sales gain and continued margin improvement while offsetting market challenges and investing in our future. We have our work cut out for us in 2015, but we are well positioned and well prepared to outperform once again and deliver another superior performance for shareholders this year and for the years ahead.","And now here is Doug Baker with some comments.","Doug Baker","Thanks Mike. A couple of comments on 2014 and also 2015, and then we will open it up for Q&A. So 2014 was obviously very strong year for the Company with annual EPS up 18%. The good news is the business accelerated throughout the year. Our second half excluding M&A was plus 6%. OI margins expanded another 120 basis points for the year. We're on track on all of our Nalco and Champion synergy commitments. We're also on track in Europe where margins expanded 110 basis points for the year. This is our fourth year in a row of expansion. We're now up cumulatively 440 basis points in Europe from our low point. We're also poised to increase margins again in 2015 as sales are accelerating in Europe.","Perhaps most importantly, the momentum I talked about, the 6% in the second half was really built by outstanding cooperate account sales and new program and product launches. This is the underlying trend that we look for. It is the best, best sign we have of the health of the business and it was exceedingly strong. So we did our part. Now I guess I'd also point out that world seems to have done its part, which leads to 2015. Obviously the big news is oil price and FX and to a lesser extent pension.","So first let me touch on oil. So during our third quarter call, oil was also the top conversation topic and at the time oil was trading $86 a barrel. So we discussed ramifications, implications and the principles discussed, I would say remain true. Energy services will be hurt and the rest of the business represent 70% of sales will benefit. The degree of the plus and minus are much different than they were in Q3. So let me give you our view today. So first of all in energy services, we expect flat sales for the year, could be modest growth. But let's just say flat.","Synergies though and raw material savings in energy services will enable us to have modest OI growth in the business, in spite of the very difficult oil market. The raw material savings though will also positively impact the rest of our businesses and roughly offset the lost energy services OI versus what we would have expected in a non-oil price distressed market. So the good news is our team has gotten on the raw materials savings opportunity release. We've made significant progress and we believe we've got clear line of sight about what we're going to see during the year.","So while oil has a created real turbulence in the business, by itself it would not cause us to miss our rival city or time, i.e. the net impact on one side of the business are pretty much offset on the other side of the business and really it is not the main story in our earnings picture for 2015.","The second issue has an impact though too, and that\u2019s FX and pension. So combined, they represent an 8% EPS hit for the year. Obviously we're not the only company impacted by FX and pension. We've heard many companies talk about this. We are doing all the smart things we believe. We're using the pressure internally to challenge spending and in efficiencies which is how we typically manage. The team rallies well around this, but importantly we're not cutting long-term investments in R&D, in field technology, in systems, in talent developments, safety or security. Those are going to remain as planned. They are important to our long-term effectiveness and we have got to make sure we protect them when the team is all over this. ","Our focus though is really to run the businesses quite well and to use the market turmoil to our advantage. So we are all over share gain in energy services. Our goal is to use this year to come out of this thing with a bigger sale and a better position to get after the upcoming turnaround in the oil price.","Additionally M&A outside of the U.S., given the strong dollar also looks more attractive. All I know about FX is it goes up and it goes down. I can't tell you exactly when but I have now seen FX rate or the Euro trade at 0.88 and at 1.45. So we know this stuff moves around. We have an opportunity right now to capitalize on the strong dollar. We're going to see if we can make that happen.","We're also going to leverage our stronger markets in U.S and Europe. So we are seeing the impacts of more I guess change in the pockets of consumers, and we want to make sure that we fully capitalize on that. Our teams are excited about it, all over it as well. And then finally the same tried and true program that we always run, drive new business, leverage innovation, do that everywhere, keep driving the businesses as we always do. ","So closing I would just say we are on it. The challenges are real but we believe they are manageable. We expect another very good year in 2015.","So let me turn it back to Mike. ","Michael Monahan","Thanks, Doug. A final note before we start Q&A. We plan to hold our annual tour of our booth at the National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago on May 18th. And looking further ahead, we also plan to hold our 2015 Investor Day in Saint Paul on September 10th. If any questions, please contact our office.","That concludes our formal remarks. Operator, would you please begin the question and answer period.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question come from Mike Ritzenthaler with Piper Jaffray. ","Mike Ritzenthaler","Doug. 2014 quite a record for new business wins there. I'm curious about how difficult year-on-year comparables influenced your decisions on investments in sales and R&D and things like that, particularly within specialty and institutional where end markets at least in North America seemed much healthier?","Doug Baker","Yes, that's what I was really alluding to Mike in my opening comments. We have got sort of a tale of two cities here and we also have just core investments that we know are fundamental to driving this business year in and year out. We worked very hard not to I would say cut into those investments. And I gave you a laundry list of them, but it's certainly R&D, talent development, safety, a bunch of training issues that we have on ongoing systems investments. We want to make sure that we protect those and we continue to make those investments, because I'm going to be here a year from now talking about 2015 and giving a preview of 2016. And the only way that we can ensure that we continue on this virtuous cycle is to make these core investments.","And so we're absolutely committed to it. They are in our earnings view as you look out over this year and the businesses you touched on, it will be a better year for Institutional. They are going to have make the investments they need on the secure and continue to drive that growth and that's in the plan.","Mike Ritzenthaler","Okay. Thanks and then on energy, how do you feel about visibility into the 2Q through 4Q earnings on the Slide 9 there? Basically flat, given all the moving parts including synergies. Compared to kind of this time last year, how does that visibility compare?","Doug Baker","Well, it's certainly more volatile this year. And I would say last year was an easier year to forecast for the Energy business in particular but I would say that's really where forecasting is more challenging this year than in previous years. This is with -- what we know and I'd say we have a very experienced team, this is isn't the first oil price cycle that the team has been through. We've got all the data, we have been through it. I think we've got a handle on it and we've narrowed this down to we do not have a bunch of what I would say tough to forecast areas at this point in time. We've worked hard on raw materials. I think we've got a much better handle on that at this point in time, simply because we got on it early and the team has done a good job. There has been a lot of analytics here. So I think it totals -- that's a very good forecast, things can change but I would also say things can change in other parts of the ledger that may offset.","Operator","Next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nate Brochmann","Hey Doug, just following-up on that question, I recall back in like 2008 when you guys issued guidance with the Henkel deal, and you came smack dab in the middle of that despite one of the most volatile periods ever in 2009. I was wondering like if you could give us a little bit of sense of how you and your team kind of go through those puts and the takes as you look at your business in terms of the confidence that we have to kind of deliver those results in kind of a volatile energy period, with moving pieces of FX, pension and what not. Just wondering if you could kind of give us a little bit of either look back on history of how that came to be during that period of how you kind of look at it during this period?","Doug Baker","Well, I think there's two sides to this. One is look, we work hard to try to understand what the variables are and then we try to again do a 50-50 position, where if you have multiple variables, which you always do, you have FX, you've got investment decisions, you\u2019ve got business and markets, regions of the world and we just try to get in the middle on a number of these things and understand what we believe is a likelihood that it gets better or worse from there and try to balance it. I would say '08 was a much more difficult challenge in terms of forecasting than it is today. And simply because you add more variables and really frankly nobody knew how the world was going to shake out at the end of the financial crisis.","I would say here what we have is an unsettled oil market, which is probably the most dramatic impact that we have right now. It\u2019s sort of single variable. I think it\u2019s shown its hand at this point in time. Last piece I would say is we work very hard then to make our forecast come true and so it\u2019s not a simple way of just predicting the business. We also try to meet forecasts that we give. Our team rallies around these efforts. We are all over new business and driving, leveraging innovation and doing all the things hopefully we'd do.","I mentioned earlier we\u2019re a company now that\u2019s been through several years of very strong earnings results, and I always get nervous during these periods because I know there is inefficiencies being built up in the business as a consequence of having strong earnings. And so we look at this as an opportunity to go find those pockets and get after them. And the team is doing that quite successfully.","So I think we\u2019ve got a good forecast here. We\u2019ve proven to be a company who can pretty much predict how we\u2019re going to perform. A lot of it has to do with our business model, mostly consumables. And then for energy I think it\u2019s pretty straight forward. Energy is a bit of a wild card but we\u2019ve done a lot of work there. We have some offsets if energy softens. I think we\u2019re in good shape.","Nate Brochmann","And then just one quick follow up, a little bit more of a bookkeeping thing. But could you just give us an update on where we are in terms of synergies realized through the Champion Nalco deals and what we have left to go and if there is any pockets here or there that you\u2019ve identified as additional opportunities?","Doug Baker","Yes. We\u2019re on track by the end of this year to have 125 booked and we\u2019ll have another 25 year after that, so we believe we\u2019re going to hit our 150 target.","Operator","Next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Doug on the energy piece with business how much will drilling be down in 2015? Because it\u2019s actually down half year-over-year","Doug Baker","We don\u2019t get into the specific forecast but I guess the business that\u2019s going to be most impacted here is our WellChem portion of the energy services business. WellChem in 2014 represented 17% of the business. We think that business maybe down 30%. So that\u2019s the single largest impact and it assumes drilling as a result would be down in the 35%, 40% range.","David Begleiter","And looking into 2016 Doug, as drilling declines and product declines, can you grow this business double digits do you think '16 at current oil prices and current drilling rates?","Doug Baker","Here's what I would say. Our going in assumption right now and you\u2019ve got to pick one, is that oil prices remain around this level through much of 2016. I\u2019d say let\u2019s assume they remain at this level all the way through 2016. Once we lap the oil price decline, you're going to have a much steadier state, and you will start seeing I would say steady state of drilling, steady state of production. We would expect to continue to drive share and you can\u2019t forget that the underlying new series old wells come off and are replaced by new wells which we're going to have to do under any oil price scenario, that the new oil commands a lot more of our technology than the old oil and that fact will start taking or having an impact again once you lap this significant decline. So if they stayed through \u201916 at this level we would expect to show positive sales growth in 2016. I doubt it would be a double digit but I think it\u2019d be strong single digits and we would move forward from there.","Operator","Next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.","Gary Bisbee","I'll just follow up on that last one. For the first question how would you think about the phasing in of the benefit from lower raw materials? Does that take a couple of quarters to really pick in and I guess would you likely think you\u2019re still going to be getting benefits in 2016 from lower rods assuming that same scenario you discussed which is sort of flattish oil through the year?","Doug Baker","Yes, I mean if oil stays at the same place, you're not going to have the same delta in 2016 as you are in 2015 in terms of raw material impact. But I guess as I just shared with David, at the same time we wouldn\u2019t have the same impact on the energy services business. We would respect that to be more accretive in '16 versus '15, even if oil stayed at this price level.","To answer your first question, yes, they take some time to come on. I would say more like a quarter. So we're going to see some impact in the first quarter but not necessarily at the run rate that we would expect for the full year. You've got two different conventions globally in terms of how you handle inventory and how fast they show up in U.S versus non-U.S FIFO, LIFO. So some of that has an impact. So we would expect second quarter, third quarter to have a higher positive impact from raws than the first.","Gary Bisbee","And then just a follow up. Mike, in your comments on all the sub-businesses, you mentioned -- it sounded like an awful lot of them, you expect better growth in Q1 than Q4. Just any broad commentary on why? Is that just mostly the new business or are there some other things that you're seeing going on to drive somewhat better -- and I'm talking about sales growth next quarter versus this quarter.","Michael Monahan","Yes, I would say in almost every instance you're going to have stronger sales performance of Q1 versus Q4 with the exception of energy. And what's driving it is the strong cooperate account growth that saw last year which was up dramatically from a very strong year in 2013, and we had a great innovation pipeline last year. Typically these things are leading indicators, and so we are expecting forecasting stronger growth nearly across the board from our other businesses.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","David Ridley-Lane ","Sure just wondering how much of the benefit you are baking into the 2015 guidance on the consumer facing side of the business from the lower oil prices?","Michael Monahan","Yes, it would be hard to pull out. I would say that is one of the contribution as to why you're seeing stronger institutional growth in particular. So U.S institutional in the fourth quarter was -- and I would say actually the underlying is as strong as this. There was reported 7% growth, which is faster than we've seen for quite a while. I would think that the first quarter probably, the only exception is maybe a little lighter because you also have some inventory stuff going on in there. But that business has been accelerating steadily for a number of quarters and will have a real benefit from consumer uptick and spending particularly in full service restaurants and casual dining which we're seeing.","David Ridley-Lane ","And then just as a sort of numbers questions. Should I take the EPS impact from FX and apply sort of an average margin to get the revenue impact or do you have a sort of a revenue headwind from FX in '15 off hand?","Doug Baker","Yes revenue impact form FX in '15 is expected to be 5% to 6%.","Operator","Next question comes from John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity.","John Quealy","First question, in terms of energy can you talk about concentration? Some of your larger customers that perhaps have deeper resources and better cost profiles, are they becoming a bigger part of the mix in the '15 time frame? If you could give us a little bit of perspective?","Doug Baker","I would say throughout 2014 we had a lot of success increasing our position with the major producers. So that will carry forward. I would say -- I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to be -- so I think that\u2019s all good news. We'll continue to do that as I mentioned in my opening comments. Term oil creates opportunity. We've got a very experience energy services management team. They're great. They are all over this. It's not the first time they've seen this. I think they know how to effectively leverage this opportunity, and I think they're making very smart trades out there.","With that said, you've got a funny environment. We're going see much stronger sales in the energy business outside of the U.S than we do in the U.S and a lot of that\u2019s a function of -- a lot the business outside of the U.S is controlled in one way or another by governments, and when oil price goes down, they pump more, and they do it because they got a bill to pay.","And in North America, it's not the situation and it much more reacts to the market. And so we're going see I'd say a much earlier slowdown in North America as a consequence of this as we go through, which is exactly what we're forecasting and foreshadowing for all of you. But that would probably be a more interesting dynamic in the energy business.","John Quealy","And as a follow up, unrelated, in the specialty business, it continues to outperform. Can you dive in a little bit more in terms of details? Is it customer capture? Is it price is it transactions? What exactly is specialty doing in the last few quarters?","Doug Baker","Yes, well on the Specialty business, which is principally our QSR fast food business and food retail business, there are a couple of things. They continue to capture new accounts. That's always critical in driving that business. We've also through realignment of some programs increased their ability to get into a number of customers, and as a consequence they are able to help those customers do a better job in a number of areas and we are able to trade out one product for another, i.e. competitors for ours and we're growing the business as a result. So increased coverage, increased new customers.","Operator","Next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. ","Dmitry Silversteyn","Most of my questions have been answered, but I would like to touch base on a couple of things. In year other business, you had pretty good growth in the pest elimination business. Was there a big difference between international and domestic pest elimination performance?","Doug Baker","Not dramatic. The big business remains the U.S pest business and it has been steadily improving. We made a number of investments in that business starting two years ago. We're going to continue them. I would say kind of the heavy investment status going into 2015 has been paying off and accelerating sales. I would also say there's a number of other metrics that continue to improve in that business. So that is the biggest piece of the pest business.","Equipment care, I think Mike mentioned had a softer sales performance in Q4. A lot of that was planned and our own doing, and we expect equipment care to come out and have a stronger first quarter in terms of sales performance. But I would point out equipment care made like $8 million last year, which is dramatically better than the losses that we had just a couple of years ago. So that team has done a good job. ","Dmitry Silversteyn","Sure. Just to follow-up on the sort of your outlook for revenues and foreign exchange headwinds in 2015, in the past, at least on the water treatment side of the business, going back before you guys owned the business but just going back a decade or more when there was the last time there was a serious deflation in international currencies, the water treatment businesses moved quickly to raise pricing to offset that, particularly in the emerging markets where currencies were particularly volatile. Are you seeing the ability to do the same thing in 2015 or have the markets matured since then where it's not as easy to get pricing when currencies tumble?","Doug Baker","Yes, I would say two things. One, our strategy is to make or resell as much as we can, because we want to have currencies not be a strategic issue but to be a translation issue only. Meaning if you are a complete exporter right now in U.S dollar, obviously you got a problem because your stuff just got a lot more expensive and your competitiveness just weakened significantly. That's not the situation we find ourselves in broadly, but there are pockets.","With that said, where you have significant devaluation, we have strong inflation as a result in new business which is the situation in a number of countries. You have to go after pricing. I think we're all well-schooled in this. We've been doing it collectively as a business for over 50 years. I think our team is all over this. That is both on the WPS side as well as the institutional F&B et cetera. So they are cognitive of the impacts. Where we do have what I would say export situations, we try to understand the market impact as well as the margin impact. We don't like to drive ourselves out of business by losing share through too aggressive pricing. We don't think it makes sense for the long-term. We would rather get after the cost problem and fix it if that's the issue and it's basically self-inflicted.","Operator","Next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","So firstly on Energy, just to touch on the remaining I guess 80% of the business, so you had 11% growth this year. You are forecasting I guess flat -- if you assume that 30% decline on the WellChem business as you said, I guess just talking about 6% growth for the rest of the businesses, I was wondering if you'd help understand how that compared to the growth in 2014 and how much of the modest price decreases that you referred to play a role in that slowdown?","Doug Baker","Yes, what I would say if you did a lock through, then you've have got as I mentioned earlier WellChem, 17% of the business down, call it a third. You've got OFC which is just under 60% of the business. Here we would expect in the mid-single digits this year and certainly some of the impact is -- about a third of that business is in a cost plus relationship. So you're going to have some modest price decline across that business as a result.","But importantly, as oil comes back or raw materials come back, it will also be reflected in increased pricing in that business. And downstream we would expect to react next year much like this year, which is high single-digits. So that\u2019s probably that fast walk through of how we see sales performing this year ","Manav Patnaik","Okay, and just in the context of -- I understand the moving pieces here, but would you say that your first take at these numbers, you've erred more on the conservative side of things?","Doug Baker","I'm giving you our best forecast. So I would call it a 50-50 forecast is what we do when we go out. It\u2019s exactly the approach that we\u2019ve taken for the last I don\u2019t know 20 years and it\u2019s the approach that\u2019s worked quite well for us because we tried to make sure we understand what the different inputs are and we take them all into account. We try to pick the midpoint, understand the plus minus on either side of that thing and work our forecast there.","Manav Patnaik","Okay, and then just if I could lastly on Healthcare, it seemed it had a good sort of end to the year. Like what sort of milestones should we be looking forward to as you've sort of been trying really grow that business in the next couple of years?","Doug Baker","Well, I think the most important milestone, we\u2019ve said a year ago during this call that we really said expect Healthcare really not to get better until the end of the year, and you should start seeing better sales performance in Q4, Q1. That is showing up and coming through. What\u2019s happening is we strengthened our programs. It\u2019s leading to new customer sales. There were a number of significant customer sales in the second half in healthcare. It's the only way we can grow sales is by selling more stuff to more people. And so we\u2019ve got to find a way to grow share there, which is what we\u2019re doing successfully. So the team I think used the time wisely. The business is in better shape than it was a year ago and we expect the acceleration to continue in the first quarter.","Operator","Next question comes from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Mike Harrison","Doug, you mentioned that within the Water business there was strength in the mining side of the market. Is that just recovery against a weak comp? Are you seeing some share gains or were there are new minefields in there? I just think it\u2019s a little unexpected to see the strength there given that commodity prices are not great. So trying to understand the sustainability.","Doug Baker","Well, you\u2019re right. So the number in mining I believe was 8%, but that included the impact of a recent acquisition. Without that it was basically flat in the quarter. And so you\u2019re theory is right. Mining is in a difficult patch right now, but we expect it to improve throughout the year, in the year.","Mike Harrison","And then was the dust control acquisition you were referring to?","Doug Baker","Yes.","Mike Harrison","Okay, and then on the institutional side, I think the view of most of us was that you guys stood the benefit from potential consolidation in the food service distributor market. Does your forecast assume that that big merger does or does not happen? And would it be a disappointment if it didn\u2019t?","Doug Baker","Well, it'd probably certainly be a disappointment for two of our major customers, U.S. Foods and Cisco. So I guess I\u2019ll share their disappointment. But I would say two things. We have had a long and healthy relationship with Cisco. We\u2019ve also had a long and healthy relationship with U.S. Foods as well as other providers in the market which is unique to us. I think we work and partner very well with customers, and I guess the way we view this is this is clearly out of our control. I think our teams done a very good job developing plans. Certainly as if it closes and if there's unforeseen things we\u2019ll manage through that I think quite successfully.","Operator","Next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","George D'Angelo","This is George D'Angelo on for Laurence. In your slide there is a line about doing M&A in distressed markets. Is that a reference to oil or more certain geographies?","Doug Baker","Both. I would say certainly if there are providers of technology and\/or geographic moves to be made in energy services, we would certainly use this as an opportunity to do it. But also more broadly, either in water, institutional, healthcare, F&B, pick it, in certain geographies where you\u2019ve got some currency imbalances, we would look for opportunities too.","George D'Angelo","And then as you guys look at the margin levers that you\u2019re pulling this year, to what extent are you pulling margin improvement forward for the next few years? And then if demand recovers, will there be any offset in terms of margin expansion?","Doug Baker","No, I don\u2019t even -- I don\u2019t know that we know how to do that and it certainly isn\u2019t in our plan. So no I wouldn\u2019t expect any negative rebound as a consequence of actions we\u2019re taking this year.","George D'Angelo","Okay, and just one last quick one. What percentage of sales in the energy segment are to governments and are there any governments that are particularly large percentage of sales?","Doug Baker","Well, it\u2019s not directly to governments per se in all cases. It could be state owned enterprises and others. I don\u2019t know that I have number at hand here. 63% of that business is in North America. So you so and start whittling down from there.","Operator","Next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Curious, with regard to some of your more upstream areas in energy and well completion, anecdotally what are you hearing from customers on the volume, on the price side? We obviously see the guidance and how it progresses through the year. But are you sensing aggressive behavior from your customers there, just anecdotally what\u2019s you\u2019re seeing and hearing from your [indiscernible].","Doug Baker","I think what we've seen is fairly dramatic cut back in terms of exploration capital and drilling activity. In terms of production I would say we're seeing some markets where production is up quite dramatically because they're trying to offset the negative impact of lower price, because they've got I would say some bills to pay. And in others areas, obviously ultimately we think production will get more in line with demand and I guess we forecast our belief right now is that may be well into 2016. But this is a very different energy situation than was '08 - '09 where really you had very dramatic demand disruption. This is much more oversupply situation. ","Scott Schneeberger","And following upon that, internally would we see any material change in CapEx over the course of 2015, may be into '16 with regard to energy just on the commodity prices.","Doug Baker","Our own capital spending or our\u2026","Scott Schneeberger","Yes.","Doug Baker","Yes. Certainly a fair -- for deploying less new business for a period of time they'll see less capital deployed there. I would also say some of the things you might have to do from a volume capacity situation might be delayed six months or a couple quarters simply because of the forecast we just gave you on sales. ","Scott Schneeberger","Nothing that will take you too much off your historical total company CapEx to revenue relationship.","Doug Baker","No, because sales are down also in energy. So I think you can use the historic numbers that you've been using as you go forward model.","Operator","Next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. ","John Roberts","I'm looking at Slide 9 and we've got 5% to 12% growth in the first quarter and then higher growth in the remaining three quarters of the year, 8% to 13%. I would have guessed that the comps are going be more challenging in either the second quarter because of currency or maybe the third quarter because of energy. But is that fair to say that, that 8% to 13% for the second, third and fourth quarter, one of those quarters is going to be your toughest comparison of the year. ","Doug Baker","Well, I'd say two things. Our toughest FX quarter in 2014 was the fourth. And as you go forward, because it really started moving then. The biggest driver, and I think if you go down below embedded in those numbers we've tried to call out that the raw material moved, you're seeing a nipple in first quarter and averaging $0.10 in the next three quarters. That\u2019s probably the single biggest rate change.","John Roberts","And then could I get an update on some of the new products. There are three I'm thinking of, but maybe you could comment on something different. I'd like an update on new Clean-in-Place using 3D TRASAR, the new solids water treatment for commercial buildings and I don\u2019t know whether the energy drop has stalled the shale water recycling effort you had.","Doug Baker","The CIP I would say continues progress well bit we've I think tried to say that that thing is going be a slow build over a period of time. And so while it's doing what we expect it to do, it's not a big volume driver yet. What I would call it is it's very important in continuing to build our relationships and attract new customers. So in '15 we would expect that to be like little over a $1.5 million.","In terms of solids for water, that one is -- uptake is much faster. We would expect $12 million in revenue next year, off a much smaller base and then APAC Europe is about $30 million. We are rolling out what I call our generation that we've been selling in the U.S with some tweaks for formulation in Europe. We're having great success there. That\u2019s going quite well. Those would probably being the big early drivers in terms of what you would expect to see from innovation.","Operator","Next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Bob Koort","Doug, I think you mentioned that you expect the most pronounced energy weakness in the WellChem business. Have you seen any deviation by geography on-shore, off-shore, regionally around the world or do you expect it to be pretty consistent and broad based.","Doug Baker","No it I think what we're going to see is a much more dramatic impact in North America. I mean, you want a big generalization. Because really there's a bunch of private companies reacting to a market. And when you get outside of the U.S, it's not completely true, but in many instances you've got different factors driving pumping decisions if you will, in terms of -- I think in the fourth quarter, it was announced that Russia had record oil production. So it certainly wasn't a price trigger. It was they need to feed Russia. And so if you are going to offset a decline in price, you're going to do it through more volume and so they're not alone in that. You see that in other countries. So it's a consequence. You're going to see a more dramatic fall I think and probably bounce back in North America.","Bob Koort","Do you suspect there could be any issues around credit profiles of your customer base and concerns there as you go forward with this dramatic step change?","Doug Baker","I would say there's always -- you never say never on questions like that. But I'd say is there is no material concentration in terms of how the business is spread. You also typically -- we're also selling to intermediaries who are taking some of that risk, and at the end of the day they've got a great backing, which is they hold the oil.","Bob Koort","And my last comment, I think you mentioned you'd be willing to buy some distressed stuff. I'm wondering specifically within the energy portfolio, do you feel like there are product applications, chemistries products that you lack today that keep you out of certain customers and service deals or are these really going to be very narrow tuck-ins and not really things that are filling a dire need to have a broader portfolio?","Michael Monahan","Yes, I don't think we feel at all impaired in our ability to go, serve and do what we've been doing, but there are opportunities if you will to have -- I guess stretch our capabilities and create new opportunities and those would be the areas that we would be looking at it. So it would be somewhat similar technology but in a new area that would allow us to play and expand our footprint. ","Operator","Next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar","Doug, healthcare was seen as a major growth driver prior to your entry into Energy. And Energy slows down, would you look at healthcare again as an area to invest in?","Doug Baker","Yes P.J., I guess I would say, we never really lost our interest and our belief in healthcare even as a consequence of energy's very stellar run. So I guess we're clearly steadfast. What we did say last year is we were quote unquote putting it in the shop because we had some work to do on the offering. I think that time has been well spent. It's not like we love 4% growth in the fourth quarter. It's just better than 1% growth. But it's the step you have got to take if you want to get back to high single-digits and ideally hopefully back to double-digits. So I'd say healthcare remains a great area, we believe for us to play and we remain very interested in continuing to build that business.","P.J. Juvekar","Okay. And then a financial question. You your net debt to EBITDA is about 2.2 times. You announced $1 billion buyback. You also said that you want to ramp up M&A with a strong dollar here. So when you -- if you take actions on both of those, where do you think your leverage ratio will stabilize?","Doug Baker","Yes not much different from where it is now maybe marginally lower like 2 1. ","P.J. Juvekar","But if you do those you are saying that you can fund those both through your free cash flow and then pay down some debt to bring it down?","Doug Baker","Yes. We expect to make more money this year. That's part of the equation. But yes we've certainly done the math here. ","Operator","Next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hey Doug, on the institutional side, are you already seeing some benefit from the lower oil prices, putting more money in the consumer's pockets? I am hearing the restaurant [ph], it's not quantified and hospitality also not quantified but people are talking about core on the margins. Are you clients telling you it's having more of an impact on them?","Doug Baker","I guess, I cited a number earlier that Institutional had a particularly strong quarter in North America, Q4 up 7 and I wouldn't take that and roll 7 forward for the next 12 years, because then there was probably some inventory build. But with that said, I guess we attribute that to of course our own great execution. But no doubt the market has gotten a little better. I think in the fourth quarter it was the first time and I don't remember four or five years that we saw an uptick in old service restaurant foot traffic. And I don't think it's coincidental. I think it's as a result of more dollars in consumer's pockets.","And what\u2019s your broadly -- or if you won\u2019t talk about specific geographies, what should we think about in terms of the sales outlook for Europe, talking about continuing to get the margin expansion? Are you going to get any -- are you expecting to get some additional benefit from the top line or is it despite not a lot of benefit in to the top line?","Doug Baker","It\u2019s going to be more muted because it\u2019s Europe but no, we would expect that we are going to have improved sales in 2015. I would say all the signs that we see, the business steadily, if you looked underneath, got better throughout the year. It was modestly positive in 2014 if you\u2019re all in. We see pretty good start to the business in 2015. We\u2019d expect to have a couple of points of sales growth which is going to be critical because it\u2019s going to be a real driver now going forward of margin expansion. And if we see that we think we\u2019re going to have another very, very positive year in terms of margin expansion.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","And then just thinking about free cash flow for 2015, should I think of it on a free cash flow basis, not necessarily EBITDA but free cash flow. Should I think of that growing in line with EPS growth?","Doug Baker","Yes.","Operator","Next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie Morbelli","And just Doug following up on the 2% growth in European sales, that is I presume before FX isn\u2019t it? Or are you including the negative impact from FX?","Doug Baker","Thank you, Rosemarie. No, that is a fixed currency yield.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay, so now I have a question on Energy. Would you expect to be flat? If I remember correctly your earlier comments, at the end of the third quarter what you said was that if oil remain between $81 and $91, so let\u2019s call it $85, your revenues in that segment would be up 10%. If oil came down to $75 it would be up 5%. So you are losing 5% of growth with $10 difference. Now oil is at let\u2019s call it 50 and shouldn\u2019t it be down 10% versus last year as opposed to being flat and what am I missing?","Doug Baker","Well, really it\u2019s -- the volume is -- at the end of the day, we\u2019re mostly in the production phase and we\u2019re also in the refining phase and that\u2019s going to be mostly driven by demand. Demand of oil year-on-year is going to be slightly up is the forecast, very slightly. But you\u2019re not having a huge degradation in volume of oil produced around the world. Well, you\u2019re going to have produce but not a consumed. And so we\u2019ll take some production hit on this thing but you also have to understand underneath there as old comes on and new comes on, we have a significant step up in the amount of stuff consumed in the new wells. So taking a linear drive on this across the enterprise. This is not going to work and it\u2019s not just price. We\u2019re not stuck on the price.","Rosemarie Morbelli","And then lastly, if I may, can you give us approximately the number of sales force addition for the year and whether you expect to add the same amount more or less in 2015?","Doug Baker","Certainly in total it\u2019s going to be around 2%. Obviously the mix is going to be somewhat different. We\u2019re not going to see the same adds obviously in energy services and you'll probably see a little more in institutional as a consequence of the strength there.","Operator","Our final question comes from Justin Hauke with Robert Baird.","Justin Hauke","So I don\u2019t see in the interim on the loss, but I guess if we could just get a little bit more color on specifically what raws you see benefiting because when you look at refined product prices, it really hasn't moved a whole lot. So maybe just the magnitude of that. And then I know raws are roughly 50% of your cost of goods sold. What's embedded in the guidance in terms of a percentage decline in your raws?","Doug Baker","Well, I think if you go to Page 9 we gave you what the embedded raw material savings are and EPS. You know the number of shares. You can get into it. We\u2019re trying to make this clear. I would say a lot of these -- half of that benefit and this is the way it falls, because energy buys more oil based or oil derived raw materials than our other businesses. And they will see the most benefit. Some of that will be given back in the form of cost relief to customers as a consequence of our cost plus contracts. We have other businesses where really they do not a dramatic change in raw materials. Institutional as some savings, fairly modest, because you also have a lot of caustic and other materials that they buy which are not going to be impacted by the price of oil.","I would say across the enterprise what's often lost when we have this discussion is what are the inflation drivers in our business? It's rarely, really raw materials. We spend a lot more on people then we do on raw materials and our people costs go up every year, both in terms of salary or what we pay them and benefits. And that is the number one inflation driver and certainly will be an inflation driver this year, even for those businesses, seeing material raw material savings. They will still net have inflation, i.e. the costs will be higher.","How do we offset that productivity gains, really driven by implementation, new technology, we work to do a number of things, reformulation of products. So we can give a better product at a lower raw material cost. But this trade is also got to be favorable for customers where ultimately you start cashing in your good will over time which is a bad thing to do if you want to be share leader for an extended period of time. So I don\u2019t know that helps but I would look at Page 9. I think a lot of answers are there. Or if you have model questions, you can certainly Mike or Lisa.","Justin Hauke","Yes. No thanks. I didn\u2019t see that online. And then on last question, this more of a clarification. On the $0.20 special charges in '15, is there anything that\u2019s incremental in that restructuring? Because if we go back and look at what's been disclosed in the Ks for the restructuring cost related to Nalco and Champion, you would thought it would have been maybe half of that. So is there anything that's new you just have some numbers messed up there.","Doug Baker","Yes, what I mentioned earlier, we went and challenged our businesses to go relook at where synergies would likely exist, and maybe we didn\u2019t find them at the rate we expected, that we have gone after and re looked at opportunities both in regional costs and some corporate cost, as well as within some divisions where we had some I would say natural synergies as well, say WPS, where we folded in the historic Ecolab business into the WPS business and in those areas. So certainly we use the opportunity that FX pressure has bought to challenge our team to get after and take another look.","Operator","We'll turn the call back over to Monahan for closing comments.","Michael Monahan","Thanks everyone.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Monahan.","Mike Monahan","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab\u2019s fourth quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO.","A discussion of our results along with our earnings release and slides referencing the quarter\u2019s results and our outlook are available on Ecolab\u2019s website at ecolab.com\/investor. Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials, stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described under Item 1A, risk factors, of our most recent form 10-K and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with a brief overview of the quarter, Ecolab\u2019s sales and earnings continued to show sequential acceleration thorough the fourth quarter. Continued new business gains, product innovation and pricing drove fourth quarter acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales growth in all our business segments. The sales gains, along with our ongoing cost efficiency work, more than offset higher delivered product costs and investments in the business to drive the operating income gain. These, along with lower adjusted interest expense and our work to lower our tax rate, yielded the fourth quarter\u2019s 11% adjusted earnings per share increase.","Moving to some highlights from the quarter, and as discussed in our press release. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, fourth quarter 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $1.39.","Consolidated acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales rose for all of our business segments. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales growth was led by North America and Europe.","Reported operating margins increased 60 basis points. Adjusted fixed currency operating margins decreased 70 basis points as price and volume increases were more than offset by rising delivered product costs in the quarter. Adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 3%.","The operating income gain, along with lower adjusted interest expense and tax rate, yielded an 11% increase in fourth quarter 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share.","We continue to aggressively work to drive growth, winning new business through our innovative new products and sales and service expertise, as well as driving pricing and cost efficiencies to grow our top and bottom lines at improved rates. We also see continued good underlying sales volume and pricing across our business segments, and look for that to more than offset continued and significant delivered product cost headwinds and yield stronger operating income growth.","We expect 2018 to be a strong year with earnings growth accelerating through the second half. We look for accelerated pricing to again exceed continuing and significant delivered product cost headwinds and along with our product innovation and cost efficiency work yield better operating margins and income growth. We expect 2018 adjusted dilutive earnings per share to rise 12% to 16% to the $5.25 to $5.45 range, with second half earnings growth outpacing the first half, reflecting the expected impact of the higher delivered product costs and systems investments which are expected to have a larger impact in the first half.","We expect good first quarter fixed currency acquisition adjusted sales growth with lower operating margins as improved sales momentum and stronger pricing are more than offset by higher delivery product costs and systems investments. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the $0.85 to $0.93 range, up 6% to 16%.","In summary, we saw improved momentum in our business as we moved through 2017 and expect to realize strong growth in 2018 that should deliver 12% to 16% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth.","And now, here\u2019s Doug Baker with some comments.","Doug Baker","Thank you, Mike. I\u2019ll just touch on some headlines or top level view, as I see it. So, clearly, the business is better and getting better.","Organic sales improved. And the improvement, when you look at it, was widespread. Industrial is quite strong, energy was strong, pest was quite strong, and institutional got better as well. Also, pricing is catching up to rise. So, the strong results here, if you look across the board, you can see better improved pricing everywhere including energy, which finally moved into the plus column as we had forecast. So, we see more of the same as you look into the 2018. We expect a very good macroeconomic environment globally, but we also expect inflation to continue with raws peaking on a year-on-year basis in Q1 and really not easing until late 2018, if at all.","So, while we see this, we also see good things happening on our side. We expect solid sales momentum to continue across the board. And we\u2019re also continuing to push pricing, given the inflationary environment. We\u2019ve had great new business productivity in the second half of 2017. So, there is good reason to believe momentum will continue. We have got major launches underway including our new Smartpower warewash platform, which is starting to help drive institutional improvements. We also continue to invest significantly in customer-facing technology and in infrastructure technology.","So, if you add all this up, we are quite excited about what this means for 2018 results. We see double-digit EPS for the year and for each quarter.","Now, if you look underneath, this is really driven by strong underlying business performance. We certainly have a number of good guys this year working in our favor, things like FX, for a change, tax. Hurricanes are really the planned absence thereof, we don\u2019t forecast any hurricanes impacting a major area for us, like Houston or the Gulf again. But also have things on the other side of the ledger which are often overworked. We\u2019ve got the Equipment Care divestiture. We have one-time SAP in a -- or North America install expense. This isn\u2019t the expense of the system or the amortization of the system, this is really the extra cost it takes to put this in, in terms of inventory and moving things around, et cetera. It\u2019s real but it\u2019s a smart stuff to do because it\u2019s one-time expense; it goes away once the system is up and running. And then, we have raws. Raws are going to be another headwind this year. We will offset them. We believe we\u2019ll even realize margin accretion on gross margin basis before year-end. But, we know we\u2019ve got to grow price to recover the incremental raws that are coming our way. If you net all these out, we\u2019ve got very strong underlying double-digit performance as well.","So, last point, we\u2019ve been doing a lot a work on digital technology to help our customers, and what we\u2019re learning is quite, quite exciting. So, we have huge advantages in the digital world and we\u2019re making real progresses with our customers by leveraging these. So, I remain very optimistic about the year, but I am also really optimistic about our development program, and as a result, very optimistic about the years to come. So, that\u2019s my opening. And from that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Mike.","Mike Monahan","Thanks, Doug. That concludes our formal remarks. Operator, would you please begin the question-and-answer period?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Sure. Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Gary Bisbee","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I guess, Doug, I\u2019d love to drill down on your take on the investments. And number one, sort of help us quantify how much incremental investment is going into business this year? And how do we think about what the payback is from those digital strategies, what are the -- what really is it, and what\u2019s the timing of achieving meaningful payback from these investments? Thanks.","Doug Baker","Well, look, I think, there\u2019s couple levels of investment. I mean, one, we mentioned we\u2019re putting in new ERP system in North America. We\u2019ve done this in a number of regions, in a number of countries. So, we have a lot of experience. But, it takes time and spending to get this thing done, unless you want to take unnecessary risk. The good news is, we\u2019ve already launched, we\u2019ve rolled out, we have a 100% of our financial backbone in North America on this platform. We closed the month. We also have about 40% in North American production and warehousing on this system, and it\u2019s been running. And I would say the early returns are quite favorable. So, what we know is it\u2019s going to be on the continuum of normal installations, which I always call really painful to just impossible. I think, it\u2019s going to be on the better side of that continuum but these things are always difficult.","What\u2019s the payback? Well, look, we\u2019re replacing a 40-year old system. So, some of this is ultimately you\u2019ve got to go do this. This will enable significant upgrades in our visibility in the business, our ability to, what I would say, further leverage digital and all the rest of the stuff. It\u2019s going to be hard to parse through exactly how that works. But, I would say, this one-time expense that we talk about, dissipates as we go out throughout the year, and will certainly not be repeated next year. That\u2019s around an additional, probably about a nickel this year is what we anticipate in total. That type of expense that we don\u2019t expect to see next year. Hopefully, we do better than that. But that\u2019s yet to be seen.","On the digital side, we\u2019re investing another $0.04 to $0.05 this year versus last year. If you go back in total, we probably have about $0.20 investment in this year on a run rate basis. And it\u2019s really been built over the last six years. I think, this has been very smart money for us. And it does not show up in our R&D line where I think it probably belongs because of the accounting rules. But, this is a significant increase in what I would call R&D-related expenditures. And what it\u2019s really designed to do is enable us to take advantage of what I think are our super size advantages in a digital world.","We\u2019ve got access to unique data that nobody else can get at. So, we have over 2 million accounts; we\u2019ve always talked over a 1 million; we never bothered to count them up. Globally, it\u2019s 2.2 million. We\u2019re collecting data today in over 90% of them but too few of them are connected to the cloud. We\u2019ve customized the cloud; we\u2019ve created a central group, we\u2019re doing a number of things right now. So, we have unique data. And I would say, the ability to leverage it better than anybody else, because we\u2019ve got knowhow and a field team to actually take action upon what we learn. So, this is already translating into success in the industrial area where we are further ahead because you have fewer accounts, quite candidly. And it\u2019s easier to start assimilating and getting after this stuff. So, that\u2019s what we are learning first. But, it\u2019s already led to a number of big, big enterprise deals that I don\u2019t think two years ago we could have fantasized we would be able to go compete for because of the way they wanted to look at this industry. But now, for real, they are taking a look at what we can do on energy and water. They\u2019re counting it, not just counting price that we want to charge, and it\u2019s leading to significant new wins.","So, that\u2019s stuff is translating into success right away. But, this is in spite of difficult years because of FX, principally in energy, we have continued to invest in this business. And as we come out of this, we\u2019re damn happy we did because it\u2019s going to be adding additional fuel to a fire that\u2019s already started to take off.","Gary Bisbee","And a quick follow-up just on energy margins, I think your prepared remarks that you posted, called out, Q1, you lap some of the costs, step down from a year-ago or bringing the cost back on. But, how do we think beyond Q1 about just incremental margins? If that revenue does ramp at a nice pace, should we see incremental margins start to rise and be, I don\u2019t know, above corporate average or just any color? Thank you.","Doug Baker","Yes. No, it\u2019s going to ramp up according to our forecast significantly over the next four quarters. I think, you\u2019ve seen a sequential improvement in 2017. That will continue and actually we think accelerate and it needs to. We talked that we gave up pricing during the down turn and we need to go and recapture it, one, because it was lost pricing; and two, because we\u2019ve now got rekindled inflation of raw materials. So, I guess, the best way to think about it is, it will be improved in Q1 but pricing will still be below the raw increase year-on-year. Q2, we think, it\u2019s going to be about net equal. So, it will be no longer, if you will, EPS dilutive, but it will be neutral. And we\u2019ll start -- energy will be accretive. But, I\u2019m just talking about the raw pricing ratio. And then, you are going to start seeing expansion in Q3 and Q4 where if we are fortunate, we\u2019re going to start seeing margin accretion in the second half of this year. I think, that\u2019s more likely than that but obviously it somewhat depends on what happens in the raw market.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord.","Chip Moore","Good to see some of the big headwinds over the past few years going the other way on FX and tax. Maybe on tax specifically, any impacts there on tax reform in terms of end customer demand beyond obviously the benefit to you guys?","Doug Baker","I would say, too early to say we have any specifics about investments that are being made or other things from customers. Typically, they\u2019re responding demand driven signals, not cash in the bank signals, and I would expect that to go. But, we are seeing fairly strong economy globally and in the U.S. So, I would expect that we will see some expansion in certain areas that we will work to go capitalize on as we move forward. So, it\u2019s hard to say that it\u2019s bad news. We like our customers to have cash because when they have concepts to grow, they will do it. So, there is no bad news here.","Chip Moore","Maybe just one follow-on for energy, following up on that first question. I think you called out maybe a small pull forward this quarter. Just talk about that size and impact in Q1.","Doug Baker","Yes. I would say, Q4, 12% organic, we don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the run rate of that business. So, often, I pull them up; I would pull this one down. I think it\u2019s high single digits is more realistic run rate that we experienced in Q4 for energy, which isn\u2019t bad. And it\u2019s about what we expect this year, mid to upper single digits. And so, it was not really a pull forward as much as it was a bunch of one-time things that come along routinely in the fourth quarter, but they came along and we fully capitalized on them this year. So, it\u2019s not a bunch of stolen business from first quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","David Ridley-Lane","It sounds that you are already getting some traction in the institutional business from the refocusing in on the core product lines. Wondering if you\u2019ve started to see any tailwind from the U.S. economy with wage growth picking up and also higher after-tax income. I think, the National Restaurant Association\u2019s customer traffic survey had a tick up in December, for example.","Doug Baker","Yes. It would be tough for us to go ferret that out this quickly and this early. So, I will say, it\u2019s a trend that we like and certainly can\u2019t really hurt. We are seeing, I would say, an uptick in that business broadly. Some of it we know is driven by execution. It\u2019s a little early for us to have any public data on what\u2019s happening in the industry in terms of units, traffic and the like. But, we\u2019ve read the same thing. I would say customers feel better. Retail certainly had a very good holiday season, we all know that. That typically correlates with restaurant traffic and restaurant spend as well. So, I would expect, as we sit here, our expectation for institutional, and we really focus on U.S. first because it\u2019s the biggest business, makes the most money, and we can\u2019t afford to have that thing stayed dormant very long. It\u2019s moving, it improved 4 versus 3. We expect the same or maybe even a better move in Q1 versus Q4 and sort of sequential improvement throughout the year. And our goal, and I think it\u2019s quite achievable, to leave the year at a 5% run rate on the U.S. business, which is going to have a significant improvement overall in that public segment.","David Ridley-Lane","And then, just want to ask, it\u2019s been a couple of months since the Diversey and GE Water transactions closed. Have you been able to capitalize on some of that competitive disruption?","Doug Baker","Well, you never know exactly what the root is. We certainly are doing our normal welcome party to the industry. And so, we\u2019re working to be quite aggressive. It\u2019s what you would expect. So, we are actively pursuing new business, have programs in place in our water and our energy and in our institutional and F&B businesses. They\u2019re working together quite constructively, particularly in the F&B space where there are huge synergies between our water and F&B businesses. That is having success. We would expect to continue to have success.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Manav Patnaik","I just wanted to follow up on the digital investments. I was just curious, all this data that you talked about and the only place to get it, like can you monetize that in the future, or is this more just it increases your value proposition to the customer?","Doug Baker","I guess, the ultimate answer is, we don\u2019t know. At minimum, it\u2019s going to make us or position us to be even more helpful and valuable to customers. Whether it gets monetized in a unique income stream or it\u2019s monetized as an overall part of the programs that we sell, I don\u2019t exactly know. I think, what will happen here, it\u2019s happened in our other learning episodes is, we start out and we are starting out and we go out, doing what we know we can do and making a difference where we know we can make a difference. As a consequence to that, you learn many other things in other areas in maybe other ways to make a difference for customers, if they\u2019re willing to pay for. It\u2019s certainly happened for us in the past. And I would expect this journey will have some of those off ramps as well. We\u2019ll capitalize on them. But at minimum, it\u2019s going to enable us to do pretty significant things for customers, just the visibility that we can provide and the understanding about their spending patterns and their efficiency patterns within either a restaurant or food and beverage plant, a hotel, a hospital. We now know best-in-class let\u2019s say water usage and given in the steel mill industry globally or in the beverage and brew industries. And these aren\u2019t small things because if we can really say, hey, you can get down to a 1 liter in here at [indiscernible] day per liter produced, that\u2019s a dramatic improvement in our efficiency and start mapping ways to do it helps them be better stewards and frankly make more money. So, I mean there\u2019s a lot of ways to make this create value for customers. Our history, when we create value, we get paid for it. And we know this is going to enhance our ability to do that.","Manav Patnaik","And then, maybe just on Europe, could you just update us on sort of the margin trajectory there and maybe what the trajectory for Europe generally in your view should be in the next couple of years?","Doug Baker","Yes. If we go back to sort of the Europe that we had identified when we launched the Renaissance program back in \u201811, this year margin was really flat and we target a 100 basis points a year. We started off in a big hole Q1 and climbed out of the hole to reach basically flat for the year. We\u2019re still up dramatically over the period of time since we announced this first quarter of 2011. And I believe we will be back on track in this year as we move forward. So, there is still firm belief. We identified 1,000 points; we started out it at 3 margin, so getting to 13, I still believe that\u2019s quite achievable. We\u2019re upper single digits now. We\u2019ve covered most of that ground but we have ground left to carry, and then will start arguing from there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","Doug, just to follow on there. I think, you said European institutional sales were down in the quarter in fixed currencies, what was going on there?","Doug Baker","There was some business that we ended up losing because we didn\u2019t want to compete for it at the price it was going to be done at. We\u2019ve been through this in Europe several times. I would say, of the chains that I would have put in that category, say four years ago, two out of three that we lost and are already back in our fold simply because I don\u2019t think you can execute at those pricing levels. So, this is something we\u2019ve dealt with for decades. We have competitors who I don\u2019t understand their P&L or their view of it but they are quite aggressive at times on price. And we do the math, it looks like a cash loss position to us. We are unwilling to do business at a cash loss business. We won\u2019t drop price to protect; we\u2019ve done that. We will do other things, but there is a point where we just blink and say, forget it. And now that is coming out of the base fairly quickly because it\u2019s been in it for a while. We expect to be neutral to maybe slightly positive in Q1 and for the year next year.","John Roberts","Do you think that\u2019s a result of the competitive dynamics from your competitor being sold?","Doug Baker","Well, I mean to be honest, it\u2019s been a pattern under five ownerships and it\u2019s been consistent. So, we always say, well, new owner perhaps will be a new pricing philosophy. So far, that\u2019s been a unfulfilled wish. So, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to translate here. I\u2019ve always said, we\u2019ve dealt with 30 and 40 off for, I\u2019ve been at the Company 28 years. It was happening before I got here, it\u2019s still happening. So, my expectation is it will likely continue to happen. During that period of time, we\u2019ve grown share, and at the expense of every competitor including those who are quite price aggressive. So, I would just say just put in the camp of everybody has got to deal with their own stuff. That\u2019s some of the stuff we\u2019ve got to go deal with, we\u2019ve done it, we will handle it in the future.","John Roberts","J&J put its sterilization business up for sale. Setting valuation aside, I assume that would fit really well with your hospital product strategy?","Doug Baker","This is -- why don\u2019t I say that I\u2019m not going to make any comment on a specific property that may or may not be for sale. But certainly, the central sterile area has been one of our focus areas and an area that we\u2019ve talked about strategically in the past, and it\u2019s important going forward.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander","So, two quick questions. First, is the digitalization strategy changing or could it change your targets for R&D, and your rule of thumb for how fast your sales force would grow each year to tie into the volume growth you target? And secondly, can you give a bit of an update in terms of demand trends that you\u2019re seeing in Asia and your thoughts around investing to grow the sales force there?","Doug Baker","Yes. So, Laurence, I guess, on the digital side, our priorities go in this order. Number one, we\u2019re going develop technology that improves and enhances our ability to drive value at our customer level. That\u2019s focus one. Focus two is developing technology makes it easier to deal with, i.e., you want to go track a shipment, you want to find out a price, you want to get a critical information that you might need on specific products. We can do a lot better job making it easier for customers access and by the way for our field team too. And then, third, and third is, we\u2019ll use it to go drive efficiency. And it\u2019s simply just trying to get the focus first.","You can get projects under any of these buckets, we have loads of them. But, what do we want to do first, we want to go use this to drive value with customers. That\u2019s our number one priority. As a consequence of that, yes, it changes some things. But, what we\u2019ll end up doing first is really augmenting our field with technology, and enabling them to get a lot -- get more done with less effort. And that\u2019s the goal, because then they can spend more time upselling, helping, training and doing the things that really only humans can do. And so, we want to supplant and use technology where we can.","How is that going to translate? I said, ultimately, yes, it\u2019s almost hard to imagine that that doesn\u2019t enable you to increase sales team capacity, if you do it right. And we would certainly leverage that if that proved to be true. But that\u2019s not the objective of our initial thrust as we go out there. It really is enhance value, create value, drive the top-line and from there, learn how to do the rest of the stuff.","And, the next thing I\u2019ll do is the Asia demand, yes, I would say, there\u2019s a number of hot points in Asia that we continue to feed and we\u2019ll continue to feed as we grow. Our China business in institutional, in F&B, and in whitewater has been very steadily growing at either double digits or high single digits. It will continue to do that we believe as we go forward .It\u2019s now starting to eclipse, some of the struggles we had in the heavier industries as a consequence of new regulations and other things. China grew in the fourth quarter, we expect it to grow next year both top and bottom line as we go through, and these faster growth parts become a bigger part of the portfolio there. So, we\u2019re feeding that we\u2019re feeding Southeast Asia, we\u2019re feeding Indonesia and other markets that are growing disproportionately. And we\u2019ll continue to do that as we move forward. Demand there, I would say in a number of areas is quite good and we want to make sure we\u2019re up to supplying and meeting it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Begleiter at Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Doug, on healthcare, it\u2019s now been about a year since you acquired Anios. Can you give us an update on how that is progressing? And overall in healthcare in 2018, how are you looking at growth for that business?","Doug Baker","Yes. I mean, Anios is -- look, you have to like it a lot to buy it and pay what we paid. I mean, it was clearly within market metrics, but market\u2019s frothy. It turned out to be a great acquisition as we thought it was. So, sitting here a year later, I think the team, the Anios team, our integration team, the healthcare team at large has just done a fantastic job bringing that business into the fold. They\u2019ve done it in a way that has not disrupted the business. We\u2019ve fed the business; we\u2019re working to enable the business. They had a very clear way of expanding globally. We\u2019ve made it a lot easier because they don\u2019t have to build infrastructure, it already exists. And so, what we were going to do frankly with a Ecolab line and Anios can do, we\u2019re now doing via an Anios line and expanding and it\u2019s going quite well.","What do we expect? I mean, if you look at Anios organic growth and our other organic growth, you\u2019ve got to kind of blend them together. It\u2019s growing at a mid single digit combined growth rate right now. My hope is that we\u2019re able to tick that up through the year, as we go forward. I think, there\u2019s good plans and reason to believe that. But the business has been performing well. Anios is ahead of plan, top and bottom versus our first year expectations, and we always have high expectations. So, we\u2019re quite pleased with the business. The more you learn about it and the more you interact, frankly better you feel cause it\u2019s really a terrific business.","David Begleiter","And Doug, just on institutional, the acceleration to that 5% run rate at year-end, what one or two things are going to drive that acceleration from today for the rest of the year? ","Doug Baker","Well, some is the base stops being a problem. I mean, I want to be straight. But the other is just better execution. I think, the team went back and did a good job of looking at their plans in the last really two years. And we had a lot going on in that business that I think started pulling people\u2019s eye off the ball. We talked about it in prior calls, in terms of field technology rollout, kind of a major one. And every time we do these, we learn. And also the integration of Swisher was very intensive in terms of how deep it went in the organization. So, those things are behind us. I think, they tried to do too many things last year on one level and not enough big things, it\u2019s their summation of learning. I think their plans this year are much crisper, much more focused, the stuff that can make a difference. We -- you only get several yeses a year in a customer, you want to make those yeses count a lot, both for them and for us. And I think we\u2019re just back to some of those basics and the team\u2019s plan reflects that. And you can already start seeing some of the benefits as we start tracking those metrics. So, I\u2019m calling what\u2019s -- I know it\u2019s going to improve. Does it hit 5? I bet, yes, but it\u2019s certainly not going to be hanging around the 3 level.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse.","Chris Parkinson","Great. Thank you. F&B performance appears to have taken a turn for the better on the back of new business wins and enterprise selling, after as a little problematic I guess 12 to 18 months ago. Can you just quickly comment on your expectations for the balance of \u201818 and even into \u201819? Does the current growth rate have the runway? And if so, what subdivisions and geographies are the key drivers? Thank you.","Doug Baker","Yes. I would say, the F&B business, I think that team\u2019s done a terrific job. ?And this marriage between F&B and water technologies which both the water white team and F&B have done a amazing job partnering, collaborating and developing outsized advantage, it\u2019s driving both businesses forward, has been huge. And it\u2019s very difficult for competition to even come close to matching it, because nobody else has these two businesses. And our expectation, I think you are going to see more of the same from F&B. Every quarter is not going to be identical to the fourth quarter. But, I think, call it plus-minus 6, as we go through the year, quarter-after-quarter. The light business is also doing well. Where do you see the growth? I mean, the good news is it\u2019s in some of the bigger markets, right? North America, we would expect to have at least average growth versus the 6 I talked about; China a little above average; AP above average; Latin America above average. So that\u2019s sort of where we see the growth. But, we would expect to grow in every region.","Chris Parkinson","And just a quick follow-up, quickly on pest elimination, you\u2019ve seen some solid organic growth and also made a few smaller acquisitions. Can you quickly reiterate or give additional commentary around your long-term strategy with enterprise selling, any geographic opportunities as well as the larger M&A landscape?","Doug Baker","Yes. The pest business, I mean, I would say that team continues to do a great job executing and delivering value for customers. We are getting paid for it. Their growth is upper single-digit, 8% in Q4, which is good. If you recall maybe four or five years ago we were at the very low single-digits. And we\u2019re getting called out regularly what the heck is going in pest, and I think the team has done a terrific job driving organic sales growth. We did make a recent acquisition. It improves our ability to serve the F&B segment. So, that will enable us to drive even more value into that segment when you start coupling it with the water and F&B technology that I discussed before. It\u2019s a very attractive segment for the pest business as well, because it drives real value there and they\u2019re big units. So, they are efficient, if you will, for delivering pest services. So, all that\u2019s positive.","Our strategy going forward, we\u2019ve always said we really like this business, run well. It\u2019s a very high return business. The only way to ruin a high return business is to go make a lot of overpriced acquisitions. And so, that\u2019s the one mistake we won\u2019t make. We love to make acquisitions in this area. You just got to be disciplined that you don\u2019t end up overpaying because it\u2019s sort of a sin you can\u2019t recover from. There are huge expansion opportunities. We are doing some of the Greenfield in the absence of acquisition targets. There are some things that we think might come onto the market in future and we will take a deep look at those. And if we can buy them at a price that makes sense, we would love to do it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Group.","Hamzah Mazari","The first question is just if you could just give us an update, how big is your corporate client base? And specifically you had talked about circling the customer a few investor days ago. Just curious, how many of these customers are subscribing to the entire product suite? Is there still room or opportunity there?","Doug Baker","Look, we have all these different businesses and it\u2019s all a different number for every business. We don\u2019t typically have like a single enterprise number for what corporate accounts represent. Many of our businesses, it\u2019s the majority because it\u2019s the nature of the industry. F&B has obviously been historically dominated by large players, think soft drinks, think beer increasingly in other areas, think QSR, fast food, et cetera. And so, it comprises a significant portion of our sales. If you look at it in total, you could easily triple the sales to that segment. If you sold them everything, we have to offer where we have to offer it.","So, whenever, I say that, people say, well, that must mean you\u2019ve done a terrible job in the past circling the customer. And I\u2019d say, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a fair read of that stat. What it really implies is two things. I think, we have continued to drive successfully circle the customer strategies. If you go back to the commentary I had earlier in terms of how we\u2019re approaching the F&B business with the water technologies, F&B and even pest, and that\u2019s been quite successful. But, we also simultaneously have been adding to the total price by expanding our market opportunity. I think, it\u2019s one of the smart things that we do as a company, we\u2019ve done historically is we expand before we need to, so we don\u2019t run into walls, like growth walls, run out of growth. So, we have significant opportunity in front of us. If you told me all we could do is sell the existing customers, I would tell you we continue to grow like we are. I would also tell you, it\u2019s a strategic mistake, because it takes pressure off our competition. So, I think you need to do both, if you\u2019re going to be a successful company and that\u2019s how we view it.","Hamzah Mazari","Just a follow-up question on capital allocation. One, you didn\u2019t buy any stock back in Q4. How are you thinking about repurchases going forward? And then, along the same lines on capital allocation, how important is a chemical sale process for you guys around M&A? Swisher didn\u2019t really have one, but deals in the did. So, just any thoughts on capital allocation, specifically buybacks and M&A?","Doug Baker","Well, yes, I would say, look, we look at acquisitions to do a variety of things for us and they have in the past and will in the future. We\u2019ll bring in technology that we think will be useful, leverage across the platform, we buy sometimes competitors and markets that we don\u2019t have a large footprint to give us a head start. And so, yes, I mean, we like companies that have chemical platforms; I would say, Swisher actually did. Swisher -- the business really we bought was a similar warewash business. We sold the restroom business and got out of that, because that wasn\u2019t what was attractive to us as we went forward.","In terms of share buyback, we didn\u2019t make any purchases in Q4, because we made the purchases early in the year. It wasn\u2019t anything more. We tend to have a budget or expected spend level in share repurchase, we had reached it, and we reached it earlier in the year. We count on our share price appreciating throughout the year. So, it\u2019s typically cheaper early as we go. We also did a lot of M&A in the fourth quarter, which was a -- in our minds, our preferred use of cash as we go. So, I mean, it\u2019s a variety of things.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.","Scott Goldstein","Hi. This is Scott on for P.J. Thanks for taking my question. So, maybe just looking at your outlook for raw material inflation in first half. What are your expectations for caustic soda specifically and are there any other raw materials that you\u2019re keeping your eye on?","Doug Baker","I\u2019d say, based on today\u2019s price it\u2019ll go up, caustic. Look, we go raw-by-raw-by-raw, and ours is a big basket of products that we buy. I mean, it\u2019s over 10,000 specific products. So, it\u2019s tough to keep track of everyone individually, although there are few that we pull out and watch. So, here is our expectation. I would say, the peak we believe is in Q1. It\u2019s a significant headwind in Q1, stepped up from Q4. And so, while originally in the third quarter we thought that there would be a spike in Q4 and it would abate; it did not. So, in fact, it\u2019s gotten stronger. You guys all see this, it\u2019s plenty of public and data around these facts. We believe that it starts to moderate but not go down, moderate in terms of increase moving into Q2 and Q3. And then potentially, you might see a decrease in Q4. Let me say, we aren\u2019t betting our year on it, because right now, every time we forecast moderation in price, it seems like we get the opposite effect. So, we\u2019re starting to hope for higher prices, maybe it will have the unintended consequence, but that\u2019s how we see it. So, it\u2019s real, we\u2019re pricing for it, we\u2019re out there. The environment is inflationary on a number of fronts. Inflation, historically, we complain about it but it\u2019s been more a frame than a foe. And we\u2019ve got to do what we\u2019ve got to go do. And I would say, the businesses are getting the price that we need to continue to keep pace and ultimately completely offset the inflation we foresee.","Scott Goldstein","If I could just get a follow-up then. So, going back to institutional, when you are looking at improvement by year-end in that business, can you point to any market segment, like full service restaurants, lodging or long-term care where you think you can execute better or any of those market segments that you\u2019re more excited about than the others?","Doug Baker","Yes. I would say, our lodging business has been strong, remains strong, and we are forecasting continues to be so. I think where we see because of the warewash launch and the focus, we would expect that our full service restaurant business improve. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll see because it\u2019s a larger segment where we will see probably the best pick up. Long-term care represents a great opportunity. They are obviously everywhere you turn, new long-term facilities going up. That\u2019s another area that will get increased focus, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a prime driver in 2018. That\u2019s more in out years.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities.","Mike Harrison","Going back to response about the change in the raw material inflation rate, you guys updated your Q1 guidance, you increased it by a penny. Just trying to kind of parse out if you are seeing higher raws, what changed in the underlying view on Q1 in the past few weeks that was a positive offset to the raw material inflation?","Doug Baker","Well, I mean, the simple answer on Q1 is where halfway through. So, you start having more confidence that your forecast for any number of things are accurate, simply because you\u2019ve just taken the risk of time and it\u2019s been reduced. Catalysts are our SAP implementation; we\u2019re now whatever 10 days into it. So, you know a lot in the first week and you learn a lot, honestly a lot in the first day i.e. does it work. And so, those questions have been answered. We\u2019re quite confident, it would, but now, we don\u2019t have to be confident in the future. We can be confident in what\u2019s already transpired.","On raw materials, you get to a point where it just says less time to have a huge impact on the quarter as you go through, both internationally because a different convention and in the United States, even though it impacts faster, you\u2019re just running out of time, and you start seeing your pricing take hold. So we had a clear forecast, we had clear trends, but you still have to get people to accept the price and put it in and ship them at that price. And so, all those things led to, I would say, greater degree of confidence that we would be moving up the range, and led us to move the forecast and signal that risk is kind of moving away. And the good things that we thought would transpire are transpiring as we go through here. But just to give you a flavor, I mean, raws, in this quarter like a 14% headwind. So, we\u2019re going to do we believe double digit, at the mid-point, but it\u2019s not like in this benign environment. People want to talk about tax, all right. Well, I\u2019ll give up a whole year of tax in one quarter on raws. So, it sort of misses the broader picture. Now, we\u2019re more than covering that with pricing also year-on-year. So, we\u2019re not crying in our soup over this, but we are -- there\u2019s real work, the teams have done it, we\u2019ve done in the past. So, there\u2019s real I think reason to believe, but it\u2019s just to give you the type of level that we\u2019re talking about.","Mike Harrison","And then, on the energy business, I think, you\u2019ve been reluctant in the past to talk about the operating leverage that you\u2019re expecting in 2018 or OI growth relative to sales growth in the segment. So, with a view toward mid to upper single digit top line growth in 2018 and now that you\u2019ve left some of the headwinds around compensation and the other factors that you talked about, what sort of margin improvements or OI growth is factored into the energy business in your guidance for 2018?","Doug Baker","Yes. We would expect to see OI margin leverage improved for the year, probably starting mid-year, Q2 maybe earliest, but certainly in the second half. I would think in like, probably this year we cover maybe 100 basis points of margin type expectation.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.","Tim Mulrooney","Good afternoon. The water segment has inflected into stronger growth territory lately, I mean the year I think at 5%, which is really above what we\u2019ve seen over the last several years. So, I guess, my question is how sustainable is that as we look into 2018 and beyond? I\u2019m curious how you think about this business in terms of a long-term growth trajectory?","Doug Baker","Yes. Our expectation for the water business, particularly the core light and heavy water would be to continue to accelerate that business more in line with the 6% to 8% expectation and so, move up this year from 5% to 6% as we go forward. Paper, we do not see and nor have we in the 5% to 6% range, but we see paper is a consistent, steady, low single digit grower that could continue through technology and a number of great initiatives, continue to enhance its margin as it enhances its ability to help customers make more money. And so, that\u2019s where the paper business fits. The big sea change that will occur for water is really the China business. And as we come out from under some of the challenges that the paper -- or the water business, particularly the heavy business had in China, I\u2019ll think you\u2019ll see that flow through and start driving faster growth globally.","Tim Mulrooney","And my follow-up is back on the institutional division. You kind of broke down by each segment what you expect, long-term care, there\u2019s a long-term opportunity there, lodging continues to be strong you said. So, you expect to see the improvement on the full service restaurant side, which was good to hear. I\u2019m just curious what gives you confidence to be able to say that for 2018. Is it more of a -- well, you\u2019ve been making these investments since the back half of 2017, so it\u2019s more of an internal improvement or the external environment is improving, any additional color there would be helpful. Thanks, Doug.","Doug Baker","I would say two things. I mean, as we look at this market, there\u2019s a lot of conversation about unit loss et cetera. But, the unit loss really isn\u2019t in the sweet spot of our market. If you look at full service restaurant chains and\/or QSR chains, both had unit growth last year, albeit quite modest, but not down. The decline in units has really been in the independent segments of both QSR and full service restaurants. And I would say, this is bolstered by our own internal data when we look at loss figures, i.e. how much sales did we lose year-on-year? And this is one of the metrics that we track closely for decades. We\u2019re at really record low levels of lost business. And our losses include bankruptcies and closures. And so, I don\u2019t know if an Outback closes a unit that would show up in our lost column, even though we had nothing to do with it, quote unquote. And so, to look at the levels we are in losses, I would say, also say the ground we\u2019re on is much firmer I think than people think. We look at it as ground upon which we can get more purchase, I mean, in terms of forward momentum. And that\u2019s why we have confidence too. We\u2019ve already started instituting these plans so we\u2019re starting to see them bear fruit. So, it\u2019s not -- I mean that\u2019s why we think Q4 was better than Q3. It\u2019s the specific sales events and sales efforts and why we\u2019re confident we\u2019ve already got right some data you might imagine in Q1, sitting here in the middle of the quarter. So it\u2019s all those factors that lead us to believe we\u2019ll be able to do better there. It\u2019s a big business. It doesn\u2019t go down fast and it doesn\u2019t go up fast. We are running in the U.S. at 6%, not very long ago, you sort of saw a steady degradation of sales but went down to really probably realistically 2 to 3% at its low point which I would have called Q3 and started moving out. But it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s not going to snap back, it\u2019s going to take some time to rebuild its momentum but the team\u2019s on it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019d like to follow up on your comments about China and specifically how the impact of the government\u2019s tightening environmental regulation is playing in your industry? In other words, are you seeing more benefits from some of your competitors perhaps being pushed out of the market as a result of this? Or is this a little bit of headwind as some of the manufacturing facilities where you may be supplying that heavy industry water treatment products that are slowing you down? So, can you talk about sort of what\u2019s going on in China with their manufacturing footprint reduction across the industries and how it\u2019s impacting Ecolab?","Doug Baker","I call this one of these classic things. Overall, this is a great thing. I think, it\u2019s a great thing for the world. I think, it\u2019s ultimately a great thing and a smart thing for China. And it will be a good thing for Ecolab. But, there\u2019s like adjustment period to get through, which is a period we are in. So, I think, you cited a lot of, Dmitry, it\u2019s what we are seeing. So, we have some customers that are being shut down who can\u2019t make the transition to the new regulations, loss business. We have other customers who can make it, who are buying better technology and paying more money, so that\u2019s a plus. And then we also see what I would say is some supply disruption globally in the chemical industry, which has led to some, at least justification, whether it\u2019s real or not for price increases and we\u2019re seeing that in raw materials. Because a lot of what I would call substandard chemical producing plants have been shut down as well. Now, that stuff ends and the good news flows for the long-term, i.e., standards are going to be raised, people are going to need to do more and meet to new regulatory environment. China, when they decide to do something, gets quite serious about it, and has been quite successful in driving new standards.","So, first, we see a lot in the power industry there. There is real pressure. They need to go meet these regulatory requirements in very short order. And so, we are having very important conversations there and we want to find ways that we can go and set the players to move up the scale. That will likely translate into higher spend with us. So that\u2019s the good part. So, I don\u2019t mind the short-term pain, because I think long-term, this is exactly the type of move we hope for in China ultimately.","Dmitry Silversteyn","And then, just a follow-up on your comments around cleaning and sanitizing, you came out of 2017 at very low single digit growth outside of foreign exchange. And it sounds like -- and I just want to clarify that it sounds like you are not going to look for much to change maybe in the first half of the year but with all the efforts that you made and with a little firmer foot that you are referring to, we should see some pickup in the back half of the year and then look for that maybe low to mid single digit growth in 2019 and beyond. Is that the right way to think about cleaning and sanitizing over the near to mid-term?","Doug Baker","Dmitry, what segment were you talking about?","Dmitry Silversteyn","The institutional, the cleaning and sanitizing portion of institutional, sort of your largest part of...","Doug Baker","Yes. No, I am not that bearish. I would say, -- here is that what I would say. We would not define last year as not a good year for institutional. It grew, it didn\u2019t shrink. We don\u2019t think we lost share or anything else but we didn\u2019t grow the way we except to. We started to see improvement. And we believe we bottomed in Q3, if you want us to try to call it, and started seeing improvement in Q4 versus Q3. And what we forecast is we would expect to see the similar, maybe even a little better improvement Q1 versus Q4. So, no, we don\u2019t believe this is like hanging out at his low-level. But, what I\u2019m trying to also suggest is it\u2019s a big business, it doesn\u2019t snap back quickly. What you\u2019ll see is sort of continued modest improvement sequentially quarter-by-quarter to the point where we believe we\u2019ll leave the year in that area at about a 5% run rate. Hopefully, we can get there sooner, but that\u2019s the most realistic forecast that we\u2019ve got right now.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew Wittmann","I have couple of questions here, probably for Dan actually. Dan, I was looking at the guidance that you gave for the first quarter and for the year. It all makes sense, but the one line item here is interest expense, it\u2019s up sequentially in first quarter. You guys did some refinancing that lowered the overall interest expense. So, just trying to understand why the interest expense guidance appears a little bit high, and if there\u2019s anything in there that we should be aware of, maybe CapEx or something that\u2019s running higher than historical levels, things like that?","Dan Schmechel","Yes. I really think that it is just primarily rate driven, okay. So, we saw this pretty significant step down in interest expense between 2016 and 2017, despite the fact that our debt balances were up, that\u2019s largely the impact, okay, of increasing our exposure to euro borrowing. Part of that was related to the Anios financing and part of that was just increasing our exposure through the swap market. But year-on-year, although our debt balance remains about the same, what you\u2019re seeing incrementally is really is rate driven. So, we\u2019re not in an entirely fixed position in terms of our debt portfolio.","Andrew Wittmann","And then, maybe just as a follow-up, Dan, you\u2019ve got an accounting change on revenue recognition here in 2018; in some of your prepared comments you referred to it a little bit. I was just wondering if you want to give us a little bit more detail as what we should expect from that -- how it\u2019s going to appear between gross margins and SG&A margins for us as analysts. And maybe, is there any benefit to the actual revenue dollars that will be reported? We\u2019ve seen other companies that have actually had benefit to the revenue from the new recognition standard?","Dan Schmechel","So, maybe just for sort of general benefit, explaining kind of what\u2019s driving this revenue recognition thing, so we\u2019re now required to split from both a sales and a cost of sales reporting, those portions of our revenues that are tied directly to products and then the portion that we think -- or what we estimate to be backed primarily by service. And so, just I\u2019ll kind of take your questions in sequence, if I could. So, from a P&L and geography perspective, the first thing that you\u2019ll note is a reduction in our gross margin of about 5 percentage points, which will be offset by reduction in our SG&A ratio of about 5 percentage points. And so, no real -- no impact at the operating income margin line. What\u2019s driving that reduction in gross margin is really a restatement of expense from SG&A, so think about where the cost of the service currently resides, a lot of it is currently in SG&A and that will be pumped up to the cost of sales. And so that\u2019s going to really drive this 5 percentage point gross margin reduction, but sort of net to operating income from revenue recognition at operating income it will be equal. We will actually be -- so this is a little bit ahead of the game. We\u2019ll be showing the full reconciliation and restatement in April ahead of our Q1 earnings, but we actually expect to see a very small reduction to reported sales as a result of revenue recognition. Because if you think about -- we invoice at the product level, if you think about typical ship and bill arrangements where shipments laid in the period, we haven\u2019t actually performed the service yet, and so there is going to be a drag that we estimate and it will be restated for both years of about a penny to 2017 into 2018.","The other big accounting change that\u2019s out there, just maybe to round up the conversation is on pension. And here -- so there is -- we are required now to split the results of our pension into two pieces. So, the expense, which is, I would think about that as the annual expense or people accruing pension benefit, will continue to be a component of operating expense. But, the result of the earnings on the pension portfolio, we\u2019re now going to go below operating income, the net of that will be a reduction of about 50 basis points to our reported operating income ratio, again, all restated.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Just a question also for Dan. Dan, it looks like the guidance is assuming at the midpoint somewhere around close to 100 basis points of margin expansion. Could you talk about some of the components that are going to drive that especially since there are so many tough comparisons in the first half of the year with raw materials?","Dan Schmechel","Well, I think, as Dough pretty clearly indicated, we feel good about our pricing program and our efforts to continue to drive pricing to cover the higher impact of raw materials. There is as always growth in the business, will continue to drive some degree of SG&A leverage as well as other leverage across our supply chain cost structure, at least part of which is fixed. There is always cost savings in there too. We\u2019ve been quite aggressive in 2017 on cost savings programs, which will drive an annualization next year. But the biggest driver expect to be the continued benefits of pricing versus raw materials through the year, plus volume leverage I would say.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","And then, just as a follow-up on that, based on the acquisitions to-date, how much acquisition revenue do you expect to have in 2018, and if you can kind of net that on the Equipment Care divestiture just so we get a way to understand it net-net debt?","Dan Schmechel","Relative to the Equipment Care piece, it\u2019s almost immaterial. If you think about Anios being the big deal; that was done so early in 2017 that the annualization is going to be minimal and the rest of them are not going to be big revenue drivers.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Going back to the raw materials, can you give us a feel for what the hit was in 2017 on a per share basis and what are your expectations for 2018 of the timing, magnitude?","Doug Baker","Two seconds, we\u2019re adding numbers.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Sure. So, while you are adding numbers, I was wondering, in terms of pest, you mentioned your interest in getting additional acquisitions as long as they are in line with what you are willing to pay and makes sense, would, after the -- I\u2019m not so sure how to phrase it, after the fiasco with ChemLaw; I just really didn\u2019t find the right word; after the fiasco with ChemLaw, would you consider that going into the consumer household type of pest elimination? And I am thinking Terminix, to make it clear?","Doug Baker","Yes. So, I will answer. I think, what we\u2019ve said is our focus has been and continues to be on the away from home markets. It\u2019s I think, the decision that was made honestly before I got to the Company to focus in these areas, has proved to be a very wise one. And so, while we\u2019re quite successful here, we don\u2019t believe that necessarily translates to success in residential or consumer in terms of -- so even in the pest area, given part our circle, the customer strategy, building on our knowhow, we prefer staying where we are. So that would be how I would think about our focus going forward. Back to your earlier question, last year in 2017, raws were, call it plus-minus $0.37, in this year, it\u2019s probably another $0.30. But, the vast majority are like almost half of that $0.30 year-on-year hits in Q1.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay. And so, if I look at 2017, by the fourth quarter, you had recovered at least on a run rate basis, the full $0.37, and then, [indiscernible] in addition to?","Doug Baker","No, I mean, we really started seeing white, I mean, it was like $100,000, I\u2019m being a little facetious, between pricing and raw material increase in Q3 for the first time. It was underwater and dilutive on an EPS basis in the first half of last year, neutral, really I\u2019m just talking not margin, I\u2019m talking EPS, neutral in Q3, and then slightly accretive in Q4. Q1, we\u2019re going to be back to just barely accretive on an EPS basis, is our expectation because we think pricing will be just a nose above raw material on an absolute dollar basis, but we start seeing increasing daylight as we go throughout the year. And that\u2019s not because we see raws falling but it\u2019s because pricing continues to build and raws are running against the base last year where it increased really in late first quarter and more in the second and third quarters.","Rosemarie Morbelli","So, if I understand properly, while you will have that impact of $0.30 from raws, it\u2019s not going to affect your EPS by $0.30 because you will be offsetting it with price increases, am I thinking about it\u2026","Doug Baker","Yes, most definitely, it\u2019s yes. So, Rosemarie, I mean, our -- this is all incorporated in our forecasts which is for double-digit EPS. So, yes, we\u2019re more than offsetting it with pricing as we go throughout the year. It\u2019s just -- we\u2019ve gone through these periods. It goes benign for a few years in and then you have typically a two-year, fairly steep run up in raw material prices, started in late 2004 and 2005, and then we had another one in 2007, 2008 period and then 2011 and 2012 et cetera. So, we\u2019re in just another one of these periods. We\u2019ve handled them. But, they do have near-term impact on the business. And we\u2019re just trying to get all the transparency. I think, the team is doing a good job, we\u2019ll cover it. And I think we\u2019ll come out of 2018 in a strong position.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay, great. And if I may ask one last question, you gave us Q1 as a range of $0.85 to $0.93 but let\u2019s say it\u2019s up 6% to 16%. But in your remarks Doug, you mentioned double digit growth for every quarter on the EPS basis. So, what would need to happen and what would you be unhappy to see in order to not reach that 10% growth in the first quarter?","Doug Baker","Well, I mean at this point, I mean, the midpoint implies double digit. And so, midpoint is not loss on either. And so, what could happen that could knock you off? We could have a problem with our SAP system. I don\u2019t think it would be a problem that would be an ongoing problem but could be a problem that costs you money in the quarter. You could have some huge roll up that we don\u2019t -- run up that we don\u2019t forecast on raw materials, it\u2019d have to happen pretty quick. It could happen. And we could end up not hitting our sales forecast. So, I mean, there of course is risk here and then there\u2019s upside as a consequence, which is why we have a range as we go through here. But, it\u2019s any number of those things. That\u2019s life in the business world. So, we\u2019re giving our best forecast. And my expectation is, we\u2019re going to do everything we can to go deliver at least at the midpoint in the range. We always like to be at the upper side but we give you a range and that\u2019s what I\u2019d focus on.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from the line of Dan Dolev with Nomura.","Dan Dolev","Hey. Thank you for taking my question. Just so I understand, given the discussion about the accounting, the 47 to 48% gross margin guidance for the year that is apples to apples with fiscal \u201817, correct?","Dan Schmechel","Yes. That\u2019s correct. As I indicated earlier. We\u2019ll do the full restatement in April ahead of the release of the quarter.","Dan Dolev","Got it. And then, sort of related to that, if I go back to kind of your legacy business in 2005, when raws were very high, you had about a 100 basis points gross margin drag and the snap back was about 30. If I go to Nalco it was even worse and the snap back took longer. I mean, you\u2019re kind of implying 70 basis points of gross margin improvement for the year. Why is it different this time, especially given the more muted inflation versus kind of the last decade? Thank you.","Doug Baker","I don\u2019t know, I mean, this is a two-year raw material cycle. So, I would just say, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s really materially different. I think, the water business and energy business, I mean, are in a different cycle than they were at that time, but they\u2019re both much better equipped now to go deal with this pricing environment than they were in \u201804, \u201805. \u201804, \u201805 was the first time really raws had meaningfully moved for almost any of us on this piece of chemical business in like 20 years. And all of us had to go figure out how we\u2019re going to develop the new pricing capabilities and all the rest. And I would say, it was one of the things that we did quite successfully. I think, if you looked at Nalco\u2019s history, they were much better in the \u201808 period and captured a lot of that run up and then even better in the \u201811 and \u201812 period, and that was a period at which we were looking right to buy. And so, we did a lot of studying of their capability. So, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s materially different. You just got a two-year pretty powerful cycle. We are on it. We are going to catch up. I don\u2019t think there is -- I am quite confident we will end up recouping margin, not just dollar with our pricing.","Dan Dolev","On the Equipment Care, would you be able to quantify the margin uptick from the divesture?","Doug Baker","Yes. I don\u2019t -- it\u2019s not, I mean, Equipment Care was like 3% of that total business, and it\u2019s the one that at zero margin. So, immaterial. It\u2019s not going to be -- it won\u2019t hit the rounding.","Operator","Thank you. I would like to turn the floor back to Mr. Monahan for closing remarks.","Mike Monahan","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Mike Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations for Ecolab. Thank you. You may now begin.","Michael Monahan","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab\u2019s fourth quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our Chief Financial Officer. A discussion of our results, along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter\u2019s results and our outlook, are available on Ecolab\u2019s website at ecolab.com\/investor.","Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials, stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described under Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our most recent Form 10-K and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with a brief overview of the results, Ecolab\u2019s strong growth momentum and double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth continued in the fourth quarter. New business gains, accelerating pricing and product innovation drove strong fourth quarter acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales and operating income growth, which along with cost efficiency actions and reduced tax rate, yielded the fourth quarter\u2019s 12% adjusted diluted earnings per share increase.","Moving on to some highlights from the quarter and as discussed in our press release, acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increased 6%. Adjusted fixed currency operating income rose 7%, continuing the acceleration shown throughout 2018. The operating income gain, along with a lower tax rate yielded the 12% increase in adjusted diluted EPS, continuing the double-digit quarterly growth trends recorded throughout 2018.","We continue to work aggressively to drive growth, winning new business through our innovative new products and sales and service expertise, as well as driving pricing, productivity and cost efficiencies to grow our top and bottom lines. Our digital investments are developing well and will add new actionable insights for our customers to improve their operations, enhance their experience working with us and increase our sales force effectiveness.","We also continue to see solid underlying sales volume and pricing across all of our business segments. We expect 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share to rise 10% to 14% to the $5.80 the $6 range, as volume and price gains more than offset the impact of higher delivered product costs and business investments. First quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be up 8% to 16% to the $0.98 to $1.06 range.","In summary, we expect continued strong top line momentum in our business over the balance of the year to more than offset higher delivered product costs and deliver operating income growth and, along with cost efficiency actions, yield double-digit adjusted diluted earnings per share growth this year.","Importantly, despite the headwinds, we continue to make the right investments in key areas of differentiation, including product information, digital investments to develop superior growth for the future and we expect to sustain strong momentum as we exit the year.","And now, here is Doug Baker with some comments.","Douglas Baker","Thanks, Mike, and hello. We\u2019ve got \u2013 I\u2019ve got a couple of comments and I\u2019m going to keep it brief and maybe a bit repetitive. If we look at 2019, we enter with really quite strong momentum. Q4 was solid in the positive sense of the word. We had 6% organic growth, driven in part by strong pricing, but also very solid volume. This is driven by strong new business, which we really enjoyed all year, including in the fourth quarter, we saw improving OI throughout the year and double-digit EPS in the fourth quarter and for the year as well.","So as a consequence, we project 2019 to be very good as well. We\u2019re forecasting a 10% to 14% full-year adjusted EPS range, 8% to 16% Q1 range. The year is really going to be driven by this formula: continued good volume and pricing; a growing benefit from our accelerate plans; and less raw material headwinds, underscore less. They aren\u2019t favorable, they\u2019re just growing slower than they were in 2018, or that\u2019s our projection.","Importantly, we\u2019ll continue to invest in systems, digital and key growth innovation throughout the year, and our success driver really fundamentally remains the same. And I would say, importantly, the story we bring to our customers is an important story in both good and not so good economic times.","So we know when we have great teams driving our great business model, which we define as best results at lowest cost in the environmental impact. This is what drives great financials for our shareholders and it\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re focused on. So if there\u2019s any shout out that is deserved, it\u2019s really \u2013 I\u2019m quite pleased with the momentum we enter 2019 and it\u2019s really a testament to our teams who have been executing very well out in the field.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Mike for Q&A.","Michael Monahan","Thanks, Doug. That concludes our formal remarks. As a final note before we start Q&A, we plan to hold our annual tour of our booth of the National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago on Monday May 20. Looking further ahead, we also plan to hold our 2019 Investor Day on Thursday September 5. If you have any questions, please contact our office. Operator, would you please begin the question-and-answer period?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one brief follow-up question per caller, so that others have a chance to participate. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Gary Bisbee","Hey, guys, good afternoon. So I guess, the first question for me, obviously, pricing has really picked up and that\u2019s been helpful to revenue growth. But as we think about \u2013 but in fairness, volume also had its best year in a number of years. So as you think about 2019, what is the cadence look like? I assume, as you start to lap the pricing, you\u2019re unlikely to get those types of gains again on top of what you\u2019ve got now. So is it reasonable to think that the revenue growth decelerates a bit as we move into the year, or is your optimism around volume is such that, this recent trend is sustainable on the top line? Thank you.","Douglas Baker","We believe contributions from volume and pricing in 2019 are going to be very similar to those that we saw in 2018. And so while you\u2019ve got raw material inflation slowing, we still forecast, it\u2019s going to be up year-on-year. But I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s like spot market pricing, that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving our conversation with customers.","Fundamentally, we don\u2019t try to match price and inflation in any given quarter. We want to do it at a slower pace, as we\u2019ve talked in the past, simply because it\u2019s better for our customers. And so we\u2019re still in the recoup mode, if you will, from a pricing standpoint for increases that we saw in parts of 2017 and all the way through 2018 and the continued forecasted increases we see in 2019.","So we would expect fairly steady, if you will, collective sales growth throughout the year. We don\u2019t think that there is a big hockey stick, i.e., it\u2019s much faster in the first-half versus second or vice versa.","Gary Bisbee","And then a quick follow-up. I guess, just wanted to probe your ability to prepare for the spin. Does this have any impact on either the bolt-on M&A strategy or anything else as you divert people to focus on that, or are you think that\u2019s not going to be a huge deal as we think about what the executive team is working on over the next 12 to 18 months? Thank you.","Douglas Baker","Yes, I mean, it\u2019s fair. It\u2019s absolutely a large project. I think, we worked hard to understand, if you will, where the shadow falls from this project. It will not preclude us from continuing our path of bolt-on M&A. We have a very good pipeline right now.","What we create when we\u2019re in these situations and I think we\u2019ve done it quite successfully in the past is, we create and kind of segregate teams that are going to go focus on this. We will utilize outside services, where they are equal or better than what we can do internally as well, so that we don\u2019t drain capacity needlessly here.","If you recall, when we had, say, even the Nalco integration, we created a standalone team. We gave them a charter. They executed excellently. And if you also recall, we continue to drive very successfully sales growth and margin growth during that period of time in the rest of the businesses.","Gary Bisbee","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Bardi","Hi. This is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I just want to hit on the raw material assumptions a little bit more. Just given what happened last year in terms of the third-party assumptions ending up a little bit worse, just wondering what level of conservatism you\u2019ve put into those assumptions?","Douglas Baker","Yes. No, we would follow the philosophy, I think, you\u2019re advocating. We\u2019ll make a new mistake this year. So you\u2019re right. I mean, if you went on the indices last year, which is basically how we formulate forecasts, it would have suggested, you would have had a much lower level of inflation in raw materials in 2018 than we actually saw.","If you look at our forecast in indices, our forecast for raw materials is slightly above the indices at this point in time. We also understand that the indices are always going to be wrong one way or another, but we are certainly not being overly aggressive. We don\u2019t believe with our raw material forecast.","We\u2019ll see what actually transpires. Obviously, if it ramps up, we have proven that we can ramp up pricing if we need to in that eventuality and that\u2019s exactly what we would do if we needed to. And obviously, we\u2019d probably step on the accelerate \u2013 accelerator, too.","Greg Bardi","Okay. And then I just wanted to quickly ask about how you think about the growth trajectory for the Downstream Energy business? I think in the past, a lot of the secular growth drivers you\u2019ve talked about for that business focus more on the upstream side. So if you could just touch on some of the drivers that have driven the nice growth on the downstream side, that would be appreciated? Thanks.","Douglas Baker","Yes. The downstream business if you look at cyclicality, either on growth or income, is one of the steadiest businesses we have in our portfolio, not just in energy, but in total. And it\u2019s a very steady mid single-digit top line growth business. There are a number of things that drive it. We are a global player in that market. You certainly still have significant economic growth in key parts of the world that typically drives energy consumption.","The other aspect of production out of the refineries and petrochemicals, obviously, plastics. And while there are certainly pressure on some consumer plastics, plastics are absolutely critical to a number of the key sustainability initiatives. It\u2019s a way that you lightweight materials, the way you lightweight vehicles, et cetera, is going to be through fundamentally plastics. And so there\u2019s very steady demand story we believe as we look at this business. If you look at the past, it would also indicate that the business is quite resilient, both the end market and ours.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","Chip Moore","Thanks. Doug, maybe you can talk a bit more about competitive environment by geography and institutional, in particular, and then where you are exiting some lower-margin business, maybe you can just help to quantify that for us as a headwind in 2019? Thanks.","Douglas Baker","Yes. I\u2019d say the \u2013 I don\u2019t know what the competitive environment has dramatically changed by region. Certainly, Europe remains the most competitive challenged market that we compete in from an institutional standpoint. It was and is and will be we think for a considerable period of time.","In terms of the low-margin comment, yes, we ended up and we\u2019ve been through this a number of times, where through quite aggressive bids that we determined weren\u2019t smart to match. We have exited loss, whatever word you want to use, some business, principally in the contract catering arena. This will have some top line impact, probably less impact on the bottom line, simply because it wasn\u2019t high-margin business to begin with, and then we faced very aggressive competitive bids.","If you go back, this isn\u2019t very different than the situation we faced in food and beverage for a considerable period of time, where a number of instances, we decided not to match bids. The business went away for a period of time and virtually all. I can think of one piece of business that we have not resecured after going through that in the food and beverage market.","Obviously, we will work to prove that we\u2019re the right partner for these companies going forward, but we can\u2019t do business when it\u2019s going to be at a very problematic financial situation. The reason we\u2019re in business is to do good for society and for our customers, but also \u2013 or by the way, make money. And we do not ever see the idea of losing money as a strategic benefit.","And so if we can\u2019t prove, we\u2019ll get costs right and do other things. This is not going to be significant. We think institutional this year is going to grow mid single digits again as a sector and institutional specific division will have mid single-digit growth this year as well.","Chip Moore","Understood. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander","Hi. Can you give a feel for on \u2013 particularly on the more on industrial facing parts of institutional, so the dairy and food and beverage and so on. What kind of dispersion that you\u2019re seeing in terms of acceptance or traction with the price increases? Are there any pockets regional or otherwise on pricing gaining traction where it\u2019s being more difficult?","Secondly, as you think about the digitalization investments, what would you need to see to \u2013 over the next couple of years to significantly change the pace of investment?","Douglas Baker","Yes. Well, the first question around industrial and where we\u2019re seeing pricing, I mean, we saw a significant improvement in pricing capture throughout the year and ended over 3% in our industrial businesses in the fourth quarter. We expect that to continue as we enter 2019, as I discussed earlier.","You\u2019re right, regionally, it\u2019s not exactly the same number everywhere. I would say, China, which was a net plus in the pricing column, is always a more challenged market, it\u2019s cultural, it\u2019s historical, et cetera. But we are pushing and securing price there, just not at the same rate that we\u2019re seeing in some of the other markets, but we also know that ultimately that\u2019s got to change too.","So we feel good about the ability to capture price. I think at the heart of it is that the value we bring to customers is tangible. They understand it. They\u2019re willing to pay for it, because they know that net we are a better deal than their alternatives, and we work very hard to merchandise and prove that day in, day out, and it really comes from the significant water and CO2 savings or energy savings that we help drive within their facility, which often are greater than the total bill they pay us. So that\u2019s an important part of the equation, important reason we get price.","And the second question, digital. I would say, what do we need to see? Well, I mean to me, this is one of the most critical things that we need to do. We have huge built-in advantages that we need to leverage. And I think those advantages play really well in a digital future.","We have nearly 3 million customer sites, probably 90% we\u2019re collecting information today. But a very small fraction of those are connected to the cloud at the moment. Connecting those dispensers, which are collecting unique information to the cloud isn\u2019t technically hard and costs have been going down. And so we\u2019re on a real mission to go get those connected.","The information streams that we have will be unique. We have unique ways of analyzing this, because we have know-how and the ability then to translate this into advantage for customers we think is dramatic. We\u2019ve done this on a fairly large scale industrial, where, if you will, cost of capital isn\u2019t as sensitive, simply because you may be taking out millions out of a given unit versus thousands and we have proven the concept.","And one of the reasons, I think, you really see water moving, food and beverage moving is our ability to capture information and utilize it to the benefit of customers. We now have some very large-scale wins and tests going on and big customers in the institutional area. We\u2019re quite confident, it\u2019s going to show the same kind of value creation as we go.","So obviously, we need to continue to see fruit from this investment. But I would also say, I think, the future without investing digital is a scary place to be and a bad bet for any business to be making. So even if we have some hiccups, some stumbles or some other things, we\u2019ve got to continue to invest here. And I think our investors would be wise to hold our feet to the fire on digital investments going forward, because it\u2019s the safest way to guarantee a long-term successful future.","Laurence Alexander","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Tim Mulrooney","Yes, good morning. I have two questions. The first one, how much \u2013 going back to the price raws conversation, how much were delivered product costs year-over-year in 2018? And what are your assumptions for 2019?","Douglas Baker","Well, they\u2019re up high single-digit, like 8% globally raw materials rate, et cetera, pretty significant. Our assumptions into this year are roughly half. So..","Tim Mulrooney","Got it. That\u2019s helpful.","Douglas Baker","\u2026so increase, but more at the 4% level.","Tim Mulrooney","Yes. Okay, perfect. That\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for. And then, Doug, relative to my model, the business that outperformed the most in the back-half of 2018 was water. Were there any large orders or other one-time events that drove such strong performance? And how are you thinking about water for 2019, particularly given the difficult comps in the back-half of the year? Thank you.","Douglas Baker","Well, if the water team is listening, I\u2019m hoping for 20% in 2019. For the investors, I\u2019d probably calm that down a bit. No, I would say, the water business is an annuity business, like the balance of our other businesses. So it\u2019s not a \u2013 I mean, there can be occasions, where we have a significant investment and\/ or sale, But that\u2019s quite rare and was not the driver for the acceleration in the second-half of the year was fundamentally improved pricing certainly helped.","But I would also say, big, big success in terms of driving new business \u2013 net new business, and that\u2019s always the key to driving our top line. And the team in heavy, in light, in mining, really kind of broad. It was a broad success story. Paper obviously saw the numbers there, have done a very good job\u2026","Tim Mulrooney","Yes.","Douglas Baker","Leveraging innovation to drive new sales as they go forward.","Tim Mulrooney","Got it. Thank you.","Douglas Baker","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts","Thank you. Back on the digitization efforts, as they proceed, would you expect the institutional business to go \u2013 be able to go down into smaller customers? More effectively, you\u2019re concentrated up in the larger chains, but I don\u2019t know whether this allows your guys to \u2013 at a lower cost to be able to provide some sort of services to the smaller restaurant chains that have been harder for you to penetrate?","Douglas Baker","Yes, I would imagine ultimately as we continue to drive utilization of the technology and the technology continues to evolve and typically, the evolution of digital as a lower cost, not higher cost. Yes, I think you would ultimately \u2013 our focus is going to be driving superior outcomes for our customers. But I would also say, I imagine that using digital will enable us to be even more targeted and how we use our very advantageous field resources more successfully and more efficiently.","And as you\u2019re able to do that, you\u2019ve got the best of both worlds, which is you will learn more, you can be predictive, but you can still react and have the capability of solving the problems that you want cover, which is a huge desire on our customer standpoint. So, yes, I think, it will lower cost, improve our capabilities and enable us to probably go to a broader swath of the market.","John Roberts","And then could you give us an update on the institutional water market? You had a relatively small business and now go ahead a relatively small business. And I have kind of lost track as you\u2019ve tried to increase your penetration there, it\u2019s not broken out clearly?","Douglas Baker","Yes, there would be our \u2013 the water light business would include the institutional market and food and beverage markets, et cetera. And that business has been a very consistent, if you will, mid to upper single-digit performer for quite a while. And we really, if you will, reprioritize that business. It was an important business for Nalco in the 90s. It got deprioritized in the 2000s, and we thought incorrectly so did much of their management by the way.","And we have, if you will, resplit and one of the early work we did was going to redividing the Nalco water business into dedicated focused business units, much how Ecolab thinks about going to market. And I would also say much how Nalco used to go-to-market in up through the 90s.","And this is proven to be a good investment and a \u2013 and good work to go through, because one of the reasons I believe we are seeing improved water results is that, we\u2019ve gone through all of that work and now have this redivision, if you will, done largely globally and focus drives results. And in the light business, we see it as well.","And so we are out there working to secure. We\u2019ve made some acquisitions to give us route capabilities and in New York market, in particular, we want to learn from that route model and see if we can\u2019t replicate it another large metro areas, because we think it gives us an additional means of getting after a large segment of that market.","John Roberts","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you. Could you just give us some comments on the gross profit margins for the year in terms of how much improvement you think you\u2019re going to get and you talked about overall cost for the year earlier? But how does that phase in through the year, and where do we see the inflection and GPMs? In which quarter?","Douglas Baker","Yes. I think, here we would expect to start seeing daylight, if you will, or year-on-year improvement in gross margins, second quarter for the vast majority of the businesses. And I think, you\u2019ll see improvement in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter in terms of margin, if you will, gross profit year -on -year decline, it will be much less. So you\u2019re going to see the line, I think, steadily improved from second-half through the first quarter and second quarter, I\u2019d be surprised if we didn\u2019t have, if you will, increased margin year-on-year 2019 versus 2018 in Q2.","For the year, given that we\u2019re going to have this, I mean, it\u2019s going to be \u2013 I don\u2019t know 30 to 50 basis points kind of improvement this year overall. But obviously, it\u2019s going to be stronger in the second-half than it is in the first-half as we just discussed the first quarter situation.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. And just as a housekeeping follow-up. Any comments on cash flow generation and working capital? And you also noted a lower tax rate, I assume, it\u2019s not materially lower?","Douglas Baker","That\u2019s a Dan question.","Daniel Schmechel","Yes. So let me just say, we feel great about our cash flow in 2018. I mean finished \u2013 that was a question mid-last year. We outperformed my expectation at that time and look for 2019 to continue to be a great free cash flow generation you\u2019re looking for sort of the yield of reported net income to free cash flow in the 90%-plus range okay? And yes, the tax rate, so clearly, we benefited in 2018 really from the U.S. corporate tax reform. Also let me just say, from a lot of good tax work that we did consistent with the new rule in terms of continuing to improve our position, but not expecting great shakes in 2019 in comparison expect the rate to be flat or maybe even tipping up a couple of tenths of a percentage point, okay.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Parkinson","Great. Thank you. Your enterprise selling has been doing pretty well, especially in F&B and Pest Elimination. Can you just give us a quick update on these teams, given the current degree of customer penetration and just how we should think about this in 2019 and 2020? Is it still safe to say we\u2019re in the early innings? Thank you.","Douglas Baker","Based on share, you\u2019d have to say, we\u2019re in early innings. And so while we\u2019ve been in these businesses, we\u2019re successful. In some key markets, we\u2019re number one, but we still have significant upside from a share standpoint and we think just like a line of sight in front of us.","So, we would expect the pest business to continue to perform as it has been, which is kind of high single-digit organic growth rates. They\u2019ve been executing very well. We continue to invest in that business as we believe we need to sustain that type of growth rate.","F&B had a good 2018, ended up with 6% growth in the fourth quarter, kind of organic growth rate. They too are working hard to secure pricing, too, if you will, recoup the margin that was lost as a consequence of the significant raw material run up. But in terms of top line, there are significant opportunities.","I would say, the combination of water and F&B\u2019s food safety programs is an outstanding story that our customers have really responded to. We had early success when we first, if you will, acquired Nalco and we talked about $0.5 billion in terms of sales synergy, which we also announced that we more than surpassed.","I would say, the momentum is built if anything. And it\u2019s really the team\u2019s willingness and drive to continue to refine the story and now have that translate into new innovation, where there are synergistic innovations between water and F&B, shared platforms around 3D, et cetera, all those things, I think, bodes very well and is a reason we\u2019ve seen a huge uptick in, I would just say, share in that space.","Christopher Parkinson","Just a quick follow-up on healthcare. Last year, I believe or at least over the last couple of quarters, you\u2019ve been shifting your sales approach a little versus your competitors. Can you just comment on the status of the strategy evolution? Any key differentiating offers \u2013 offerings? How you handle yourself in the hospital versus your peers? And then just overall approach to reaccelerating the growth in this business? Thank you.","Christopher Parkinson","Yes. No, I \u2013 fair. I mean, we talked about healthcare last year and we had a, what I\u2019ll call, like disappointing start to the year, where first-half was very low single digits. We forecasted that we would improve throughout the year into the team\u2019s credit they did. So we exited in the fourth quarter with a 4% organic growth rate in healthcare. It\u2019s really driven.","I\u2019d say, there\u2019s a couple of things. The team has done a lot of very good work in terms of developing programs. And we believe they\u2019re the right programs the team does, I do. They\u2019ve done great work around utilizing digital technology to, I would say, further enhance those programs and it\u2019s quite compelling stuff.","What we need to do is probably sharpen the way we talked about benefits, which I mentioned in previous calls, which is certainly reduction in healthcare acquired infections and significant rate reductions. But we also need to do a better job translating that into economic benefit, and I think the team has done a lot of work there.","Our program business in healthcare, if you will, the stuff that we\u2019ve been emphasizing and putting, if you will, our real sales effort behind is growing double-digit. It\u2019s just not the majority of the business yet. But if you continue this path over any length of time, ultimately, it becomes the dominant piece of the business in terms of size and therefore, more of that growth start showing up in the overall number.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your question.","Douglas Baker","Hello?","Operator","Dmitry, your line is live.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Hi, thanks. I just wanted to follow-up a couple of questions. Number one, can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on given sort of the softer economic conditions in parts of the world outside of the U.S. with your restaurant and quick service business? I mean, how should we think about your ability to gain share in this \u2013 in a slower growth environment in 2019 in that space?","Douglas Baker","Yes. I would say, we don\u2019t think \u2013 I mean, I think, what we\u2019re going to see the economy have any impact is probably Europe. And the U.S. is forecasted to grow slower, but we\u2019re not that GDP sensitive. We still think it\u2019s going to be a very solid economy, and our ability to go capture share and do things and offset lost businesses, et cetera, we think remains pretty robust in the U.S.","Europe isn\u2019t going to be a tougher environment and we think probably where you see weaker economies maybe show up. Globally, as I mentioned before, we think institutional will continue to have a good year in 2019, but Europe will probably be their soft spot.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay, all right. And then just as a follow-up on the \u2013 your comment about Europe being sort of the most competitive and kind of the most difficult market for you to execute the sort of the value-added strategy that you\u2019ve been called known for. This \u2013 you probably could have made this comment 20 years ago. And so my question is, is there anything on the horizon in Europe either from what you guys are doing or what other players are doing in terms of consolidating in that space and that geography? And if not, what\u2019s stopping the consolidation of the industry that can result in better operating environment for the remaining players?","Douglas Baker","Well, I wouldn\u2019t say, we go out to consolidate an industry. It\u2019s going to \u2013 our view is typically, if we\u2019re going to do M&A, it\u2019s \u2013 because it gives us the ability to enhance our offering to customers either through technology and\/or gives us access to our markets and maybe here too for we didn\u2019t have access to.","Dmitry, I guess, if you want to take the long view, which I appreciate, certainly, our competitive position in every business, most notably, institutional is dramatically better today than it was 20 years ago, 15 years ago, 10 years ago or five years ago. We have a larger share. We\u2019ve outgrown our competitor in terms of absolute percent on double the size, I think, every year probably or close to it. I don\u2019t have all the facts, because they\u2019ve been private much of the time.","But I think we have pretty good estimates, because they were public for a period of time and that includes Europe. And our Europe business improved to just it is a tougher situation. So these are kind of relative comments. I don\u2019t feel we\u2019re impaired in Europe, or there we\u2019re missing any technology or critical competitive advantage to compete, it\u2019s just relative to the other markets. Our competitive situation undoubtedly is more challenging in Europe than it is in other places. But I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s an obstacle.","Dmitry Silversteyn","And you don\u2019t see that changing, I guess, in the next, let\u2019s call it, three to five years?","Douglas Baker","From now, I don\u2019t know. I mean, it\u2019s hard to predict. I \u2013 so I think we\u2019ll continue to get stronger over the next three to fie years, I think as we start leveraging more effectively. I mean, one of the advantages we have is size. We invest a lot more in R&D just in absolute dollars and dollars count in R&D. And we ought to continue to leverage that scale to our advantage, which I think is one of the strategies that we\u2019ve effectively utilized over the years.","And as we do this in digital is a perfect example of that developing world-class platforms and leveraging them broadly is something that we can uniquely do. We can afford to put more money into them, because we have more money. And we\u2019ll continue to do that going forward, I do believe that will translate into advantage over the next three to five years.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. Thank you, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","Scott Goldstein","Hi, this is Scott on for P.J. Thanks for taking my question. Doug, if I go back to the institutional business, I think, you had forecasted for 2018 top line growth to return to the mid single-digit range. And it did despite weaker restaurant foot traffic in the U.S. And I think, would you mind talking about some of the drivers behind that growth this year? And do you think that level of growth sustainable through 2019?","Douglas Baker","Yes. I mean, we forecast mid single digits for 2019. I don\u2019t know if it means that the points flow exactly at 5 or point faster. It\u2019s relatively the same \u2013 roughly the same type of growth rate this year. And the reason we won\u2019t see acceleration is a little bit of that conversation on softness in Europe. And as we overcome some of the losses through new business, which we\u2019ve secured, but you\u2019ve got to go install it.","So I\u2019m quite confident in our institutional business as we go forward. What drove it last year is sort of old-fashioned. We sold new business. They had a lot of very successful innovation uptake throughout both their warewash platform, as well as continued progress in their laundry platforms. Those are by far the most important factors in driving this growth and they\u2019re starting to see it more broad.","So China is moving quite nicely for our institutional business. It\u2019s going to be the most important market long-term for food service globally. So that\u2019s a very important investment area for us and an important place to see traction long-term.","Scott Goldstein","Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s all I got. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Doug, are the assets that you\u2019re expecting to spin out in the energy space expected to grow this year in line with corporate average above or below corporate average?","Douglas Baker","More in line. So, we would say, it\u2019s mid single-digit top line growth. We would expect to see margin expansion as well in the upstream business as they recoup and the significant raw material inflation that they\u2019ve seen as well. So I wouldn\u2019t say, the business is going to work dramatically different with or without it, if you will, from percentage growth and percentage OI growth.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And then just \u2013 would you just from an on the ground perspective, after you spinout this business, is there \u2013 does that give you more management wherewithal to focus on other areas of the company, or is there some commentary you could talk about in terms of the kind of executive management focus that was required for that business over the last several years? I guess, what I\u2019m getting at is beyond just kind of changes in the end markets, does this free up some management time or bandwidth to focus on the other businesses that you just didn\u2019t have beforehand?","Douglas Baker","Yes, I guess, I\u2019d answer it this way. The basis for the spin remains, the model is shifting and it\u2019s increasingly becoming less like our other businesses in terms of the disciplines and expertise you need to run it, which we talked about during the spin call. And that\u2019s really the reason that we\u2019re doing it.","I would say, an additional benefit is exactly what you said. I would certainly, if you will, kind of the models we\u2019re running are more alike, so you get more synergy in terms of management investment and time. You get more synergy in terms of uptake on specific developments. You probably will have in digital and\/or some of the other technology as we go forward.","So, yes, I think a side benefit is the company becomes arguably a little easier to run, which means more bandwidth to go drive innovation and improvement in what you\u2019re running.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Group. Please proceed with your question.","Hamzah Mazari","Good afternoon. Thank you. My question is just if you could remind us on synergies between various businesses in the portfolio? The reason I ask is, you touched on water being a significant portion of downstream. Maybe just touch on how many of your corporate customers subscribe to your entire suite of products, or however you want to answer that question, I appreciate it?","Douglas Baker","Yes. I \u2013 well, it\u2019s a hard one to answer, simply because of the breadth we have, as I mentioned 3 million customer units around the world. We don\u2019t track by, I would say, the best way to answer, I think, the heart of the question is this, there\u2019s not a customer that we sell that we couldn\u2019t double or minimum triple the business with if they ended up buying all of our offerings. And that includes our most longstanding, most highly penetrated customers. And so we have significant upside in every customer.","Now a lot of this is planned upside. We continue to invest in new technologies. Water continues to build out, if you will, their capabilities around cooling tower and Legionella detection and ultimately prevention practices. When they do that, they become \u2013 they open up the scope of offerings or customers that they can go sell to. And as a result, the opportunity continues to increase.","We\u2019ve always said, we want to grow every year and we want to grow our opportunity every year. So we don\u2019t end up running into walls like our share is too large and there\u2019s no more growth in front of us, which is a mistake too frequently made by too many companies.","So we\u2019ll make a different mistake, we\u2019re not going to make that one. So I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s passed. There\u2019s huge penetration opportunities, water huge penetration opportunity, institutional itself has significant penetration opportunities. They\u2019re getting after water filtration in a more concentrated way and a number of other technologies and there\u2019s huge upside for them in a number of their customers.","Warewash and our KAY QSR business has got significant upside potential. So there\u2019s probably not one set of customers or one set of technologies that doesn\u2019t have upside from circle to customer opportunities.","Hamzah Mazari","Great. And just a follow-up, does the spin of energy increase your appetite to do larger deals? I know you haven\u2019t done one in a while, maybe it\u2019s valuation or maybe something else, but just any thoughts there? Thank you.","Douglas Baker","Yes, I think, our appetite was plenty large to begin with. I think, it\u2019s always going to be counterbalanced with discipline. And so, yes, I think the company and the team has proven that we can successfully do whatever large deals mean deals in the billions. We would not be afraid to do that, but we aren\u2019t going to do it if we don\u2019t think the valuation is such that will enable us to have healthy returns for our shareholders.","Ultimately, that\u2019s why shareholders invest in us. You can do a lot of deals, make them accretive on EPS, but they\u2019re lousy return deals and long-term, we think it\u2019s return that drives value.","Hamzah Mazari","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer & Co. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Schneeberger","Yes, thanks. Hey, Doug, on \u2013 following Hamzah\u2019s question on M&A. The last real big win was about two years ago was Anios. Could you give us a progress report on that one? And then this conversation earlier about how Europe maybe the soft area? Going forward on a relative basis, what\u2019s your propensity to do M&A in that region specifically, might there be an opportunity upcoming? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Douglas Baker","Yes. So Anios has been very successful. And through today versus its plan is on or above plan on almost all of key metrics. And so we feel very good about how the team integrated, how Anios onboarded the cultural overlap. I mean, there aren\u2019t many areas, where we don\u2019t feel good about how healthcare is integrated that business.","So I think, it\u2019s \u2013 you would chalk it up on the success side. We typically have fairly aggressive management cases for deals. They are higher than our investment case, if you will. And so Anios is off to a good start.","In terms of Europe, as \u2013 yes, I would sort of concur that. Soft economic environments typically or can create good M&A opportunities. And if you even recall when we bought Nalco, 2011 was very early, if you will, and M&A heating back up. And for some, was a little earlier than they thought maybe was wise, at least, the first eight weeks. And so \u2013 but the consequence we bought that \u2013 the print number was like 11 EBITDA, and with synergies, it was high single digits. And it was, because it was following a big economic change.","So, yes, we\u2019ll be aggressive in looking. Our relative performance tends to do quite well in tough economic times, and we\u2019re a good cash generator. So our capabilities of doing M&A don\u2019t change demonstrably in tough economic times and our advantage probably changes more significantly up in bad economic times.","Scott Schneeberger","All right, thanks. I appreciate that. And then the other question was in the Other segment, very, very strong operating margin expansion there. I imagine a lot was because of the departure of Equipment Care. But that you\u2019d all anniversary now heading into 2019. so I\u2019m just curious what \u2013 what\u2019s a reasonable steady state the margin to expect there? And what\u2019s \u2013 what is achievable? Thanks.","Douglas Baker","Yes. Well, you\u2019re right. A big piece of that year-on-year margin growth is the fact that GCS was still partially in the base and had obviously a very low margin relative to the other businesses. So exiting that impacted it, right? It\u2019s out. So going forward, yes, I think you\u2019ll see steady improvement overall in that base.","I mean, there will be some lumpiness simply because CTG can be a little \u2013 it\u2019s a small business, but relatively lumpy. It can have some big quarters plus and some quarters not as large, if you will. Pest over time has been a very steady performer. It\u2019s one of the higher-margin businesses that we have. It\u2019s a good margin business, very commensurate with other pest businesses, if you will.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with G. Research. Please proceed with your question.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Doug, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Bioquell and how you are planning to integrate it with your \u2013 in your healthcare business? It sounds to me as though it is totally different from what you are offering. Can you give us a better feel for what you\u2019re doing with it?","Douglas Baker","Yes, happily. So Bioquell is a different business. It\u2019s really, if you will, being integrated, let me define that word for a minute in this case into our life sciences business. So there will be some application of the Bioquell technology in healthcare or acute care specifically, which isn\u2019t unusual for us. But predominantly, we view the Bioquell being targeted against the life sciences, i.e., pharma, cosmetic industries, et cetera.","The life science approach here and, if you will, the acquisition model is fairly light touch initially from an integration standpoint, often our mantra. I mean, we stole it from somebody else, is make sure do no harm. We\u2019ve got a great business with great technology, great competency in the team that we brought on.","We want to understand how we most effectively leverage, if you will, the other parts of life sciences to advantage Bioquell and vice versa. That takes time. We have a thesis going in, but you need some experience to prove and learn how do you best do that. Long-term the Bioquell capabilities are always going to be somewhat unique, and so we\u2019re always going to need, if you will, a unique center with people who are expert in specialist in that area.","So we\u2019re probably going to take more of an approach like we did with Anios, or we did with even KAY many years ago, which is utilize the asset, learn and understand the team, feed them with technology that can enhance them and learn from them how do you best, if you will, drive that business performance over time.","Rosemarie Morbelli","So I thought it was \u2013 I thought that their technology allows them to totally isolate a room if there is some kind of infection that you don\u2019t want to spread anywhere else. So how does that apply to life science and the cosmetic industry? I thought, I mean, I thought of it as acute care and hospital, not at all in life science or cosmetics?","Douglas Baker","Yes. There\u2019s times in pharma and\/or cosmetics or other manufacturing where you need to do a, if you will, kind of concentrated shutdown and comprehensive kill. And so that\u2019s not infrequent. It\u2019s an important part of the tool. It could be just parts of a manufacturing facility. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be the whole thing. It could be a specific clean room applications and others.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Oh, that is very helpful, thank you. And then, lastly, if I may, when I look at your operations, you have reached 46% to 48% gross margin. I\u2019m assuming that the Energy Upstream has lowered it in addition to the inflation and so on. But is there a chance that you can return to that particular range? And how quickly could you do that?","Douglas Baker","Yes. Well, you\u2019ve got a couple of factors, I mean, you\u2019re right. Our margins post-spin will be greater than they are pre-spin. The other factor though, if you\u2019ll recall, is the rev rec changes that we undertook, where we had, if you will, moved on the P&L geography, some of the service costs, which previously were in SG&A. It was like a 5 point \u2013 or 500 basis point change in overall gross profit, had no impact on OI, if you will. But it did have an impact on gross profit or gross margin.","With that said, certainly, I would say, you can expect, I mean, it\u2019s not hard to figure out that both our OI margin post-spin as a consequence also our ROIC post-spin will both be enhanced fairly significantly by the change.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Hauke","Great. Well, that last one actually was kind of what I was going to be asking about which was kind of structural gross margin expectation that would be aspirational from here. And I guess the second part of that question would be does pricing need to be even greater than it is or is there something else that\u2019s diluting the gross margin down, because 3% pricing is about as good as it\u2019s been really, I mean, in decade-plus.","And it seems like with raw material costs only up 4% in the outlook, all else equal, I would think that there\u2019d be a little bit more gross margin recovery than kind of flat to up slightly that \u2013 that\u2019s implied here. So is there anything else that\u2019s changed that\u2019s maybe diluting the gross margins down from where we would otherwise expect them to go to?","Douglas Baker","No, there haven\u2019t been fundamental changes. I would just say, as I mentioned earlier, last year we had 8% raw material increase. And we built a pricing through the year. Pricing in total for 2018 was 2%. It was 3% in the fourth quarter. And so we are moving in this year with a lot more momentum, obviously, than we moved into 2018.","And raw materials, while they\u2019re expected to increase, it is at a slower rate. But the most severe year-on-year comparison we\u2019re going to have on raw materials is in Q1, simply because they started moving really kind of Q2 on forward, if you will. And so the base becomes somewhat easier as you go throughout the year than it starts.","With that said, we said we don\u2019t have really any hockey stick forecast for EPS or other things. We believe we\u2019ll be able to manage through this as we go on throughout the year, but there are no other huge structural issues.","The last point I\u2019ll make is recall, we are \u2013 we\u2019ve now had 100% of our U.S. supply chain. The bulk of the supply chain moved on to SAP. And we did that all the way through 2018 and actually put the last 15% on last week successfully. And it started a year ago like mid-February, and we now have a 100% of that supply chain. That costs money. It costs money certainly in just the investment in SAP systems, you turn it on.","But probably most importantly, it creates, if you will, hijinks in your supply system as you need to move inventory around internally, as plant productivity goes down near-term, as you move them from one system to another.We said when we were going to undertake this that this would not make a quarterly call and it hasn\u2019t.","The team did a great job managing this successfully, not making this a point of distinction and it was a big, big initiative. It certainly has cost there. We will have some continuation of higher costs this year than I would call normal in our supply chain as a consequence of that. But that will bleed off as you move and exit 2019 as well and we move into 2020.","Justin Hauke","Okay, great. And then the last one, this is just purely a number question. But of the $325 million just so we can track and calibrate better on the cost savings that are expected. What\u2019s expected in the 2019 guidance specifically?","Douglas Baker","Yes, $80 million incremental versus last year.","Justin Hauke","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll turn the floor back to Mr. Monahan for any final comments.","Michael Monahan","Thank you.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I\u2019d like to turn over the call to Mr. Michael Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Michael Monahan","Thank you. Hello everyone and welcome to Ecolab\u2019s First Quarter Conference Call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab\u2019s Chairman and CEO. A copy of our earnings release and the accompanying slides are referenced in this teleconference are available on Ecolab\u2019s Website at ecolab.com\/investor.","Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on Slide 2, stating that this teleconference and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our first quarter earnings release and on Slide 2. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with an overview on Slide 3, strong new account growth and new product introductions drove a solid fixed currency sales increase in the first quarter. We leveraged that growth along with pricing, delivered product cost savings and our ongoing synergy and cost efficiency work to more than offset headwinds and increase our adjusted operating margins. These along with a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding drove an attractive adjusted earnings per share increase.","Looking ahead, we expect 2015 to be another year of superior growth despite mixed macroeconomic and market trends, as well as substantially unfavorable currency exchange and pension costs. We\u2019re seeing better sales growth in our institutional, other and industrial segments primarily resulting from internal work we\u2019ve undertaken to improve our effectiveness. In addition North America restaurant trends are showing gradual improvement. Lower oil prices have yielded lower delivered product costs, while also slowing our energy segment. Net we continue to look for a strong profit growth in the mid to high-teens before currency and pension effects. The dollar has strengthened since the last call and we now expect currency exchange will be an unfavorable $0.30 per share. With pension and unfavorable $0.09 per share, currency and pension will represent a combined unfavorable impact of nearly $0.40 per share in 2015 or $0.09 or our EPS and 10 percentage points of EPS growth.","We\u2019ve adjusted our 2015 forecast to reflect the increased headwind from currency exchange in energy markets and now look for 6% to 10% EPS growth for the full year to the 4.45 per share to 4.60 per share range as continued good fixed currency sales growth, appropriate pricing, delivered product cost savings, innovation and synergies more than offset 2015\u2019s increased challenges. We expect to show 2% to 8% adjusted earnings gain in the second quarter as currency alone represents an estimated $0.08 per share which is $0.04 more than the first quarter impact.","Moving to some highlights from the first quarter and as discussed on our press release, reported first quarter earnings per share were $0.77. On an adjusted basis excluding special gains and charges and discreet tax items from both years, first quarter 2015 earnings per share increased 8% to a record $0.80 despite a $0.06 headwind from the currencies and pension. The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by volume, appropriate pricing, synergies, new products and the lower tax rate and share count.","Our fixed currency acquisition adjusted sales growth was solid rising 4% and was led by our global institutional, other and industrial segments as each improved over its fourth quarter and 2014 growth rates. Latin America and Middle-East led the regional growth, while Europe growth also improved. Adjusted fixed currency operating income grew 7% and we expanded our operating margins by 30 basis points. We also continue to make key investments in the drivers for our future growth. We remain on plan to achieve our Nalco and Champion synergy targets and our Europe margins are on track for further strong expansion this year. In addition, we\u2019re underway with our $1 billion share repurchase and bought nearly 3 million shares in the first quarter.","Looking ahead, energy markets and some regional economies will present challenges in 2015 and the headwinds from currency exchange have only increased since we reported the last quarter. However, we also expect favorable tailwinds from lower oil cost to benefit our more consumer facing customers and we are realizing raw material savings that should improve in subsequent quarters. In this mixed environment, we will drive new business gains and lower costs as we maximize the benefits and minimize the challenges in 2015. We will once again use our product innovation and service strengths to help customers get better results and lower operating cost and through these drive new account gains across all of our segments. We expect the second quarter 2015 to show further solid fixed currency sales growth and margin improvement from our institutional, other and industrial segments as they more than offset lower energy results.","Second quarter adjusted EPS is expected to increase 2% to 8% to the $1.05 to $1.11 range as the unfavorable currency impact increases by approximately $0.04 in the quarter and we compare against last year\u2019s very strong second quarter when adjusted EPS grew 20% and was $1.03 per share. We look for the second half to show better gains as our institution, industrial and other segment sales continue to lead top-line growth. Delivered product cost savings should nearly double versus the first half and along with synergies and cost efficiencies lead to further margin expansion and yield the better EPS gains. We adjusted our forecast for the full year 2015 to reflect the increased headwinds from currency exchange in energy markets. We now look for 6% to 10% EPS growth to the 4.45 per share to 4.60 per share range with that wider than normal range reflecting the dynamic currency and commodity markets.","In summary, we believe our first quarter performed very well despite very challenging conditions. We continue to expect 2015 to show strong operating performance for the company, despite the challenges in energy and to more than offset the increased drag on EPS growth from currencies and pension. We remain confident in our business, our markets and our people as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years, while also delivering attractive returns in 2015.","Slide 4 shows our first quarter results both as reported and with adjustments for special gains and charges, while Slide 5 shows our sales growth detail. Ecolab\u2019s consolidated fixed currency sales for the first quarter increased 4%. Acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales also rose 4%. Looking at the growth components, volume and mix increased 3% and pricing rose 1%. Currency was a negative 5% and acquisitions and divestitures were not significant. Reported fixed currency sales for the global industrial segment rose 5%. Adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 3%. First quarter fixed currency global food and beverage sales increased 6%. Adjusted for acquisitions, fixed currency sales grew 4%. Food and beverage growth was primarily driven by share gains and we use them to more than offset generally weak volumes. We enjoyed good growth in agri and food and beverage and modest sales gains in dairy and food. Regionally, we saw solid gains in Latin America, Middle-East Africa, Europe and Asia Pacific with modest growth in North America.","Food and beverage continues to drive sales growth using its Total Plant Assurance approach to customers, in which we combine our industry-leading Cleaning & Sanitizing, Water Treatment and Pest Elimination capabilities to deliver improved food safety results, lower operating costs and better product quality assurance for our customers. This is enabled us to win business with key global customers and offset difficult conditions in our North America and Europe market, where lower volumes have to impact sales. ","Looking ahead, we expect improved organic sales growth in the second quarter. We look for further benefits from growth synergies, better customer penetration and new business capture, as well as leverage from our innovation pipeline, including 3D TRASAR for cleaning plate systems in food and beverage plants to more than offset continued tough industry conditions.","Fixed-currency water sales grew 5%. Adjusted for acquisitions water sales grew 3%. Fixed-currency acquisition adjusted water sales excluding mining grew 4% as good gain in the power and light industries were partially offset year weak steel industry demand. Acquisition adjusted fixed-currency mining sales were flat. Regionally, we saw strong growth in Latin America and Middle East Africa, modest growth in Europe and North America and a modest decline in Asia-Pacific sales.","The introduction of 3D TRASAR for hotel and other institutional cooling systems, utilizing solid chemistry and advanced dispensing is going well. We also continue to drive better penetration in our other water markets, using our innovative solutions to optimize water usage. We remain focused on building our corporate account and enterprise sales teams, delivering our growth synergies and improving product innovation to drive revenues. We expect to show improving growth through 2015 as market share gains drive our heavy and light businesses to outperform soft end-markets.","First quarter fixed-currency paper sales grew 2%. Latin America recorded strong growth. Elsewhere we saw overall modest gains with slight improvement in North America and lower sales in Europe and Asia-Pacific resulting from continued low customer plan utilization and extended customer shutdowns and slowdowns. We expect paper to show to modest growth in 2015 as we drive new business and technology penetration to augment stabilizing paper market conditions.","Fixed-currency sales for the Global Institutional segment rose 6%. Adjusted for divestitures sales were grew 7%. Turning to the businesses that make up the segment, fixed-currency sales growth for the Institutional business grow 6%. Adjusted for small divestiture in your sales grew strong 7%. We saw further good growth in global lodging demand, but also positive signs in North America food service foot traffic. Another regional food service foot traffic trends remain steady.","Looking at our regional sales, we continue to outperform our markets. We record strong sales growth in North America, North America, Asia-Pacific and Middle East Africa. Europe also improved reporting a moderate sales gain. Sales initiatives targeting new customers along with the effective product and service programs appropriate pricing drive our results. We continue to globalize our leading technologies as we rollout our next generation laundry platform in Europe this year. Our work to standardize global competencies and initiative is going well and they\u2019re helping to drive our sales improvements. We\u2019re also focus on strength in our execution and delivering increase customer value with solutions that reduce their water, energy and labor costs. With the work on our business fundamentals yielding good results and with end market study to improving, we look for further solid sales growth in the second quarter and for the full year.","First quarter sales for specially grew 8% in fixed currencies. Quick service sales were solid as new account, increase service coverage and additional solutions leverage generally modest industry trends to drive growth. Regionally, Europe quick service sales grew double-digits benefiting from new accounts and additional customer solutions. While Asia-Pacific also show strong gains billing on good quick service foot traffic growth North America sales rose modestly.","The food retail business posted solid double-digit sales growth benefiting from international customer additions, new products and increased penetration in North America. We look for good sales growth again in the second quarter, especially works to deliver another solid performance in 2015. Fixed currency global healthcare sales increased 5%. Sales gains were driven by new account growth, better penetration and new product introductions.","We continued our work to strengthen our corporate accounts approach and our integrated value proposition, as well as better focused on product portfolio. We believe we are on the right track and look for core global healthcare sales to show moderate growth in the second quarter and the full year. ","First quarter fixed-currency Energy segment sales rose 1%. Looking at the components our upstream business rose modestly as the decline in North America results was offset by very strong international performance. The downstream business saw a good growth also led by strong international sales and share gains in North America. ","First quarter results reflected North American drilling and well completion activity that felled much faster than once than while we expected while production gains were steady. Downstream growth stayed solid worldwide. ","Looking ahead, we now expect energy segment sales for the full year 2015 to show a low single digit decline primary reflecting faster than expected reduction in North American drilling activity and customer spending reductions. We expect that second quarter and second half energy segment sales to decline in the mid single digit range as good international growth, ongoing share gains and solid downstream sales are more than offset by lower North American upstream activity and price decreases. We expect a very challenging year particularly in the North American upstream industry. We are very experienced team in place. They have remained aggressive using our industry leading product innovation and outstanding sales and service team to drive sales and share growth and they will use this period to strengthen our position. We continue to remain confident in our energy segment and its long term growth prospects. ","Sales for other segment increased 6%. Fixed-currency Global Pest sales increased 7% in the first quarter. Adjusted for acquisitions, fixed currency sales grew 6%. Sales to Food & Beverage customers and restaurants once again led the growth. We enjoyed sales gain in all regions. We continue to drive market penetration using innovative service offerings and technologies. We also showed further progress in globalizing our market focus capabilities and field technologies. We expect Global Pest sales to show further good growth in the second quarter led by gains in all markets. ","Equipment Care sales grew 7% in the first quarter. New customer additions continued at a solid rate and productivity improvements from our technology investments and strengthened execution work continue to pay off. With solid underlying business growth trends expected to continue, we look for Equipment Care to show upper single digit growth in the second quarter and expect a strong second half.","Slide 6 of our presentation shows selected income statement items. First quarter gross margins were 46.5%. On adjusted for special charges first quarter 2015 gross margins were also 46.5% and rose 80 basis points above last year. The improvement resulted from volume and pricing gains, lower raw material cost, merger synergies and cost efficiencies.","SG&A expenses represented 34.5% of our first quarter sales. The SG&A ratio increased 40 basis points versus last year. The increase primarily reflected the impact of higher pension expense investments in the business. Consolidated operating income margins were 11.8% adjusted for special charges fixed currency operating income margins with 12% raising 30 basis points over the last year\u2019s comparable margins. Sales volume appropriate pricing, cost savings and efficiency improvements as well as merger synergies more than offset, higher pension cost and investments in the field sales force and the business. ","Fixed Currency operating income for global industry increased 5%. Acquisition adjusted operating income grew 4% and margins rose 10 basis points, pricing, volume gains, lower delivered product cost and cost efficiencies more than offset paper business exchanges. ","Fixed Currency operating income for Global Industrial increased 12% and margin expanded 80 basis points. Results benefited from volume gains pricing and cost efficiencies which more than offset business investments. Fixed currency global energy operating income increased 1% and margins were steady. Flattish volume, lower pricing and business investments were offset by lower delivered product cost synergies and cost savings. ","Fixed Currency operating income for the other segment increased 9% and margins expanded 40 basis points. improved operating results more than offset business investments and higher cost.","The corporate segment and tax rates are discussed the press release. We repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares during the first quarter. The net of this performance is that Ecolab reported first quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.77 compared with $0.62 reported a year ago. When adjusted for special gains and charges and discrete tax items in both years, adjusted earnings increased 8% to $0.80 when compared with $0.74 earned a year ago.","Turning to Slide 7 and looking at Ecolab\u2019s balance sheet, net debt to total capital is 50% with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 2.4 times. Slight increase in the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio from year end 2014 primarily reflects the first quarter share repurchase. First quarter cash flow from operations reflects the normal seasonal pattern of our business where in we typically see low income and smaller cash flow in the first half with both of them stronger in the second half. Looking ahead, and as outlined in Slide 8 we will take aggressive actions in 2015 to drive both our top and bottom lines.","We will work to leverage the benefits and offset the challenges of lower oil prices as we capture the lower raw material cost, leverage the expected consumer spending tailwind and gain share in the Energy markets. We will also continue to drive organic growth through further cooperate account wins, stepped up innovation work and improve field productivity. We still expect a very strong operating performance in 2015 showing our business balance that more than offset substantial headwinds from currency in pension. ","We expect our second quarter to show good Fixed Currency sales growth with currency negative impacting reported sales by about 6 percentage points. we look forward second quarter earnings to increase 2% to 8% to the $0.05 to $0.11 as currency becomes increasingly unfavorable with currency pension combining for a negative impact of $0.10 or approximately 10% of second quarter earnings growth. Further the second quarter will also compare against a very strong period last year when adjusted earnings per share rose 20% to $1.03. ","As mentioned earlier, we adjusted our full year outlook while we continue to expect high teens earnings growth before currency and pension. We now look for 6% to 10% EPS growth for the full year in 4.45 to 4.60 per share range as continued good fixed currency sales growth appropriate pricing delivered product cost savings, innovations in synergies more than offset the increased headwinds from currencies pension and energy. ","In summary, once again we delivered on our forecast in the first quarter with a solid fixed currency sales gain and continued margin improvement while offsetting market and currency challenges and investing in our future. We have our work cut out for us in 2015, but we are well positioned and well prepared to outperform once again and deliver another superior performance for shareholders this year and for the years ahead.","And now here is Doug Baker with some comments.","Doug Baker","Thanks Mike and hello to everybody. So, my headline for the quarter in the year would be our underlying business performance was very good and it\u2019s getting better. So all segments are growing share, all segments are executing very well, we had record new business in the quarter and that follows a huge year last year, we\u2019ve got excellent innovation programming in almost every business all segments have strengthened their teams that are doing the things they need to do built the culture. In all segments we\u2019re accelerating from Q1 versus Q4 with the exception of energy. So, what\u2019s new in the forecast, I guess I would point out three things. ","Number one; the energy markets are clearly more challenging than previously anticipated. Rigs of our declined further and faster rig counts in North America in particular, we\u2019re not expecting energy to show a modest decrease on the top line any flat to modest increase on the bottom line for the year. Offsetting the energy news, now it\u2019s a equally or more important is affect that the balance of our business will do better than originally forecasted. We\u2019re capturing the raw materials saving driven by lower oil with benefiting from improved institutional markets driven by cheaper gasoline, beyond the plus side of the oil impact we\u2019re also seeing as previously mentioned business acceleration or emerging markets were up double digits Europe top line accelerated was up 5%, 3% without energy. There is a lot of good news in our businesses around the globe. ","Our EPS delivery promote businesses at fixed rate remains at 15% which is exactly what our forecast was last call. The major optic impact the third if you will piece of news is really FX. And so this certainly colors a result, but I don\u2019t believe this is a strategic issue for our business because most of our cost are incurred in the selling currency, but this does not dictate our competitiveness when we compete around the world. I also believe based on history it\u2019s almost certainly going to reverse itself someday. We\u2019ll probably all enjoy that. ","The perspective in our forecast FX is a $0.30 hit for the year or 7% that is $0.04 worse than the last call. The perspective around $0.30 this is 40 times worse than our 10 year average move, so this is truly outsize it is 3x worse than our next highest impact over the last 10 years. So I think it\u2019s hard to wrap minds around this. We\u2019ve been dealing with this for a while and it certainly has a big impact on how results look. The important thing is that we want to continue to focus on what we need to do to drive our business, drive value and drive returns. And as our FX forecast implies, I think the team is doing a lot of good things. ","At constant FX, our new forecast is 14% to 17% adjusted EPS that compares to the last forecast of 14 to 19, net we trim the top that really reflects the belief that we aren\u2019t going to see any material improvement in our markets in time to impact this year. So we do anticipate the mid to upper-teen performance ex-FX. Clearly I think the team is doing a right stop to focus on the things to drive value and returns. They all will renew business. They all will renew innovation. We know these are the two drivers of organic sales acceleration and that\u2019s a primary driver of improved returns. ","We\u2019re doing a great job on team and talent building. We\u2019ll continue to invest in both and we continue to make sizable investments in process and system improvements which we know are key to our long term health. So we continue to be well positioned. We continue to build market position. I feel great about our ability to delivery another strong year, while improving ability of the business to perform over the long haul.","So with that, I\u2019m going to turn it back to Mike and then we\u2019ll go to Q&A.","Michael Monahan","Thanks Doug. A final note before we start Q&A. We plan to hold our annual tour of our booth at the National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago on May 18th. Looking further ahead, we also plan to hold our 2015 Investor Day in Saint Paul on September 10. If you have any questions, please contact my office.","That concludes our formal remarks. Operator, please begin the question and answer period.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We ask that you limit yourself to one question and a brief related follow up question per caller, so that others will have a chance to participate. First question comes from Mike Ritzenthaler with Piper Jaffray.","MikeRitzenthaler","Doug just wanted to drill little bit more into the new business wins on the sustained good growth within institutional. Is there a way to parse out the things like new product launches and account wins versus end market health? From your prepared comments it seems like 2015 is setting up for a healthy pace of account wins after a very productive 2014.","Doug Baker","Yes in our institutional business in the segment there are other businesses besides institutional grew 7% in the quarter and clearly I would say I think like a point of the acceleration is probably just market improvement as a consequence of lower gasoline particularly in the U.S. where it\u2019s fully reflected because currency hasn\u2019t eroded simultaneously. And I would say though the other acceleration and you\u2019ve seen steady acceleration quarter by quarter for the last five plus quarters is really a consequence of continued driving \u2013 I mean continually driving new business performance. Last year I think we talked about when we looked at net new business gains when you look at on annualized contribution we were up 45% versus the prior year. I mean we glued out of the water institutional is one of the real leaders in that whole area.","We\u2019re up another 10% cumulatively in the first quarter versus last, that\u2019s netting our losses, so we\u2019ve really I think done a very good job there, but clearly we are gaining share. I think it\u2019d be hard to argue that the food service and hospitality businesses are growing at 7%. So we are I think outperforming. Europe grew an institutional roughly 3% when it controlled for divestitures almost in every market we see real strength.","MikeRitzenthaler","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on energy, if the business slow and faster than expected would that not also mean that potentially and recovery in growth to mid-single-digit growth or happen faster as well. So we can look at the potential for that business into 2016s for all obviously with the -- that we\u2019ve got a stable energy price environment?","Doug Baker","Yeah, I mean I guess, you would certainly argue that the first quarter basis a little easier that we have forecasted previously. So I think I would speak to, if you think oil is going to stay in the same range as it is now through \u201916, which is what our assumption is. And we think energy next year recovers in this call it mid, it\u2019s mid-single-digit growth and that\u2019s going to be accelerating throughout the year.","Operator","Next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nate Brochmann","Hello everyone. Just a follow-up and just a little bit more basically on the last question. In terms of the new business wins and obviously again great performance their. But you guys have always been great at going after business wins and the new product introductions et cetera and obviously Europe is doing well on that front as well.","Is there any tricks or any differences in terms of what\u2019s going to on today versus what you\u2019ve done in terms of great performance over last X number of years. In terms of why this could be a permanent infection point or why this is accelerating at such the rate is it. Changing customer behavior is it a better understanding the value proposition or is it internal tricks that you\u2019ve made in the selling approach?","Doug Baker","Well, I think is a couple of things, a lot of new touch on. But I guess, I would highlight one of the things that we said we want to drive when we bought the WPS business was really leveraging Ecolab\u2019s now how on enterprise selling in that market. That business and team done a lot of really solid things we\u2019ve obviously stole in a lot of their processes and apply them our businesses, but one of the things that we wanted to transfer, if you will 1 WPS was the enterprise selling, view, skills and focus that we have an F&B institutional --.","And I think we\u2019re doing a very good job of doing that, we\u2019ve taken a number of their top sales people, we\u2019re taking them through the same skill development that we\u2019ve taken Ecolab both through the years, but we have a broader based. So that\u2019s one and I would say we\u2019ve done better on training and better on fundamentals. Second is innovation and so a lot of the things that we\u2019ve been working on over the last five to seven years that are now -- are really getting innovation with a very sharp point and that point is we will give you world class results but we\u2019re do it and reduce energy and water footprint. And that resonate I\u2019d say in good and bad time, I\u2019d say every business is got pretty aggressive sustainability goals, we can help need those while delivering cost savings and continued to their foot safety and\/or efficacy performance objectives and that\u2019s become I think even more relevant particularly the new types of environment where we\u2019ve got water scarcity energy concerns and like around the world.","Nate Brochmann","And just I mean what that mean that like with California going throughout the draw out issues is that been extra area of growth for you to kind of reinforce step point?","Doug Baker","Yes, without a doubt, we\u2019ve got a team of over a 1,000 California focus right now and delivering our world class water technology solutions throughout the industries that we serves, I don't and care if it\u2019s light industry like hospitality or light manufacturing all the way to heavy industries. We are all over the situation there. The edit from governor ground or the 25% savings, it\u2019s really focused on 25% of the water users, because so far agree it\u2019s been sort of off on the side line, but that 25% is at the hard of what we do. So we\u2019re all over trying to help them one at least need that target is probably going to have to do better that than long-term and make sure that they can get the water if they need to operate.","Nate Brochmann","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just the follow-up on energy two just feel more specific. But I mean we\u2019re all quarter-to-quarter assuming stable from here and obviously one of the hallmarks of Ecolab is just overall predictability and things obviously slip here a little bit faster in the first quarter from where we started out from. What gives you the level of confidence at this point and don\u2019t get me wrong if you had perfect confidence you\u2019d probably be doing something else even, but what gives us the level of confidence at this point that we are stabilizing in terms of your customers and then the ultimate end market demand in terms of whether it\u2019s rig count or the new projects et cetera and clearly production seems to have stabilized, but like in terms of some of that new business where you got that higher margin from.","Doug Baker","Well I guess I would say one let me enter a little bigger \u2013 from a little bigger perspective. Like our operating model I think it\u2019s proven its resilience, so our forecasted delivery if you will from our combined institutional, industrial, energy and other segments hasn\u2019t changed on iota.","So our energy softened, the other businesses strengthened, some of its exact mirror reflection of the same issue and so we basically said while we have a bias towards higher oil prices, it is not a huge bias and we will perform well in the low oil environment or a high oil environment. For this year, we anticipate operating delivery EPS to be around 15% which is exactly what we forecasted in the last call.","So I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any question about the resilience. I think we\u2019re seeing it come through. If you look at energy in particular look I think the team is on exactly where you\u2019d want them to be on. Energy is more cyclical if our cyclicality means basically flat sales in Ol at the bottom of the trop I don\u2019t know how you called it cyclical. If you draw it on a graph, it\u2019s a flat piece of a graph before you start going up again.","And that\u2019s exactly what we anticipated, that\u2019s what we talked about that we saw when we did the analysis of the last drop in \u201908, \u201909 it\u2019s basically what we\u2019re forecasting right now and the team is on new technology we\u2019ve got some great new launches. We\u2019ve got stuff that\u2019s going to make fracs much more efficacious while reducing water substantially and this is exactly what this industry needs. I think we\u2019re going to be positioned with more sail when the wind starts blowing in our direction and that\u2019s what the team is focused on. So I don\u2019t know I think the model is doing pretty well. You got to get under the covers if there\u2019s down FX news and look at the underlying business and I guess I would only offer this, if FX was a $0.30 help I think you guys would be looking deeply to say how the heck is the core business performing. And I think those are the fundamental questions to long term value that have got to be asked and I think when they\u2019re asked and addressed here they look pretty good.","Operator","Next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.","Gary Bisbee","[indiscernible] and I guess Mike you\u2019ve said that you expect the second half to look better from an earnings growth perspective than the first and I understand that the raw material cost benefit increases. Is that the primary driver of that statement or are you expecting the revenue growth acceleration you\u2019ve seen in the last quarter or two on a constant currency basis in non-energy to continue into the back half of the year?","Michael Monahan","Yes I think you got it Gary its continued strong sales performance from the non-energy segments. The energy as we already forecasted and you\u2019re right, the raw material savings grow as the year goes simply because it takes a while for it to work through inventory. And so we anticipate that we will have significantly more benefit in Q2, Q3 and Q4 than we had in Q1.","Gary Bisbee","And then as a follow up I guess I\u2019d like to ask about the record bookings again. I think it\u2019s a third straight quarter you\u2019ve talked about that, but you\u2019ve got a pretty sticky business right and so and my guess is that much more of the revenue base comes from people using hopefully more but same customers using similar volumes. So how much really does record bookings if you have it for two quarters to three quarters or four quarters impact growth in any given year? Is it right to think that it\u2019s a fairly modest improvement, but if you do it year after year that\u2019s what really drives revenue?","Michael Monahan","No I mean clearly it will add a point or two of growth, it\u2019s not going to add 8 points of growth but it\u2019s a very important metric because it basically \u2013 we\u2019re going head to head versus competition who\u2019s winning and so we look at this metric and then work very hard to understand how we\u2019re doing in each of our businesses and versus key competitors because at the end of the day also the business is going to be dictated by how successful we are securing new business and obviously keep our existing customers.","So for us it\u2019s one of the leading indicator metrics that we look at, where we get to health of innovation portfolio, the health of the team and also just strength of our overall metrics to customers is resonating or not. But ultimately we\u2019re epic growth driver but it\u2019s not on outsized, but a point or two every year comes from this. ","Gary Bisbee","And is the big part of this just having had time to effect improvement at the Nalco and Champion businesses or is it really very broad based across all the businesses. Thank you. ","Michael Monahan","It\u2019s a broad based, I would say we reenergize the focus here, I think we also supplemented with stronger training in development focused for our corporate account professional who are the ones who lead this charge and I think it\u2019s a combination of those plus as I mentioned earlier innovation. And really at the end of the day what\u2019s new, what you\u2019re talking to customer about, what is the benefit of moving to us. That\u2019s going to be obviously pretty going stronger, you\u2019re not going see new business results like this. ","Operator","Question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Doug, just back on energy, you mentioned pricing pressure, where are you seeing the pricing pressure and how do you think that reverses or how do you think it reverses going forward?","Doug Baker","We\u2019re seeing pricing pressure fairly broad it was anticipated because it\u2019s not that similar from pricing pressure that is been realized by that business in other downturns. Right now I would say that pricing pressure which we would love to have none is close to forecast. And so the closer you are well head the higher the pressure in the business simply because that\u2019s where it\u2019s more acutely felt in that industry but this pressure throughout. ","David Begleiter","And in energy going forward post the realization synergies if you do achieve 5%, 6% topline growth, what should OI grow operating profit, at what rate on that type of sales growth?","Doug Baker","I think 5%, 6% will get you into the double digit. ","Operator","Next question comes from David Ridley from Lane with Banc of America.","David Ridley","So paper margins were a bit of a drag in the quarter even though you did have some topline growth. Is this more about shifting regional demand and would you expect paper margins to be flattish for the full year?","Doug Baker","Yes. In the quarter it was more a mix issue in paper, I think the good news is we saw paper fuel sales rebound obviously it was a negative for majority of last year and so we thought about 2.5% growth in this quarter. For the year our anticipated margins in paper are going to be we think it they\u2019ll up. ","David Ridley","Okay, great. And then heard you alluded to some of the investments you are making in the energy segment. Maybe a few examples of that. And also would the proposed fracking regulations on federal land be a potential positive catalyst for your business? Thanks.","Doug Baker","We don\u2019t see any capital impact in our business or any material change versus what we\u2019ve talked about going forward and in terms of investments in energy if we talked about investments in the first quarter some of that were investments made last year as we lap first quarter. But we aren\u2019t adding headcount obviously in the energy business this year. So, we are going to have material investments in terms of SG&A. we are continuing to investment in innovation because we believe that is core to our advantage in that market we will continue to see investments there. ","Operator","Next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. So firstly, just wanted to clarify your sort of renewed assumptions that you made on Energy. I think last quarter you told us on the rig count side you had assumed it was down 30% plus some share gain. So I was wondering if you could just help us understand what you are thinking in these new forecasts?","Doug Baker","I think before we thought they would be down 30 to 40 for the year, they already down at that rate right now and now they\u2019re forecast out there of 50% to 60% decline pretty good in North America. I mean, we\u2019re going to be, we are going to present ourselves as the lead forecast either rig count and\/or certainly oil price as we go forward. But certainly I think, you can\u2019t read a player in the energy industry world that as I comment that the decline of which has surprised them in terms of debt and speed and we would add our ourselves to that room which I\u2019d say is full of people.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. I guess what I\u2019m trying to get add is I guess do you see any room for further downside just outside of the FX headwinds?","Doug Baker","Well, I can\u2019t, yeah and I guess, I would see room for upside too. Right now the forecast that we have is our best estimation of 50-50. And I would say in total from an operating standpoint as I million earlier or forecast in total have changed. So the elements of change, energy got worse and the other business is got better, net it\u2019s about -- and all I know was next time we\u2019re talking, we\u2019ll have some changes in our forecast, but I don\u2019t believe our forecast on operating performance for the year in total is highly risks.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. And then on the FX side, obviously every company out there is getting hit and it seems like it probably gets worse too. But at some point does the pressure from FX force you to make any operational changes in the different regions or is it just purely translational and when it goes down you get the hit and when it goes up you will start seeing a benefit?","Doug Baker","Yes, by and large most of its optics it\u2019s translation of locally generated operating profit translated back in the dollars. Now with that said, there are certainly some items that we manufacture in one currency and selling another. And we are looking in all those items, you got to be very careful not to change currency. And so if we can see that we can safe money under any currencies scenario, we will make the moves. If it is a move dependent on a strong dollar, you got to be very careful, because by the time you finish executing the dollar can reverse sign and you are now unhappy for a different reasons.","So we\u2019ve been through this next 40 or in 88 that Euro I mean we\u2019ve seen both over our in-time operating these businesses and all I know is going to change again, I just can\u2019t tell you when. So we when operate in the smart way and not chase currency, but certainly there are sub situations that we\u2019ll require us addressing we\u2019ll make sense in today\u2019s environment and even in tomorrow.","Operator","Next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, this is Dan -- for Laurence. Will you guys be buying shares at the current rate or we should become more attractive with that accelerate?","Michael Monahan","We\u2019ll continue to be buying shares over the balance of the year.","Doug Baker","What the target that we\u2019ve said originally for the year is the same.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then one more question. So you\u2019re seeing a tailwind from raw material costs, but I think you said that also we\u2019re increasing prices for certain segments. Are you seeing, I mean is there would you expect any push back against that just given, I don\u2019t know your input costs or going down at all, is that help works?","Doug Baker","Yes, look I mean what we always get push back and pricing that sort of the given. But we\u2019re seeing one to two pricing in the balance of the segment X energy, which is what we expected.","Operator","Question comes from John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity.","John Quealy","Hi, good afternoon. First question can we go back to your visit lower oil for outcast the sales. Can you comment by segment, have you been capturing those savings yet, when should we expect to see the full benefit of the oil in the cost side and I have a follow-up?","Doug Baker","Well, I would say we gave, our forecast on raw material benefit for the year remain the same it was last call. And when we gave the chart last time I think we dictated how it\u2019s going to show up first quarter and second half and obviously it was remaining of the year waited as I discussed in the previous question. We have not broken it out if you will by segment nor do we plan to do that, so in the first quarter it was roughly a nickel. We anticipate it to be $0.32 for the balance of the year, so $0.37 in total.","John Quealy","And then second follow up more of a macro question, so Premax after many months is finally getting a little closer May and July of detailing out service contracts as well as oil field auctions. How does that impact your business? Is there an additional opportunity for Premax I know you folks do a lot with some sovereign producers if you could just comment on Mexico? Thank you.","Doug Baker","Yes as we believe the move in Mexico is favorable and will be positive for our energy business.","Operator","Next question comes from Mike Harrison with Global Hunter Securities.","Mike Harrison","In the healthcare business you noted new accounts but also improved penetration and showed some of the best growth that you\u2019ve seen there in quite a while. You do have a fairly broad suite of products there.","What do you usually lead with in healthcare? What\u2019s the ware washing equivalent? And how much bigger does the overall opportunity get as the penetration increases toward the full range of offerings?","Doug Baker","Well the big wins that we highlighted in late last year and are clearly the driver for the growth acceleration were around the environmental hygiene offering or the program that we\u2019ve developed to reduce infections contracted in hospital by patients and importantly we think that\u2019s a program that we want to continue to focus on and drive and leverage because it\u2019s our anchor program much like if you will, dish machine or ware-washing it\u2019d be an anchor program and institutional or CIP and F&B et cetera.","So the fact that we\u2019re seeing success there I think bodes well because that\u2019s basically what you\u2019ll build-up of to drive further penetration as you move forward. So I think healthcare showed improvement, the year has shown improvement in the fourth quarter which was consistent with the timing we talked about last year during this call that we wanted to work on our fundamentals in 2014 I think the team did a good job. We started showing benefits at the end of the year and you saw that was a 5% top-line growth in this quarter in healthcare which was certainly better than we saw last year.","Mike Harrison","And on the energy side, it sounds like the international side was quite a bit better and when I think international I think more offshore and obviously new CapEx has been an important driver particularly in the offshore business for you guys. Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of offshore CapEx projects going forward? Are they being delayed? Are they being delayed indefinitely or just pushed out a few quarters?","Doug Baker","Yes I mean some have been pushed out and delayed I would say we are having still significant success securing new CapEx projects which you\u2019re right it\u2019s been a core part of the strategy and a successful part. We\u2019re not walking away from that. The team has secured a lot of business this year. That business won\u2019t come on until in many cases even \u201918 and \u201919 that\u2019s the type of pipeline that we have here, but we feel good about what they\u2019re doing.","A lot of the CapEx that was if you will initiated several years ago that we had secured. Some has been delayed. Some of it is coming on obviously offshore continues to move on and progress. You\u2019ve built the big piece of CapEx. You\u2019re going to go deploy it. The money is already sunk and so that continues to move forward. What we\u2019re seeing mostly is a huge decline in unconventional onshore and that\u2019s where you have a lot of the pressure. It is the part of the industry that can move with the market and does move with the market probably most rapidly but that\u2019s where the most the queue pressure is.","Mike Harrison","And then last one for me, do you expect any impact from Bird Flu on the F&B business in the rest of the year?","Doug Baker","I think when we it\u2019s certainly going to have an impact on a number of important customers of ours. Typically when you end up with shortage of one protein consumers adjustments are buying more of another protein and our exposure across protein sources is pretty wide. So, I don\u2019t anticipate it\u2019s going to make the call.","Operator","Next question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","John McNulty","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So Doug, I think you had said earlier if energy prices kind of level off here, you are kind of looking at for next year mid single-digit growth in Energy and it kind of accelerates throughout that period. I guess how do you get to that? When you think about the major buckets that will drive that growth, what are they in kind of a flat $60 oil, $55, $60 oil range? ","Doug Baker","I think you start doing is annualizing against the very significant reaction and decline and activity. I think you\u2019ve got a couple other things happening, you\u2019ve got some 4,000 wells that are temporary capped, people going to have to deal with this because they have about 12 months under current law to get after these and deal with it which means Q4, Q1 activity. Our guess is the majority of those, we\u2019re going to be brought online, the pricing pressure that we are filling now or annualize against and that\u2019s -- and you\u2019re going to have constant to mannerly increased production next year versus this year. But you won\u2019t have the price pressure that we have going on this year so you could see better sales from that and ultimately we even thinking downstream. We had some minor impacts in Q1 this year from the refinery strikes which were over and we will again annualize against next year. ","John McNulty","Okay. When you think about pricing, kind of in the core or legacy Ecolab businesses, it seemed like pricing was always pretty much either stable or up modestly and it looks like you are seeing some negative pricing pressures in the energy markets at a minimum in kind of a new parts of Ecolab. How do you think about being able to get that pricing back? It always seems like giving up price easy maybe isn't the right word but it happens. Getting it back tends to be tougher so I guess how do you think about working with your customers and making sure you can get the pricing back?","Doug Baker","The majority of this impact is coming from cost plus contracts that we have with major energy supplier. So when our energy prices go down and oil and raw material inputs go down as a result that ends up reflecting in the formula and worse when energy and raw materials go up it\u2019s going to be reflected in the pricing because that\u2019s the arrangement we have with those customers. ","So, it\u2019s not like we negotiated the price decrease we\u2019re going to have to renegotiate price increase in most of these cases, most of its formula here. ","John McNulty ","Okay, so it is really just price pass-throughs then or cost pass-through, it is not a true give back on price, is that right?","Doug Baker","A significant portion of it, there are some that would a give back on price but the vast majority is contractual. ","Operator","Next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","Good afternoon. Doug, I think in last quarter's release you were optimistic about acquisitions for the coming year. Could you give us an update on the environment out there?","Doug Baker","I remain optimistic, there is a number of things and number of opportunities that we\u2019re chasing some of them quite a ways long in the process. So, I still remain bullish on being successful in this environment making some key acquisitions. ","John Roberts","And then back to the food and beverage segments since it is the highest growth Industrial segment for you, there were a couple of high-profile dairy contaminations over the past quarter. Are there any trends there or are there just greater levels of detection going on that are going to cause customers to have to clean more intensely or anything else we might translate more across the overall segment rather than just a couple of isolated events?","Doug Baker","What I would say, food safety in general is food producers are always constantly on high alter and nature has its ways. It\u2019s a difficult game and on the producers by and large doing a amazing job if you look at the number of meals served. Just take it in this country and the number of incidents, it is an amazingly low number given number of meals consumed, With that said, I don\u2019t think this is a big trend, I don\u2019t think vigilant way, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s turn in the United States up, because I think it\u2019s in a high level. I do think in emerging markets you\u2019re going to continue to see height in awareness, height scrutiny and height in consumption, but that\u2019s mostly were you\u2019re going to see it.","Operator","Next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Couple of questions, first of all can you differentiate in the performance, if there was any between new international and your domestic pest elimination business?","Doug Baker","Yeah about the same really on top-line both very good. North America, which I think we talked about a couple of years ago with disappointing, is really done a good job rebuilding their sales acceleration. They\u2019ve made a lot of, I think very smart investments with the team. There is a lot of improvement from their business. I\u2019m very bullish on what past team is done and the outlook. And particularly our North America, we done have the same if you will turn down internationally that business is remain consistently strong.","Dmitry Silversteyn","Okay. And the food and beverage question as previous call is pointed out this business is done well for you or it\u2019s a result or at least in this quarter, it\u2019s a quarter of many years of work and getting traction in some of the progress and programs. In sort of combining food and beverage to the healthcare if you will, I don\u2019t think you guys do a lot currently in sort of clean in place of pharmaceutical production facilities. Is that I\u2019m I correct first of all, this is not an important market for you yet and is there an opportunity given your, it\u2019s a great in place in food and beverage and then given you bio-science and antimicrobial capabilities and healthcare too to perhaps go after this market a little bit more aggressively?","Doug Baker","Yeah, I would say CIP opportunity is beyond food and beverage exists and certainly pharmaceuticals would be a good example there others as well. And that\u2019s exactly how we look at extensions. So either try to sell more to the existing markets. So you try to follow your technology to its natural end. And so certainly that would be an example of an area that you could push CIP and do.","Dmitry Silversteyn","And my one final question in terms of your traditional Cleaning & Sanitizing business as in Europe versus North America. Where do you stay in terms of rolling out the more complete product line-up if you will in Europe to match about what you have in the U.S.. Are you pretty much fair is that ahead of the time schedule and have there been any sort of early indications of success of getting growth accelerated given a fuller tool box for you sales people to go after market with.","Doug Baker","Yeah, I think we mentioned or I did Europe sales were up 5% or 3% X energy for the quarter. Which is substantially higher than we\u2019ve announced and quite a while in Europe. I think you reflects exactly what you talked about, we have, we will behind in innovation in Europe was a consequence of our EBS\/SAP program. We\u2019ve got free to product line for a couple of years, while you\u2019re putting that just in place that has unfrozen, we\u2019ve been launching our technology over there for the last couple of years starting to make headway in particular in both F&B and institutional. And so that one of the reasons that you\u2019ve see sales acceleration in Europe. We expect sales to be positive for the year in Europe and it\u2019s really as a result of the new business which attribute in -- innovation.","Operator","Question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Bob Koort","Thanks. I appreciate the overtime here. Doug could you talk a little bit, I guess, I envision your energy business, you\u2019d characterize is it some point having a similar business model approach to the traditional business of having feed on the street or folks out in the customers facility. I\u2019m just curious, how quickly can you dial down those costs if you need to another words.","If you typically having several employees out of these well ahead on the exploration production side and now you seen this big drop up in North America unconventional. Can you dial down those expenses just as quickly as you move them up or you have to absorb that until you see some recovery in those markets?","Doug Baker","Yes, the real pressure in that business really is in the production phase. It\u2019s closer to the wellheads.","It\u2019s in our WellChem business. The WellChem business isn\u2019t a people intensive business I\u2019d say a production or OFC business or our downstream business. There are certainly costs that we continue to take out. There is much a part of the synergy program that was put in place with Champion as they are anything else.","We certainly are accelerating some of those moves as a consequence of the market, but really it\u2019s still in line with what we anticipated creating once we got through the synergy moves with Champion. And so G&A rightsizing that and doing all those things, we are looking at how do you accelerate it, but in line with anticipated ultimate goal that we saw once we put Champion and Nalco energy together. So are there opportunities in the field? Yes they\u2019re small. We tend not to go, we don\u2019t want to create a overreaction in that business too. I think I would remind you we expect sale to be roughly in line with last year. We\u2019ve got this monstrous degradation in activity in our business like there are in other businesses and so I would call this not a decline, but sort of a pause in the growth and we anticipate re-growing next year and that\u2019s how we\u2019re managing the business.","Bob Koort","And my last question if I might, can you just help us characterize the energy business in total maybe geographic spread or upstream, downstream, refining just some shares of the business scale the business?","Michael Monahan","Be around top of my head. All right \u2026","Bob Koort","I could follow up with Mike if you want...","Doug Baker","I\u2019m saying again it\u2019s a lot of model flush. North America is about 60% of our business in total and then when you look at the balance you\u2019ve got fairly little more in Latin America, Middle-East Africa would be next and then AP. Okay as you balance out the other regions, Europe is really North Sea type production. If you want to look at the rest of the business roughly WellChem was 17% last year it\u2019s probably going to drop to about 15% this year and then you really split the rest you\u2019ve got about 60% production phase and then the balance is downstream. That\u2019s how\u2026","Operator","Next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","I just have a few kind of housekeeping questions and how it relates to the business. There is a little bit of move up in receivables and more of a move up in inventory. Can you talk a little bit on the receivable side? How much would that might be related to energy and your confidence in trying to covering those? And then just on the inventory side. Is that a investment in growth and where exactly was the build-up? Thank you.","Doug Baker","Yes I believe I\u2019d say this way working capital one of our highlight in the quarter and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re all over as a team so there\u2019s three buckets. One you pointed out was receivables. That was really just a handful of large customers. It was a timing issue. All those have been resolved. That is not a systemic issue at all. And there was a couple of energy but a couple of other customers it wasn\u2019t exclusively energy but those payments came and it was really just timing at the end of the quarter.","You\u2019ve also got inventory. I would say you got two things going on inventory, one energy inventory build because we weren\u2019t able to turn production off as quickly as the business declined and as we previously mentioned the business declined quicker than we anticipated, so call that 30 million bucks in inventory. That will get out of the system, but that\u2019s going to take a couple of turns to do as we go through. And then you\u2019ve got payables and payables was higher I mean it sucked up more of our working capital. It\u2019s probably easiest to say that was an internal different execution that we don\u2019t plan on repeating. That would be the [indiscernible] get to that, so working capital for the year I think we will be moving in the right direction and we also have I think very good plans we have very favorable cash flow for the year.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Do you have a kind of range or targeting for the year for the free cash flow number?","Doug Baker","90%.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","On net income?","Doug Baker","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Co.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Most of my questions have been answered but I was just wondering on the Energy side, Doug, let's assume that oil stays where it is today and you have some kind of a normal growth rate next year, can you make it all up in 2016 or will you need to go through 2017 before you catch up on whatever you missed in 2015? ","Doug Baker","I think you are talking about top line OI growth.","Q - Rosemarie Morbelli","Both.","Doug Baker","I don't think you cannot make up the complete bill. I guess if we assume that the businesses really go double digit topline and extend margin and have 15% -- bottom line forever, you can never make it up. But that was never our forecast. We always knew when we bought this business. We you it should be overall of faster growth business, top and bottom, but was also going to go through some oil cycles where like '08 - '09, we thought we are going to see a pause in sales in OI growth. I guess next year, as I mentioned earlier, mid-single-digit top, double-digit bottom -- if oil stays, I don't know 60 plus-minus range for another year after that, I would expect it will be accelerating growth in '17 even with the kind of oil forecast.","Most conventional guesses is oil will probably rise over time. I don't think we are going to be completely different upon it. But if it does, I think it's going to be a benefit for the business.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay, thanks and then quickly on Europe, other companies are seeing some improvement on the demand side. I know you grew 5% or 3% excluding Energy but do you see that as a result of what you are doing in-house or are you also getting some help from the market itself or at least expecting more help in the second half? ","Doug Baker","As I mentioned earlier in Europe, the changes like, I don't know, down one up one. It's not the most dynamic economy right now. It's hard for us to feel exactly the effects of those small moves. I would say we think it's more on our back and I think we stated before it we are flat. It was more focused on margins, trying to hold sales, so we can get the P&L for the future so that when we grow we get leverage. And right now I would say it's more of our efforts than the market.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay and if I can squeeze one more, on the Equipment Care, revenues up 7% in constant currency, that is quite high. Do you anticipate that kind of growth rate for the balance of the year and do you see margins continuing to improve after you have done all of the restructuring and reshuffling of your business model? ","Doug Baker","Yes and yes. Equipment care is on a good path.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Baird.","Andy Wittmann","Doug, last quarter I think you talked about your ability to manage the business and how after a couple of years of a pretty good performance that you were worried about that -- I don't know if you used the word complacency but you talked about the fact that there might be opportunities that you could go to if you needed to. With Energy taking a slight step down here, have you gone to any of those other -- I don't know, contingencies or are you contemplating them today? Is the business at a level where you need to go to some of those? ","Doug Baker","We always wish you had these huge file drawers full of money ideas, I mean we have several, I wish we had more, like every CEO in the land. Now I would say we were pushing -- I think the team is doing a great job. I used the analogy last time that you know if it's a plain ride we are going to land in the right city on time, but it could be a turbulent ride. And I think the team is managing through a lot of turbulence. Making sure that you capture all these raw materials, and they show up in the P&L isn\u2019t like a layout. I mean we had purchasing on suppliers early securing the business, we have to make sure the R&D that had shown up in the mix properly, and then we understood the impact.","The supply chain has been all over this. Our team is within all over it. It has been a lot of incremental effort. Meanwhile, we continue to drive new business and innovation. So I think the team has managed this very successfully and I think it does -- if anything I think were showing the robustness of the model, you are a work through the damn clouds of FX. If you do it you'll see it. There are still huge margin opportunities. We'll talk synergies for one more year. We are then going to flip and no longer use the word synergy and start talking cost savings. But the cost savings that are out there is a consequence of both a Nalco merger and the Champion deal, still remains, they're are still significant. Because you really -- it takes a long time to get after the supply chain savings. ","It takes a long time to get after some of the regional savings. Because he got to implement systems, and when you're running two systems and you have two legal entities that precludes capturing some of the savings that you would normally get after, and doing that in a sensible way just takes time. And we didn't see any reason to create undue risk that could create havoc with our customers so we have done this over -- I think a very thoughtful period. But you're going to see those benefits show up in the business, which is why we talk our model. 60 is organic, 2 to 3 additional points from acquisition, and collect 50 basis points to 75 basis points a year in leverage. That's how you continue to drive. And other things you're flipping in our favor. So we do like our position. I think we're executing quite well. I think will do well, not only this year, but in the coming years.","Operator","The last question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","I guess on the Industrial business, Global Industrial, could you discuss a little bit about how you anticipate margins will build our progress over the balance of the year, maybe some of the drivers and some of the headwinds facing them? ","Doug Baker","The industry margins we anticipate continued to strengthen some. Some is just a consequence of seasonality where we always had better margins in the other years, but you also get to see some raw material benefit as we discussed in the other business flow through and these businesses as well. So I think innovation, raw material flow through and volume, you'll see margin increase for the year.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Monahan for closing comments.","Michael Monahan","Thanks everyone for your time today.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Mike Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Thank you Mr. Monahan you may now begin.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","Thank you. Hello everyone and welcome to Ecolab's third quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. A discussion of our results along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor.","Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials, stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described under Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our most recent Form 10-K, in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with a brief overview of the results. Ecolab's solid growth momentum continued in the third quarter. New business gains, accelerating pricing and product innovation drove strong third quarter acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales growth in all of our business segments. That strong top line growth along with cost efficiency and reduced tax rate yielded the third quarter's 11% adjusted earnings per share increase.","Moving on to some highlights from the quarter and as discussed in our press release, acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increased 7% with strong growth across all business segments. Regionally sales growth was led by North America and Latin America. Adjusted fixed currency operating income rose 6% continuing the acceleration shown throughout 2018. The operating income gain along with the lower tax rate yielded 11% increase in third quarter 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share.","We continue to work aggressively to drive growth winning new business through our innovative new products and sales and service expertise, as well as driving pricing productivity and cost efficiencies to grow our top and bottom lines at improved rates. We also continue to see solid underlying sales volume and pricing across all of our business segments.","However after offsetting the bulk of $0.75 per share of increased delivered product cost and currency exchange headwinds since our initial 2018 forecast, we expect the fourth quarter will see further significant increases that leave insufficient time to offset them this year. We now expect 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share to rise 11% to 13% to the $5.20 to $5.30 range as volume and price gains offset the impact of higher delivered product cost and business investments. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be up 8% to 15% to the $1.49 to $1.59 range. Work on the previously announced $200 million cost savings initiative, which is leveraging our recent technology and systems investments is making good progress and will benefit the fourth quarter.","In summary, we expect continued strong top line momentum in our business over the balance of the year to more than offset higher costs and deliver operating income growth and along with cost efficiency actions and a lower tax rate yield 11% to 13% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth this year. Importantly despite the significant headwinds we are continuing to make the right investments in key areas of differentiation, including product innovation and digital investments to develop superior growth for the future and we expect to sustain strong momentum as we exit the year.","And now here's Doug Baker with some comments.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Thanks Mike. In short, I'm happy with our business performance. I'm not happy at all that we had to lower our guidance, but the story isn't very complicated. The business results are strong. Volume growth, pricing, innovation, new business cost savings are all meeting our ambitious targets. Organic sales were plus 7% for the third quarter. We expect equal or better in Industrial, Institutional and other in Q4 compared to their Q3 results. The exception will be Energy, which is mostly a comparison issue. It's going against a 12% Q4 last year which we had said at the time was onetime driven.","Pricing also accelerated again in Q3 across the board and will again in Q4, so we will leave the year at a 3% clip. Everything else operationally is in line also, including cost savings. The unexpected was principally raw material costs, which continued to defy gravity indices and certainly our projections. In total raws were $0.11 more than we had last forecast and FX piled on for another $0.04. Nearly three-quarters of this hits Q4.","So time is the enemy here. Short-term moves like slashing investments or halting our U.S. SAP rollout would be foolish; we are not doing it. Instead, we continue to focus on pricing, cost savings and volume growth, but these don't spike to match raws, so it takes more than a quarter which brings me to my next point.","We are winning. We're winning in the marketplace. We're winning against inflation. Clearly we're outpacing market growth across Industrial, Institutional, Energy and other segments. And even with the dramatic raw materials and transportation inflation, our pricing, volume, cost-saving efforts are leading to improving results with OI accelerating over the last three quarters and expected to continue in Q4 even at our new forecast. Also, adjusted EPS for the year remains double-digit.","Perhaps most importantly, we enter 2019 with significant volume, pricing and cost savings momentum. All of this puts us in a good position to continue building our earnings momentum in 2019 and throughout the year, even in an environment where we have continued high raw material inflation, which is how we are planning for it.","So with that I'm going to turn it back to Mike.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","Thank you, Doug. That concludes our formal remarks. Operator, would you please begin the question-and-answer period?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, thank you. Thank you. Our first question is from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gary Bisbee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey guys. Good afternoon. So, I guess the first question, if we assume that raws and FX remain relatively around where they are right now and project that forward, would you anticipate adjusted operating margins increasing in 2019 before benefits from the $200 million cost reduction program? I guess just trying to think through operating leverage outside of another meaningful step up in raws.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, I guess, Gary, I mean not to get detailed meaning, certainly if raws stopped increasing and stayed at the elevated Q4 levels, you would start seeing gross profit improvement very early in the year, year-on-year. Our forecast is more conservative than that at this point in time, which is not consistent with the indices or the published indices. We're looking and making sure that we perform in an even more difficult environment. And there, you might delay it until Q2, Q3 where you'll start seeing margin, even without the $200 million, because most of that's going to be SG&A, not in cost of goods. So, that probably is the best way to answer the question. Obviously, we're not going to go forecast the year right now. Environment's fairly dynamic, but we're working hard to take hard looks at what the sensitivities are around raw materials, et cetera, and put ourselves in a position to deliver no matter what.","Gary Bisbee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And then the follow-up, obviously, pricing accelerating has helped revenue. But the last year, you've had much better volume and mix growth than you'd had in the prior several years, really. I guess, how sustainable do you think that is? I know you've seen it pretty broad-based, but is there anything in particular you'd call out for driving that improvement in the volume side of revenue growth? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, it's always a combination of a couple of things. Certainly, I think our own efforts have a lot to do with it, but we're also in a fairly good economy. And to not note that I think would be misleading. So, our new business productivity, our innovation, I would say, our capabilities around leveraging the combination of Water with F&B and increasingly with Institutional has only enhanced. And we're having great success there as well. I think those things are going to be quite resilient in all economies because what we're ultimately demonstrating is that you can get best-in-class results and save money because of our capabilities around reducing water and the corresponding energy related to it. So it ends up to be a very economic story too, which will still resonate if the economy slows.","So, yeah, I would expect that the vast majority we will have strong results moving forward, barring any \u2013 I don't expect an 2008, 2009. I reserve the right to change everything if that's what we see. I think our expectation next year is the economy will be fairly good, albeit a little bit slower than this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions.","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon. Doug, can you just give us an update on your Institutional business? How does the competitive environment look? And what are your thoughts on pricing and volume as you work your way through the fourth quarter here?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, our forecast, as I mentioned earlier for all of the businesses, except Energy, is that they will be equal or maybe even a little stronger in Q4 than they were in Q3. That includes Institutional. The Institutional business we had forecast at the beginning of the year would be accelerating to about 5% and that would be its exit growth rate for the year. And we're there and we expect to stay there in Q4.","The competitive environment for Institutional, we're going through another wave where we have a very aggressive price competitor, Diversey, and they've been quite aggressive in several accounts. Some, we have frankly allowed the move or stopped competing, because the price got to such a point that it doesn't make any sense to do the business. We don't like to buy work, if you will. And so, we've gone through this a number of times before. In some cases, the business finds its way back to us within a not terribly long period of time. I don't know if that's going to happen here or not.","But with all that said, if you look at our net wins and losses against Diversey for the year, in total, as a company, we remain considerably up. So it's not like we're not continuing to win there, but they've had a couple of big wins because they're doing at a prices that don't make a lot of sense to us and we don't believe they have any cost advantage. With all that said, our Institutional business is improving and has improved. Certainly we'll have to walk through this, but we'll fight it the old-fashioned way, more new business innovation. I would say, as we've been working through Institutional, we also believe we have real cost savings opportunities, nothing to do with people, but a lot to do with product line and some other opportunities that we're going to go capitalize and take advantage. So we would expect Institutional to be a good performer again next year.","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks for all that color. As my follow-up, I will pivot to your Water business, which had great performance in the third quarter. For Water, was there an uptick in Light Industrial, or is the acceleration in growth primarily being driven by heavy Industrial and Mining?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, I mean, all of them are performing well. And we had improvement in heavy business which we've been talking about, because heavy team really starting a year ago was really strong and accelerating new business. It always takes a little while for this to show up in the results, but you're seeing it now. Mining, which is not a big business for us, has also turned around. And the light business continues to perform well also. And as I mentioned before, I think there's \u2013 we've talked about this. I think the Water business underneath the covers has been doing quite well for a while. We're just out of a lot of the kind of exiting business and the other stuff that we were doing. We weren't trying to be optically perfect, but we're doing things that we thought would enhance the business and the Water team has been executing very, very well.","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Healthcare was the second lowest growth segment after Textile Care. I thought some of the new penalties around hospitals having infection rates and public disclosures of infections were going to help that business accelerate. Maybe you can take us through kind of where you are with that.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, well, John, as we've talked the last couple of calls frankly, Healthcare had really a rough start this year. And while you're right in the analysis, second lowest growth, I would also say it's considerably better than it was in the first two quarters, which is what we had said we expected to happen i.e. acceleration in the second half. So we're seeing the beginnings of that. To the point of your question around, I'd say incentives in the healthcare industry, there still not as straightforward as I think all of us would either design if we were designing it, it's simpler I suppose if you don't have any of the details to deal with. But right now the economics still don't line up as straightforwardly as we would like.","What we've adjusted and moved to is also not only talking HAIC reduction, where we're doing quite a good job, but also being much more transparent about how these economics show up even in the world where you are still reimbursing for extra hospital fees and everything else, which is still what's happening. And I think the team is getting clear about how they talk to our prospective customers in light of a game where it's not quite as clear as we would like it to be.","Additionally there's still a lot of, a lot of room to grow in Healthcare. And we are using our Anios acquisition in France to expand more aggressively around the world in many cases using the Anios brand for several reasons, but it's been quite successful. We'll continue to do that. We're also putting stakes in the ground for Ecolab, if you will, branded business in key markets as well. So I remain bullish on the Healthcare business. It grows in kind of lumpily, but they're getting some underlying organic traction which we expect to continue.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And then secondly, I thought actually at some point you might discontinue the other segment and move Pest Elimination into Institutional. Instead now you've added this Colloidal Technologies business unit, maybe you can tell us where you're going with that?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","With Colloidal?","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, you've got \u2013 you're bulking \u2013 you've got now two businesses in other.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Well, these are \u2013 so some of this is just rule-driven from an accounting standpoint. And when businesses are different than the other businesses, you need to put them in another segment. It's SEC other. And so what happens is past given the nature, there's really not a product component like there is on our other businesses, it finds its way into other. Colloidal is a different business for us as well. It has virtually zero SG&A. I think it's got a total of like 25 people on the whole business. And as a consequence, it's viewed as a other business as well and that's why those two are in that segment, it's just simple as that.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. I just wanted to touch back on the pricing versus cost equation. So I think you said you're assuming that the raws gets worse I suppose or keep increasing next year. You talked about sort of being at the 3% clip on pricing. I guess compared to historic periods, how high can you push pricing? Like is there a point at which you're going to have to find other ways to help offset those raw increases?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, I mean, I would say there certainly is of course a ceiling. I mean we have competition out there. And we don't expect that we can go get \u2013 we can probably get 10% pricing for a year or two, but we would be on everybody's blacklist and ultimately they would choose to leave us. So we've always said that we take a longer term view on executing pricing. Our customers don't like big lumpy price increases. We don't either, but we can't \u2013 we are not immune from them, we can help them manage through it.","If you look at history, if you go back, so raws this year were up in the 9% range. If you go back obviously to the severe 2008, 2009 period, they were up 11% in 2008. We got 3% pricing as a combined unit in both 2008 and in 2009. Right now we're going to be as I said exiting the year. So that was a full year pricing story. This year it's going to be just around 2% or a little north of 2% with a 3% exit rate. So we think there's still upside in pricing from what we delivered in 2018. And so, we are going to continue to push. We have to, given this environment. So we don't think we're at the end. We are already seeing exit rates. We're at 4% in the Industrial businesses, around 2% to 3% in Institutional. Energy is around the 3% rate and that's got to move up as we go throughout the year. So we're continuing to push, have upside from here, but it's not infinite.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. And just as a follow up, I mean, in terms of other costs, like, particularly labor, wage, so forth, like are you seeing any noticeable, I guess, trends there that may be add more pressure on top of the raws?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, I would say we continue to see wage inflation, but it's not inconsistent with what we've experienced in the past. Traditionally, the way we view this is we use a lot of our, what I'd call, normal productivity work to offset wage costs and healthcare costs and the like. And we've continued to do that. And so, we use pricing to really go after spiky costs like raw materials, transportation, et cetera, and make sure that those can serve to offset there. The incremental $200 million that we announced last call is really sort of on top of our normal efforts. It's not in place of our normal efforts.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Hello. Could you give a little bit more color on what you're seeing regionally, particularly in Europe? And then secondly, sort of, to the extent that you're pushing the price in the Institutional markets, where you're seeing any areas of actual volume pressure or pushback, if at all, as opposed to just being theoretically you can't do it for a couple of years, but are you seeing any pushback currently?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, I mean, the simple answer is there's always pushback whenever you seek price in virtually every situation. And so, it always begets the discussion. And we need to demonstrate why it's important to price and why we are still a valued supplier delivering economic benefit even with the new price. So that's always an ongoing discussion. It takes real time from our sales team to go do this and execute, and also you get better with practice. And we're in an environment where there's a number of people who are being impacted by price. So we're not the only guys in the waiting room, if you will.","In terms of what we we're seeing regionally, I would say, our Europe business continues to perform decently, a little over 3% sales growth is what we're seeing there. We expect that to be more or less the trend going forward. So, certainly slower than balance of the world, but better than, if you will, sort of our darker days in Europe. China, we continue to see strong results, basically double digits, almost across the board. Latin America is relatively strong coming off, I would say, a little easier base, but having good results in Latin America. The balance of Asia is doing pretty well as well.","So, we don't see a lot of softness in the business at this point in time. We're not usually a harbinger of this, so we don't take a lot of solace. We're watching and looking, but I would also say just underlying trends don't indicate a big downturn in the economy, certainly not one that would match the volatility in the markets.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Doug, just on raw materials, which ones inflated the most to drive the guidance reduction here?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Oh, so in the latest period?","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, I mean for the year, we've got propylene, ethylene and caustic are our stars if you will. And recently, it's caustic continually and basically plastic for pails, et cetera, HDPE.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And just again on Laurence's previous question, are there any signs of either destocking or slowing in any of your key end markets, more on the Industrial side I'm thinking about here?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","No, we've not seen any material change in behavior in our Industrial segments.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your questions.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Doug, last quarter you talked about the $200 million cost savings plan. And at the time, you kind of suggested that you had a sense of it, but it wasn't fully nailed down and it sounds like it's probably still evolving a little bit. But I was just hoping you could just give us an update on your thoughts about how well developed the plan is here today maybe versus last quarter and where it could be by the end of the year? And then just maybe talk about the phasing; previously you suggested that it'd be kind of linear over that three year path. But has that developed to deliver any more benefits sooner or are any benefits needed sooner from the SG&A line, given that the raws are being an incremental headwind here?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Well, we have done a lot of work since then. We aren't final, if you will, because we're also looking at ways to tweak the organization to reduce some layers, increase speed of decision making which is really the fundamental goal. It will probably also have the benefit of reducing costs and doing other things as well. So we're still doing some of that work. In the end, sitting here today, we're quite confident in our ability to deliver. We talked about a third, a third, a third over the three years. The first year was not going to be a challenge. If you're going to take a number, you take the over and not the under, but we're still finalizing that. When we announced and give a range for our 2019, we'll be very explicit on what we expect from the $200 million at that time.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you. That's all I had for today.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you everyone. Just a question on cash flow, it looks like you made up a little progress versus where things were at the second quarter. But how do you think you'll straighten the year out? Is the raw material pressure just going to keep pushing working capital higher going into the year-end or something else going to happen?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, Dan gets cash flow.","Daniel J. Schmechel - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Sure. So this is Dan. Yeah, thank you. Q3, I think was a much improved quarter from trends. So we saw in the quarter something like a little north of 100% conversion, bringing our full year benefit up to \u2013 close to 90%. We target about 95%. And you're correct, that from a working capital perspective, higher costs tends to inflate inventory. I'll point out also that higher pricing tends to benefit us from a working capital perspective on accounts receivable.","And so, I feel good about the quarter. It is an improvement from trend. I think that we feel fine about the fourth quarter and expect to deliver a full year cash flow more or less in line with our expectation as it compares to the net income. And I'm thinking in the maybe $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion range, towards the higher end, I would expect, okay. But no real surprises and encouraged by Q3.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. And just us a follow-up, I had a question on Energy. And I apologize if you've answered this already. But the supplement talks about in the 4Q comparison against a strong period last year due to some production business sales. Can you just remind us what that was?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Last year when we announced the fourth quarter Energy sales in Q4 were 12% last year, it was after like negative 2% and a 4% and a 5% in the prior three quarters. And we have said that wasn't the run rate, it included fairly significant like roughly maybe just a little under half of one-time sales of equipment and other things. I don't have the exact verbiage. A lot of those was even in the Middle East. But it wasn't a run rate and we're annualizing against that. If you take that out and look it would be like high single-digits in Q4, which is not inconsistent with what you saw in Q3.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question is from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.","John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. On the $0.75 of raw material headwinds that you expect to see this year, how much of it do you expect to recoup back before the \u2013 or by the end of the year? And then how much of it is something that we'll see you catch-up on in 2019?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. The $0.75 includes FX as well. So that was really raw materials and FX versus our original plan. If you look at year-on-year impacts, it's going to be \u2013 I'll get you the exact numbers in a minute. So we're going to basically recoup if you will. So DPC versus plan and FX versus plan are around the $0.75 and pricing is just going to be under $0.30 or so over plan. So we've upped pricing this year versus what we expected to deliver in response to higher than forecast raw materials and ultimately FX. But we weren't able to recoup all of it because it moved very late on the year on us. Ultimately, we think we will recoup all of it. So we are already if you will our pricing dollar for dollar is over the incremental raw material bill, including in the fourth quarter. But now we've got to recoup margin, which we always say is typically year two work.","John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. No, that's helpful. And then thinking about the raw materials, it looks like some of the raws that you have exposure to whether it's caustic or propylene have actually started to come off a bit, I guess, in the last month or so. How quickly do you see that? Like how long do we have to wait before \u2013 let's assume these prices are for real in terms of how they've dipped a bit, how long before you actually start to see the benefit of that?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, it's different in the U.S. than outside the U.S. because the accounting rules are different. So in the U.S. it comes through fairly quickly. And outside the U.S., you've got inventory...","Daniel J. Schmechel - Ecolab, Inc.","80 days.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, maybe 70, 80 \u2013 couple of months.","John P. McNulty - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Prefect. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great, thanks you. Just on Energy margins, the recovery is moving in the right direction, but it does appear a little bit slower than many investors were expecting. As you've already taken out the net costs following the volatility over the last few years, how should we think about the development of U.S. onshore to offset some of the potential shortfalls across the globe? And even thinking about the production rebalancing in the Middle East given the potential void of Iranian sanctions, just what are the best ways to think about your company specific outlook, given where the Energy markets are likely heading into 2019? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, well I mean look you've touched on a few right. So Iran is going to turned off, Permian will get turned back on ultimately. They're probably the two big shifts. And you have got the slow leak in some other markets because they haven't the capital or the ability to maintain production values. I think by and large it bodes well for us. We don't have significant Iranian share given that we had to walk out. And Permian is an area that we've done well in. So as we see this shift, it will bode well for us.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. And just you did allude to this a little with your comments on Diversey. But given that the industry M&A changes over the last few years and the changes in competitive landscape pretty much across a bunch of your major segments, can you just comment on if you believe that these changes have had in any shape or form or fashion an effect on the various areas of industry pricing discipline and\/or your ability to act in a timely fashion over the last year or so? Just any color on how that may have factored into the pricing? And if it wasn't a big deal obviously all good.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes. I'd even put the Diversey activity is not inconsistent with history. So we've always gone and they've always been quite price aggressive in our minds not always in the most intelligent fashion as we look at P&Ls of customers. But it's always easier because you have more information than the person competing for the business, because you're doing it. You know what the costs are, you know what the consumption is and the others are guessing. So that's not even new. I mean we've been dealing with this on and off for 30 years. And I would imagine, we'll continue to do so. Or I mean the only really \u2013 there's only really upside in terms of pricing behavior from most of our competition. I'd say Baker Hughes has come under kind of the GE Energy umbrella, appears to be I would say more priced, seems like they're pricing more intelligently based on costs and other things. I don't know if that's going to last or not, can't predict. And I'd also say Suez, we haven't seen dramatic change from Suez.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey Dan, maybe you could help with this. If you leave current FX rates constant from where they are today, what would be the FX headwind to 2019 numbers? So not asking for guidance or anything, but just what does it represent as a headwind to next year?","Daniel J. Schmechel - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes. So if you just read next year's FX exposure at current spot rates, we would see a headwind of about $0.10, okay, so plus or minus 2% of EPS.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay great. And then what would be the growth rate in the quarter if you normalized for that Hurricane that was kind of an easy comp in the third quarter? Would you still be at 7% or would that have come down to 6% or something?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Hurricane was probably 60 basis points. So, you'd probably end up above 6%, but probably not rounding to 7%.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","Scott Goldstein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, this is Scott Goldstein on for P.J. So, it looks like in Textiles Care, it's growing meaningfully slower than your other Industrials businesses. So, what are your longer term expectations for that business and do you still view it as core part of the portfolio?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","We expect Textile to accelerate from here. That's a business forecast sound reasoning behind it. Some was just going through some customer transitions and others, but we would expect that business to accelerate. But it's going to be a mid-single-digits growth business. It's not going to be a business in the 6% to 8% organically, but it's a good business. Yes, it's part of our portfolio and we'll continue to invest in it to grow and to win.","Scott Goldstein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And just checking, have the tariffs had any impact on how you're thinking about your supply chain or distribution?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, we are somewhat fortunate in the tariff world, if anybody is and that we've historically had a supply chain strategy which is make where we sell. It was originally born because of mitigating FX. We didn't want foreign exchange to become a strategic issue, right, it's a translation issue. But if you only made in the U.S. and the dollar got strong, you're suddenly not as competitive from a price standpoint, hence our strategy to go make in markets or in the currencies we sell in. As a consequence, we don't have big exposure. In China, for instance, like 92% of what we sell in China is made in China. So, we don't have significant imports into the market that are going to be affected by tariffs. The bigger impact for us will be British exit and that one it depends. So, we're assuming that it's a hard exit and that we have to fall with the WTO rates and that's the way that we are managing and looking at it. Anything better than that we'll mitigate, but I think even there, we don't plan to have this as a big talking point in our quarterly calls.","Scott Goldstein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thank you for the detail.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Group. Please proceed with your questions.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good afternoon. Thank you. The first question is just on the paper business; it had a nice ramp. If you could just touch on the sustainability of that growth, is it largely just a cyclical rebound or anything you're doing differently in that marketplace?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, big piece of the ramp was price. That's a business that has a lot of price-plus contracts. You're starting to see price tick up; where we don't have those contracts, our team has been aggressive recouping raw material increases that have occurred over the last couple of years. The other half of the sales is volume, so that's a tick up as well. And that's really been driven by new business and new innovation that's been introduced there that's helped drive successful new volume at both existing and new customers. So, the team's on the price equation; they know they've got to go back and rebuild margin, so that we can continue to invest in new technologies. It benefits everybody in the industry and that's exactly what they're doing right now.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And just a follow-up question on international, are there any sort of structural reasons why the mix of international shouldn't look like the U.S. longer term whether it's more Institutional, more QSR, just any big picture thoughts on that? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, I don't know if it will on average. You have \u2013 the U.S. has got an outsized food service market given its population and compared to, if you will, other markets like dollars spent per head. With that said, I think Institutional is undersized and has low share versus our potential in our non-U.S. markets. So, it has certainly significant upside from where it is today, but it likely won't be the same percentage of the total enterprise as it is in the U.S. on the balance of the world.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your questions.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the margin performance in the Energy business. There was just a tiny bit of sequential decline, despite some improvement in the top-line. Can you talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes in the margin performance in Energy and also provide some thoughts on the cadence of margin over the next few quarters?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, I mean the blip would have almost certainly been just propylene. They have fairly sizable exposure to propylene. And so, as it moves up and down, you'll see the 10 basis point, 20 basis point kind of blips in their margin. I mean the real Energy story needs to be continued pricing, recouping raw material input cost inflation. It didn't occur just this year, but also in prior years. The team is on it; they're doing it. They're doing a much better job driving enhanced mix, et cetera, and driving new innovation and customers. All these things will help drive and rebuild margins, which we still believe will be in the middle teens.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. And then was wondering going back to the paper conversation, can you comment on how the Georgia-Pacific acquisition has been progressing relative to your expectations? And are you seeing benefits in the paper segments related to some industry consolidation that's happened over the past year as well as the past several years?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes. Well, the acquisition you referenced is off to a great start. So, it's above on virtually every one of our targets. In case the team's listening, this is the year one and we often do this year one, and we plan to own it for 40 years. So we got to continue the performance. But it's been off to a good start.","And in terms of consolidation, I would say generally, the period of consolidation can be unsettling, but typically consolidation in industries benefits us. We prefer consolidating customer sets and fragmented competitive sets. It's almost one of the preconditions for us to thrive. And so long-term we would view that as a positive.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli of Gabelli. Please proceed with your question.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Well, most of my questions have been answered. Doug could you talk about the environment for M&A what are you looking at? I mean, the valuation seems to have come down for a lot of potential properties.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I would expect Rosemarie that we will have a couple more deals done before year-end. And I'd say the environment generally I would agree these seems to be getting a little better. We're going to remain committed to doing smart deals. And this means it's going to be a bit seasonal. Not like spring, winter, fall. There may be \u2013 there are some years where we're going to be more successful than others, because we really don't want to force it by paying too much. And we think we're in a position where we can do this. So that's the way we view it. With that said, yeah, I would expect that we'll have a few near term. And if we look at sort of what we're looking at, who we're talking to, I would say, the list is getting better and stronger.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Any particular size that you are targeting in specifically?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I mean, look I think the only size limit or parameter we have is doing too little of a deal can be a real waste of time and money because it almost takes the same amount of effort, if you will, to buy a $5 million company as a $50 million or a $500 million. So we try not to do really tiny deals. Other than that we don't really have a size, preference-to-preference really is around, does it makes sense strategically, can we get a return on it, are we their rightful owner. I mean those are kind of the big things that we look at. In financial terms, it's a return. We're investing shareholder money. We've got to be able to look at shareholders and say, you're going to be really happy with this return. It's the best way we can invest the money.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","All right. Thanks. That is helpful. And if you could update us on your technology and digital investments?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. We've not blinked there at all. In fact, we're investing more this year than last year. I think we're starting to get at a point where it's not going to call for dramatically more money in the near term. We've got to really do a great job with the money we're already investing. But we've had \u2013 look we're out in the marketplace with some very large customers. We're learning, developing. As I've said repeatedly, I think the digital world is great for us. We are advantaged. We have 3 million customer sites, all of which, or virtually all of which are collecting data today, a fraction of which are connected to the cloud, but technically that's not that complicated that cost to do it. It's dropping. We have unique knowhow, unique streams of information and are the only people able to act upon what we've learned through the digital world. So once we find out there are problems in units, we can actually get in there and help our customers fix them. I think that whole combination is a great advantage for us long-term and we're working very hard to make sure we don't squander this advantage.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Great.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Monahan, Senior Vice President of External Relations. Thank you, Mr. Monahan, you may now begin.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's third quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. A discussion of our results along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor. Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials, stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under item 1A, risk factors, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with a brief overview of the quarter, Ecolab's underlying sales and profit fundamentals continued to improve through the third quarter and we are building momentum as we finish 2017. Continued pricing and new business gains drove third quarter acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales growth in all our business segments despite the unfavorable impact of hurricanes in North America. The sales gains along with product innovation and ongoing cost efficiency work more than offset higher delivered product costs. These along with our work to lower interest expense and our tax rate as well as fewer shares outstanding yielded the third quarter 7% adjusted earnings per share increase.","Moving to some highlights from the quarter, and as discussed in our press release, on an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax item from both years, third quarter 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.37. Hurricane related impacts on sales and costs were estimated to be a negative $0.04 per share in the third quarter, representing a 3 percentage point reduction in our EPS growth. Consolidated acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales rose for all of our business segments. Europe and Asia Pacific led the regional growth.","Absent the impact of the hurricanes, acquisition-adjusted fixed currency operating margin declined an estimated 20 basis points as price and volume increases were more than offset by the margin impact of higher delivered product costs in the quarter. Absent the impact of the hurricanes, acquisition-adjusted fixed currency operating income is estimated to have increased 3%.","The operating income gain along with lower interest expense, a lower tax rate, and fewer shares outstanding yielded a 7% increase in third quarter 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share. We continue to aggressively work to drive our growth, winning new business through our innovative new products and sales and service expertise, as well is driving pricing and cost efficiencies to grow our top and bottom lines at improved rates. We also continue to see underlying sales volume and pricing improve across most of our business segments and look for that to more than offset continued delivered product cost headwinds and yield stronger operating income growth.","We expect fourth quarter fixed currency sales to rise in the 5% to 6% range with net income increasing more than 10% as improved sales momentum and stronger pricing drive results and more than offset higher delivered product costs. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the $1.35 to $1.45 range, up 8% to 16%. Hurricane related impacts are estimated to be a negative $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter and the loss of Equipment Care income will reduce earnings per share by an estimated $0.01 per share. Together, these represent an estimated 4 percentage point headwind to fourth quarter EPS growth. Reflecting the impact of the hurricanes and higher delivered product costs, we've tightened our full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share forecast to the $4.65 to $4.75 per share range in 2017, rising 6% to 9%. We expect the impact of the hurricanes on full-year sales and costs will be approximately a negative $0.08 per share, and the Equipment Care sale to reduce income by $0.01 per share. We do not expect 2017 hurricanes to have a meaningful impact on 2018 results.","In summary, we see momentum improving in our business. We expect to deliver strong adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2017 and we look for our investments and actions to drive better growth ahead.","And now here's Doug Baker with some comments.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Thank you, Mike. As I look at Q3, I would highlight three key takeaways. Number one, our business fundamentals are improving. Our new business, innovation and pricing discipline are showing up in the numbers. Pricing is improving in all segments as we covered the absolute raw material increase in Q3 and expect to exceed in Q4 which will begin our margin rebuild. And our volume is also forecast to increase. It is regaining its natural path in Q4 as well. Institutional was the exception, point number two. If you cut through the clutter, Institutional is growing at 3% globally and 3% to 4% in North America, which is better than it looks but still way under potential and our expectations.","In short, the U.S. environment in particular requires more offense. Unit growth in same-store sales in full and casual dining are weak. To increase offensive capability, we are adding additional sales positions, launching new platforms in warewashing and laundry to drive new unit sales, and refocusing the field on large category penetration opportunities to help drive same-store sales. We anticipate these steps, which are already starting to lead to improvements, will improve Q4 versus Q3 modestly but drive continued improvement throughout 2018.","Finally, the third takeaway is that overall results have been on a steady improvement path all year. The fundamentals are winning, and we expect to leave the year with very strong momentum. We have sales momentum. We forecast in Q4 organic sales to be 5%, fixed currency sales to be 5% to 6%, reported sales to be 6% to 7%. We have margin momentum. Pricing will continue to accelerate in all sectors including energy which we forecast to have positive pricing in Q4 too. We have earnings momentum. We forecast double-digit net income growth in Q4 as well as double-digit EPS with a 12% midpoint. Be 13% if you exclude the divestiture of our Equipment Care business.","So clearly Q4 is a notable improvement, but the most important news is the momentum driving Q4 results positions us well to deliver Ecolab-like results in 2018. So with that, I will hand it back to Mike.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","Thanks, Doug. That concludes our formal remarks. Operator, would you please begin the question-and-answer period?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Doug, I guess the first question, I appreciate the positive commentary on improvement ex the hurricanes this quarter and more to show up next quarter, but I guess I continue to struggle. It's been like 18 months now that you've been talking about improving bookings trends and it's just been stubbornly slow to work its way into revenue. What's going on there? And I guess can you say anything other than what you've said so far to help our confidence that this is actually going to materialize going forward?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, I don't know that I'm going to go rehash all the stuff that we went through in 2015-2016. I think though in 2017, it's been pretty clear that we've had improvement on a going basis on fixed currency sales. I mean, they were 2% in Q1, 5% in Q2, 5% in Q3, and they're 5% to 6% forecast in Q4. And if you look at rounding, I mean, we're moving up in the right direction. It's a bigger business. This business always, it's very sticky once you sell it. It does not ramp up quickly in almost any environment, never has. And so we are starting to see traction take hold.","The call-out I made on Institutional was it's a place honestly where we haven't seen the same traction we would have expected and I would call that mostly the result of a tougher than anticipated environment, which isn't an excuse, because we have tons of share opportunity in the U.S. as well, which is what we really have to get after and get on. So short of Institutional, I would say you're seeing clearly signs of improving business. In Institutional, we've been a little bit on a hold, but we think we've got the traction moving there too.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And I guess just to follow up on that point, some of the things like the new warewashing and laundry platforms you talked about in September at the Investor Day, but this increase in head count and some of the other things you mentioned about the focus on penetration, seems to be new. So did something change in the last couple of months that made you acknowledge, hey, this isn't going the way we want? Or is this just not something you discussed there but that had already been underway? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","No, I would say part of it was we were talking about it there but had not decided to go do some of these things. And I mean, the fact is the institutional market in U.S. isn't giving as it used to. You used to naturally acquire new unit expansion as a result of having the chain business. They're not adding units. We used to have better same-store sales as a result of traffic. We don't have traffic. And so you got to acknowledge a market you are in, not the market you hope for. And so as a consequence, we know we got to up the offense, and we're doing it.","Now we've been here before. I would say if you go back to the early 2000s, there's probably a two-year period \u2013 unfortunately it was when I took over \u2013 where we were stagnant as well and growing at about the 1% and 2% in U.S. institutional. And so we upped our offense. We did a number of moves. I would say the things that we're launching now are digitally enabled and will allow us to capture a lot of the information that we're already securing but get it to the cloud which will allow us to do more for customers, which I think ultimately leads to more business. Those are the new platforms we're launching. So I just think this is a little bit of a relook at how this market's actually performing and what do we need to do to succeed in the given market.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","OK, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Quealy with Canaccord. Please proceed with your questions.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.",": Hi, good afternoon. The first question, can you talk about the impact on price across all segments and SKUs? Has everyone that can catch up at this point caught up? And then a part of that is when do the delivered comps get easier on the price point? That's the first question. Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, I would say from pricing, I mean, in total, we are north of 1% in Q3. Expect that to expand by basis points going into Q4 but the expansion's across the board. As I mentioned, Energy will be positive on pricing in Q4. It was nominally under last year in Q3, so we kind of crossed the threshold there as well, which is the last segment to cross it. In terms of raw materials, raw materials started moving against us last year fairly early, really at the very end of Q4, if you will, a year ago and into first quarter. So as the year goes on, the base gets easier.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.",": Okay, thanks. And my last question, on the Paper business, I think it's been at least in our eyes a pretty good run, 36 months plus of growth there and then maybe hurricane excluded growth may be a percent or rounding up to a percent this quarter. Can you talk about big picture around cyclical versus secular in Paper? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, I mean, the Paper business, frankly, is doing well everywhere but in China. And China, we, I would say, are starting to bottom out in Paper, but we've not performed as we should have in China, and that's really clouding the results in all other regions. China is not going to be a long story because we're getting to a point where it can't be. But we've retooled, we're putting a lot of emphasis on technical competency, we're launching new technology which had been delayed there and doing a number of other steps. I recall China more upside at this point than downside. So I think you're going see Paper stabilize and start moving up or accelerating sales. I mean, it's growing, just not growing very quickly.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Sure. As the Energy business recovers in 2018, what's the likely range of incremental margins that you're planning for? I know this year has had some compensation rebuild, the raw material pressures, etc. Just wondering the underlying margin potential of that business?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, David, I mean, we're not going to get into real specific details on 2018 in the call. I would expect, this year we said it was going to be plus\/minus on OI and low to mid single-digit growth, and that's really what we're seeing for the year and forecasting for Energy. Next year, I would expect growth to be nominally better and it would be on the plus side on income, so it will be accretive. And we aren't really going into detail of how much. We'll do that in the call at the first quarter when we typically give our detailed 2018 forecast.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just a quick numbers question. On the Equipment Care divestiture, what is the estimated after-tax proceeds? And then the margins of the Pest business on a stand-alone basis, for modeling going forward?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Neither of those we've disclosed nor plan to. I think as we move forward,-- Pest margin was obviously certainly north of the Equipment margin. So this is not dilutive to margins.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. You touched on the pricing in another question, but I was wondering looking ahead, like we saw this quarter, I guess, where your pricing offset your increases in the raws. Should we continue to expect that going into 2018, or is there anything else you would call out, whether it lapses or anything as we think about the cadence into the year?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, we have historically talked about our pricing philosophy to be try to recapture absolute increase in year one and recapture margin in year two. Obviously, you got to recapture roughly double the increase in raw material absolute dollars in pricing to recapture margin. And we tend to do this over a period of time, call it six to eight quarters. And I think that's exactly what you're seeing. So we're saying we crossed the threshold. Even though we had a little spike in raw materials in Q3, we still were able to cover absolute dollar.","I mean, like almost exactly via what we saw from pricing in absolute dollars and paid out in raw material increases. Q4, as I mentioned, we will have daylight where pricing exceeds raw material increase at that point in time. We were obviously below in Q1 and Q2. So what I would expect to see is that delta, the positive delta, continue to widen as we go on because, one, we've got to kind of pay back what we invested in the first half; and two, that's how we recover margin. So I think that'd be a steady increase in that delta over the next three, four quarters.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. And then just on tax reform, I understand you're dealing with 140 characters or less, but I think in the past you talked about 28% maybe being the breakeven tax rate for you guys on corporate tax reform. Was just wondering if you had any updated views there?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, I mean, the simple answer right now they seem to be very focused on 20%. And 20% almost assuming its territorial and the like, which is what they've been contemplating, would be fine for us. Would not be a negative.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Doug, on Equipment Care divestment, was the inability to wrap Equipment Care into the circle, the customer strategy, the primary reason for moving on with that effort?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I guess. Look, the Equipment Care was a good business. We didn't always run it that way, but obviously we drove substantial improvement over the last five to six years. I would really say at the heart of it when we looked at how we're going to drive Food Safety, how did we want to invest in digital, where do we really want to put our money, and where was the upside for us? Equipment Care as we looked at our portfolio increasingly became the odd man out, and if we're not going to be fully on the gas in a business, then we probably be best not to own that business.","So we thought to see if we could find an owner who we thought would be better for the business long-term, and I think we found one. So that's the best explanation. I mean, we had sold it in circle bundles and other things successfully, but it's a bit of a different model, which I think the new owner understands. Leverage is tougher in that business than it is in our other businesses for us, and we want to focus on businesses that are more like our core model than not.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And then could you talk about the Specialty Paper chemical unit you acquired in the quarter, and I think there's a more commodity part of Paper that's water chemicals. Is that core long-term? And now that you've bought something else in Paper, does it make it more core long-term and more commodity part?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes. I wouldn't overread or underread. I mean it was to us a smart acquisition. It put us in, it's really technology that's in the growing part of that industry. It's not a huge acquisition. I think sales were $40 million the prior \u2013 in the base year. So it just, we thought, positioned us better to do what we're doing in Paper. We're going to invest in that business and continue to invest in it. We've substantially improved the business since we've been operating it, and we plan to continue to do just that and this particular acquisition increased our positioning in the fastest-growing piece of that market.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Goldstein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. This is Scott Goldstein on for P.J. So maybe going back to the growth initiatives. Are you looking to add to your sales force to target any particular market segment or is it more broad-based? That's the first question.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes. No, we're, I would say in most businesses \u2013 the exception right now, Energy, we don't have significant adds in this year \u2013 but in almost all the other businesses, we've added, albeit not huge numbers. In particular we've been adding corporate account resources in three of our major business because as we looked at and analyzed opportunities, we felt we had too few people to get after new opportunities because the existing business base was commanding most of their time.","Scott Goldstein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And follow-up is, can you maybe give more details around the penetration optimization program that you're using to stimulate same-store sales?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes. I mean, what happens in Institutional is, I would say there's rhythms over time or rhythms. And we've introduced a number of categories to extend our line, which is a time-tested and honored way that we grow our business. But over a period of time, it can also lead to a little lack of focus on the largest categories. And so what we want to make sure we're doing is focusing everybody's attention on the most important categories, in this case in a restaurant. And that we make sure we drive penetration in those areas.","Our penetration hasn't declined, but it hasn't been increasing as we would expect it to over a period, so we need to reemphasize it. And I would say importantly in Institutional, our challenge is really accelerating growth. We do not have a defensive challenge. Our account losses are at historic lows so it's not that we're losing business, it's not that we're losing penetration, it's just that we aren't having the same offensive impact that's required to grow that business, in part because the market's not giving what it used to, so we're going to have to do it ourselves.","Scott Goldstein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Hi. This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. You mentioned technology as part of the most recent acquisition. I was just wondering if will technology be or improving technology, will that be a growing part of your focus when you're thinking about doing future M&A?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, I would say it's historically been one of the focus areas. So when we buy a business or a company, we're looking to create some advantage for the company, meaning we just don't want to get bigger, we want to get better at the same time. And so that either comes from adding talent, adding a fast-growing portfolio to your current portfolio, and\/or adding technology. In the case of the recent Paper acquisition, we're adding technology which we believe strengthens our portfolio and does it most importantly in the fastest growth part of that industry.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Doug, in 2018, you mentioned Ecolab-like results. Does that mean double digits? Does it mean 15%? I know it's early for 2018 guidance, but what are your thoughts there?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I would say it certainly implied double-digit EPS growth. And I'm not trying to hedge on any number at this point in time. I just don't want to get in front of our normal cadence. And we will give explicit guidance coming up in February, but clearly work to imply that the momentum you see in the fourth quarter, we expect to carry forward through 2018.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understand. Doug, just on Institutional U.S., if the growth isn't there, how do you assess the impact of spending too much money for some limited growth as opposed to spending money in other areas of the company here?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, one, I guess I'll deal with it when we get there, but I don't believe we're going to get there. So I mean, we're quite confident there's plenty of growth opportunity in the U.S. food service business and we've done a lot of work trying to understand exactly what's happening, where is it. And that's why we can say with certainty where it's not. So this isn't a defend problem. This is just making up for what the market used to give us and no longer is giving us. If it comes back, hallelujah. But we're not planning on it. So I'm quite confident that the investments we're making, which aren't huge in any absolute term, are smart investments and will pay back handily. If we prove wrong, we are a company chasing $120 billion-plus market and we're $14 billion. So it's not like we're short on growth opportunities and we'll get after the most appropriate ones, but I'm quite confident U.S. food service happens to be in there.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks, guys. Real quick, in Food & Beverage, you guys are fairly comfortable. You're outgrowing the market by a few hundred basis points. Given this area was a focus in 2017, can you just comment on where you'd expect account wins, pricing share gains, you know all the kind even out through the balance of year and any just even preliminary comment on 2018? And then also, what percent of this would you attribute to enterprise selling? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, I would say the F&B business has had a very good year because it's done a very good job setting itself up for 2018. And so you mentioned enterprise selling. They have latched up with our Water business very successfully. Together, they bring superior value to our customers. They're driving it. It's driving new business in both Water and F&B. F&B was, what, 5% in the third and going to accelerate, we believe, in the fourth. And we believe that's going to be running at a sustainable rate in 2018. So they've done a great job driving new business, leveraging new technology to do it. And so all the emphasis that we put in that business is paying off.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. And just a quick follow-up on just within heavy water. You've exited some business in China, and obviously there's a little bit of some hurricane effects. Can you just walk through some of the key end markets, geographies, et cetera, just very broadly? And anything that you see at present which gives you the confidence for more of a material rebound in 2018 and 2019? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes. Our light business continues to do very well; it's growing at mid-single digits. Pops up into upper single digits. And that business, which includes the F&B market that we just talked about, we think is growing at a very sustained and strong rate. So we feel good about that. Heavy has been impacted most notably by what's been going on in China. That business is now starting to bottom and show signs of improvement. So I think what you'll see is global heavy numbers improve as well because in other regions, heavy's done quite well.","If you look at our core Water, we expect it to end of the year growing at 4-plus percent, and we would expect that to accelerate throughout 2018 as we move into the year. What's not included in core Water is mining, in particular, would be the largest business unit. And mining has recovered as I think we've talked about, positive in the third and expects to be positive going forward.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions.","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. My first question's on the Healthcare business. This slowdown to the organic rate of \u2013 I think organic growth was 1%. Can you just talk about what's happening there is quite different than what we saw in the first half of the year?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes. Without trying to \u2013 I would say the way to think about the Healthcare business, it's still growing in the 4% to 5% range. So we bought Anios and we moved our international expansion efforts largely to Anios. So Anios organic sales have moved up dramatically. I mean the organic sales were 9% in Q3. Now we don't have that as our terminal value. But one of the big drivers was international growth in Anios, which was 15%. And really, what we've done is taken a lot of our international expansion work and we're running out of Anios versus out of the other business or the legacy business. And so you sort of have to look at both of those. When we strip out acquisitions, we strip out all of it. So it's taking away some of the growth efforts which have just been shifted from one brand to another, which probably isn't the best way to portray the business and what's happening there.","So the two big growth emphasis are continue to drive HIC programs. That's going to be lumpy, a lot like we see in KAY and others, but we're having success there and continue to expect to have success. We're expanding in international principally through Anios. When you put those together, you end up in the mid 4s. Life Sciences, which historically was in Healthcare up until this year, is now growing at high single digits as well. So all in all, that I think's doing fine with significant opportunity to accelerate.","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. I think that makes sense, Doug. So should I expect, then after you lap the anniversary of the acquisition of Anios, we would expect to see the organic growth rate accelerate back to historical rates?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes. I think we expect it to be better in Q4, even the reported number we give you, versus Q3. But yes, we would expect this to be, as we talked, mid-single digits heading up to upper single digits. That remains our ambition. We think it's quite realistic, and you'll see those things put together in early next year.","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","That makes sense. And then my second question is on the Institutional division. When do you lap the exit of the low-margin business? Is that in the fourth quarter or is that sometime in 2018? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes. Its impact has diminished considerably second half versus first half. I think there's a little bit of an overlap in Q4, but it's very small and it'll be all gone by 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones. In Global Industrial, there was also a reference to lower shipments to distributors. How material is that? And is that ongoing or is it just sort of a onetime issue?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, no, that was Institutional, the distributor reference, not Industrial.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Yes. Well, either way, the balance of the question was just is it a onetime issue or how material was it.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes. In North America, Institutional was about 200 basis points, and globally it was about 150 basis points.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And will it just be housed in this quarter? Or is that something that you have to face until you lap it?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","No. You know what, these are always hard to predict. What I would say traditionally, we've seen this movie before, and it happens episodically. There's a disconnect. So we get all the out data, meaning the distributors that sell for us in the United States provide us where every case goes by end user. So we have very specifics about what consumption is. And, occasionally, you get into a mismatch between ins and outs, if you will, in a distributor. And that's really what happened in the third quarter, that distributor purchases were well below distributor outs, so inventories, obviously, shrunk in distributors.","Traditionally, we find these coming back. It's hard to predict if it's going to be absolutely the next quarter. Our forecast assumes that there's no rebuild of the inventories in fourth quarter. So we'll see what happens as it goes. Traditionally, they find their way back. It's sort of like water seeking its level.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your questions.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good afternoon. Doug, you had mentioned the market not giving what it used to in Institutional. Just curious if you're seeing any structural changes in that market with either consumer behavior shifting from casual dining to home delivery, or what have you. Just any sense of whether there's any structural change, whereby you have to invest more to seek out more share gain and the market is just going through some sort of a change that the investor base maybe cannot have visibility to just yet.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes. I would say the change we're seeing in this market right now is \u2013 there's clearly \u2013 and this has happened many times, there is a move by the consumer. I mean, QSRs are doing relatively well. Fast casual is even under some pressure, because QSR is probably the fastest-growing segment right now. But you get into casual dining or even full-service restaurants, they're just a little temporarily out of vogue. So you're not seeing the same kind of traffic and\/or increase in those restaurants that you saw historically.","Now, this isn't the first episode and we're going through many of the same things that we've gone through when you see this trade. For us, as a company, we're obviously strongly \u2013 we have strong presence in the fast casual, in the casual, the QSR in all segments, so there's just trades up and down. We do not see a big structural change in terms of home delivery of food. We might see that down the road.","I would say, I was just in China, where this is a significant burgeoning business, and they don't have any of the headaches of legacy technology, so they're moving quite quickly. And I met with one of the leaders there, where, frankly, we've got a very interesting food safety proposal and program that we're using with them, because by God, when you deliver food, food safety matters, too. So I just look at it.","Right now, this is just a classic trade up and down among the category. And we know we've got to get after it, so we have major exposure. They're not adding units, because they don't see the growth. And you don't see same-store sales growth, because you don't have the traffic. And that's what we've got to overcome, and we've done it in the past, and I'm pretty confident we'll do it right now.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And just a follow-up question, with the new accounting rules, you mentioned disclosing product versus service components of your revenue. And I'm just curious, is that something you're comfortable with from a competitive standpoint? It definitely creates more online transparency on pricing around the product category. So just curious, do you intend to disclose that at a segment level or is that just very high-level and you're comfortable there?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, I mean, we're going to meet all the requirements. I mean, FASB's been busy and so now we are too. And I would say we're going to do this and meet the spirit and letter of what's been required, but we're really going to do it at a consolidated level. Importantly, it's not going to have any impact on OI. It's not have any impact on EPS. We'll have us have additional charts and show the business in a little different light. We don't believe it's going to create any undue competitive challenges and\/or challenges anywhere else. It does create work. I hope it creates some helpfulness for the financial community.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mike Harrison was Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Happy Halloween. Doug, you talked a little bit about the Institutional business and we talked about penetration and the desire to get some of the same-store sales moving a little bit better. But wondering what penetration looks like on the new accounts. When you get new accounts, do they kind of just dip their toe in the water and maybe take up just a very small number of products to start, such that it weighs on your overall penetration rate? Or is the uptake actually pretty good as you look and compare it to existing Institutional accounts?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, I mean, undoubtedly, we tend to grow penetration within existing accounts over time. I would say we usually go in with at least enough products to have a comprehensive kitchen hygiene program, which is really what we're representing and presenting. But from there, we build that out. Importantly, over time, or you don't capture it all, there's significant upside in all of our categories. I mean, if we look at warewash anchor accounts and look at pot and pan penetration, or floor care, or degreaser, or pre-soak, sanitizer \u2013 I can go on \u2013 to hand soap, on, on, and on. There is dramatic room in every one of those categories to increase penetration, which makes a lot of money and, just as importantly, we think helps the restaurant save money and helps our field team make more money. So I mean, it's sort of a win on all levels. We need to go and we are reemphasizing, refocusing, and getting after it and it will bear fruit.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","And then on the Energy business, I noticed that you mentioned in there that you had some weaker performance in the production side of that business. Was wondering if you could talk about how much of that weakness in production might've been related to the hurricanes. And then can you walk around the globe and the key production regions and talk about the trends that you're seeing on the production side of your business?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, we think it's more a temporary story. So production, I mean, we're talking about 2%. And production in the world is up 1%. So it's not a huge mismatch and it's a quarter deal, not a ongoing long-term issue. So I don't think that's going to be an ongoing story in that business as we move forward.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","And was it hurricane related, Doug?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","No, the production side was very modestly impacted by a few platforms, but no, that really wasn't the issue.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Staying on energy, Doug, with oil prices, certainly they've moved up recently. How are you thinking about them looking into next year and how that would influence segment results? Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, I think what we believe to be true and what we're planning is that the energy prices are going to be roughly around the $50 range even through 2018. We do believe that they will move up but we don't think the real sustained move is probably until later into 2019, 2020. So our focus and the numbers I spoke about earlier when I was asked about energy is really predicated on, call it, plus, minus $50, $55 a barrel.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great, thanks for that. And then going to something more of an upstart, Life Sciences. Could you just talk about the customer conversations you're having there? How pharma and personal care are looking as an industry? And then just, you speak in the release today to the lumpiness of new contract wins. Just progress you're seeing with a little more detail. Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes. I mean, Life Sciences is several billion-dollar opportunity for us, and the market makeup is ideal. So you've got huge multinationals and a very fragmented \u2013 so a consolidated customer set and a very fragmented competitive set, which works well to our advantage, i.e., that we can do world-class technology consistently around the globe.","This market has big needs, and we think we're the perfect people to fulfill them. So our expertise in F&B and Healthcare sort of coupled together with the CIP knowhow we have from F&B and the sterile environment experience that we have from Healthcare are the two areas that these customers are most in need of, coupled with water management and Legionella capabilities. So as we go out, I think there's been an understanding of the benefits we can bring.","In many cases, you have had plant-level decision-making. This is what we went through in F&B years ago. It's what we went through with KAY when we entered the food retail market. Traditionally, they were local level decisions that we worked hard to centralize and make the company understand the benefits of centralizing in terms of consistency, in terms of cost-saving capability and ultimately throughput improvement. And all those things exist.","So our conversation's been quite positive, but we're talking about changes in big organizations. It takes some time. And what we're seeing is exactly what we would expect to see. If I take you back to food retail, which is not new news anymore \u2013 it's 20-some years old \u2013 we had no business in the top 10. And today we sell 9 out of the top 10 globally. I mean we've built a great position in that business but it wasn't done overnight. It takes a few years, and we expect to see the same type of results in Life Sciences.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up with a couple of follow-ups, if I may. First of all, you talked about your Europe and Asia Pacific sort of as the two regions that were leading your growth in the quarter. Kind of get the APAC portion of it, but what was it about Europe that made that region outperform I would imagine North America as well as Latin America in the quarter? And are those dynamics sustainable into the fourth quarter, into 2018?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes. I mean, Europe, in the second half, is going to grow 4% to 5% in total, which is pretty good. I think we called out early this year that Europe was probably the surprise in terms of economic activity. A lot of the Europe benefit was really driven by Industrial. Water in particular was upper-single digits and has done a very good job driving new business through an increased focus on both the heavy and the light side.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","So it sounds like it's both the market growth as well as better execution? Was one more impactful than the other?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, in Europe, you have to put it more on execution than overall market growth. I mean I would just say the market is better in Europe than we expected, but we had low expectations. But the Water and the Industrial business there certainly isn't growing at high single digits, so we know we're capturing share.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. And then just to follow up on the paper chemicals discussion you had where you kind of called out China as a problem region. Is that for you and your Paper business specifically and the products that you have going into that geography? Or was that a more general comment on the Chinese paper producing and pulp and paper market?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","No, unfortunately, I would say that's us. So I don't have any insight that the paper business in China is a problem overall. I would say my guess is it's not. This is our own execution, and I'd say the mistakes reside here. So we're dealing with them and getting after it, but no, it's not an overall comment on that market.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So the good news is that it's going to be fixed quickly. Okay. Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your questions.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you. All right, so just one more quick one on Institutional. Not to beat a dead horse, but is there any difference in what you're seeing between the big established chains that I kind of think of as more legacy Ecolab versus the street business that you've put more emphasis on in the last couple of years? Is there any difference in the trends that one growing faster than the other or are they both doing about the same?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, no, I don't think this is a independent versus chain deal. This is much more a segment deal that's going on. So the segments that are doing well, i.e. QSR, it's the chains that are in particular doing well. So, no, I don't think it's a mix in between independent and street at all.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then we hadn't really talked about capital allocation on this call. The buyback activity slowed a little bit. Is it still your expectation to do about $700 million this year and where are you on the M&A pipeline? Any comments there?","Daniel J. Schmechel - Ecolab, Inc.","Sure. So let me start with the share repurchase. So you've noted in the release of the materials, we've done north of $550 million year-to-date. My expectation is that we'll finish the year south of $700 million which is the number that we did last year, but of course that does depend on the M&A pipeline, which I would describe as typically robust, like lots of good ideas in the hopper. And so we are watching it closely, but I would expect share repurchase to end south of $700 million for the year.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your questions.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. Good morning. Good afternoon, rather, everyone. Doug, I was wondering. Industrial seems to be improving as far as you are concerned, so could you separate what was the improvement that was market driven versus Ecolab progress due to do new products on your accounts gains?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes, I mean, look, the best we would have is where's GDP and where's our acceleration, I guess would be close. We don't spend a ton of time trying to understand every nuance of plus and minus on the market in terms of what consumption is of, let's say, water chemicals in the existing accounts. By and large, I would say this. We know we're gaining share, we've got very good traction now in heavy, the exception being China as I mentioned earlier, but that we believe is bottoming. We have very solid traction in light industry across the board, particularly in F&B, where we've put a lot of emphasis on the cross-selling.","Our Food & Beverage, Food Safety business is doing very well and accelerating as we look and go through. Paper we talked is really a story of China and everywhere else. And I would just say the quick story, as I just mentioned in China, is we're not executing as we should. It's not a market problem, it's an execution problem and we own it. But we don't have a lot of those and we have one there and we'll address it and fix it as we are going forward and we are already working to do it. So I would say the Industrial I think across the board we've got good movement. We are confident we're gaining share, and most importantly, I think we're gaining momentum above and beyond what the market's giving us.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thanks. And then as you are expect price increases to more than offset for material inflations, do you think you can go back to \u2013 and I'm talking about the growth margin for the company overall. Do you think you can go back to 2016 margins? And again, I am also talking about on a public currency rate basis, not once you have adjusted everything. So if I look at 2016, for example, the first quarter growth margin was 47.3% and it went down to 46.5% in the first quarter of 2017 on that basis. Can we go to back to 2016 numbers in 2018?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes. You know what we will get \u2013 well, here's the history. So we really saw no raw material increase as a company from, call it, mid-1980s until mid-2000s. And then we have had a steady \u2013 well, how about a march from 2004 onwards. It comes like every three, four years in waves. And we're in the midst of another wave. If you go back to 2004 and you look at our margin in businesses that we've owned this then, all of them have steadily increased in spite of raw material inflation. I know no reason that that pattern is not going to continue. So we complain a lot about inflation, but by and large it's been our friend, and we've executed well.","So my expectation is, yes, ultimately, we will recover our margins that have been eroded as a consequence of raw materials, but it's predicated on two things. Yes, we have to get pricing, but we also have new innovation and drive new innovation that makes a lot of sense for our customers. And that's the other piece of this play that's being played out right now as well. So both of those are important. We typically don't just do it through raw pricing. Innovation plays a very important role.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of James Dolan with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead with your questions.","Dan Dolev - Instinet LLC","Yes. It's actually Dan Dolev. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions. One is what was the benefit you got in the Energy segment from that legal cost recovery? And then, is that included in your non-GAAP EPS? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes. It was a legal settlement benefit that we got, and it was in the segment, because all the costs of prosecuting it were also in that segment and incurred. So we try to match cost and benefit wherever it shows up on the P&L, so they match.","Dan Dolev - Instinet LLC","And is it included in that non-GAAP EPS number? Or is it excluded from non-GAAP?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","It's included in non-GAAP.","Dan Dolev - Instinet LLC","Got it. Thank you. And then...","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","So were the costs.","Dan Dolev - Instinet LLC","Right. Right. No. Understood. And my second question is if you take a step back and you think about where you started the year at $4.70 to $4.90, you were expecting $0.07 of EPS headwind. Now, it's neutral. Obviously, you add back the hurricane, it's about $0.08. And the equipment, it's about $0.01. But you also have like $0.04 of lower interest and lower taxes. So, I mean, net-net, I'm coming up with, say, like $4.60 at the midpoint versus $4.80. Where's the weakness coming from most in terms of just the apples-to-apples comparison? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yes. Good rec. I would say, I have the same rec in front of me. And the only missing part, raw materials were a $0.16 hurt versus our expectation going into the year. And that was probably the big wild card. Because you're right, FX is about $0.07 better than we expected when we started the year. You got hurricanes, so you're basically \u2013 you go through this. The base business more or less performed as expected as we have our natural adjustments in there, so that really wasn't a big surprise. It would've been raw materials.","Dan Dolev - Instinet LLC","Got it. And you did a little better on the SG&A. Is that cost cutting? Or just more?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, I mean, look, you adjust to the markets you have and to what you're going to do. So certainly there's efficiency drives, we continue to take our back office and centralize it in certain parts of the world, and do all those other things that you need to do to stay cost competitive.","Dan Dolev - Instinet LLC","Got it. Thank you very much. Much appreciated. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. Doug, I was wondering as you guys went through in Institutional, the low-margin stuff, was there a commonality through that in terms of the products that you moved away from? Was it you weren't getting enough price? Was there too much cost involved? Was it a market that was going the wrong way? And then, what did you learn there that can make that a continuous process across your portfolio? Or is this more of an episodic event that we'll see from time to time?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, I'd say this one is sort of unique. But when we bought Swisher, it was losing cash. And the way you lose cash is you underprice, and they were underpricing in a whole host of accounts via what they were delivering and how they were delivering it. And so we worked with those accounts to basically say, look, we'd love to continue to serve you, we just can't do it at a negative cash basis. So we either bring up the price or we have to discontinue the service, and those are the exercises that we went through. So it's basically repairing what was a broken business.","And as you recall, I mean, Swisher at one time was heralded as maybe the thing that was going to take us out. And you can't really sustain this on a going basis. So I would say Swisher is somewhat unique. We had to go exit. We weren't really \u2013 we don't believe in losing money for strategic reasons in accounts. It's never proven to be very strategic to me over any period of time. So we wanted to clean it up and get after it. And so with that, there's some pain associated with it. But we acquired Swisher at a very attractive price, so it's a business that's going to end us giving us returns but those returns need to be netted out once we see what our stable base is.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And so no Swisher-like issues across other segments? Or is that something that you routinely search for?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Much more routinely. We are always looking at our bottom contracts in terms of profitability and understanding how we can improve them organically over time. We rarely get into situations \u2013 I don't know of any right now where we're \u2013 we don't like to be cash negative.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mike Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Communications. Mr. Monahan, you may now begin.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's fourth quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. A discussion of our results along with our earnings release and the slides referencing this quarter's results and our outlook are available on the Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor.","Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with a brief overview of the quarter, continued attractive new business gains and new product introductions drove solid acquisition-adjusted fixed currency growth in our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments during the fourth quarter. These were offset by a moderating underlying sales decline in the Energy segment, though previously discussed one-time sales impacts in both this and last year resulted in a wider posted decrease for that business.","Product innovation and ongoing cost efficiency work led the total company's adjusted fixed currency operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the impact of soft economies, challenging end markets and continued currency headwinds. These drove the fourth quarter's 2% adjusted earnings per share increase, which includes a 2 percentage point currency translation headwind.","Moving to some highlights from the quarter and as discussed in our press release, consolidated acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales for Institutional, Industrial and Other segments grew 4%, but were offset by lower Energy sales period. Regional fixed currency sales growth was led by Latin America.","Reported operating margins increased 710 basis points. Adjusted fixed currency operating margins expanded 20 basis points, as continued sales growth from our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments as well as pricing and cost efficiencies offset lower Energy results.","In 2016's difficult operating environment, we focused on driving new business gains by helping customers to lower their costs. We used our industry-leading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve the best results and lowest operating costs and, through these, aggressively drive new account gains across all of our segments.","We expect 2017's external environment to show continued sluggish economic growth, higher delivered product costs, reduced but still unfavorable currency translation effects and gradually improving fundamentals in the energy markets. We will again work aggressively to drive our growth, employing the same fundamental approach, win new business using our innovative new products and a sharp focus on sales execution, and along with pricing and cost efficiencies, grow our top and bottom lines at improved rates.","We look for strong earnings growth in 2017, significantly outperforming the headwinds. We look for a better year-on-year acquisition-adjusted fixed currency growth in our Institutional, Industrial, and Other segments, as they once again work aggressively to outpace their markets, leveraging investments we have made to further improve sales and service force effectiveness and profitability. We expect Energy to be modestly accretive to sales and earnings growth, as it benefits from a more stable market.","We believe our actions will lead to better growth and stronger comparisons in the second half of the year versus the first half for Ecolab in 2017 with forecasted adjusted diluted earnings per share in the $4.70 to $4.90 range this year, increasing 8% to 12% including unfavorable $0.07 per share or 2 percentage point currency impact to earnings. In summary, despite a very challenging global, economic, and market environment, we expect to deliver strong adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2017.","And now, here's Doug Baker with some comments.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Thank you, Mike. So I'm just going to touch on first the fourth quarter and then thoughts on 2017.","So first, Q4, we had, going into the quarter, forecast that our Institutional, Industrial, and Other businesses would see better Q4 sales acceleration than Q3 and that our Energy business would deliver roughly the same sales and OI in Q4 as it did in Q3. Our Energy forecast turned out to be spot on. Its business is stabilized in the top line and improved on the bottom line with operating income up 45% in the second half versus the first half on similar sales.","Our Institutional, Industrial, and Other businesses did accelerate, but not as much as anticipated in Q4. Sales grew 50 basis points faster, but we projected a little north of 100 basis points. The lower acceleration plus a negative $0.01 of FX versus our forecast, and it was a rounding $0.01, drove the delta versus the midpoint of our Q4 range or $0.03. Underneath, the business is fairly solid with improvements in both industrial and institutional sectors, and our heavy up investments in healthcare and Life Sciences are gaining traction.","Finally, even as we recognized some softness in the fourth quarter, we purposely chose to stay the course on our investments and inventory reduction plans given our view moving into 2017. So let's talk this year. Importantly, we moved into the year with solid fundamentals and lessening headwinds. We expect to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth as indicated by the midpoint of our range. The forecast we have is built on the following assumptions: similar overall global growth environment; continued solid Institutional, Industrial, and Other growth with the business accelerating for the year; a stable energy market with oil trading in the $50 to $60 a barrel range; modest raw material inflation that we will offset by pricing; stabilizing dollar driving modest FX unfavorability for the year; and some first-half negative impact as FX hedges unwind.","Given the timing of the hedge unwinds and the raw material increases which are front-end loaded and our typical pricing delay, we will see better EPS growth in the second half, but we will see growth in all four quarters and a return ultimately to more normal Ecolab-like performance.","So with that, I'm going to turn it to Mike and then we'll open up to questions in a minute.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","Thanks. That concludes our formal remarks. A final note before we start Q&A. We plan to hold our annual tour of our booth at the National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago on Monday, May 22. Looking further ahead, we also plan to hold our 2017 Investor Day in St. Paul on Thursday, September 7. If you have any questions, please contact my office.","Operator, please begin the question-and-answer period.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC. Please go ahead with your questions.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I guess maybe I'll just start out with the Energy business. A two-part question. The energy industry CapEx outlook calls for a sharp rebound in U.S. shale, but pretty lackluster outside of that. Given you make more money in that business, I guess I just wanted to get a sense for how you're thinking about your Energy business? And the second part more specifically, your prepared remarks said that drilling fluids were doing well but that the well completion didn't as much. Is there any reason that would continue, or was that something more specific to this quarter? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","We think the well completion will build throughout the year and start coming around even in this quarter particularly in North America. Yeah, I mean I think there're two energy markets right now. North America is clearly turning and the rest of the world has not yet turned and probably we won't expect to see a turn there until the second half of this year.","But with that said, I think our view on the Energy business is clearly more favorable than the last couple of years. We view that we think it will be minorly accretive both on a top line basis and a bottom line basis for the year. It's going to show kind of steady improvement on the top line throughout the year. The first quarter, we would expect sales to be slightly under first quarter of last year, but have positive OI. And the real question for us, we do not forecast any big upturn occurring in 2017. We think that's more a 2018 story. And we'll have to see how we plan to build some resources moving into 2018 at the end of the year. But that's going to be a story we'll talk about in subsequent quarters. Right now, I would say we're fairly \u2013 we view this year as sort of a transition year in the Energy business, but it's certainly not going to be a drag like it has been the last two years.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then to follow up just quickly, how are you planning or how did you fund the recent acquisition in Europe? And any color you'd provide on how we should think about modeling the profitability of that or growth of that asset, any thoughts there. Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Dan Schmechel happens to be here. Why don't you answer that, Dan?","Daniel J. Schmechel - Ecolab, Inc.","Sure. So given what we're buying here, our European assets, our intent is to fund it effectively in the European debt market, where the rates are currently very attractive.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","John Salvatore Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi, good afternoon. First question, can you talk a little bit about inflationary pressures across the business? And how should we think about the lag between any price gains and any raw material pressures that you have? How do we think about that by segment?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","We would expect that you're going to see a change. We already started to see it in the fourth quarter in some of the businesses. The price lag usually is several quarters for us. And we say within the first 12 months we typically recover the absolute dollar of the inflation in raw materials through pricing, but we don't recover the margin usually for another year. It just takes a while. We tend to try to go through and do this on a more smooth basis. You've got, though, in certain businesses, Water and Energy in particular, a number of cost-plus contracts. Those usually always lag a quarter or two both on the down and on the up as we go through, and those are already pre-negotiated changes, and that represents often about 25% of their business.","So I think what you would expect to see this year is we're going to have some margin pressure from inflation in the first couple of quarters. That's both raw material increases and the FX hedges unwinding, but it's going to be offset by pricing as you move into quarters three and four, and that's pretty much across the board.","John Salvatore Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay, thank you. And then on the follow-up, Healthcare posted another good organic gain, and I think this is a couple of quarters in a row of better than corporate growth there. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on in your outlook there for 2017? Thank you, folks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Healthcare, as we've been talking, we felt good about the plans and the progress we have made in Healthcare, and it always takes a few quarters to show up. But a couple of things, we had a 6% quarter in Q4 in terms of Healthcare growth. It was really driven. We have created two business units in Healthcare, if you will. There's the acute care, still focused on hospitals principally. We also have a Life Sciences business unit.","The acute care has continued to accelerate. It did a 4% in Q4 and the Life Sciences did 14%. And moving into Q1, we would expect the acute care to accelerate from 4% to 6% \u2013 5% or 6%, and the Life Sciences is going to be around 14% again or mid-teens. So both sides of that business are doing, I would say, better and they've got very good traction on both sides. And it's driven the old-fashioned way, by great focus on new business activity and leveraging innovation to drive new business. So for the year, we have a fairly bullish outlook, very similar to first quarter. That's how we see the year progressing.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your questions.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure, so over the last couple of years, the Water segment has been dragged by weak results in the mining industry in particular. When you look out to 2017, do you think you'll mostly have lapped that, and what are your growth expectations for that business?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I'll address mining first. I think mining improved dramatically throughout the year, but it was still down mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. We would expect mining to probably trip into positive territory, either Q1 or Q2 latest, as we go through this year. If you look at Water in total, I think the Water story next year we think is going to be a \u2013 it will be a significant improvement. There's a lot of things that have been going on in the Water business that we feel very good about. It always takes a couple of quarters.","But the fundamental story there is strong new business activity, strong innovation activity, and 2017 is just fundamentally a better market for Water than 2016, not even expecting turnarounds in a number of industries. But stabilization in mining and steel and a number of other heavy industries, it will do just fine. The Light business, which has not been impacted by what I would call segment softness, grew 7% in the fourth quarter, and we expect similar-type results next year.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then on the recent acquisition of Laboratoires Anios, should we think about the operating margins as similar to Ecolab's legacy European segment, or are they closer to the Global Institutional segment margins?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","They're closer. They're somewhere in between, but closer to the Institutional margins than they are certainly to the average European margins. So it was an attractive business from a profitability standpoint, innovation standpoint, positioning standpoint, so we're quite happy that we were able to close on that business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon. I just wanted to \u2013 your guidance for 2017 calls for more Ecolab-like growth, I guess, and I think rough math would suggest you're probably still looking for somewhere short of mid-single digits, maybe just around then. I was just wondering. What does it take or what do you need to get to those 6% to 8% type targets you've always set out for the longer term?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I think from a top line standpoint, we need all businesses moving, and so Energy this year will be, as we said, modestly accretive on the top line, but certainly not \u2013 we don't think it will be growing into the 6% to 8% for the full year simply because you're starting with a minor hole in first quarter as you go in. And we are not predicting a dramatic recovery in that business globally in 2017. We think it's in front of us. But certainly the top line this year will be positive that we have enough I think sales growth to overcome what we predict will be a fairly modest negative from currency, and I think you'll see our overall business improve and perform.","In our Institutional, Industrial, and Other businesses this year, the combined, we expect our results in 2017 to be more favorable than 2016 from a top line standpoint too. So these businesses are all moving in the right direction. And I would expect next year I think you'll see a normal top line type performance because energy will be in a more favorable market.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it, okay. And then I know there's a lot of moving pieces with obviously the new administration, but I was hoping you could give us some color on maybe what the moving parts would be for your business in terms of your supply chain with respect to the border tax proposals and so forth. Any color there would be helpful.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","One, I think none of us know ultimately what a tax proposal will look like, and there's a lot of work being done obviously in DC. Let's say the Brady Plan with the border adjustability provision was passed. It would be favorable for us. We don't take any solace in that because fundamentally we don't think that's ultimately what's going to probably get through, but who knows? I think the bigger question is what's its impact on the overall economy and many of our customers which is also a big concern for us and maybe even a bigger concern.","And so we're also quite hopeful that we're able to get something done on corporate tax. We'd like a lot of the provisions in what I'll call the Brady proposal. I'm not totally comfortable with the border adjustability just as a big, big bet on a big piece of our economy and nobody knows exactly how it plays out and that seems to us unwarranted because the other parts of the proposal, we think, are almost guaranteed wins. So we have to let it play out. If it did pass exactly like it is, our tax rate would likely go down.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Doug, Food & Beverage right after the Nalco deal was one of the higher growth areas because of the synergies. It's become one of the lower growth areas recently. Have we just lapped the opportunities or is there a way to get that business growing faster again?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I think we believe F&B is going to grow faster in 2017 than 2016 for two reasons. One, it had a very steady, successful new business campaign. They certainty were in markets this year that were impacted. I mean, dairy has been a tough market, agri has been a tough market and you also have just a lot of consolidations going on, some that are behind us, but we'll see what the future holds.","Clearly, the dairy and agri businesses, if nothing else, are annualizing and they're no longer declining. So we think the environment in 2017 is just more favorable than 2016 period for that business. So we would expect the innovation and new business work to shine through in a more effective way. So we see F&B accelerating in 2017 versus 2016.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And then you've got a major competitor in both the water area and the cleaning chemical areas in play right now. Should we expect Ecolab's M&A activity to be relatively subdued until those two other transactions clear the market?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Not necessarily. I don't think they're going to impact our M&A view going forward. So, what would impact that is, are they good deals.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Doug, Paper is doing just way better than we certainly expected when you bought the original Nalco business and a 5% growth. I was wondering if you could just talk about what's going on over there underlying, are we at kind of a new normal over here, what kind of growth to expect, does it look like it's more core than it used to look like a few years ago? And then I have a follow-up after that.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I've always been pretty clear on Paper that we weren't going to be the consolidator, but we likely weren't going to be the divestiture either on that property. And we've always said that that business has got a very good team, good innovation, capabilities. It's always done fairly well. We have built EBITDA margins in that business handily since we acquired it and it's had a very steady top line growth trajectory even in a difficult environment.","So, what's going on in Paper, yeah, I mean our terminal value there is in a 5% growth, I'll say that. But we would expect 2017 to be in the 3% to 4% range versus the historic 2% to 3%. I think the team's finding its legs. It's done a good job, continuing to improve the, sort of, customer portfolio and keep focusing where you would expect to see growth in Paper moving forward, and they've got strong innovation pipeline, so I think the team's done a very good job. They've improved that business, so it's sustainable. But we aren't predicting 5% growth going forward.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. And just I want to follow up on a note on the technician shortage in Equipment Care. Are you seeing just from other business units also like wage inflation or a tougher hiring environment and have you seen kind of that step up in the last several quarters, and if so, how are you thinking about that in terms of just margins and how you attack something like that at this point in time.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I'd say it's very specific geographically, but certainly, I mean, if you take U.S., yeah, there are certain markets where we've clearly seen wage inflation driven by the low unemployment, I mean, including our headquarter market. So we're in a market here that's been perennially around a little north of 3% unemployment, but we've lived through this for many years in a sense and certainly we've seen wage inflation driven the old-fashioned way via the market, and how do we deal with it? Like we deal with all other inflationary items. I mean we've got to go price forward.","And you brought up kitchen equipment repair. That business has successfully recovered all inflationary pressures. It certainly improved profitability handily even with those pressures in 2016 and we expect it's equipped to do that going forward as are our other businesses. So I don't think this is going to be something that we proactively talk about moving forward as one of the real key pressures on the business. We think it's a pressure we can manage.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good afternoon. Can you give an update on how you're thinking about growth in Europe and whether it will be enough to sort of get back on the 100 basis points of margin expansion track?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, I mean for the year last year, we met our 100 basis point objective either just looking at legacy or if you look at total Europe and include other businesses. And so I don't think we have to get back on there. I think cumulative now in the legacy businesses, we've done 650 basis points over six years, so that's doing what we said we would do, and we anticipate that we will be able to accomplish that again in 2017.","But your point's fair. You need a \u2013 we need top line movement to do that, so obviously driving that kind of success in a negative sales growth environment would be much harder. We would expect \u2013 we will continue to have top line growth there, but we would expect 2017 to be more modest than 2016 in Europe, simply because we anticipate we'll have a slow start there.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Doug, just on Institutional, how do you characterize the demand trends in that business right now and what are you looking forward for growth in that business in 2017?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","In total, I think Institutional is going to have a similar year in 2017 in total as it did in 2016, which is very solid year. It's going to be probably a flip in terms of stronger second half in 2017 versus first half as we go. Demand profile is good. I mean I would say foodservice trends globally remain fairly strong. Lodging remains fairly strong in that business. Obviously, we have a very strong business in the United States. And if you cut through all the noise and there's like a Swisher drag in there and all the rest. That business was a 6% growth business in Q4 and we expect similar in Q1. So it's doing quite well, and that's all we expect moving forward.","In 2017, you're going to be going against a very strong base in the first half and an easier base, if you will, comps in the second half. So, that's going to have influence and also on a margin standpoint, they're going to have some cost-to-goods pressure and hedging effects in the first half that they'll overcome through pricing. And we expect more margin expansion in the second half than in the first half in that business. But that's not an unsimilar story to other sectors we're dealing with. That business is doing just fine.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. And just on Diversity, Doug, are you seeing any benefits or are you taking advantage of any of the distractions at Diversity during their sales process?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","We've been I would say over the years in a number of instances we've had situations where competitors go through the distraction of either a large acquisition and\/or being sold or bought or whatever you want to call it. In all cases, we do view that as an opportunity, and we try not to miss those opportunities as we move forward. We think the stability that we've had as a business in terms of ownership, management focus, and the rest has been a real advantage for us. And we try to make that known how that advantage plays out for customers' benefit, and certainly we'll continue to do that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Good afternoon. A lot of my questions have been answered already, but thank you for taking my call, a quick question on the comments that you made regarding the strength that you've seen in your revenues in Latin America in the fourth quarter. Was that just a question of easier comps or foreign exchange or just the business efforts that you've had in the area or the economy is coming back? Can you provide a little bit more color on what's driving the Latin American strength?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I think there are a couple of things. If you look at the growth, 60% of it is pricing. You've got pretty significant inflation going on in that market as a consequence of devaluing currencies. And we've worked hard to make sure that we're recovering the inflation that that drives via pricing, and so that's clearly a big piece of the sales growth. But then the remaining 40% or 4 points is volume.","And I would say those economies aren't great, but we've still been able to capture new business successfully and retain business successfully, which is why we're also seeing volume growth in addition to the pricing growth. So I think we'll continue to do well. We've got a very, very good Latin America team. They have performed year in and year out over a long period of time, and we expect more from them and the same type of results going forward.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, thank you. And then the other question, actually you've touched on the trends in Paper and Food & Beverage, but another smaller segment in Industrial that's doing well for you recently is textile care, and obviously that's also not been a segment where you've been focusing on growth, I guess, would be the best way to put it. So can you talk a little bit about what's changing, if anything, in the market that's allowing this segment to all of a sudden start posting mid-single-digit growth versus very low-single digits that we've become accustomed to in the previous years?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","First, I'd say, Dmitry, in all cases if we're in a business, we're in it to win and we're in it to drive growth, period. Otherwise, you shouldn't own the thing. And so the expectations of textile, paper, any business that we have are the same, which is we're going to continue to grow share, we're going to continue to grow margins, and we're going to do them simultaneously as we move forward. And we need to outperform whatever the economic conditions are. So that's our expectation.","Look, I feel good. I think the Paper team is proud of what they've accomplished and the textile team has started to regain some momentum too. And they've done it by selling new business and getting after some of their margin challenges, particularly in certain geographies. And there's more to do there, but I have a lot of confidence that that business is on it and is poised to continue to drive improvements going forward.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your questions.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Can you talk about the price trends in Energy and whether those price trends are going to persist in the first half of 2017 or longer?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","We've seen steady improvement. It looked like our low point in terms of pricing pressure was, I'll call it July 1. And since then it's slowly abated, not dramatically, but slowly. We would perceive that we'll see that continued, I guess, less bad pricing scenario for the first two quarters, and we might start getting even in Q3 \u2013 Q4 or even see some light at the end of the tunnel, particularly if raws start moving in the other direction, triggering some contractual terms.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then for my follow-up, for the last two years your SG&A expense has been down year over year. And I think this year you're talking about a 33% SG&A ratio, which would probably mean that would be up, I don't know, somewhere between $150 million and $200 million. Is that a true description of what's occurring, and why the SG&A inflation this year?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I'd say the last couple of years what you've had going on is, I would say modest. It's still been accretive from a margin standpoint, but growth in SG&A across the Industrial, Institutional, and Other platform, and it's been offset in total by reduction in SG&A in Energy, as we've right-sized that business for the market conditions.","What you have in 2017 is obviously no more need for right-sizing the Energy business. If anything, SG&A is going to be stable there, and we'll probably be looking to add important growth components as the year progresses there, if our view on Energy remains the same, that 2018 is going to be a strong year. And you see continued what I would call modest investments in SG&A and the other businesses continue in 2017. So the big difference I would say versus the last few years is Energy is no longer in a cut mode.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions.","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. It looks like core growth in the specialty business ticked up in fourth quarter to 8%. What drove the strong performance there? Were there some one-time factors or easier comparisons? And then how are you thinking about this business for 2017?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Pest had a little stronger quarter, but it's been running around that area. I would say that business is in a good position. Sometimes during a quarter, you may have a point of growth up or a point of growth down. It's just 13 weeks. By and large, we expect that to continue to grow in the high single-digit area as we move forward in 2017.","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. And then in the Institutional business, can you quantify the impact to organic growth from the exiting of the low margin business at Swisher? Was it a point or more or less than a point? And then also, on the divestiture of the non-core business, how big was that? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, I would say globally it rounds around almost to a point, but it's going to go away probably the end of Q2, Q3 start normalizing, on your first question, i.e. the low margin and the less attractive business. And we don't take that out of our acquisition-adjusted because it's really sort of in the base business. The business we exited was worth, like, $30 million. It was the restroom hygiene business. That is adjusted out when we do acquisition-adjusted figures or organic figures.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your questions.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Just looking at the Institutional division, you've commented in the past on new account wins. I was wondering if you could give a little bit of color on the pace of business with those new accounts. Is it still the case that you're getting the warewashing business first and then over time you would expect to increase penetration into some other product lines or is it the case where more recently you're seeing the rate of penetration better from the outside such that you're selling a broader range of products from the get-go?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I think somewhere in between, Mike. I mean the truth is when we sell a new, say, foodservice operation, be it the foodservice in a hotel or a restaurant chain or a caterer, we typically get a pretty big slug of what I'll call the kitchen hygiene program including warewashing and other products needed to take care of the food safety, et cetera, in a kitchen. Over time, we built from there, no doubt about it and that equation has not changed. So, that is simple as it's only warewash and then we start selling the balance of the kitchen hygiene. Usually, it's, call it, 80% of the kitchen hygiene program. We build from there. But that would not include things like water filtration, audit programs, pest elimination programs, kitchen equipment repair, et cetera, et cetera. Those types of programs are built over time as our customer relationship develops.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","And then I was just hoping that you could talk a little bit about the cost structure and the margin profile of the Energy business as we think about next year. Obviously some puts and takes. You were taking out costs this year, but based on this modest revenue growth profile, how much margin improvement could we expect to see in terms of OI margin next year compared to this 11% margin that we showed this year? Is it a situation where we could see you get as high as the 13.4% that we saw back in 2015?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","When you're saying next year, is that 2017?","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Yeah, sorry, this year.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Okay.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","I'm living in the past, Doug.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","No, it's okay. I was, like, all of the sudden I'm being asked questions about Energy margins for 2018. Yeah, I think you're going to see \u2013 you won't see dramatic margin improvement this year for two reasons. One, we're kind of going through this transition, and there's two parts of this transition. There's a gross profit part, because as oil recovery occurs, so too does raw material recovery. We've talked \u2013 we always have a bit of a delay between raw material price increases and our ability to capture price, and that's true in the Energy business as well. And secondly, we're going to have some investment that we need to make in the Energy business in SG&A, moving into 2018 if we are confident that 2018 represents a pick-up in business activity. That call's going to be made in the third and fourth quarter. It's a long time from now in that sense and so I don't even know that it's worth talking about.","For the year, we think the margin \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, we expect modest accretion on both the top and bottom line which suggests kind of flattish margins for the year in Energy, as we kind of go through this noise of raws and pricing recovery and then anticipated probably some SG&A investments needed as we exit the year preparing for an upturn next year. That's what's in our forecast.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please proceed with your questions.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good afternoon. You had previously highlighted a potential opportunity to monetize customer data through technology investments in the field and I think you referenced the cloud as well. Just curious what inning are we in sort of the monetization process and could this be meaningful over the long term. Any color around that would be great.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I think the opportunity to use the information that we already capture within customers much more effectively to drive value, merchandise the value we create, develop new opportunities and ways to help customers obviously with their full partnership represents a huge opportunity for the company. Whether it's specifically monetizing the information, i.e. charging for it or it's instead used as a means of us better helping customers and being more valuable, I think it's probably the latter. It's my guess as we move forward.","We're in early innings. We certainly do it in many instances today, but I think our ability to up our game there is fairly dramatic. We've got huge advantage, I think, versus anybody else. We have over a million customer sites and probably collect data today and call it \u2013 and making it up 800,000 of those sites, but have only connected about less than 100,000 of those sites to the cloud.","So the hard part is capturing the data. Connecting to the cloud isn't technically very complicated, and that's the work that we're doing. And then synthesizing it, rationalizing it, making it valuable for customers is, like, real work, and we're partnering with some great partners to learn how to do this and improve our capabilities there, which I think we've talked about. I mean Microsoft is a company that we've been leveraging there in many ways, sales force and other parts of our business, and we'll continue to do that as we move forward. So I think it's going to be huge for the company. It will not impact material 2017. I'm not even sure it will materially impact 2018, but in the not too distant future it's going to be a core way of us doing business.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And just a follow-up question. On the Energy business, do you have a sense of how much of a headwind has it been with customers shifting towards Tier 1 acreage essentially oil plays where it's cheaper extraction cost and so they use less Ecolab product versus oil plays where more Ecolab product is required for extraction? Just trying to get a sense of has that been a structural headwind? Has that gone away? Is that an issue still? Any color would be great. Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","First of all, yes, it is a headwind, and when oil gets cheap, people go to the cheapest, right, oil they can find, no doubt about it. We've always said you get kind of a stable price or expected price north of $60, different types of activities turn on and those activities are more fruitful for us because they command more technology than other.","With that said, I think there's already been a somewhat positive shift from the bottom of the market as people start getting after oil that they weren't chasing just six, nine months ago, and that's a tailwind that we'll start seeing benefiting us in the Energy business over the next few years. But it's not a light switch, and as we said, we don't expect huge change in activity, stabilization, you're seeing the improvement. We expect to see that, but we don't expect any kind of sand dune or hockey-stick effect in 2017. We think it's going to take a little longer than that.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much. I'm just curious in Pest Elimination, I'm pushing double-digits, the commentary is that it should show good growth in the first quarter. I'm curious can we get to double-digits? Is there \u2013 and I remember hearing that Zika may be something relevant. I'm just \u2013 they haven't heard much about that. Curious to see if that's something that maybe a \u2013 push it over the top. Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Look, here's what I like. We are now debating whether pest ought to be an 8% or 10% business which is a lot more fun than just a few years ago where it was, like, at 2% and 3%. So I think the team in pest has done exactly what we hoped they would and asked them to do, which is they've really revitalized the business. We made a number of investments in that business, and it has paid off and the team has done a good job leveraging the investments that we made there. I think this is a run rate that we see right now. I don't think there's any natural barrier to the business that says it can't be a double-digit business. But right now I guess our expectation is that it's going to remain a high-single-digit organic growth business and it's a terrific business and at those growth rates we like it quite a bit.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Doug. And then shifting gears on just CapEx, could you delve into that a little bit for 2017? And where some of the specific areas are that you're targeting? Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","A lot of it's more of the same. I would guess this year's CapEx spend \u2013 of course we have a plan. We never exactly spend to our plan. I think it's going to be around $800 million spend. The single biggest category again is merchandising equipment. We expect to spend more in merchandising equipment this year than last year. That's a good thing because that's basically dispensing equipment for our chemicals and it indicates bullishness on part of the divisions around their new business capabilities. So I like to see that.","If there's been a shift in spend, I went through and explained last year that we had a series of one-timers on offices. That's behind us and is going to slowly dissipate away. We're going to see more capacity build in this year than we did last year in terms of liquids capabilities, some capacity that we want to see for Energy, et cetera, that we're going to build in advance simply because we don't want to get caught short on the turnaround next year.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your questions.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great, thanks. Guys, I just noticed in your commentary on Energy that there are a couple exogenous-type events that happened in the quarter. I just want to have a little bit better understanding of what that was and how non-reoccurring they were.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","In Energy?","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I would say there are always going to be exogenous events every quarter in Energy. I would say Energy in the fourth quarter delivered exactly what we expected it to moving into the quarter, and we haven't been able to say that many times. And so you always have events in Energy. And so certainly Nigeria, you've got pipelines going down in other parts of Africa. That impacts it. But there's always something going on. We've got a global business in Energy. And our expectation is the fundamentals in that market are improving, and that's the thing that we most focus on. We can't predict when the next pipeline is going to go down, but something will happen in 2017 also, I'm sure.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. I wanted to follow up on use of the buyback. Obviously, you didn't do any in fourth quarter, and you did front-load last year's buyback activity with an ASR. You haven't announced one this year. I'm just curious as to what your thoughts are around the buyback for 2017. And similar to a prior question, does it depend on the clearance of the larger deals that would be of potential interest to you? Do those need to clear before maybe we'd see the buyback ramp up?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I'm sure he won't fall for it.","Daniel J. Schmechel - Ecolab, Inc.","So standing here today, what we know our expectation for 2017 is that our share repurchase would be about the same in amount and sequence that you saw in 2016. So we did $700 million of shares repurchased in 2016. You're right, we did an upfront $300 million ASR. We've not committed to the ASR, but my expectation is that share repurchase would be about the same in the aggregate and that some of it would be done in an accelerated way.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your questions.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Doug, I was wondering if you could touch on Asia. If my memory serves me right, you talked in your prepared remarks about some softness, particularly in China. Could you give us a feel for where the softness was, in particular vis-\u00e0-vis your operations and what you are seeing for 2017?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Hi, Rosemarie. Yes, in China in heavy water and the heavy industrial side, we continue to see softness there. So I think mining, steel, and even paper just as China has been going through a bit of a cycle in the heavy industry. As we move forward, with that said, so our China business was down maybe 5% for the year, but made more money in 2017. That's the organic rate. The actual reported rate was positive because we made the acquisition that in part annualized in 2016.","Moving forward, we would expect to have positive organic growth in 2017, so a better year. In large part, there's stabilization in the Chinese market, even in steel and some of these other areas. What we'll end up doing is annualizing again some of the pain in 2017, so we don't really have a falling market. What we have is a bit lower market, but we will we believe grow in that market both organically and potentially through acquisition too.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","And if I may, you have made some change in Healthcare with Life Sciences growing at 14% and acute care at 4% to 6%. Can you give us a better feel for the changes you have made? And then what is the percentage of total of each one of those entities? I would guess that it is the Life Sciences that is the smallest, but if you could help on that.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","So first of all, we've done several things and we've talked about them, but splitting the business allowed both businesses to better focus on: one, acute care; and two, Life Sciences. They're different markets. They utilize some of the same technology, but importantly the selling process, the specific programs that you build for each of those markets are different, and we wanted to make sure that we had improved focus to go after both of those markets successfully. I think that benefited the businesses.","Number two, in the acute care area, which we've talked about for a period of time, because it's the largest, we have seen our improved focus on program development around HAICs or healthcare-acquired infection control. That's gone quite well, and that team has done a good job not only developing the program but selling it and getting uptake from customers.","And so those are in a nutshell the two big moves that have been made there. And the teams are on it. I think they're doing a very good job. So we would expect them to continue to perform, as I mentioned earlier, in 2017 like we saw in the fourth quarter, so call it mid-single digits for acute care, 5%, 6%, maybe even north, and Life Sciences in the teen-type growth area. Size of Life Sciences, it's a little north of $100 million.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Yiqin Gao with Nationwide. Please proceed with your questions.","Yiqin Gao - Nationwide Insurance Co.","Hi, and thank you for taking my question. You mentioned that Ecolab is still going to pursue M&A opportunities this year. Can you talk a little bit about the size of the kind of deal you're looking for and also the pipeline and how you're going to fund those deals? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, look, the only \u2013 we tend not to get very specific about how we're thinking and what we're thinking about M&A kind of like everybody else. So it's better just left it unsaid. So M&A has been a historic part of our strategy. It will remain a key part of our strategy going forward.","Yiqin Gao - Nationwide Insurance Co.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. There are no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing remarks.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","That wraps up our fourth quarter conference call.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Michael J. Monahan","Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's Second Quarter Conference Call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO. A copy of our earnings release and the accompanying slides referenced in this teleconference are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor.","Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on Slide 2, stating that this teleconference and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q item -- under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our second quarter release and on Slide 2. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with an overview on Slide 3. We delivered strong results in the second quarter. We leveraged solid sales volume growth, pricing and our synergy and cost efficiency work to substantially improve our acquisition-adjusted operating margins and produce a very strong adjusted earnings per share increase. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to outperform our markets and show strong 13% to 17% earnings gains in the third quarter and strong upper-teens EPS growth for the full year as good sales growth, appropriate pricing, innovation, synergies and margin leverage more than offset mixed markets.","Moving to some highlights from the second quarter. And as discussed in our press release, reported second quarter earnings per share were $1.02. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, second quarter 2014 earnings per share increased a very strong 20% to a record $1.03. The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by volume and pricing, new products, account gains, synergies and cost-savings actions. Growth was led by our Energy, Specialty and Water businesses. Latin America led the regional growth once again and was bolstered by strong growth in Asia Pacific and North America. These and other increases were leveraged by good margin expansion.","We continue to be aggressive, focusing on top line growth. We are emphasizing our innovative product and service strength, as well as our wide range of effective solutions to help customers get better results and lower operating costs and through these, drive new account gains across all of our customer segments. We also continue to implement appropriate price increases to help offset higher costs and investments in our business. We remain focused on expanding our margins, emphasizing productivity and efficiency improvements to help increase profitability, as well as drive merger synergies. We also continue to make investments in key growth businesses to sustain our technology and our sales and service leadership. We remain on plan for achieving our Nalco and Champion synergy targets, and our Europe margins are on track for further strong expansion.","We -- looking ahead, while mixed trends in our markets present ongoing challenges, we look for the third quarter to show continued attractive sales gains and margin improvement. Third quarter adjusted EPS is expected to increase a strong 13% to 17% to the $1.18 to $1.22 range and compare with last year's adjusted EPS of $1.04. Business growth and the benefits from synergies and cost reductions should more than offset lackluster economic trends. In addition, the quarter will compare against a very strong 20% adjusted EPS gain in last year's third quarter. For the full year 2014, we continue to look for a very strong 17% to 19% increase to the $4.14 to $4.20 range. In summary, our second quarter performed well, and we expect the balance of the year to also show strong earnings growth as we more than offset challenging economic conditions while making the key investments to drive our superior results this year, as well as for our future.","Slide 4 shows our second quarter results both as reported and with adjustments for special gains and charges, while Slide 5 shows our sales growth detail. Ecolab's consolidated fixed-currency sales for the second quarter increased 8%. Acquisition-adjusted fixed-currency sales rose 5%. Looking at the growth components. Volume and mix increased 4%. Pricing rose 1%. Acquisitions and divestitures were 3%, and currency was a negative","1%.","Reported fixed-currency sales for the Global Industrial segment rose 3%. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the segment was not significant. Second quarter fixed-currency Global Food & Beverage sales increased 3%. Growth was led by beverage and brewing, dairy and agri, which more than offset lower sales in the weak protein market. Regionally, Asia Pacific and Latin America led results with modest growth, driven by share gains in the other region as we more than offset plant closures and weak volumes. Food & Beverage continues to benefit from its Total Plant Assurance approach to the customers, in which we combine industry-leading Cleaning & Sanitizing, Water Treatment and Pest Elimination capabilities to deliver improved food safety results, lower operating costs and better product quality assurance for customers. This has enabled us to win business with key global customers and offset difficult conditions in our North America and Europe markets, where lower volumes, as well as customer capacity and plant closures, have impacted sales.","Looking ahead, we expect moderate organic sales growth in the third quarter. We look for further benefits from growth synergies, better customer penetration and new business capture, as well as leverage from our innovation pipeline, including the introduction of 3D TRASAR for clean-in-place systems in Food & Beverage plants to more than offset tough industry conditions.","Fixed-currency Water sales increased 5%. Good growth in the heavy, light and mining businesses led the increase. Regionally, we saw strong growth in Latin America, good gains in EMEA and Asia Pacific and moderate growth in North America. The introduction of 3D TRASAR for hotel and other institutional cooling systems in the second quarter, utilizing solid chemistry and advance dispensing in a premium customer solution utilizing both Ecolab and Nalco technology, has been well received by customers. To continue to drive market penetration with innovative solutions to optimize water usage using powerful technologies, we are focused on building our corporate account and enterprise sales teams, delivering growth synergies and improving product innovation to drive revenues. We expect to show continued growth in the third quarter as market share gains drive our heavy and light businesses to outperform mixed end markets.","Acquisition-adjusted second quarter fixed-currency Paper sales declined 1%. We saw double-digit growth in Latin America and modest growth in Asia Pacific. However, these were offset by declines in North America and EMEA that resulted from continued low customer plant utilization and customer closures. We expect Paper to show flattish sales in the third quarter as new business and technology penetration offset the difficult Paper market conditions.","Fixed-currency sales for the Global Institutional segment rose 3%. Adjusted for a small divestiture in Europe, Institutional segment sales grew 4%. Turning to the businesses that make up the segment. Fixed-currency sales for the Institutional business grew 3% in the second quarter. Institutional's end markets remain subdued with moderate growth in global lodging room demand and still soft foodservice foot traffic across North America and Europe.","Looking at regional sales trends, North America -- North and Latin America continue to post solid sales growth, while Asia Pacific saw moderate gains and Europe declined. Sales initiatives targeting new accounts and effective product and service programs around the core segments continue to drive our results. We continue to leverage our global technology through the rollout of Apex, our next-generation warewashing platform in Europe.","To drive our future growth and improve on our industry leadership position, we remain focused on executing global sales initiatives, globalizing core competencies and introducing product innovation that delivers increased value with solutions that reduce water, energy and labor costs, while also increasing our customer innovacy [ph] through outstanding sales and service execution. We're also making further investments in field technology to enhance execution in sales and service, and we have better aligned our local sales team efforts around our global value proposition.","Longer term, our new Global Institutional structure is helping to accelerate global deployment of our innovation, technology and training, which we expect will help improve growth by driving better market penetration and new account gains. We look for third quarter Institutional business sales growth to improve as we make further progress on our global sales initiatives and continue our aggressive sales efforts to help us outperform challenging markets and show better growth over the balance of the year.","Second quarter sales for Specialty grew 7% in fixed currencies. Quick service sales were solid as we enjoyed steady growth from small to midsized customers. New accounts, along with increased service coverage and additional solutions for customers to help improve their operating efficiency and food safety, leveraged generally modest industry trends. Regionally, the U.S. and Latin America recorded solid gains. Europe saw good growth from new accounts and additional customer solutions, while Asia Pacific benefited from good quick service foot traffic growth. The Food Retail business saw solid sales momentum in the second quarter, benefiting from customer additions, new products and increased penetration. We look for good sales growth again in the third quarter as Specialty works to deliver another solid performance in 2014.","Fixed-currency Global Healthcare sales increased 3%. New account growth, better penetration and new product introductions more than offset continued weak hospital trends and delayed buying decisions in the U.S. To grow sales in this challenging market, we are strengthening our corporate accounts approach and our integrated value proposition, as well as improving our product portfolio. We expect Global Healthcare sales to show modest gains in the second half as we continue our work to strengthen our business.","Reported fixed-currency Energy segment sales grew 20%. Acquisition-adjusted Global Energy fixed-currency sales rose 8%. Our upstream business saw good growth in the second quarter, led by strong international performance, as well as solid oil sands, shale and deepwater production results. Downstream business sales increased as North America refining showed overall improvement. Looking ahead, we expect acquisition-adjusted Energy segment sales to show double-digit growth in the second half as new business resulting from ongoing share gains and new production coming online drives growth and delivers a full year 2014 acquisition-adjusted sales increase in the 10% range.","Sales for our Other segment increased 7%. Acquisition-adjusted sales grew 4%. Fixed-currency Global Pest sales increased 6% in the second quarter. We enjoyed good growth in Food & Beverage and restaurants. Regionally, we enjoyed double-digit growth in Asia Pacific and solid growth in EMEA, Latin America and North America. We continue to drive market penetration with innovative service offerings and technology and are making progress in globalizing our market-focused capabilities and field technology. We expect Global Pest sales to show further good growth in the third quarter and second half, led by gains in all markets.","Equipment Care sales increased 9% in the second quarter. New account sales, better penetration, pricing actions and improved technician capacity and productivity drove strong service revenue growth. We expect Equipment Care to show further strong gains in the second -- in the third quarter as continued good service trends, pricing initiatives and streamlined operations benefit results.","Slide 6 of our presentation shows selected income statement items. Second quarter gross margins were 46.5%. When adjusted for acquisitions and special charges, second quarter 2014 fixed-currency gross margins were 46.6%, 60 basis points above last year. Volume and pricing gains, as well as merger synergies and cost efficiencies, more than offset the business impact of higher energy sales, which, on average, have a lower gross margin when compared with our other businesses.","SG&A expenses represented 32.3% of second quarter sales. When adjusted for acquisitions, the fixed-currency SG&A ratio improved 70 basis points versus last year. The improvement reflected sales gains and cost-savings efforts, including merger synergies, as well as the mix of higher energy sales, which, on average, have a lower SG&A ratio when compared with our other businesses. Consolidated operating income margins were 14.4%. When adjusted for acquisitions and special charges, fixed-currency operating income margins were 14.3%, rising 140 basis points over last year's comparable margin.","Fixed-currency operating income for Global Industrial increased 8%. Acquisition-adjusted operating income grew 9%, with margins up 60 basis points. Volume gains, pricing and cost synergies and efficiencies led the gain. Fixed-currency operating income for Global Institutional increased 3%, benefiting from pricing, volume gains and cost efficiencies, which more than offset investments in the business. Fixed-currency Global Energy operating income increased 44%. Acquisition-adjusted Global Energy operating income increased 40% in fixed-currencies, and acquisition-adjusted margins expanded 340 basis points, led by synergies, the volume gain, operating leverage and pricing.","Fixed-currency operating income for the Other segment increased 7%. Acquisition-adjusted operating income grew 8%. Improved operating results offset investments in the business and higher costs. The Corporate segment and tax rate are discussed in the press release. As before, please note that our tax rate assumptions for the full year assume passage of the R&D tax credit in the fourth quarter.","We repurchased approximately 800,000 shares during the second quarter. The net of this performance is that Ecolab reported second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.02 compared with $0.69 reported a year ago. When adjusted for special gains and charges and discrete tax items in both years, adjusted earnings increased 20% to $1.03 when compared with $0.86 earned a year ago.","Turning to Slide 7 and looking at Ecolab's balance sheet. Net debt to total capital was 48%, with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 2.5x. Looking ahead and as outlined in Slide 8, we continue to take aggressive actions to drive both our top and bottom line. We're expanding our market share and customer penetration among major accounts and leveraging our positions in key growth markets in food, water, energy and health care as we work to offset continued mixed market conditions and unfavorable currency exchange rates, which will likely negatively impact sales by a percentage point in 2014.","We expect to show good acquisition-adjusted sales growth and margin expansion, driven by innovation, pricing, merger synergies and better operating efficiencies. We expect to deliver on these aggressive goals while building growth for the future. We expect adjusted third quarter 2014 diluted earnings per share to increase an outstanding 13% to 17% to the $1.18 to $1.22 range. Further, the third quarter will also compare against a very strong period last year when adjusted earnings per share rose 20% to $1.04. We continue to look for the full year 2014 to show very strong growth as adjusted earnings per share are expected to increase 17% to 19% to the $4.14 to $4.20 range.","In summary, we once again delivered on our forecast in the second quarter with a solid sales gain and continued margin improvement, while offsetting market challenges and investing for our future. We look for further solid acquisition-adjusted sales growth and continued double-digit profit gains in the third quarter, as well as for the full year 2014, as we work to deliver yet another strong year and build for our future.","And now here's Doug Baker with some comments.","Douglas M. Baker","Thank you, Mike. I'm going to offer just a couple points perspective on the business overall and thoughts on Q2. Business overall, I would say we're getting better. Our integrations remain on track. Our margins continue to expand. Our business top line is accelerating. We had a solid first half, and we expect an even better second half.","Regarding Q2, if you look at our sales, they grew at roughly 0.5 point faster rate than they did at Q1, when we strip out and look at pure organic results. When we look at individual components, we had Energy growing at 8%, which was what we expected in the second quarter. We are on track to accelerate that. The core business, if you exclude Europe, grew at a 5% rate. And Europe was roughly flat, but here I'm taking out Energy. So total, we had a 5% organic rate when we take out acquisitions and divestitures. Every one of these components we expect to accelerate in the second half, energy moving from 8% to 10% to 12%; the core business, excluding Europe, moving from the 5% to 6-plus percent; and Europe flat moving to 2% or even maybe a little better. In total, this will move our, overall, if you will, acquisition-adjusted sales from 5% to 6-plus percent in the second half.","Now there are a number of drivers of this acceleration. The #1 is new business. We had another great quarter of net new business adds. This means back-to-back record new business quarters. For the first half, our net new business results were 30% ahead of last year's first half. So we are fully back on stride now regarding new business post-integration.","Our innovation continues to fire well. CIP, 3D TRASAR, Solids for water, Apex in Europe, antimicrobials in Energy, et cetera, all are meeting or exceeding our expectations. M&A is picking up, both bolt-ons and also technology plays, and we are looking to make some things happen here in the second half. And finally, the market in total should be roughly the same, meaning global GDP second half, we don't expect to be materially different than the first half even though there's a lot of volatility in the world, as we all know about. But in total, we would expect the market to be either a headwind or a tailwind. So the fruits of our labor should show up, as we expect, in better results in the second half.","So net, we like where we're positioned. We see a stronger second half, accelerating sales, as I said, mid- to upper-teens EPS delivery. We see another great full year delivery of 17% to 19% EPS. And probably most importantly, we like how we're positioned for the out years too. We've got a great business. We've got a lot of opportunity. We have the right team, and we like our plan. We believe the combination will allow us to consistently deliver against our 15% annual EPS objective post synergies.","So with that, let me turn it back to Mike.","Michael J. Monahan","Thanks, Doug. That concludes our formal remarks.","Operator, would you please begin the question-and-answer period.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Mr. John McNulty from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So with regard to Europe, we've seen some other companies putting up some growth in Europe, and it seems like you didn't have really much to speak of on it this quarter. But you do expect things to kind of get better in the back half of the year. So I guess, can you walk us through what may have been an issue -- what some of the issues were around growth this quarter? And then, I guess, what gives you the confidence that it's going to get better in the back half of the year? Are you already starting to see those trends improving already?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Well, our Europe -- look, if we total our business in Europe, including Energy and all the other businesses, it was down 1% in the first quarter and up 2% in the second quarter. So we've seen some sequential improvement in our European business, and this is driven in large part by new businesses coming on, stabilization of the market and other efforts. And we expect Europe to get better in the third quarter and the fourth quarter still. So I think we're seeing some of the same trends that you're referring you might be seeing in other people's business. But our focus in Europe remains on profitable growth, cleaning up the business that we don't want to be in long term. So I would say we are also artificially covering some of the good work in Europe as we exit some businesses and do this really just on the P&L, not through any restructuring activity. So our Europe business, we think, is in good shape. We had another very strong margin performance against our goals, and so we are set up to at least deliver in the 100 to 150 basis points improvement for the year. You're going to be seeing run rates in the 7% margin -- EBIT margin basis by year-end, which is good, big improvement.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. No, great. And then just as a follow-up, one area that we haven't seen much improvement in from the rest of the world and yet, you seem to be exhibiting some really solid strength is in the Lat Am side. So maybe if you can flush out kind of what's driving that and maybe where you're seeing it and some of the trends that you're seeing down there, would be great.","Douglas M. Baker","Sure, yes. Latin America is a fairly strong story. So we're seeing it in our core Food & Beverage, Institutional businesses. We're seeing it in Water, where we've had, I think, strengthening of the management team down there through some internal promotions on the Water team. Energy remains strong as well. So it's pretty much across the board. And also, we've got strength in Brazil, which I think is relatively unusual versus some of the other reports that we've seen. So the team down there continues to execute. We also continue to make sure that we are doing the right thing around margin, simultaneous to top line growth, and we've seen improvement there as well.","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Doug, just on new business, very impressive first half results. In what businesses or areas is it really focused on, this 30% year-over-year improvement?","Douglas M. Baker","It usually differs by quarter because, as you know, we go after large -- large pieces of business and they are a bit lumpy. I mean, in the first quarter, as we talked about, we had a lot of terrific success in both Institutional and F&B in particular. Water is pretty steady in both quarters, first and second. And Energy had a blowout second quarter, which we had anticipated and expected, which was one of the reasons that we've been forecasting a much stronger second half. And so I think the events that we believe were going to come through in the second quarter, leading into the second half, have come true, which is why we continue to forecast Energy, in particular, up in the 10% to 12% range for the second half. But all the businesses are going to benefit from the work that happened in the first half.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And Doug, just on Energy, as it picks up to double-digit growth back half of the year, what happens to the margins? How much do they improve from Q2 levels?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, they continue to improve in the second half simply because it's the bigger-volume half for Energy. So you've got volume driving some of it, but we believe the margin improvement that we're seeing is sustainable, and we have still synergies yet to be realized in that business. So we'll continue to work and drive margins as we go forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. Nate Brochmann from William Blair & Company.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Doug, I wanted to talk -- just to follow up on that, just a little more specifically. I mean, granted I know things kind of were a little bit light of some of -- where you wanted to be in terms of the core growth in the first quarter. Could you talk a little more specifically what you've done in terms of either execution or with the sales force in terms of spurring those new business wins? And I know it's about the Ecolab playbook in terms of great new innovation and new products, but how you've you been able to accelerate that in terms of the outlook to get to that 5% to 6% for the second half of the year.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Well, Nate, I would say, from the new business perspective, it's continued efforts, but we have expanded our corporate account team over the last couple of years, particularly in the WPS business but also in other businesses. We've strengthened -- we believe, further strengthened the leadership in our regional positions around the world in, say, Institutional and others. And we have clearly identified and targeted the largest players in the industries and put together specific plans to go after them. All this is helping contribute to very strong results. I would also say we didn't make a lot of noise. We continued to deliver quite well through the heavy integration periods. And while I can't go and point to exactly how that took a toll on any one thing, I don't think it took enough of a toll to make it onto a call. But certainly, the integration work lessened. We know we will have even more energy going towards offense, which, long term, is a key to driving value.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","That makes sense. I appreciate that. And then also, too, just thinking a little bit bigger picture and who knows where some of these rumblings ever go, but if there ends up getting to be broader across-the-board minimum wage hikes in some of your end market businesses, how do you think that impacts your business in terms of some of your customers' desires to automate things and reduce costs in terms of that maybe being a net benefit for you?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, one of the obvious impacts would certainly be in the Institutional U.S. business, which continues to perform well. It grew 5% in second quarter, both the field sales and actual shipped basis. I would say if you look across the Institutional business, and I'm going to throw KAY in here and QSR as well, certainly, increased labor costs are going to be -- are going to have to be offset somewhere. And so in many cases, you can see our customers looking at how they would further mechanize either the kitchen operation or the front part of their operation, and they are working on those technologies. Now we've got a number of technologies that fit in with that thinking. Obviously, warewashing in QSR would be an obvious one. We would expect that, that will continue to have great uptake. That increases our sales in those restaurants, but is also a great deal financially for the restaurants to install and take the plunge from a capital or a lease standpoint. So those would be some of the examples, but this is going to be further and wider reaching than that. And typically, whenever there is cost pressure on the business, our philosophy, if you will, comes to bear and tends to prove quite valuable. So we like what we do, so our lower energy, lower water and in many cases, lower labor promise is the right promise in the eventuality that these rates get raised.","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","A question on the margins in the Institutional segment and just looking at year-over-year flattish margins. Is that a function of incremental leverage in the emerging economies from better volumes offsetting decremental margins from lower sales in Europe? Or is there more to that story?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Mostly I would just say it's timing. It's -- we have -- we've had some growth investments that we made in that business. A lot of them came disproportionately in the second quarter. So it had sort of a neutralizing effect on any volume lift. So margins were flat. We expect margins to be up for the year and up for the balance of the year.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then for business outside the U.S. and Europe, there's a few headwinds that I'd be interested in some additional color on, such as the slate of sanctions on Russian businesses potentially affecting Energy, the difficulty doing business in Venezuela, the Argentine default. Maybe each one geography not huge in terms of revenues but kind of when you add it together.","Douglas M. Baker","There's probably a longer list, right? You want to go to the Middle East? Yes, I would say I don't think Venezuela's any particularly new news. I mean, it's been a challenging situation for quite a while now. It's a situation we've been managing, and we think we'll continue to manage. I mean, I -- we forecast in the Q, like other people, we expect another devaluation. We go through those, and the team there has been very adept at then getting behind that and raising local prices in the bolivar. So that, we'll continue to manage. I would say Argentina is more similar to that than dissimilar. And we'll have to continue to manage our business there, and I think we're quick to do it. Russia's a harder one to predict. I don't know who can predict what's going to happen there. We certainly don't believe we can predict. So I think we've done all the smart things there. Our Russian business, for perspective, is probably at a run rate of around $200 million. So it's not a huge business in terms of impact globally, given our $14 billion-plus size, but it's an important market for us. And we've taken, I think, a lot of the smart steps to put us in a position to manage further sanctions and other things. And of course, we're going to comply with all laws and anything that may or may not happen as we go forward, but it's very tough to predict what that may -- might be. From an energy standpoint, it's not a huge piece of their business, but it's an important piece. And I think we'll just -- we're just ready to manage as wisely as we can given what unfolds there, and predicting what unfolds is quite difficult.","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is the third straight quarter you've talked about very strong new business signings, and yet, we haven't seen real acceleration. I know you're expecting it, but what -- how do we think about the lag from new business sign -- when you sign new business and talk to us about it and when it begins to generate revenue? And is it very different from segment to segment? Or is it a similar lag?","Douglas M. Baker","What we see, on average, it usually takes a couple of quarters to show up because -- so Institutional, we talked last quarter about a number of new pieces of business in Europe specifically. And a lot of that business was installed in the second quarter, but they still have to run out their old inventory. And you really don't see a lot of the activity until, really, even the quarter following install. So this is, I don't think, any great surprise. If we're -- I'll be surprised if we're not seeing some pickup from this in the third quarter, and we would expect to. We think we're already seeing it. So we would expect third quarter to be better than the second.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the follow-up. Both in the Institutional and Other Services businesses, you mentioned investments that offset the normal leverage and cost savings. What exactly are those investments? Is it salespeople? Or is it other stuff? And how quickly do you expect to earn a return on the investments?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. It's a little different by business, but headcount, both Institutional and also in Pest. Training in Pest, in particular, is we're arming the team to be even more specialized when they get after specific segments, and this is a lot of the work that's been helping drive Pest organic sales growth faster. And also, there have been some R&D investments that we've made. And I would just say it's more -- coincidental may not be the best word, but the timing is just the timing. We didn't try to manage it to make each quarter look beautiful. It's just the right time to get after some of these initiatives, and they'll be helpful in the second half.","Operator","The next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Just wanted to ask a couple of questions and clarification. When you look at your Energy segment and the business, sort of the -- was the legacy Nalco business versus the Champion business that you're looking to globalize perhaps a little bit more aggressively, was there a difference in the growth rates, if you can discern at all, between those 2 businesses? Or is it more appropriate to talk about upstream, downstream growth rates?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I mean, there were some differences in the growth rates. You might recall, Champion had a huge second quarter last year, right as we were putting it together. So one of the challenges is Energy is going against a very big base number in the second quarter and still accelerate it versus the first. So Champion, that business is all upstream. We didn't take any of the downstream business, as you might recall. There are differences historically and we would expect, going forward, in terms of expected downstream growth rate versus upstream growth rate. Downstream has been much more in the upper-single-digit type growth rate, and we expect double digit from the upstream businesses, including WellChem.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then as a follow-up, on the Pest Elimination growth, was there much of a difference between sort of if you look at the domestic Pest Elimination, which is an older, I guess, more seasoned business, if you will, and the international Pest Elimination business, where there's still quite a bit of whitespace filling left to do?","Douglas M. Baker","No, it's very similar. I mean, the U.S. growth rate was very similar to the global growth rate, 6%. So we've got -- that business has been steadily improving as we talked about. We had it in the shop not that long ago. It's come out and doing well.","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. Edward Yang from Oppenheimer.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","CapEx picked up sequentially, and it was up 30% year-over-year. Was there anything to read into this? I think, Doug, you mentioned that you had made some heavier investments in the second quarter than in the past.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I would chalk it up to timing. I mean, our CapEx forecast that we've given before and expected use of capital remains the same.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I think you launched Apex2 in North America and Europe at the start of the second quarter. What's the update in terms of adoption and contribution to growth?","Douglas M. Baker","Apex has launched in Europe -- Apex2, and I would say it's exceeding targets. It's off to a very strong start, nearly 3,000 installs to date. We expected in total opportunity in the $60 million [ph] to $70 million [ph] range for Europe, and majority of that, but not all of that, would be incremental. So it's early. It's going well, and we expect it to continue to go well. So it's doing what we expect it to.","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. David Ridley-Lane from Merrill Lynch.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure. I wanted to get an update on the run rate of cross-sell synergies in the second quarter and how Ecolab is tracking to the $150 million run rate target for the full year 2014.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. We're on pace. We'll look up a second quarter number if we have it. But I would say all the growth synergies that we expect are on pace for the year. So I guess, second quarter, we're seeing -- it was $119 million is what we saw. But I think the big number was we had forecast. That's the run rate right now. That we forecast we'd get to $0.5 billion -- I mean, $500 million right by the end of '16. We're tracking a little ahead of our forecasted pace.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure, okay. And then it's been almost a year since we heard about the enterprise selling initiative Ecolab was piloting in F&B and Water. I just wanted to get an update on maybe how many teams you have selling, if there's integrated solutions at the highest level with clients. And any thoughts about expanding that into other segments?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. We have corporate account people in both the Water business and in the Food & Beverage and Institutional business. A given enterprise will have a lead business and a lead division who takes responsibility for driving the total Ecolab portfolio in that customer. So I would tell you, virtually, every large customer in the industries that we serve has \"a team lead\" whose job it is to drive the complete enterprise sale at that customer. So with that said, I would say, as I've talked about in previous calls, we've had great success -- more success early than I think we anticipated. We continue to have very good success, hence the terrific numbers I shared with you earlier. I don't have a specific number of discrete teams whose only job is to go sell, say, F&B and Water together. It's really the corporate account team members on both sides. Both divisions are working together to go drive that.","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. John Quealy from Canaccord Genuity.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","First question, in Institution, you talked about QSR being solid again in the small and mid account area. Can you talk about is that foot traffic and volume? Or are there other underlying trends there? Like, for example, I know a year or so ago, Starbucks did convention opens and things like that. So if you could just characterize that a little bit more.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. A lot of it, I would just say, is new business, and the new business that was brought on by our QSR business was principally the medium and smaller-sized chains. This is good news because they tend to grow into larger chains over time, and it's where you'll probably see disproportionate unit growth going forward. That was the single biggest driver, but we do see different chains adding food products, be it wings or other moves, which tend to change the cleaning needs in a given environment and then also then drives additional products in the unit simultaneously. But the biggest move was new business.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay, great. And then a broader one-off question. I know the DOT has suggested new regulations for oil transportation by rail specifically on some of the heavy stuff out of Canada. I know this is early, and I know this is comment periods and all this. Are you working with some of your heavy oil clients about different formulations of what that could look like? And give us any characterization there, that would be helpful.","Douglas M. Baker","I would say the transportation of oil via KEYSTONE pipeline, if you don't build the pipeline, you're going to end up having the stuff shipped on rails. And I think there's a realization that, that may not be the best alternative -- I mean, the best answer because it creates risk, too. So everybody wants to manage one risk, and they forget about the other risk that they got to deal with. I don't have any great -- I would tell you shipping heavy oil is a little safer than shipping light oil, if you want to get down to it. We work with our customers on any of these issues. I think it's too early to say exactly how this is going to go play out.","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Two questions around the acceleration that you're seeing across your business. Do you see this as a multiyear surge? Or do you need an end market recovery to maintain it? And secondly, given the acceleration that you're seeing, has the underlying growth algorithm in terms of how many salespeople you need to hire to maintain the growth, has that changed? Or should we see a step up in hiring practices over the next 12 to 18 months?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Well, let's start with the formula or the algorithm question first. I don't think it's changed. We have been hiring sales team members this first half and have a couple of hundred more than we did at the start of the year. So it's a couple percent more. But if you annualize it, it starts turning into 4%, if we continue on this pace. So we are investing in the business while growing margins and doing the other things that we're expected to do. I would say, look, we would benefit by an economic recovery. I don't think it's needed for us to get into the lower end of our 6% to 8% organic range that we've talked about nor is it needed to add the 2 to 3 extra points from M&A. But for us to play around the top of that range, yes, I think you're going to ultimately need to see some uptick in the underlying economy. The way the economy's working right now, which is below 2 digits globally, I think we can get into the 6% -- about 6%, maybe up to 7%, but it can be very difficult to get to the 8%, 8%-plus range.","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. John Roberts from UBS.","Bill Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is Bill Carroll on for John. Can you remind us of your capital allocation priorities, particularly with respect to debt reduction? You mentioned a desire to get back to A credit rating. So what's your timing for getting the credit metrics there in light of using free cash flow for share buybacks and bolt-on acquisitions as well?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I would say our uses of cash have not changed materially, with the exception of the addition of some debt paydown. The debt paydown is about $300 million. It's proceeding. It's going to occur this year. Following that, we expect our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to be low-2s by the end of the year and hitting the 2 range sometime early next year. As we go forward, we continue to grow EBITDA. So following that, I think we've said that things that are on the table, like additional share repurchase and\/or more aggressive M&A, they tend to complement each other. They will end up to be, I would say, a bigger EPS driver than they have been the last couple of years. And of course, I'm excluding the big deals that we did with Nalco and Champion in that conversation.","Bill Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And another one on Water. What are your capabilities and appetite for pursuing opportunities in areas that you're not involved with now, like treating municipal water or agricultural processing?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I would say we do treat some municipal water systems today, had historically. We'll continue to serve that business as long as we can do it in a way that's reasonably profitable moving forward. It is not our target market by any stretch. I would say, look, there's a lot of places in Water that we see additional opportunity moving forward. Certainly, our Energy team is looking and getting after additional opportunities in their space using water technologies that are developed corporately. But we also see other opportunities, both in the pure water space and in the Institutional F&B and other spaces. We'll continue to expand our capabilities as we move forward. I would say that's our formula. We want to grow the business every year. We want to expand the margins. But just as importantly, we want to expand the opportunities every year so we never run into a wall and get into a situation where we are, if you will, at the end of a realistic share gain period. We chase over $100 billion today. We think we've got about a 13, 14 share, and we expect that $100 billion opportunity to grow as we look at new arenas. One of the areas we're going to be more aggressive in is going after desal, not inventing the technology but serving the installed desal units, be them -- be they the boil the ocean units or the membrane units. Either one we will get after, there are big service opportunities there. So there are plenty of opportunities in Water. Our Water business is performing well. Second quarter, if you take away the Paper business and the business that we are exiting, our Water grew at 7%. So it's showing continued sequential improvement as we said it would, and we're excited about the opportunities in front of us.","Operator","The next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Doug, looking back, these Nalco and Champion acquisitions were very timely. But your core Institutional business really hasn't picked up steam yet. Can you comment on what's holding it back? Is it more on the hospitality side? Or is it more on the restaurant side?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I would say it's more on the Europe side. I would say you've got to recognize we're now -- what we're reporting in Institutional isn't just U.S. business. We're reporting the global results for Institutional. If you went back pre-Nalco acquisition, because we hadn't globalized Institutional yet, we would have -- with or without the Nalco merger, by the way, but we were really reporting, principally, U.S. Institutional numbers. I said earlier, the U.S. Institutional number for this quarter was 5% growth. And we've had -- last quarter was 5% underlying growth, as this quarter was, but I think 3% reported. We said there was a bit of a take-down in terms of inventories. This quarter, both numbers were 5%, 5% consumption, 5% shipped. And so I think the Institutional business as it's historically been reported is very consistent with where it's been, and this is in spite of, I think, difficulties in that market. Restaurant traffic continues to be soft, in decline. Lodging has been strong throughout this period once it recovered from the recession. What we're really working on doing is getting the business right in the other geographies. And so really, the particular hole that we have is Europe. So Europe for that quarter was down, like, negative 4% in the second quarter, and it was a series of onetimers. Some of them we did purposefully. Some just happened to fall into this quarter. But we're quite confident that we are now going to see Europe grow in Institutional for the next couple of quarters. So I think Institutional is going to be fine. Some of this we just took on, went after the business. You know the priority in Europe hasn't been on growth, it's been getting on the margins right. Our Europe Institutional business now makes money. It didn't every quarter previously, and it is now consistently. And now we got to get the top line moving. And their efforts around new business, the new technology they're introducing, hence the earlier Apex question and answer, all are, I think, showing the right trends. So Institutional, we think, will be climbing back on a global basis in the 5-plus percent type growth business here relatively soon.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, secondly, post Champion, can you size for us the revenues and profitability in your upstream and downstream businesses in Energy?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I -- if you're asking on Champion per se, we can't -- we can no longer split out the Champion business from the legacy Nalco Energy business just by nature of the type of integration that we've gone under, which is why we even handled the restatement. We're trying to give you guys a picture of what's happening organically. I would say, overall, that business performed. So we would expect, going forward, we're going to continue to have very strong results in WellChem, which is a combined business of the 2, Nalco and Champion. We expect OFC to accelerate. It's going to be the big beneficiary of a number of the new businesses -- or the new business opportunities that we've secured in the second quarter. And downstream has been performing solidly, let's say, in the U.S. and around the world, and we would expect that to continue to grow solidly. But really Champion brought both WellChem assets and OFC assets, 0 downstream assets.","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's Brian Maguire on for Bob today. Doug, I appreciate the comments on sources of the growth rate acceleration in the second quarter, too, that I was maybe surprised not to hear some weather normalization. I would have thought that maybe that helped. And also just curious to hear, given the strength in Latin America and Brazil you cited, any material benefit from the World Cup there. Or any potential hangover there?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I can't speak to the individual's hangover status. I can -- there wasn't a huge uptick in Brazil Institutional for World Cup. Interestingly, we rarely see one. You host the Olympics every other year. We tend to have a lot of that business or serve a lot of the partners who serve that business. We certainly are in most cities of the world. We typically don't see monstrous uptick in our business during those events, and we saw the same thing in Brazil. Simply because there's kind of a trade of influx of tourist dollars, somewhat. Those who live there tend to stay out of restaurants and others because think it turns into a bit of a hassle. So anyway, no big news there. I think the balance, I don't expect -- we don't really worry about that. These events happen all the time. So even if you did see a big lift -- these people are traveling from somewhere and they're spending their dollars in one city and not the other, we're in 170-plus countries, we tend not to focus on that stuff too much.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just on Energy. There have been some upstream project delays we've been kind of hearing about or tracking. Just any change in timeline on projects, any slippages there that you're seeing any impact from?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, we certainly had projects that were part of slip, but our forecast takes all that into account. And so the forecast that we've given for the second half is based on data that we know right now. So obviously, if something materially slipped in September, we may talk to you about it in the next call. But we don't anticipate that. All the projects we're on, we think we've got a good handle on.","Operator","The next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Could you just give us a little bit more detail on what's going on with Healthcare? It sounds like you guys are expecting maybe a modest pickup in the second half, but then being positioned to be a lot better in 2015. Given what we've seen over in the hospitals for the last many years, could you talk a little bit about the investments in innovation and what you're doing over there? And any thought as to what's going behind the expectation for the pickup there?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Last call, we talked Healthcare and basically said we're working on a couple of areas, certainly around innovation, how we're going to position our technology and how we're going to go sell bundled programs even more effectively going forward. I'd say that work is progressing nicely. But we didn't -- we basically tried to set an expectation that you're not going to see a material change in growth rates until probably early next year or end of this year. With that said, the business isn't off the hook nor do they consider themselves off the hook. They improved first quarter to second quarter. We had 3% growth this quarter. We aren't shooting off flares, but it's certainly better than first quarter. And I think the team's on the issues they need to be on. I like the work that they're doing. We have, I think, a good track record of taking businesses, and sometimes, you've got to retool. We aren't asking for any forgiveness on quarterly expectations or overall company growth rate or anything like that. We've just got -- Healthcare, we think we can make some tweaks to put this business in a position to grow high-single digits and do the things that we expect it to do going forward.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Just as a follow-up, based on what you're doing over there, you just mentioned high-single digits is a potential, what's a realistic -- do you think kind of near term, say, 2015 to '16 type of thought, you can get back to this mid-single digits on a regular basis sound realistic? Or what do you think about that?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Certainly, that would be our expectation, that we think the Healthcare business and particularly the part of the Healthcare business we're in should be a upper-single-digit growth business for us. So I guess, yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","I was just wondering, Doug, if you have seen recently a more competitive change, especially in Europe, where your main competitor is pushing price increases or so they say. Is that helping you? Are you seeing them take business or lose business because of that particular change in the way they are conducting business?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I would say we haven't seen a material change in the way any of our competitors are approaching the business, specifically in Europe, and I guess, specifically in Institutional was your reference. I'm not sure that we would always see that right away anyway. So I don't know exactly what they're doing. But if you're going to raise prices, you're going to do it with your existing customers, not necessarily with new ones. And so that wouldn't be as visible to us anyway.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","And are you able to raise prices in Europe as you are now focusing on growth? Or is growth actually not conducive to raising price?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, there's always a trade-off, but no, we are getting price in Europe. We're getting price, frankly, everywhere. I mean, not huge amounts. I would say, the traditional, on average, 1 point across the globe, which is I think what we had forecast we expected, and that's about where we are. I would also say that, that never includes the mix changes. So when we talked the Apex launch in Europe, when we trade out old solids for new solids, we do it at a much higher price, and that is not reflected in the 1 point of pricing I spoke about, which was the global number.","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. Andy Wittmann from Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Doug, just your comments on M&A and bolt-on M&A kind of heating up, that's there's more going on there. What should investors be looking for in terms of where you think that -- in terms of total dollar deployment towards M&A could be maybe in the next year? You said it was going to be higher. I mean, is this hundreds of millions? Is it billions? What kind of order of magnitude do you think we could be looking at here?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Well, I guess, I signaled that there's no really huge targets on the horizon for us simply because it's not really as much an appetite challenge as it is just, frankly, a good fit challenge. So as a result, you're talking hundreds of millions, not billions.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got you. And then just a quick follow-up here. This quarter, for the first time in a long time, we've seen GAAP EPS and adjusted EPS starting to converge a little bit more than we've seen. Is this a pattern that you think we can continue to expect going forward? Or do you think that the restructuring charges and other things are going to continue to -- is this more of an anomaly or something that we should expect to go forward?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I mean, it's both. I would say you'll see continued convergence. I don't think -- the $0.01 delta that we had this year of $1.02 and $1.03, part was because we had a legal settlement that was in our favor in there, too. So unless I can convince our GC to deliver that every quarter, which would be terrific, you should put that in your report, we don't expect that every quarter. So -- but I think you'll see, starting 2015 and on, yes, we expect really pretty much they're the same.","Operator","The final question comes from Mr. Mike Harrison from First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Doug, can you talk a little bit about how the Champion integration is going now that it's been in the fold for a little over a year? And I'm speaking specifically from a cultural standpoint, where Champion may have had a different approach to customer service as opposed to the Nalco approach. Have you had any key customer or personnel losses? And if so, how are you handling those?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Well, I would say, on balance and in total, I think the integration's going about as well as you could hope for. So I'd give you stats. I guess field level attrition is lower than it was premerger, so that's good news. Have we lost anybody? Certainly, but that's because this is a hot business, and both companies were losing people before the merger, and they've lost some people post merger. And guess what? We've taken some people, too. So that's -- I don't think there's any big news there. Customers, we haven't lost any customer that we can really identify. As a consequence of this, we had some -- a couple customers that I would say we had on our concern list, particularly going into due diligence, and that business has all stayed. We've had a number of the large players who were buying from both increase their share with us post merger. So all of that, I think, has gone quite well. You mentioned earlier a different approach from service. I would say, as I think we did very successfully when we brought Ecolab and Nalco together, the goal here was to take good ideas wherever they come from and not be just convinced that however you were running it before was the best way. So some of the customer service methodology that we've adopted came with Champion. Particularly in some of the North American fields and how we get after and serve and deliver product was really, what I would say, is much more of a Champion model than it was the previous Nalco model because we think it was a smarter way to go into business. There are other examples, too. And as we've talked in the Nalco-Ecolab merger overall, there's been plenty of things that we've adopted, I would say, from legacy Nalco, safety programs, onboarding of people programs. And certainly, our financial modeling and I would say, discipline around business reviews we've adopted from Ecolab and thrown across all the businesses. So I think that's the only way you can really have a successful merger. If you buy a company, you're buying a lot of know-how. And if you wipe out all the know-how with the thought that whatever you were doing must be superior, you're going to lose value in -- by approaching it that way.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And then just in terms of the Asia Pacific market in Institutional, are we starting to see a pickup in places like China as those markets are getting a little bit more mature in terms of restaurants and hotels per capita? Or are you still pretty early on that curve?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I'd say yes and yes. We are seeing in China, in particular, continued strong growth in the Institutional business really across the portfolio, and I'd say it's very early days there. So you've got still fairly uneven situations. You can go to Shanghai, and it's one of the most sophisticated cities in the world. You don't have to travel far before it becomes, let's just say, less sophisticated. And as that economy -- as GDP grows, as people's incomes grow, we would expect that we would see the same evolution in foodservice, lodging, as we've seen in the other economies that have gone through the same growth curve. So we're quite excited about the long-term potential there, and we're seeing it in growth rates right now that are quite attractive.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Monahan for closing comments.","Michael J.

Welcome to the Ecolab First Quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. After the presentation we will conduct the question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Michael J. Monahan","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's first quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO. A copy of our earnings release and the accompanying slides referenced in this teleconference are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor.","Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on Slide 2, stating that this teleconference and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected.","Factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our first quarter earnings release and on Slide 2. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with an overview in Slide 3, we delivered strong results from the first quarter. We leveraged solid sales volume growth, pricing and our synergy and cost efficiency work to substantially improve our acquisition adjusted operating margins and produce a very strong adjusted earnings per share increase.","Looking ahead, we expect to continue to outperform our market and show outstanding 16% to 21% earnings gains in the second quarter. And strong upper teens EPS growth for the full year as good sales growth, appropriate pricing, innovation, synergies and margin leverage more than offset mixed markets.","Moving to some highlights from the first quarter and as discussed in our press release, reported first quarter earnings per share were $0.62, on an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items for both years, first quarter 2014 earnings per share increased a very strong 23% to a record $0.74. The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by volume and pricing, new products, account gains, synergies, cost savings actions and the Champion acquisition.","We enjoyed strong growth in our Specialty, Food & Beverage and Energy businesses. Latin America led the regional growth once again and was bolstered by strong gains in Asia Pacific and good growth in North America. These and other increases were leveraged by good margin expansion. We continue to be aggressive, focusing on top line growth. We are emphasizing our innovative product and service strengths, as well as our wide range of effective solutions to help customers get better results and lower operating costs. And through these drive new account gains across all of our customer segments.","We also continue to implement appropriate price increases to help offset higher costs and investments in our business. We remain focused on expanding our margins, emphasizing productivity and efficiency improvements to help increased profitability as well as drive merger synergies. We also continue to make investments in key growth businesses to sustain our technology in sales and service leadership.","We remain on plan for achieving our Nalco and Champion synergy targets. And our Europe margins are on track for further strong expansions.","Looking ahead, while mixed trends in our markets present ongoing challenges, we look for the second quarter to show continued attractive sales gains and margin improvements. Second quarter adjusted EPS is expected to increase an outstanding 16% to 21% to a $1, $1.04 range and compare with last year\u2019s adjusted EPS of $0.86. Business growth and the benefits from synergies and cost reductions should more than offset lackluster economic trends.","In addition, the quarter will compare against a strong 19% adjusted EPS gain in last year\u2019s second quarter. For the full year 2014, we continue to look for a very strong 16% to 19% increase to the $4.10 to $4.20 range.","In summary, our first quarter performed very well and we expect the second quarter and full year 2014 to also show very strong earnings growth as we more than offset challenging economic condition, while we make the key investments to drive superior results this year as well as for the future.","Slide 4 shows our first quarter results both as reported and with adjustments for special gains and charges, while Slide 5 shows our sales growth detail. Please note as detailed in the press release, to be effective in this quarter we made immaterial changes to our reportable segments. They had no impact on our consolidated sales or operating income. The impact of these changes on 2012 and 2013 results are shown in the appendix slides and the following comments regarding both our 2013 and 2014 first quarter results include these changes.","Ecolab's consolidated fixed currency sales for the first quarter increased 18%. Acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales rose 5%. Looking at the growth components, volume and mix increased 4%, pricing rose 1%, acquisitions and divestitures were 14% and currency was a negative 2%.","Reported fixed currency sales for the Global Industrial segment rose 3%. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the segment was not significant. First quarter reported fixed currency Global Food & Beverage sales increased 5%. Acquisition-adjusted first quarter fixed currency sales grew 4%. Growth was led by beverage and brewing, dairy and agri, which more than offset modestly lower sales in the weak protein market. Regionally, we enjoyed strong results in Latin America and Asia-Pacific with moderate growth led by share gains in the other regions.","Food & Beverage continues to benefit from its total plant assurance approach to customers in which we combine our industry-leading Cleaning & Sanitizing, water treatment and pest elimination capabilities to deliver improved food safety results, lower operating costs and better product quality assurance for customers. This has enabled us to win business with key global customers and offset sluggish conditions in several of our regional markets.","Looking ahead, we expect further good organic sales growth in the second quarter as we develop further benefits from growth synergies, better customer penetration and new business capture as well as leverage our innovation pipeline, including the introduction of 3D TRASAR for clean-in-place systems and Food & Beverage plans in the second half.","Fixed currency Water sales increased 4%. Gains were led by good growth in the heavy, light and mining businesses. Regionally, we saw a strong growth in Latin America, good gains in Asia Pacific, modest increases in North America and flat EMEA results.","We continue to drive market penetration with innovative solutions to optimize water usage using our powerful 3D TRASAR technologies. We are introducing 3D TRASAR for hotel and other institutional cooling systems in the second quarter utilizing salt chemistry in advanced dispensing, varying a leading technology from both Ecolab and Nalco in a premium customer solution.","We are focused on building our corporate account and enterprise sales team delivering our growth synergies and improving product innovation to drive revenues. We expect to show another good gain in the second quarter as better growth in our heavy, light and mining businesses outperform mixed end-markets.","Fixed currency sales for Paper increased 3%. Acquisition adjusted first quarter fixed currency sales were up 1%. We saw a double-digit growth in Latin America, modest growth in Asia Pacific and declines in EMEA and North America, resulting from continued low plant utilization and customer closures. We expect Paper to show modest sales growth in the second quarter as new business and technology penetration offset the challenging paper market conditions.","Fixed currency sales for the Global Institutional segment rose 3%. Turning to the businesses that makeup the segment, fixed currency sales for the Institutional business grew 3% in the first quarter. Institutional's end markets remain subdued with modest growth in global lodging room demand and still challenging foodservice foot traffic across North America and Europe.","Looking at regional sales trends, Latin America continued to post strong sales growth. North America showed good gains while Asia Pacific saw a moderate growth and Europe sales were up slightly. Sales initiatives targeting new accounts and effective product and service programs around our core segments continue to lead our results.","We leveraged our global technology through the rollout of our next-generation warewashing platform Apex2 in Europe. To drive growth in the future and improve on our industry leadership position, we remain focused on executing global sales initiative, globalizing core competencies and introducing product innovations that delivers increased value with solutions that reduce water, energy and labor costs while also increasing our customer intimacy through outstanding sales and service execution.","We\u2019re also making further investments in field technology to enhance execution in sales and service and we have better aligned our local sales team efforts around our global value proposition. Longer-term, our new global institutional structure is helping to accelerate global deployments of our innovation, technology and training, which we expect will help improve growth by driving better market penetration and new account gains.","We look for second quarter institutional business sales to improve as global sales initiatives progress and continued aggressive efforts to outperform challenging markets yield better growth in the second quarter and over the balance of the year.","First quarter sales for specialty grew 9% in fixed currencies. Quick service sales were strong increasing double-digits as we enjoyed steady growth from both large and small customers. New accounts along with increased service coverage and additional solutions for customers that drive their operating efficiency and food safety, leveraged generally modest industry trends.","Regionally, the U.S. and Latin America recorded solid gains. Europe saw good growth from new accounts and additional customer solutions while Asia Pacific benefited from good quick service foot traffic growth.","The food retail business increased modestly in the first quarter benefitting from customer additions, new products and increased penetration. We look for a good sales growth again in the second quarter and especially works to deliver another solid performance in 2014.","Fixed currency healthcare sales decreased 1%, new account growth, better penetration and new product introductions were more than offset by continued weak surgical and in-patient hospital trends and uncertainty in hospital buying decisions in the U.S. healthcare market.","Regionally, North America sales declined while Europe sales rose moderately. To grow sales in this challenging environment, we have increased our focus on corporate accounts and our integrated value proposition and continue to strategically broaden our product lines, rolling out new hand care products, new infection barriers and surface disinfectants.","We expect healthcare sales to increase in the second quarter as account gains and new product launches in both North America and Europe more than offset a continued weak healthcare market.","Reported fixed currency Energy segment sales grew 78%. Acquisition adjusted global energy fixed currency sales rose 8%. Our upstream production business saw a good growth in the first quarter led by strong international performance and deepwater results.","Downstream business sales were good as North America refining improved and we gain market share. Looking ahead we expect acquisition adjusted Energy segment sales to show similar growth in the second quarter. We look for stronger second half and new business drives better growth and delivers full year 2014 acquisition adjusted sales growth in the 10% range.","Sales for other segment increased 4%. Fixed currency Pest sales increased 3% in the first quarter. We enjoyed good growth in food & beverage, healthcare and restaurants.","Regionally, we enjoyed double-digit growth in Asia Pacific and good gains in both North America and Latin America. However, Europe sales declined reflecting the timing of service calls that should be made up in the second quarter. We continue to drive market penetration with innovative service offerings and technologies including the global protect programs, Bed Bug Assurance, STEALTH Fly Station, STEALTH Fusion and expanding solution offerings. We expect Pest sales to show better growth in the second quarter led by gains in all markets.","Equipment Care sales grew 8% in the first quarter. New account sales, better penetration, pricing actions and improved technician capacity and productivity drove strong service revenue growth. Parts sales were off slightly. We continue to see good results for both chain account and headquarter relationships, as well as by our work to drive sales through their regional and franchise organizations. We expect Equipment Care to show further strong gains in the second quarter as continued good service trends, pricing initiatives, improved parts sales and streamlined operations benefit results.","Slide 6 of our presentation shows selected income statement items. First quarter gross margins were 45.5%, when adjusted for acquisitions and special charges, first quarter 2014 gross margins were 45.8%, 50 basis points above last year. Volume and pricing gains, as well as merger synergies and cost efficiencies more than offset the business impact of higher energy sales, which on average, have a lower gross margin when compared with our other businesses.","SG&A expenses represented 34.1% of our first quarter sales. When adjusted for acquisitions, the SG&A ratio improved 70 basis points versus last year. The improvement reflected sales gains and cost-savings efforts, including merger synergies, as well as the mix of higher energy sales, which on average, have lower SG&A ratio when compared with our other businesses.","Consolidated operating income margins were 10.5%. When adjusted for acquisitions and special charges, fixed currency operating income margins were 11.6%, rising 120 basis points over last year\u2019s comparable margins.","Fixed currency operating income for global industrial increased 7%, with margins up 40 basis points. Volume gains, pricing, and cost synergies and efficiencies led the gain. Fixed currency operating income for Global Institutional increased 7% with margins up 60 basis points. Pricing, volume gains and cost efficiencies drove the increase.","Reported Global Energy fixed currency operating income increased 83%. Acquisition adjusted Global Energy operating income increased 36% in fixed currencies and acquisition adjusted margins expanded 270 basis points, led by the volume gain synergies, operating leverage and pricing.","Fixed currency operating income for the other segment increased 2%. Improved operating results were offset by investments in the field sales force and field technologies. The adjusted tax rate was 27.9% in the first quarter 2014, when compared with 28.2% in the same period last year. This improved tax rate was the result of favorable geographic income mix, which more than offset the cost of the expired U.S. Research & Development tax credit. Please note our tax rate assumptions for the full year assume passage of the R&D tax credit in the fourth quarter.","We repurchased approximately 2 million shares during the quarter. The net of this performance is that Ecolab reported first quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.62 compared with $0.53 reported a year ago. When adjusted for special gains and charges and discrete tax items in both years, adjusted earnings increased 23% to $0.74 when compared with $0.60 earned a year ago.","Turning to Slide 7 and looking at Ecolab\u2019s balance sheet. Net debt to total capital was 49%.","Looking ahead and as outlined in Slide 8, we continue to take aggressive actions to drive both our top and bottom lines. We are expanding our market share and customer penetration among major accounts and leveraging our positions in key growth markets in food, water, energy and healthcare as we work to offset continued challenging market conditions and unfavorable currency exchange rates, which could negatively impact sales by a percentage point or two in 2014.","We expect to show good acquisition-adjusted sales growth and margin expansion driven by innovation, pricing, merger synergies and better operating efficiencies. We expect to deliver on these aggressive goals while building growth for our future.","We expect adjusted second quarter 2014 diluted earnings per share to increase an outstanding 16% to 21% to the $1.00 to $1.04 range. Further, the second quarter will also compare against a very strong period last year when adjusted earnings per share rose 19% to $0.86.","We continue to look for full year 2014 to show very strong growth as adjusted earnings per share are expected to increase 16% to 19% to the $4.10 to $4.20 range. We once again delivered on our forecast in the first quarter with a solid sales gain and continued margin improvement while offsetting market challenges and investing in our future. We look for further solid acquisition-adjusted sales growth and continued double-digit profit gains in the second quarter, as well as for the full year 2014 as we work to deliver yet another strong year and build for our future.","A final note before we start Q&A. We plan to hold our annual tour of our booth at the National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago on May 19. If you have any questions, please contact my office.","That concludes our formal remarks. Operator, please begin the question-and-answer period.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now being the question-and-answer portion. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Nate Brochmann from William Blair & Company. Your line is now open.","Nate Brochmann \u2013 William Blair & Company L.L.C.","","Good afternoon, everyone. I was wondering \u2013 I know you hit on it briefly and I know that end markets are pretty mixed across the board, but I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more of a regional update in terms of some specifics, in terms of what you are seeing, in terms of traffic or improvement in Europe, North America and it was nice for you guys to mention too Asia picking up a little bit? Just wondering if you could tell us a little bit more in terms of what you are seeing there and where the trends are.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","","Yes, Nate, this is Doug. I guess you are referring to restaurant traffic?","Nate Brochmann \u2013 William Blair & Company L.L.C.","For the most part, yes.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","I would say, our business \u2013 traffic still is somewhat impaired in the U.S. Our business, if you look at underlying business in the U.S. Institutional field sales is in the 5% range, which is pretty consistent with how it's been running last few quarters. We continue to do a very good job driving new business.","If you look at Europe, it\u2019s, I would say, marginally improving across the board. Our business is starting to improve and I would say importantly, we had a very sizable new business activity or success in Europe in Institutional, in particular in the first quarter, that\u2019s been the longest we\u2019ve been tracking it to be honest. So it was a very sizeable portfolio series of wins.","Asia is getting better. Latin America continues to be very solid and strong. So I would say the economy this year is predicted to improve. We still feel that\u2019s true. I think the first quarter was a little tough to read particularly in the U.S. because of the weather.","Nate Brochmann \u2013 William Blair & Company L.L.C.","","Okay. Then just a follow-up on that in terms of the improvement over in Europe. Is part of that now your ability to be able to focus a little bit more on the top line and growth as we have some of the transformational projects kind of behind us or do you think that is just the overall economic improvement coming off the bottom?","","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","No, I mean it\u2019s \u2013 while I think there is some bottoming that's occurred in Europe no doubt but new business is a consequence of us shifting focus, if you will towards external top line activities which is what we focus on most of the time. And so we\u2019ve had very good results there, very good start and so we look forward to getting that show through the P&L.","Nate Brochmann \u2013 William Blair & Company L.L.C.","","That\u2019s great. Thank you very much.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","Okay.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital. Your line is now open.","Gary E. Bisbee \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","","Coming out of the fourth quarter fall, all of the commentary was very positive about new business wins and pipeline and all of that type of stuff and then we saw the growth rates slow quite a bit in the industrial and institutional businesses. Can you do two things? Number one, quantify weather impact if that is possible? And number two, just give us some more color on you talked about account wins here in Europe being good and you talked about it in the back half of last year overall. But when do we start seeing that flow through into better revenue growth? Thank you.","","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","","I\u2019d say two things Gary. So weather, we didn\u2019t mention it in the release. It\u2019s hard to quantify our internal numbers suggest that was nearly a point of growth. I\u2019d also say I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019ve ever said in any release that great weather drove our results. So we\u2019re a little reticent to say bad weather got in the way. Whatever the weather was we were able to, I think comfortably deliver our EPS. How do you feel about \u2013 here is how I feel about top line? I think we\u2019ve got underlying very good momentum across the board. You\u2019ve got a number of things that may hide the fact.","First, if you look at Energy, Energy activity, new business activity picked up particularly in the fourth quarter moving to first quarter. That takes several months at minimum to start showing up which is why as Mike mentioned in his formal remarks at front reflect confidence, that Energy well it\u2019s going to run at high single-digits in the first half, is going to run double-digits in the second half, and our math suggests right now end the year at double-digits.","Energy is going against at a pretty big base particularly in Champion and in the first quarter and even the second quarter, quite as we are taking off within to own it the first quarter. So we are seeing some of that comparison, when we give you the acquisition adjusted numbers that you are looking for.","So we feel confident. Energy is on track doing what it needs to do and will be in a range of what we\u2019ve always talked about which is for the double-digit business. The other businesses, the institutional businesses, the industrial businesses are all forecasting across the board, stronger growth as we go through the year. And if you look at underneath all of these, they are strengthening. We had a record first quarter new business. The quarter was plus 20% versus the prior two quarters in terms of net new business sold. So it was a quite dramatic increase in terms of productivity from new business and we know that translates into sales. So for the year we feel pretty confident that we will be accelerating, picking up and hanging in the 6% to 8% organic growth rate that we talk about in total.","Gary E. Bisbee \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from John McNulty of Suisse. Your line is now open.","John P. McNulty \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So, it sounds like you\u2019re looking have a relatively large launch on 3D TRASAR side in an F&B and some other parts of the business that haven\u2019t seen it before. I guess, how should we be thinking about what that may do to the growth, looking out over the next year or two?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","We\u2019ve been in test for a while, we\u2019re now rolling. Industrial launches always take a bit longer, i.e. to get to the peak average sales that we look for. I would say our early results, particularly in the industrial area has been very, very strong. And so, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have any challenge meeting our internal targets for 3D TRASAR, particularly in CIP, which is what we\u2019re doing in Food & Beverage.","In terms of solids, solid CIP 3D TRASAR is our targeted lodging effort. It\u2019s going to be lodging and hospitals. There we\u2019re also having a lot of success that\u2019s just rolling out. We see incremental sales in the $70 million range from that, but that should take several years to generate as well, but I would say, all those things will continue to drive our vitality index and gross margin expansion.","John P. McNulty \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then just one last question. It sounds like LATAM was an area of relative strength for you, which is I guess hearing some of your peers throughout the quarter, that wasn\u2019t necessarily the case for everyone in the industry. So I guess I'm wondering what's driving that. What specific areas in the Industrial segment are you really seeing that strength?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","Well, we had strength across the board. We were strong in F&B. We were strong in Water, we were strong in Energy and Institutional had a good quarter too. So I would just say our positioning of clean water, food, energy and healthy environment plays well in Latin America. It plays well frankly in all the emerging markets. So we saw very strong growth across the board in our emerging markets, not just Latin America. China was double digits. EMEA is going to start showing underlying strength as well as we get moving. We\u2019re starting to do, I think, the right things in Eastern Europe and that will get moving in the direction as well. So, I think it\u2019s just right businesses and good execution.","John P. McNulty \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Ritzenthaler of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Mike Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co","","Yes. Good afternoon. So we\u2019ve heard that the rent prices on offshore rigs that they have been declining modestly month-over-month for the past few months. Can you describe how that influences your outlook seeing as it runs a little bit counter to that in the Energy segment and especially since Ecolab has a little bit higher customer intimacy on the offshore side of things?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","Yes, I mean if you\u2019re talking offshore Gulf, there\u2019s a bunch of new projects coming in, particularly midyear, second half, fourth quarter even. So we\u2019re relatively bullish on Gulf and what's going to happen there. We\u2019re not in the rig rental business.","Mike Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co","","Of course.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","","So I just look at it this way. I think the underlying trends that we\u2019ve spoken about for the last few years in Energy are still the prevailing trends and that is new oil replacing old oil, new oil commanding significantly more of our technology than old oil. Therefore, you\u2019ve just got natural inherent growth even at a relatively flat overall oil demand, which is not what we\u2019re actually seeing and you got gas on top. So, I think our trends and what we see in that industry still feel very strong.","Mike Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co","And then as a follow-up on beverage in particular, it seemed quite strong in 1Q as Mike had detailed in the prepared comments. Is there a way to delineate things like new products from other drivers like enterprise selling in markets like beverage? Is one a better contributor than another?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","I don\u2019t have that here. We can of course look at that. I\u2019d say two things. I mean we do have a bunch of new technology going to the beverage market, but we\u2019ve also had a lot of significant success with large players in that industry and we\u2019re gaining share. So it\u2019s a combination of both and obviously technology helps you drive share. So even if you separate out the numbers, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the complete story because technology begets new business and so it\u2019s all related.","Mike Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co","All right. Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Your line is now open.","John E. Roberts \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon. As you roll out 3D TRASAR into Food & Beverage, how is that going to play out? Is that going to free the field force to be more active prospecting new business or is it going to just lower cost initially in existing business? How are you going to utilize it?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","I think it just dramatically further improves our ability to be best-in-class with customers and this has got several impacts. One, it will give better usage rates, you are going to have equal to better efficacy. You are going to reduce water and energy usage considerably because you don\u2019t have to overshoot all the time and it also has a very tie in impact in terms of our ability to manage a water process at the back end of the operation.","So this is important data that they need to collect anyway. It is now automated. I wouldn\u2019t say that it dramatically changes our field sales productivity measures, but it does gives us a very important tool to go out and solidify new business and up sell existing accounts. That\u2019s really where we\u2019re going to focus on driving that.","John E. Roberts \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","And I just wanted to clarify how you are going to handle the US R&D tax credit. So it\u2019s not in your Q1 results or Q2 or Q3 expectations, but in the fourth quarter you expect to take a full-year catch up, which we\u2019re actively in the fourth quarter for the year?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","Yes. That\u2019s exactly how have we have it in the plan.","John E. Roberts \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Ridley Lane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","David Ridley-Lane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. Have you completed cycling through the deemphasized business in water or is that a drag in the first quarter and if so, when would you expect to completely cycle through that?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","We\u2019ll be through most of it by the end of this year, but you\u2019re going to see it even in Q3 and very small in Q4.","David Ridley-Lane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then was paper OIs for picking up despite the declines in North America and EMEA volumes?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","Yes, paper OI was up \u2013 volume for the exact number was single-digit. Paper was up \u2013 it was slightly up, but yes, it was up.","David Ridley-Lane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Let me squeeze one more in. Could you give some details around sort of the globalization of sales initiatives you have particularly in the institutional business. Thanks.","","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","Like talk about the initiatives, well yes, we have the right global product line and it makes sure that we can get new solid Apex across the globe. Right now we have not add the capability to manufacture around the world. We have developed what I\u2019ll call a much lower capital manufacturing process, which will enable expansion of that program i.e. with localize manufacturing in a much faster manners than it would have, if we had not figured it out how to do this.","Two, we are driving Global 360, which is the field technology tool that enables highly productivity, better service, better ability to capture information, which is an important way so to merchandize with particularly large enterprise account while what we are doing, what we see and what we can see suggest, they do to improve their operation which many times involve more of our technology and products and service.","The other is just how do you operate the sales and service team and taking some of our know-how and spreading it across the globe. So it\u2019s in all those dimensions. So it\u2019s certainly higher-end product lines, it is the field technology tools and what I would call the general management know-how that we are driving right now.","We work last year very aggressively on corporate account efforts in the like and you are starting to see that bear fruit.","David Ridley-Lane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Quealy from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.","John S. Quealy \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi good afternoon. By healthcare I know it\u2019s a relatively small and promising area, but can you give us an update in terms of your satisfaction with results, I\u2019m not necessarily talking about the quarter, but mid-term platform expansion opportunity including external M&A there?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","Yes, from an M&A front I would say, with the promising property has been increasing and that's not only in healthcare, but that's across the board, as we started I would say re-emphasizing bolt-on acquisitions, be it geographic expansion, newer share play or new technology. And certainly our healthcare lift has benefited too from getting back on the focus which is I think, it\u2019s a natural stage of where we are.","Come to healthcare, but we don\u2019t like the results that we are seeing, we understand many of the drivers. The business is working hard at how improve their ability to go drive new business impact. So fundamentally in the U.S. in many of the areas that we compete, we\u2019ve had same store sales equivalent challenges. This isn\u2019t unique to us. It\u2019s pretty much across the board in many parts of the healthcare industry.","We\u2019ve seen this in many environments before and we overcome it by selling through it, and right now our sales efforts aren\u2019t significant enough to overcome negative same-store sales. I mean it is about as simple as that.","So our business is sticky, we are keeping it. There is a lot of the metrics that we like, but we are really if you will, in the shop working on, how do we drive that forward and work on it. Now I will say that's a competency that we have in this company, we are good at this and we are quite confident, we\u2019ll get this move in the right direction and the healthcare teams are all over it, but it\u2019s not going to be an overnight success.","So we are not going to start seeing the sixth to eighth, high single-digit collectively for a number of quarters and so we\u2019ve got a so ramping-up sales, which we believe we\u2019ll start seeing, but we are not going to be where, we are comfortable for the several quarters.","John S. Quealy \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","","Okay, and then a quick follow-up on Global Energy in terms of the guidance in the back-half of the year, was some acceleration in growth. I would assume that\u2019s still more geared towards upstream and offshore than downstream relatively incremental benefits in the back-half of the year?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","Absolutely.","John S. Quealy \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","","Okay, great thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Your line is now open.","Eric B. Petrie \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Yes, Hi Doug, this is Eric Petrie in for P.J. Just a question in terms of your Global Energy margins, it looks like some of your segment adjustments led to a total of advice lower 13 margin as 13.4% from 14.2% first quarter it was at 13.1%. How do you see the trajectory of the margins going forward this year?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","","Yes, I think, the only change was happy corporate allocations I wouldn\u2019t, the underlying business margins in Energy has been improving steadily and its forecast improve fairly, significantly this year.","Eric B. Petrie \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Okay. And then could us also talk a little bit about your sales growth in Europe in Institutional, and if you\u2019re seeing in terms of operating margin improvement of your 100 basis points, is there any attrition of that what you now focusing on top line growth?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","","No our forecast in Europe for margin growth this year was 100 basis points plus and we see that as achievable obviously we\u2019ve had to execute the rest of the year. Our first quarter margins in Europe were up several hundred basis points, it was a very strong start, stronger than forecast initially in fact.","But these margins come in lumps at times, so it\u2019s not this moved 100 every quarter, so we don\u2019t expect it was north of 250, we didn\u2019t expect to see that every quarter. So it was a good start. We do not see the focus shift if you will externally impacting our ability to drive the 100 margin point. What we do see is, as we start seeing top line, solidifying and growing which is what we saw in the first quarter. Solidifying, we expect to start to see growth as we move throughout the year. You are going to see a lot more leverage on all of that margin we put in over the last two years.","Eric B. Petrie \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Okay, and then lastly if I could as you rollout 3D TRASAR into the light, industries and water can you just remind us your light, heavy, mining sales right now?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","","Yes, in terms of percentage of sales in each?","Eric B. Petrie \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Yes.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","","Yes, it\u2019s roughly, yes, just give us a second. Like 40% \u2013 yes, so light about 40%, heavy is about 25% and mining is 10% to 15%?","Eric B. Petrie \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Mike Harrison from First Analysis. Your line is now open.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation","","Yes, I think that adds up to 80 but close enough I guess.","","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","","Yes, we just got the same number?","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation","Was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Apex. If memory serves, you guys never really rolled out the Apex1 platform in Europe the way that you had initially expected. So can you talk a little bit about the Apex2 rollout and how meaningful that could be for the European institutional business?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","Yes. I know we do not do Apex1, we skipped right to Apex2 was in the process of being rolled out right now in Europe.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation","Right, but I mean in terms of how beneficial it could be, I mean this is sort of as you say, skipping a generation and really bringing a value creating platform to a set of customers that has been kind of behind the times. So how important is that to growing going forward?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","Well, as I mentioned earlier, we had a number of very large new customer wins in the first quarter in Europe institutional. And certainly, Apex is critical and at least two of those. So it\u2019s going to do a number of things, right it gives you a tool to go after entrenched business, because it is by far the most advanced technology in that industry. And so we know we have been handicapped for a while in Europe without the latest technology and without some of the tools, so we deployed another geographies.","So this is one of the ways that we are going to start turning around negative sales growth to positive sales growth. I think if we look at institutional, we were positive for the first quarter. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve been positive there in a long time, and we don\u2019t even have yet the benefit of the new businesses we sold, because that\u2019s really being rolled in Q2, as we speak right now.","So without getting into specifics, we need to get Europe as I\u2019ve always said, our expectation of Europe will not be in the six to eight. But we do believe it needs to start getting in the 2% to 3% to 4% range, and it\u2019s going to rollout technology getting their, the right field tools and driving the sales performance the way we drive it everywhere else, are they keys to doing that.","That\u2019s the agenda, we are on now. The P&L is much more rights than wrong, at this point in time in terms of balance of investments and cost structure. So that the good work that the new business will actually accrue the profit. At this point in time, given the structure of the business and so that\u2019s what we\u2019re on. And new technology is the key part of it.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation","And then just a quick one on energy. Are you seeing any disruption in the Black Sea related to the situation with Crimea and Russia, Ukraine?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","No, it\u2019s not the drama. If there are issues as a result of that I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how we\u2019ll see it.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation","All right, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Andrew J. Wittmann \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple here on guidance. I noticed you tweaked the gross margin guidance here for the year from 46% to 47%. Can you just talk about what\u2019s behind that? Was it accounting thing where you moved an immaterial amount of cost from cost of goods to SG&A or were there other things there?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","","Yes, mostly Andrew, it was one rounded down and all rounded up. We\u2019re probably indicating more precision than we meant to as we went through this. I\u2019d say from a GP standpoint for the year, we feel we are in good shape, was up, if you do apples and apples 50 basis points Q1 versus last year. We expect that spread to widen as we go throughout the year. And so I think, we were taking the steps we need to do to make sure that happens. So it\u2019s going to be a positive contributor but we were trying to indicate that it\u2019s going to be 100 basis points better than we have indicated last call.","Andrew J. Wittmann \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","","Can you just talk in maybe a little bit of detail on kind of the raw material environment that you experienced in the quarter, and how that outlook shapes up and factors in that gross margin number?","","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","Yes, raws are pretty benign as we look at it. So we do not expect raw materials to be a big conversation point this year, I mean their plus, minus and on the amount we buy it\u2019s pretty very, very small. Pricing will certainly \u2013 pricing is going to be near what it was last year and in a benign raw market, it\u2019s one of the key drivers that increased GP.","Andrew J. Wittmann \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","","Got it, great. And just maybe final question on cash flow; do you still feel kind of like the $1 billion plus number is the right way to think about the year with the start that we have and where we are here so far in 2Q?","","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","Yes, we do. We think we are on track on cash flow.","Andrew J. Wittmann \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","","Thank you very much.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my call. A couple of things in terms of the food and beverage market. I think the one area that we consistently keep hearing about weaknesses in the protein market. Is there anything taking place that would reverse or alleviate that issue? Or maybe you can talk a little bit about what the issues are and how you are dealing with them?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","Yes, this business goes through cycles, and right now more animals would probably be the single most important driver in terms of improved business. Here you\u2019ve got rising prices and shrinking birds. This is really kind of \u2013 this happened a few years ago, this is well predicted for quite a while, so, we are going through it.","Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","","So this has nothing to do with changing diets or changing population dynamics or anything like that.","","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","If anything long-term, we think protein is going to be moving forward not backwards as diets change in the emerging markets.","Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","","Okay. And then on the Nalco\/Champion integration and the process you are making there, can you update us on what the cost synergies to-date realized were and where do you think you are going to be by the end of 2014 and 2015?","","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","Yes, well this is on the Champion \u2013 on the Champion side, as you guys, I don\u2019t know what \u2013 so on Champion, we had $25 million last year, we\u2019re forecasting $80 million this. We were about $18 million in the first quarter and $130 million year after.","Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","Thanks, very good. Then the last question on \u2013 there was a question about the situation in Latin America and you answered it nicely as far as what you are doing to sort of offset the issues there. But the other thing that other companies have been complaining about besides sort of economic condition is currency devaluation. I haven't heard you mention that as a problem. So is that not impacting you or is it you are just dealing with it in terms of getting pricing up or just weathering through it?","","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","Yes, I know as you are aware, we have business in Venezuela, Argentina and the other countries in Brazil. But Venezuela, I mean, we\u2019re pricing to recover, where we\u2019ve already had devaluation. It will fight for normal cycle that we\u2019ve all lived through in the past and so we\u2019re on the other end of that, but certainly there is still risk improvement evaluation in that market, which we talked about in our releases. So it\u2019s an issue. So Venezuela is about 1 percentage sales. So it doesn't seem like the thing to focus on.","Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","Got it. Thank you, Doug.","Operator","This is the operator. I just wanted to remind everyone that you\u2019re allowed to give two questions, one main question and a follow-up question. Our next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Your line is now open.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli \u2013 Gabelli & Company","Good afternoon, all. Doug, you talked about the lack of impact from the issues in Russia and Ukraine on the energy side. Could you talk about what it could do to the institutional side as tourism may come down. So we are talking about restaurants, hotels. What size is your business in that particular neck of the woods?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","","Yes, on the institutional side, it\u2019s very small. In total, Russia, is just a little over a percentage 1.0 of sales in total and includes the energy business, the industrial business, the institutional and institutional by and large the smaller of those businesses. So I just \u2013 I don't think that's going to be the impact we talk about. We\u2019re in 170 plus countries. There is always something happening somewhere in the world every year and every quarter. There are certainly risks with the Russian business right now in terms of what may or may not happen none of which is very predictable. But I just, we will just have to figure out like we figure out everything else, including I guess weather in the first quarter and all the rest of the stuff, how to get through it, and I am confident we will.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli \u2013 Gabelli & Company","Okay. That is helpful, thank you. You talked about several large new accounts in Europe. Was the first quarter helped by filling up a pipeline or is it a question of those particular accounts showing revenues over the course of the year as opposed to one big lump in one quarter and then stop until they need more products?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","Yes, I don\u2019t think we shift anything to any of those accounts in the first quarter. And if we had, there are sometimes a small pipeline at front, but it's not that dramatic. It\u2019s principally an annuity business. And so as the business comes on, it starts consuming product, but at a fairly gradual pace, it\u2019s not a big lump, big spike and then a downward trend, it's an upward trend.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli \u2013 Gabelli & Company","If you put them all together can you give us a feel for how much they could generate incrementally?","","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","Yes, we don\u2019t typically name names or disclose size. How about this? They\u2019re big enough to mention.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli \u2013 Gabelli & Company","Okay.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","It\u2019s going to be meaningful, and I think you should expect to be able to see it in the P&L, in the sales trends, in Europe as we move forward.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli \u2013 Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc","Hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. Doug, I just wanted to ask you a longer-term kind of holistic question. When you bought Nalco, the cost synergies were supposed to run through 2014 and we\u2019re in 2014 now and you\u2019re going to have some benefit from Champion in 2015. It looks like about 30 basis points for the margin. Can you just talk holistically about the levers you are going to be going after to get the 50 to 100 basis point margin expansion when you don\u2019t have as much benefit from acquisition synergies?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","Well, I guess, first I would say this. When we announced the Nalco deal, we first talked about $150 million and then we update months later the $250 million in total synergies and that was through 2015, right. The sale synergies of $500 million were through. With that said, they still ultimately come to an end, which I think is the heart of you second part of your question and I\u2019d say two things. ","Our underlying business and we believe confidently we\u2019ve grown this 6% to 8% range. We have four decades driven margin expansion and we will continue to do that. Plus we will be adding two historic, but relatively there will new tools, because they\u2019ve been on the blocks for a while, which is \u2013 we\u2019re back in the share buyback business. So we\u2019re going to be back in the bolt-on M&A business as we move forward.","And share has been negative for the last few years, not a positive. But as we stop debt paydown, which is really only remaining of this year, we\u2019re out of the debt paydown business. Going forward several steps that comes off, but it\u2019s kind of natural occurrence and we\u2019re going to have cash utilized for its M&A, which is accretive typically, and then second for some share buyback. And so, you take all those together. I think we\u2019re quite confident that we can play in the 15% EPS range post synergy.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc","But is the 50 to 100 basis points on the operating margin still the way that you think about it or is there going to be more share buybacks than we had been thinking about before?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","No, I think the roughly 75 basis point operating margin is how we think about it.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc","Okay. And if I can just sneak in just the tone last quarter sounded like Europe was starting to get better at least it felt that way. Would you say that you are incrementally feeling better about Europe or just kind of reiterating what you said last quarter? And I\u2019ll leave it after that.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","Starting at the same trend. Yes, we\u2019re a quarter further in and I would say that, yes, we think Europe is showing improvement, our business in Europe in particular.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Yang of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Edward H. Yang \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Hey, Doug. Hey, Mike. The large new customer wins in European institutional, I was curious, was that from one of your larger competitors or how was that distributed in terms of competitive wins? And what are you seeing in terms of price competition from some of your competitors there?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","When I would say broadly on price competition, I\u2019d say we still see a lot of the same activity we\u2019ve seen for a long time, which is typically the way our competition is. In many cases it got after our businesses by promising significant price reductions and so unfortunately that hasn\u2019t changed, but we\u2019ve looked at that. I mean, it\u2019s almost 25 years and we\u2019ve seen after 25 years. So it probably won\u2019t change anytime soon. In terms of who is the business from, we won\u2019t get into the institutional business. It was large customers in Europe.","Edward H. Yang \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Got you. And pest elimination, that moderated a bit, it grew 3% and had been running at 5%. Is there anything to read into that? Was there weather impact or was that just kind of lumpiness?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr.","Yes, it was hopefully in Europe and France, where we had delayed service and we only do offer the service when it\u2019s performed. So we see catch-up there. So ultimately we\u2019ll be fine.","Edward H. Yang \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Monahan for closing remarks.","Michael J.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Monahan, Senior Vice-President, External Relations for Ecolab. Thank you. You may begin.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's third quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. A discussion of our results along with our earnings release and the slides referencing our quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor.","Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under the Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with a brief overview of the quarter, continued attractive new business gains and new product introductions drove acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales growth in our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments during the third quarter, offsetting a moderated decline in Energy sales.","Product innovation, lower delivered product costs and ongoing cost efficiency work led the strong adjusted fixed currency operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the impact of soft economies, challenging end markets and continued currency headwinds. These drove the 7% adjusted earnings per share increase before currency translation.","Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments to show modestly better year-on-year acquisition adjusted fixed currency growth versus the third quarter, outpacing their markets and soft international economies as they leverage investments we have made to further improve sales and service force effectiveness and profitability. We expect lower year-on-year results from our Energy business.","We look for our fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the $1.23 to $1.33 range, with that range including approximately $0.02 per share of unfavorable impact from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation and currency translation, as we continue to aggressively drive business growth.","We have narrowed our forecast for the full year 2016 to the $4.35 to $4.45 range from $4.35 to $4.50, which includes expected currency headwinds of approximately $0.30 per share, of which $0.17 per share is from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation.","Moving to some highlights from the quarter, as discussed in our press release, third quarter diluted earnings per share were $1.27. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, third quarter 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.28, and included a $0.09, or 7 percentage point currency headwind. This compared with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.28 a year ago.","Our consolidated acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales were modestly higher as our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments grew 3%, but were offset by lower Energy sales. Regional sales growth was led by Latin America.","Reported operating margins increased 500 basis points. Adjusted fixed currency operating margins expanded 60 basis points as continued sales growth from the Institutional, Industrial and Other segments, lower delivered product costs and cost efficiencies more than offset investments in the business and lower Energy results.","In 2016's difficult operating environment, we have focused on driving new business gains by helping customers to lower their costs. We are using our industry-leading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve the best results and the lowest operating costs, and through these aggressively drive new account gains across all of our segments.","We expect fourth quarter earnings per share in the $1.23 to $1.33 range, reflecting currency translation drag of approximately $0.02. We narrowed our full year earnings per share forecast to the $4.35 to $4.45 range and this forecast includes expected unfavorable currency exchange of approximately $0.30 per share, of which $0.17 per share is from the Venezuela devaluation and deconsolidation.","In summary, despite a very challenging global economic and market environment, we expect to deliver solid fundamental results in 2016. We remain confident in our business, our markets and our people, as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years.","And now here's Doug Baker with some comments.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. Look, my headline would be solid quarter, headwinds are easing, and we believe we're in a good position as we close out the year. So let me go through each of these briefly. So, first, the quarter. I would describe it as better than it looks. The Institutional business, if you look at the underlying sales, particularly in North America, which is a big piece of the business, they remain consistent with the first half in Q3. The noise in this quarter was really in the U.S. distribution channel, and we expect Q4 sales to bounce back to the level that we were seeing prior to Q3.","QSR and FRS, our food retail and quick service businesses remain quite strong. Our F and B business was solid. They've got good new business. We expect that business to accelerate in 2017. The Water business, mining decline eclipsed mid single digit light industry growth and low single digit heavy industry growth. Mining is expected to rebound in Q4 as it hits easier comps and also benefits from new sales, so the Water business will look much better in Q4 and throughout 2017.","The Healthcare business grew at a healthy 6%. We expect an even better Q4 as it laps last year's recall and continues to benefit from new business efforts and successes that we're having. So this business is really gaining traction.","Pets and equipment care were quite strong and expect to remain strong. Energy stabilized. So our sales of $760 million in Q3 are consistent with both Q2 and Q1. Our OI in Q3, however, is much better as reformulations, synergies, and other savings take hold. As we look to Q4, we expect the results to be quite similar to Q3. I call it plus-minus. Sales likely to be a bit better, OA, OI maybe a touch weaker as we will take down two plants for refurbishment. And we're doing that just to be prepared if we're surprised on the upside next year. We don't want to be in a position where we have to take them down at that time.","So we expect to leave the year with very good momentum and fewer hills to climb. The external environment continues to be challenging, and it's mixed, but we believe manageable from an economic standpoint. Raw materials are expected to increase, but we can manage via pricing and cost savings we have in the past. And we don't see this as spiky. We see it as fairly gradual.","FX is easing. So in our first quarter, FX was a 14% headwind, and it's roughly a 1% headwind in Q4. We assume we're highly unlikely to see another 7% full-year challenge in 2017. Energy is stabilized, and if market only stands still here, it will likely or should be an accretive year even in those conditions for us in 2017.","Internally, we've also continued to have great success with new business and our innovation pipeline. We've also maintained investments throughout this year. We invested more in 2016 than 2015. And 2015 was larger in the investment category than 2014, so we continue to build on what we think our core investments for the future, so we have not, if you will, emptied the cabinet there by any means. We've also rebuilt bonus, taken down inventory, swallowed the absorption hit that this typically drives. So we leave the year whole is what I would say.","So while it's too early for 2017 forecasts, we're just frankly in the middle of our planning season. We feel like we're sitting in a good position, leaving the year to deliver a significantly improved 2017. So those are my opening comments. With that, I'll turn it back to Mike.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","That concludes our formal remarks. Operator, would you please begin the Q&A period?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Doug, I'll just ask about that final or one of the final comments you made. I think you said Energy stabilizing if \u2013 did you say if oil prices stay around here, would it be positive in 2017 or something to that effect? Can you just give more color on how you get comfortable with that? Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, a lot of it, Gary, is just the timing of our OI improvements. So, we made, what, mid $50s million on roughly the same sales, like $56 million I think in the first quarter on roughly the same sales that we had in the third quarter. We made nearly $100 million in the third quarter. And a lot of that is just timing. There's been a lot of great work done in that Energy business to reformulate products, lower cost, position ourselves for what I would say improved margins going forward once the wind starts blowing in our direction again.","So as a consequence of that, even in a relatively flat environment, if you assume no material activity change, and we continue to generate around the same $750 million, $760 million in sales a quarter, which is what we've done in the last three and are forecasting in four, you're going to see OI lift just as a consequence of the timing of the OI improvement this year.","Now, what we think is going to happen next year is there will be very modest improvement throughout the year, particularly in the second half of 2017, but I caution we think it's modest. We don't think this is by any means set up for a V recovery. I'm talking about the overall energy market. In that environment, we think we'll have low single digit, mid single digit type sales and decent OI.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. And then just a follow-up on the non-Energy businesses. You've done an outstanding job the last 18 months driving consistent margin expansion in all of those businesses to offset the Energy weakness. Has there \u2013 I know you said you've been investing a lot, but is there a risk that if Energy takes longer to come back that, it just becomes much more difficult, I guess, particularly with raws prices likely going up in the first half of next year to sustain the momentum on a constant currency basis? Obviously FX looks like it's going to be a lot less of a drag.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I think, Gary, I guess the FX, it hits you in transaction and translation. In transaction is like inflation. And we mitigate that. But the translation, there's nothing to do. And FX has really been the problem that's been the most challenging for us to negate because it's not going to justify any pricing or drive any pricing in the market.","Raw materials, I think we've proven over the years that when the raws start moving, we typically can go command additional pricing as a consequence. We continue to drive mix through new technology upgrades in our customers, and of course we've got to benefit the customers financially as well. And we've got, what I would say, very strong momentum in our supply chain around what we call structural savings. So I'm really not that nervous about what we believe is going to happen in the raw material markets which we believe raws are going to move up next year, but we do believe we're going to move up in a fairly orderly fashion as we go. But we have that fully forecasted in our business.","I don't think that's going to drive or negate our ability to continue to drive margin expansion in those businesses. And I would say we didn't drive margin just because oil was down. I mean, we were driving margin when oil was up in a number of those businesses. That's kind of our constant. We want profitable growth, continue to drive mix in a favorable way, watch our spending, continue to get productivity, and those are going to be the same focus areas next year as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, gentlemen. Hey, Doug, wanted to chat about two things: One, just when you think about all those productivity improvements, and obviously we always talk about that in terms of the Ecolab play book and you always have another ten ready to go. But everything that you've done here recently that's shown up in terms of driving that OI and your confidence heading into next year, are all those things that you put in place gradually or put in place a couple years ago to help drive this, or are these all recent initiatives that are just starting?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, it's some of both, Nate. So certainly a number of these initiatives have what I'll call long tails. They take a number of years to fully realize the benefit. And so a number of steps. Look, we're continuing to roll out new technology in the Institutional field force, and so we certainly are already absorbing the cost associated with that, but haven't fully realized the benefits and won't for a couple of years, meaning it will continue to increase in benefit. But I don't think you're going to be at full run rate for a few years. It just takes a while, the change happens in practices, take out the cost that it obsoletes, et cetera.","In the manufacturing and product supply area which we always said was going to be the last frontier for synergies, so we can't call them synergies anymore, but we are getting after a number of opportunities in product supply because we now have a full handle on what the network looks like today and what we think it ought to look like going forward. And there are significant opportunities there that our product supply team is after. So we don't feel we're impaired in terms of opportunities to continue to drive productivity and margin enhancements as we go forward. And I would expect as we continue to add businesses through M&A that we will continue to see additional opportunities arise.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then second question. I realize this is likely probably not going to be a 2017 event, but then going forward, hopefully, the economy at best maybe \u2013 or hopefully at least stays sluggish if not gets a little bit better over that time. But how do you think about at some point in terms of balancing as you kind of recapture the Energy business a little bit and hopefully we have those less FX headwinds. How do you think about letting that margin flow through to the bottom line and back to shareholders versus then when do you kind of kick up the reinvestment rate a little bit?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, I think there will be \u2013 as the Energy business recovers, yeah, there's a number of things. I mean, as we've watched the volume degrade there, it is a more harmful process than simply you lose the OI, particularly because you lose the overhead coverage in your plant. So, I think, you're right. As Energy volume comes back, you're going to see sort of outsize contributions in the near term as you build volume back in your plants. We will use some of that what I will call extra contribution to reinvest back in the Energy business where it makes sense. But we aren't going to be, I think, overzealous of those investments.","We want to see full recovery and make sure that we're investing as the business comes back, and we'd rather be two weeks late than two weeks early on that recovery because it is so hard to predict. So, I don't know if that answers fully your question. But I don't feel like we've got huge pent-up investment demands in the balance of the business, and what I tried to highlight in the opening comments were, we have been increasing our investments in these last two years in spite of FX and energy headwinds. It's important to continue to do that in the business. We have a relatively long-term view of the business. And so, I don't feel like the cupboards are bare. They're going to need to be restocked per se from an investment standpoint as a consequence.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","John Salvatore Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. First, geography question. Looks like Latin America was supportive to Water, Food & Beverage, Institutional. Is there anything going on there that would suggest sustained strength in the end of the year, or was that just a bit of a catch up?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","No. I mean, our Latin America business, I mean, there's certainly not being driven by a great underlying economy. Look, we're having several things go on there. One is, we continue to have new business success. We've got a solid base. You can count on it. In the food safety business and the Water business in particular, those things are typically fairly immune to huge economic swings. With that said, we're also getting pricing, really significant pricing as a consequence of the devaluation that have occurred down there from a currency standpoint. That begets inflation, it drives up our raw materials in that market and we've got to get pricing to offset that, which we're doing successfully. So that's certainly a key piece of the double-digit growth story. I would expect that that business is going to remain fairly resilient and have strong performance for the quarters to come.","John Salvatore Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And my follow up on Healthcare. You talk about some good growth in a smaller base business. In particular, the acute care in the HAI. Can you walk us through how is that tracking to your expectations, Doug? Are you getting the sales touches and the conversions you want as that marketplace begins to evolve? Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. No, I think the team has done a very good job. One, the work we did the last few years I think has been quite fruitful. I think the team that's running this business right now is doing a great job executing. And so we're starting to get uptake in the market. We're having successful rollouts. We've got a much better pipeline than we've had. So, yeah, I would say we were confident. We've talked about this, that this business is continuing to improve. I think you're just seeing the fruits of that. So our expectation is we're going to have a very strong fourth quarter, a little bit artificially strong because of last year's recall that's in the base.","But if you take that out, it's going to be consistent with this 6% plus the benefit of the recall comp. And then next year, we look at this moving from mid single digits to upper single digits. So I think we're on the right track.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. So two quick questions. First, can you give a bit of a feel for, to the extent that your pricing is catching up to your raw materials when you think you will lag that effect or lap it so to speak? And second, how do you think about the underlying operating leverage in the Energy business given the investments that you're making? I mean, is it going to be a multi-year 300 basis points to 500 basis points margin opportunity, or how can we size that?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I didn't fully get the last. So raw materials, we're forecasting we'll start moving kind of enterprise-wide in 2017. They're going to remain favorable in Q4 year-on-year. They're just less favorable than Q3. And there's a minor step up if you will, sequential, from Q3 to Q4. So we're starting to see these. At this point in time, I think we're going to be able to keep our nose above water certainly for the year in 2017. I can't tell you if there's not going to be an issue in one quarter, but I don't think this is going to be, by any means, a theme for next year. We're going to have to continue to do what we do in pricing, continue to do what we do on mix, continue to do what we do on cost savings, and I think those three tools are more than sufficient to offset what we see in terms of raw material inflation next year.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","And then the other question was just on the Energy business with the investments you've been making, how you think about the medium-term operating leverage. I mean, should we think about the investments as supporting sales growth or should we think about them as supporting margin expansion as volume comes back?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, there's no real significant investments going in the Energy business at the moment. What I was alluding to was we will, as this business starts accelerating again, we will be investing. I mean, these are variable investments in terms of re-expanding the sales team and some other functional support areas. But I don't \u2013 again, I think that's going to be well managed as that business expands so well to gross profit and it will more than cover the investments we need to make as we do it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. So there's been news this week around GE and the Baker Hughes acquisition, also news that they divest their Water business. Any thoughts on the potential benefits from disruption in those areas of your business?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, I think \u2013 I guess, it's all brand-new news. I mean, historically I guess I would agree with your premise that when our competitors undergo large transactions are either bought, sold or buy somebody, we tend to go through \u2013 it knocks them off their game a little bit and causes distraction. And it's not lost on us. So, yeah, I would say typically these things short-term can offer favorable competitive environments.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And in the past, you've sometimes spoken about the trend in new business signings in aggregate. Any comment about third quarter and any area that you would say is doing particularly well? Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Third quarter was above third quarter last year. I mean, we had a very good net new business. I would say one of the things \u2013 we've never had a lot of loses, but I would even say this year our losses are less than they were on the last few years on a run rate, which is great for us. So, net total, we're starting to accelerate in the second half on the new business piece, which is important as we enter next year. So I think we feel like we're in good shape there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask the first question by David from the M&A standpoint. We always ask you about your typical pipeline and they end up being small to mid. But just curious if your three main major competitors that you usually can call out are in the process of spinning off, being sold, or acquired. Just curious like what your appetite for some of these larger deals stands as it is today?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, the only answer on specific M&A questions is no comment, broadly. I think what we've always said is we have a appetite for smart deals. We never said we had some kind of artificial limit on size, so that's the approach we take. And so on specifics around M&A prospects, no comment.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And then just on Healthcare, if I can, I mean, it seems like you've had another good quarter of 6%. I mean, are we sort of have a clear runway here? Do you need to bolt on more acquisitions like the one you're doing in France? Just how should we think about where we should hold you on Healthcare too in terms of performance?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, I guess what we've been consistently saying is we think Healthcare is an upper single digit organic growth business, and we're clearly making progress to getting this business in that range. And I think, so one, that's the standard we hold ourselves to, so I'm clearly open to being held to that standard externally. I think that's fair.","In terms of additional acquisition, I would describe it this. I think if there are smart deals to be done in the Healthcare arena, we're all open. It's not a case that we are strategically impaired because we're missing something. So they would be done, I would call it, opportunistically because we thought it enabled us to either grow faster, expand faster, or supplemented our technology in some way that was beneficial for customers. But it's not like there's this big giant strategic hole we've got to go fill externally.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of things. First of all, just want to understand the performance of the Water business in the quarter. It was sort of coming along in kind of mid single digit same currency growth, and then it was basically flat. This quarter you talked about some declines in demand in Asia, particularly China, as well as the mining market impact and then \u2013 that you were, I guess, a little bit more bullish on the mining expectation for the fourth quarter. So, can you talk a little bit about what the trends are in Water? Why China was down? Was it all because of the mining or was there some other slowdown going on and what gives you the confidence that that business is going to come back in the fourth quarter?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Well, mining is a case of \u2013 mining has been down double digits here for four quarters. And that's sort of the secret. We're lapping Q4 last year as the first real pain that we saw in mining is it reflected the pain broadly in the mining market. So, mining based on new business and frankly lapping Q4 of last year, we are pretty confident it's going to be, let's just say, neutral at worst, maybe minorly positive at best year-on-year. So the negative influence from mining is going to abate, and mining will turn positive as we move into 2017.","The other market you mentioned is China, and that's really pain we feel on the heavy side of that business. And that's a reflection of steel, overcapacity, some being taken offline, mining, also in China. And also somewhat paper. Our paper results globally were positive, but they were much more positive than that if you took out the mining or the China results. And ultimately we look at that, we're going to start lapping those comps starting a little bit in the first quarter next year and really fully after the second quarter next year. And so we look at that as an improving situation as we move through 2017 as well.","Otherwise, I mean the Water business is doing quite well. So the light business continues to perform. We continue to drive great innovation there. That's the largest segment that we're in. It's also the most profitable. It had been de-emphasized, and we have reemphasized it to significant positive effect. And the heavy side is starting to do a good job generating new business. It's going to start lapping some of the industrial slowdown so the lab what I'll call more reasonable comps for this environment. And so, I think, you see some of that good work coming through.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Doug, thanks. And then just touching on Energy briefly as my follow up. It sounds from your guidance that you expect another, I don't know, 17%, 18%, 19%, something like that, decline in year-over-year sales in the fourth quarter, basically bringing your two-year decline to about 30%. Clearly, this has gone beyond sort of the 10% of your business that was or 20% of the business at one time that was the upstream business. So are you starting to see the weakness spread into the downstream in the refining business? Is it mostly pricing or volume or a combination thereof? And are we just basically looking for 2017 where we're stabilizing at these levels, but not seeing much of an improvement on the top line as we go through the year.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Well, first, Dmitry, I mean, the substance of your question I'll answer. I'll just say, last year Energy was down just under 10%, more like 9%. And this year we're saying it's going to be down, what I think we said, 10% to 12% or 12%. So it's not down 30% over the last couple years, right? It's down considerably less than that. And we also aren't predicting a fourth quarter in the range that you cited either. It's going to be down modestly worse year-on-year than the third quarter simply because the fourth quarter comps of last year included a number of one-time issues which we identified last year in the fourth quarter. It was a little bit inflated if you will. But sequentially the Energy business in the fourth quarter this year versus third quarter this year is going to be quite consistent.","So we've improved, the top line run rate has stabilized. OI run rate has improved throughout the year. So we're going to enter the year with, what I would call, top line stable, OI margin momentum as we go in. So, yeah, it's going to take a little while to build this business back and regain the 20% we lost. What we've tried to signal is this isn't going to be a one-year phenomenon. And I don't know if it's going to take two years or two and a half years at this point in time, but it's certainly going to take longer than one year to build it back. We've said next year we expect it to be positive on the top line, but modestly positive because we also think it's going to be a modest recovery in the oil markets.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Could you give us an update on how the rollout of institutional water treatment is going?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I would say that's in the light industry portion of the Water business. Okay. Let me dig some fun facts. So, our expectation was that we were going to have a cumulative impact of $90 million there, and we're starting to see revenue build throughout the year. So through the end of this year, I think we're going to be running around probably about the $25 million to $27 million rate leaving the year, and we expect that to accelerate throughout next year. So that's on track and doing what we expect it to do.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And then a number of companies have talked about some deceleration in Europe. I'm not sure Europe was ever all that strong, but could you give us a sense of what you're seeing sequentially as the quarter went along in early October in Europe?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Early October, but I will comment on...","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Well, or early November. We're only one day in November, but what did you see as you went month by month, some of your \u2013 some...","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I guess what I would comment is on Q3. And what we're \u2013 I mean, Europe is clearly not robust. I would say, I would have described it in the first half as probably stronger than I expected. I think in Q3 it was as strong as I expected or as weak as I expected going in. So I'd say there's been some downtick in the economy there. It hasn't fallen off a cliff. And I would still say the environment is, if we do our job and continue to drive new business and keep our existing customers, drive mix in the other things that we have in our toolbox, we should be able to continue to show growth in that market, which is what we anticipate being able to do.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, good afternoon. Doug, your QSR growth of 6% was quite robust. Is QSR gaining share away from sit-down or fine dining? And are you \u2013 maybe it's a case and maybe you're aligning better with the right customer. Can you talk about that?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I don't know. QSR, there's \u2013 if you look at those industry trends, it hasn't really accelerated. I mean it's continued to kind of hold its own. If there's been any trading from top down, it's probably more in the fast casual segment and those other segments of the market less so than from QSR, I think. Our strength there is really built on we've got very deep relationships. We work very hard to help our customers there react to the environments they find themselves in.","Currently, it's not a perfect top-line environment for those businesses, and they're having real cost pressures underneath, particularly from both wage and also benefit pressure, i.e., ACA. And so we're doing a lot of work there trying to help them take labor out of those businesses because they have to given this environment. And so that will offer us new technology for us, but it's a huge financial benefit for them. And that's how we're looking at that market and why I still am quite bullish on our ability to continue to grow in QSR going forward.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. And, Doug, if you were to do any M&A, what sub-segment would you be looking at? Would it be Institutional, Water, and maybe Energy? Or no Energy?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, I would say, we'll answer the Energy question first. I mean, we did an acquisition in Energy not that long ago, and I think as I've reflected in other answers on this question around Energy M&A, it's sort of a situation that if you don't have to sell right now, most people aren't in the mood to sell. If they can make it through. Because I think everybody feels like this thing has bottomed and better times are ahead for them both on a multiple and an EBITDA absolute basis. So it's not \u2013 there's not a lot of for sale signs out there from a lot of people. There are going to be exceptions, and there's been a notable one this week.","So, I guess, I'd be a little surprised if we end up doing any real Energy M&A in the near term for that reason. In terms of where else, yeah, I would say, look, if we're in a business, we're in it to go grow. M&A is one of the growth tools that we use to supplement organic growth. And if we found other smart deals in Institutional, F&B, Water, Healthcare, sort of a naming (38:27), we would be interested. What would our wish list be? I think we've strategically said we want to continue to build the Healthcare business, i.e., you've seen the Anios recent acquisition. And, Water, just because of the market probably hasn't been penetrating with small M&A deals like some of our others, that would also be a place that we would think might be richer environment.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Doug, you mentioned some noise in the U.S. distribution channel. Can you just give us a little more color on what happened there?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Mike, we get this periodically. I mean, it's just, typically we assume that outs from the distributor are going to generate an equal number of ins, i.e., orders to the distributor from us. We have great transparency here as you know, meaning, we had printouts from each of our distributor partners about what exact case went to what exact customer at what price. So we have great clarity in terms of consumption particularly in our U.S. and Canadian businesses. And in U.S., you simply had distributors taking down inventory in the quarter. I mean, it could be as simple as we're watching these things run through here. These things happen, I would say, episodically.","I mean, it's happened a number of times. I ran that business. This is not big new news. If it's consumption dropping, we get nervous. If it's just a order pattern deal with our distributor inventories, then we don't really get all that nervous. So, the U.S. consumption was at 6.3% in the third quarter compared to 6.4% through acquisition adjusted in the second quarter. That's not any meaningful difference. And so, we're quite confident that business continues to run well.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. And then in the comments that you guys provided on Energy, you referenced lower customer product usage within the production side of the Energy business. I was wondering, how much flexibility did customers have on reducing chemical use and is this a situation where they can only do that for so long and then we would expect to see the usage rebound, or does it have more to do with the mix of production coming from more sources that are using less of your chemicals on a per barrel basis?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I'd say it's principally that there are some technologies they just turned off because of their cash position. And so, some anticorrosion products. You don't see corrosion in a month or even a year, it's over a period of time. And so these are technologies that they'll turn off in very dire times. But they will end up turning it back on because it's not very smart economically to have these turned off for long periods of time because you're going to basically blow out your pipe and then you've got a big capital problem if you want to continue flow of material. So it's a number of those instances. And that business we anticipate would come back as price and customer cash flow stabilizes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Kayvan Rahbar - Macquarie","Hi. This Kayvan stepping in for Hamzah. You had a question about SG&A. Could you sort of tell us sort of what the outlook for that might be especially as it relates to some of the investment spend that's coming in?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Look, I'd say our investments are in several areas. I mean, certainly we continue to add sales folks in the businesses that continue to show solid organic growth. We continue to invest in field technology and also what I'll call a customer connectivity technology. We collect data in nearly a million customer sites around the world, and we want to make sure that we connect that data collection capability with the cloud so that we can better utilize it to inform our sales team in advance of what's going on, better direct them to sales opportunities, how to help the customer frankly drive efficiency in both new sales productivity and in just selling time productivity as we go forward. So that's an area that's getting a lot of work.","We continue to invest in just core ERP capabilities throughout the company knitting together the number of ERP systems we have around the world. We turned Canada on in the second quarter. We typically don't talk about these things as we go through them because we typically don't have big issues as we turn them on. And so we're continuing to invest there as we move forward, and so those areas are also getting, what I would call, historically outsize investments as we upgrade those capabilities, which we think are really important for us long-term and something that we think is manageable in our P&L as we move forward.","Kayvan Rahbar - Macquarie","All right. I appreciate that color. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Doug, as we're heading here into 2017 and you're doing your planning process, I was just hoping you could outline for us what your key strategic priorities are going to be as you go into 2017 and really what some of those swing factors that could affect \u2013 the key swing factors that you're looking at today as you handicap what 2017 could look like? I just want to see what's on your list of pluses and minuses there.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I would say in terms of driving the business, we mentioned this year one of them, we had a number of key strategic priorities. One was getting energy-ready for what we'll call stabilization and kind of upturn, and I think we can check the box and then we feel like we're in good shape there moving into next year. So, strategic priorities around driving the business or just making sure we continue to stick to the fundamentals. Driving new business, leveraging innovation to do that, as well as to build mix, profitable mix within the existing customer base, all the fundamentals that we typically drive. We've got some significant cost savings initiatives that we're undertaking, particularly in product supply, which I mentioned earlier, to make sure just from an operating standpoint we continue to build both top line and expand margins as we go forward.","Longer term, there's probably two key areas that we're going to have outsize emphasis. One I just talked about in terms of field technology and customer connection technologies. We're going to continue to invest there, make sure that we have a leadership position. We already have a huge installed base of information collection capability. We want to make sure that we fully leverage that to our advantage and our customers' advantage moving forward, so that's going to get an area.","The second would be talent. And so we have had a lot of success, I think, attracting great people, but we want to continue to improve our capabilities there. We track by business, by market, we're in a 172 of them how we do in terms of keeping our people, developing our people, and promoting our people, and we want to continue to increase our capabilities in all those areas because we think that's going to increasingly become a very important source of long-term competitiveness.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","On the earnings side, the key swing factors that you're looking at to drive results into 2017?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","I think the wild cards would be, number one, FX. And so, I'm sitting here quite confident it's not going to be anywhere near 7% in terms of EPS headwind next year, but if you want something that can turn on a dime, it would be FX. It's also impossible to predict. I guess I just did. So that would be the wild card. Again, I don't think it's fundamental to what's going on in the business and long-term that turns the other way some day. I just don't know when it is.","The other area I think would be just kind of world economic health. I don't think the world is going to turn to recession, but it's kind of a flaky world right now and it's almost binary. Things turn on and off much more rapidly than they did before. I think that's something we're just going to have to manage and be nimble.","And then finally, oil, which I would say is probably more likely an upside than downside to price, but it could go either way as we all know. Oil would be the other one that you would say, I think we've got this thing cast fairly in kind of a comfortable zone. We are not expecting any really upside benefit from a big market upturn from oil. I don't think you're going to see it in any case in the first half. Second half, you can start arguing a case, probably more likely upside versus our forecast than downside.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. Just an extension on the Healthcare questions. Can you comment a little on the longer-term trends you're seeing in the business, especially under readmission reduction program penalties, HII penalties, et cetera. It seems like you've seen some material upticks here in the last year. So just anything worth noting that could be a tailwind in 2017 or 2018?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I don't know that we can attribute our recent success to that factor. I would say that could only help us. I would say we're not counting on it; that fundamentally what we're working to do is be much clearer in articulating the benefit and effectiveness of our program approach in reducing HAIC or healthcare-acquired infection. This has material financial benefits to hospitals who are looking for material financial benefit. And it also has great moral benefits as well because you're hurting fewer people as you go forward. So I think that's really what we're focused on and talking about. I think if that gets traction, we'll start weaving that more tightly into our story, but that's not the benefit that we're leveraging right now.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Fair enough. And very quickly on pest elimination, can you just talk a little more about the regional trends you're seeing in LatAm and Asia Pac specifically, the long-term strategies and just a little more color on the innovative sales offerings, please? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Pest business was fairly strong across the board, and I'm just trying to get my chart. I would say two things. The business is \u2013 the pest business really takes off when you have some density. And so, what we've been able to do with a number of like what I would call as the Asia Pacific and the Latin America markets is continuing to drive density, which will continue to drive much better leverage. Right now if you look at those markets, they are the lowest OI margins that we have, and it's really a consequence of the makeup of the business, i.e., smaller businesses that are growing but haven't quite achieved what I would call margin efficient density level. But they will. So that's one of the reasons I think to be bullish on that business. All of them are growing quite well, and the growth in particularly Latin America and Asia Pacific is going to have outsized margin contribution as it starts overwhelming the overhead investments that we've already made.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Doug, I was wondering if you could touch on the growth from Institutional, which went from up 10% in the second quarter to up 7% in the third. Is the 7% more normal level, or was there some negative impact in Europe from all of those attacks?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. It wasn't Europe in particular. As I mentioned earlier, we had a somewhat unusually soft result in Institutional that was really driven by inventory distributor \u2013 distributor inventory channel, not by underlying consumption. And so, I would say, 1% to 10% you'll recall includes Swisher, so it's a bit artificially high. We don't claim that that business is a 10% organic growth business. But the 7%, which also included Swisher, I would say, is artificially low versus what it would be. We think it's running at a fairly normal basis.","In the fourth quarter, we're going to start annualizing against the Swisher acquisition as we move forward. But the underlying Institutional U.S. business, which is the one that impacted \u2013 created that delta most notably is fine. The underlying business is solid. I mentioned earlier it was \u2013 its underlying consumption rate was 6.3%. This is acquisition adjusted right in the third quarter versus 6.4% in the second quarter. So very steady.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Do you think that the adjustment at the distributors level is done?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, there's only so much it can do. I don't even know that it was planned. Sometimes these are just frankly a function of what happens in the last days of a quarter and when orders happen. So I don't think it's significant. Yeah, there's not a lot of room for them to take out inventory. Let's put it that way.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","And, Doug, if we look at Europe and the weak economic environment, do you think that if deals, they stay flat going forward, you can still improve your margin by about 100 basis points a year?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. What I've always said, Rosemarie, is we need our nose above water, we don't need huge growth. Obviously, the faster we grow, the easier it is to generate the 100 basis points plus. We're in a position this year we'll exceed the 100 basis points again. I think that's \u2013 I don't know if this is our sixth year in a row now since we \u2013 I guess the fifth year in a row since we announced it. But we're in a very good position to go deliver this year and had terrific margin improvement in the third quarter. So I feel \u2013 I think we are going to keep our nose above water in the economic environment that we foresee in Europe, which is a bit softer than we've seen recently, and we'll continue to be able to generate a 100 plus basis points in margin improvement.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good afternoon. Doug, if I could circle back to when you were discussing Water in prepared remarks, you mentioned mining expected to rebound in the fourth quarter on easier comps. But you also mentioned benefit from new sales and just curious what you're seeing in mining as far as trends geographically and the health of the business. Obviously, you're talking up the trend, the momentum into 2017, but just curious on the clarity on mining specifically.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I mean, mining went through a free fall itself, and I think what we've probably seen is some kind of stabilization in the base. And, of mining operators who, I think, can better predict going forward. We haven't seen any recovery in that business in terms of just mining activity. There's a lot of conversation in that industry about who is going to bet on the future and on increased demand because they're going to have to sink some capital to do it. So, really, the net new business we have and we have a number of technologies. These technologies can lower existing costs, reduce the amount of water that it takes to execute ex-mining. I mean, people are still mining. But that's what's really \u2013 that's what really drove the new sales. It wasn't some kind of pickup in mining activity from quarter-to-quarter.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks. And then with regard to Swisher, could you just give us a little bit of backdrop with regard to the divestiture and how things have gone with the retained portions? Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. We divested the restroom cleaning portion of Swisher which interestingly was Swisher's original business. And that was a business that we always intended to divest even when we bought it. I mean, I guess, we had open minds that if it proved to us to be a lot more valuable to us than we suspected going in, but we never saw that business as a great fit for the way that we conduct business. It's a good business. It's just not necessarily a good business for us to own. And so as a consequence, we divested it. We thought we would be able to divest that a lot quicker than we did. If anything, it slowed us down on a few areas of synergies that we are now getting after i.e., we had to keep their operating center in Charlotte open much longer than we anticipated and some other things because that's where that business is run out of. And so we'll get on with it.","The Swisher acquisition, I would say is largely on track. If you're going to pin me down and say where is it exactly, I mean, it's behind by weeks and it's in a position where that team will catch up quite quickly now that that divestiture is behind us. So that deal is going to ultimately turn out to be a absolute home run financially for us. It's just been a heck of a lot of work in terms of transitioning all the products to our formulas, moving them, they're still doing production, one, their warehouse to our warehouse and their factory to our factory, changing the way that they distribute because a lot of it was distributed by individual salespeople within Swisher and obviously that's not how we distribute our product for safety reasons as well as just control reasons and utilization of sales time efficiency.","So for all kinds of reasons. So there's been a lot of transitioning going on. All of it is going quite well, but it's a lot of work. And so, I know that team is looking forward to start hitting to more normal operating situations, which they're entering now Q4 and Q1.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Dolev - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. It sounds like the Energy estimate for the year is going to be a touch lower than what you initially guided to. I think you mentioned 12% decline versus 10% in July. A, is that true? And, B, can you give us the breakdown of the three sub segment in terms of Wellchem, downstream and then within production? Or C, can you give us sort of the usage and the pricing changes and how that changes from 3Q to 4Q? Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. So, you're right. We had said it was going to be down around 10%, and now we've clarified it's going to be down around 12%. I would say from our view then to our view now, the macro theme is pretty consistent since second half is going to be better than the first half. It is. So the business is bottoming. It is. And then the specifics around where the business is going to park for the year is a little worse than we had anticipated. I'd say what's going on, I would, mostly downstream is a little softer than we had forecast at that time. There has been some new business that we've had that's been delayed, not permanently, but out a quarter or so. And then we had a couple of world events that I would say also nicked us, pipelines breaking, pulling out of Iraq, etcetera.","But I don't know that that's really a material part of the story. I think the story on Energy is it's been a dramatic headwind for us over the last, if you will, six quarters, seven quarters. We're now starting to enter a period where we're going to start lapping, and it's going to quickly move from a headwind to a tailwind, almost under any normal scenario. If you don't believe oil is going to decline further from here, all it does is stabilize. I think it's accretive. If it happens to start picking up, it's going to be more accretive as we go forward.","So, sub segments, sequentially we think OFC is the same or a little better. Downstream is going to be a little better, but going to be a little worse year-on-year. Also had one timers in that business last year. Wellchem is going to be a little better also Q4 to Q3. So kind of across the board we see minor sequential strengthening, but I underline minor. I think the business is stabilized, and we're in a good position to move into 2017.","Dan Dolev - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. And can you give us the 3Q ranges for those three sub segments if possible?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","In terms of sales growth?","Dan Dolev - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yeah. I guess sales decline in WellChem, downstream growth, and then what happened in OFC?","Douglas M. Baker - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. I would say we typically don't go into each of the details. I'd say downstream was modestly positive. OFC was modestly negative. And still the business that's been most impacted is Wellchem, but its decline has slowed considerably as it starts lapping last year's numbers.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Michael Monahan","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's fourth quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO. A copy of our earnings release and  accompanying slides referenced in the teleconference are available on Ecolab's website at investor.ecolab.com. ","Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on Slide 12 stating that this teleconference and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under Item 1A, risk factors, in our fourth quarter earnings release and on Slide 2. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release. ","Starting with our overview in Slide 3, we delivered strong results once again in the fourth quarter. We leveraged our sales volume, growth, pricing and cost-efficiency work along with excellent acquisition performances to offset significantly higher delivered product cost to produce another strong double-digit increase in our adjusted earnings per share. In addition, note that we included one month of Nalco's U.S. results in our quarter, reflecting their operations in the period following our December 1 close. ","Looking ahead, we expect to continue outperforming our combined markets and show good earnings gains in the first quarter and stronger growth for the full year as better sales growth, pricing, innovation, synergies and margin leverage more than offset lessening increases in delivered product cost and merger-related cost. Further, we expect 2012 will be our 10th year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth in the last 11, and we will do so while setting up further strong growth in the years ahead. ","Moving to some highlights from the quarter and as discussed in our press release, reported fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.34. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years as well as the impact from the Nalco merger from 2011, fourth quarter 2011 earnings per share increased 17% to $0.70 which was the midpoint of our forecasted range. The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by volume and pricing gains, new products and new accounts which, along with the strong performance from acquisitions, lower variable compensation and cost-savings actions, more than offset higher delivered product cost. ","We enjoyed strong sales growth in our Food & Beverage and Kay businesses worldwide. Geographically, Latin America was strong, and our Canada operations also saw good gains. We continue to be aggressive, focusing on accelerating our top line growth as we emphasize our innovative product and service strengths to help drive increased market share in our core businesses and new account acquisition across all of our customer segments. We also continue to implement appropriate price increases to help offset higher delivered product cost. ","We remain focused on expanding our margins, emphasizing productivity and efficiency improvements to help increase profitability as well as drive merger synergies. We are achieving excellent progress in our actions to improve profitability in our Europe business. We have seen the benefits of these actions in our results. Though, as we outlined in our last call, Europe's fourth quarter also reflected the impact of significantly higher raw material cost. We continue to expect strong margin improvement in the fourth quarter 2012 with further significant gains over the next several years. We also continue to make investments in key growth businesses and acquisitions to build future growth. ","As announced in our January update, our work to integrate Ecolab and Nalco has gone very well. The merger bolsters our opportunity set for our customers and positions us as the leader in additional high-growth markets that leverage our mutual core strengths in product technology and sales and service execution. We look for the first quarter results to show upper single-digit sales growth led by global energy and our Asia Pacific and Latin America operations. This strong business performance will be impacted by the much higher depreciation and amortization expense from our merger in what is our seasonally slowest sales quarter. ","As such, first quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be in the $0.46 to $0.49 range compared with adjusted EPS of $0.45 earned by legacy Ecolab in the first quarter of 2011. However, we expect the quarterly earnings growth rate to accelerate over the balance of the year as higher fixed depreciation and amortization and interest expense are offset by increasing benefits from synergies and cost reductions by seasonally higher revenues and by underlying business growth. We look for full-year earnings per share to rise 16% to 20% to the $2.95 to $3.05 range. ","In summary, we expect 2012 to reflect another strong performance by Ecolab as we show accelerating quarterly earnings gains to once again deliver very attractive growth and shareholder  returns this year and set the stage for improved results in the years ahead. ","Slide 4 shows our adjusted income statement and Slide 5 shows our sales growth detail. Ecolab's reported consolidated sales for the fourth quarter, including the impact of Nalco, increased 17%. Excluding the impact of Nalco and the previously disclosed contract modification charge, legacy Ecolab's fixed currency fourth quarter sales increased 7%. Looking at the fixed currency components, volume and mix increased 2%, pricing rose 2% and acquisitions were 2%. Rounding accounts for the difference. ","Sales for our U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing operations rose 8%. Adjusted for acquisitions, sales increased 5%. Institutional sales grew 4% in the fourth quarter. ","Sales initiatives targeting new accounts and effective product and service programs continue to lead our results and outperform mixed end markets. Shipments to our end-use customers continue to show steady sequential improvement. Lodging room demand continued to show good growth against tougher comparables, while food service foot traffic remains soft. ","To drive our growth and improve on our industry leadership, we're introducing more new products that deliver increased value and reduced labor, water and energy cost for customers in our warewashing, laundry and housekeeping markets. ","We have fully rolled out Solid Power XL, our new concentrated warewashing product that provides 50% more cleaning power per capsule. The Cleaning Caddy, which won an industry innovation award and provides customers with the ability to more easily and frequently clean their restroom with less downtime, thereby saving money and improving guest and employee satisfaction, had strong growth in the quarter. ","Further, we are developing new programs with distributors to target regional and independent chains and drive better penetration and new account growth. We also continue to make additional investments in our sales and service force and leverage additional marketing initiatives to drive sales growth. We expect continued progress in the first quarter as these growth drivers and new initiatives and innovations help Institutional show steady sales gains and once again significantly outperform its markets. ","Kay's fourth quarter sales increased 9%. Quick service sales reflected strong shipments to current customers and to distributors. The food retail business rose modestly. We expect continued good new account gains in food retail, along with quick service sales to drive another year of upper single-digit sales growth for Kay in 2012. However, first quarter sales gains will be flattish, reflecting the timing of shipments to major customers. ","Healthcare sales increased 35% with year-on-year O.R. Solutions growth of 13%. Excluding the acquisition of O.R. Solutions, sales increased 4% as good growth from instrument reprocessing, environmental hygiene and surgical drapes was slowed by continuing weak U.S. health care industry market trends. ","We continue to see new account gains from our OptiPro Instrument Reprocessing line for central sterile and further good progress in our EnCompass Environmental Hygiene line for patient room hygiene. Further, O.R. Solutions continues to show strong growth. Looking ahead, first quarter sales are expected to show steady organic and strong reported sales gains. ","Food & Beverage sales rose 6%. Sales increased in both segments, led by corporate account wins, pricing and product penetration. Food & Beverage will continue to focus on new account acquisition, pricing and new product sales to show continued solid growth in the first quarter of 2012. ","Sales for U.S. Other Services rose 2% in the fourth quarter. Pest Elimination sales rose modestly as gains in food processing, healthcare, hospitality and food retail were mostly offset by slow and cautious conditions in other major end markets as well as reduced add-on service sales. ","We are working to develop new products and program solutions to better meet our customer needs and differentiate our offerings. Recent new program launches, like Guardian Plus for full-service restaurants and bedbug treatments in non-hospitality markets, such as long-term care, retail and restaurants, are showing good results. We expect our new products and programs, along with aggressive selling, to help offset the soft market and yield sales improvement in 2012. ","Sales for Equipment Care, formally called GCS, increased 4% in the quarter. Equipment Care again turned in a modest profit, its second quarter in a row. New account wins and appropriate pricing helped to drive the sales and profit gain. We remain focused on developing chain account relationships and driving sales through their regional and franchise organizations. We expect Equipment Care to again show strong sales growth and continued profit improvement in 2012. ","Measured in fixed currencies, international sales increased 6%. Adjusted for acquisitions, sales increased 4%. Europe, Middle East and Africa sales rose 2% in the fourth quarter at fixed currency rates as we continue to offset softening end markets in the region. Europe's institutional fourth quarter sales were flat versus a year ago. New business gains among regional and local customers leveraged new products but were offset by weak demand, primarily in the Mediterranean countries. ","Food & Beverage sales rose nicely over last year, reflecting market share gains. Food & Beverage continues to focus on corporate accounts, emphasizing cost savings benefits of our innovative products. Textile Care sales declined in the fourth quarter, reflecting soft work wear markets. We are using new products and technology to offset these market trends and improve Textile Care results. ","Europe Healthcare sales showed a good increase led by gains in both the infection prevention and contamination control segments. Europe -- Pest Europe sales increased modestly as a continued  focus on corporate accounts and new programs, along with continued operational improvements yielded the gain. ","Our work to improve operating efficiency in our Europe operations is showing good progress. We continue to roll out our shared services strategy into new areas and processes and thereby, accelerate savings from our earlier work. In addition, recent actions include further consolidation of raw material suppliers in order to reduce complexity and leverage purchasing and the announced consolidation of facilities in our German offices and other countries to improve productivity and reduce cost. ","Looking ahead, we expect Europe's first quarter to show continued modest fixed currency sales growth as it works through the softening and very challenging business environment. The persistent raw material increases in these tough economic conditions occurring in Europe's seasonally smallest sales quarter are likely to result in first quarter margin improvement showing a pause, but it should pick up again in the second quarter. ","Asia Pacific sales grew 14% in fixed currencies. Adjusted for acquisitions, fixed currency sales grew 4%. We estimate the effects of the earthquake in Japan and floods in Thailand continue to impact results but reduced our fourth quarter -- and reduced our fourth quarter sales gain by about 2 percentage points. ","Institutional sales adjusted for the Cleantec acquisition showed good growth. New programs and a focus on restaurant and lodging expansion in the emerging Asia markets helped offset the impact of earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand earlier this year. Food & Beverage sales also enjoyed strong organic growth, and the new account gains and new product penetration led the increase. Looking ahead, Asia Pacific expects continued strong sales growth in the first quarter of 2012. ","Fourth quarter sales for Ecolab's Canadian operations increased 6% at fixed currency rates as solid growth in the core businesses drove results. Latin America reported a strong sales gain, rising 15% in fixed currencies as all divisions in that region grew double digits. Institutional growth was driven by new accounts, increased product penetration and continued success with global and regional accounts. Food & Beverage sales reflect strong demand in the beverage and brewing markets as well as the benefits of new accounts, and Pest Elimination sales showed a double-digit gain. ","Overall, we expect attractive growth trends to continue in Latin America and yield another double-digit gain in the first quarter. We included Nalco's segment results in our fourth quarter financial statements only for the month following our merger. And these results were only for their U.S. operations, because our international businesses operate on a November 30 fiscal year. Obviously, any one-month period is not a good indicator of business performance. Therefore, we include the following qualitative comments regarding the full fourth quarter performance of Nalco's businesses on the Ecolab calendar basis in order to provide a continuity regarding their business progress. But also note, the fourth quarter results were affected by onetime events related to merger and integration activity. ","Nalco sales for the full fourth quarter rose 13% to $1.2 billion in fixed currencies, excluding acquisitions. Adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures, fixed currency global water service sales increased 9% in the fourth quarter. Double-digit growth in mining led the quarter as new technology launches, recovering power plant demand and continued appropriate pricing drove sales. Light industry sales were essentially flat. ","Regionally, growth was strong in the U.S., Latin America and Europe, while Asia Pacific was soft. We expect continued solid growth in the first quarter as further market penetration using our industry-leading 3D TRASAR technology and superior products and services should offset softer Europe as well as somewhat slower global primary metals and light manufacturing end markets. ","Global sales for Paper Services slowed to  low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. Good growth in the U.S. and Latin America was partially offset by weakness in Asia Pacific and Europe, reflecting the slower graphic paper and packaging end markets and as year-end inventory control actions were implemented by a number of customers. We expect first quarter sales to show better growth driven by our targeted and differentiated technology offerings that will help us outpace the market. ","Measured in fixed currencies, energy services global sales grew an impressive 21%, reflecting continued strong demand, market share gains and appropriate pricing. Strong double-digit growth in our upstream business reflected the continued success of our superior product technology and sales and service expertise, our ability to reliably supply customers to assure production mix innovation and our strategy to focus on products and services on harder to reach and harder to treat oil. Further, we benefited from the expansion of our operations in emerging countries as well as unconventional production in North America from shale and Canadian oil sands. ","We also enjoyed double-digit growth in our downstream business as we again outperformed the market through share gains that leveraged our industry-leading products, systems and services. We expect double-digit growth to continue in the first quarter as business fundamentals for upstream remains strong and offset slower downstream markets in Europe and North America. We're excited about the outlook, and we'll continue to focus efforts on new production, geographic expansion and building technical expertise as well as support infrastructure in the critical new growth markets. ","Turning to margins in the income statement and Slide 6 of our presentation. Fourth quarter reported gross margins were 47.6%. Adjusted for Nalco results and the impact of special charges, gross margins were 49.4%, a decrease of 90 basis points from last year. The decrease in the adjusted gross margin primarily reflected the impact of higher delivered product cost, which more than offset the impact of volume and pricing gains from a gross margin perspective. ","In absolute dollar terms, pricing equaled the higher delivered product cost in the fourth quarter. Further, it looks like the rate of year-over-year increase in those costs have slowed and that pricing and cost reduction actions we are taking will grow and drive comparable business gross margin expansion in the future quarters. ","Reported SG&A expenses represent 35.3% of sales. Adjusted for the Nalco impact, currencies and special charges, SG&A expenses were 34.6% of sales, 220 basis points below last year. Leverage from the sales gains and acquisitions, lower variable compensation as well as cost savings efforts led the improvement. ","Operating income for Ecolab's U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing segment rose 27%. Adjusted for acquisitions, U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing operating income increased 19%. Pricing, volume gains, lower variable compensation in comparison to a period that included a customer receivable write-down more than offset higher delivered product cost in the quarter. ","Operating income for U.S. Other Services declined 2% as higher service delivery costs slightly offset pricing and variable compensation reductions. International fixed currency operating income increased 6% versus last year. Margins were steady as volume and pricing gains and improved efficiencies offset higher delivered product costs. ","Only one month of Nalco's operating income was included in our fourth quarter reported results. For the full fourth quarter, Nalco's operating income was similar to last year. We do not believe the results to be meaningful in determining business trends since this period included a number of onetime events related to the merger close and integration activities. More importantly, first quarter trends show Nalco operating income improving sharply over last year, which is more consistent with the underlying business. ","Corporate segment and tax rate are discussed in the press release. We repurchased 9.4 million shares during the fourth quarter. The net of this performance is that Ecolab's reported fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.34 compared with $0.56 reported a year ago. When adjusted for special gains and charges and discrete tax items in both years, adjusted earnings increased 17% to $0.70 when compared with $0.60 earned a year ago. ","Turning to Slide 7. Ecolab's balance sheet reflected the impact of the Nalco merger. Total debt to total capital was 57% at December 31 compared with 28% reported a year ago. Our net debt was 50%. This includes a payment for the 9 million shares purchased under our accelerated share repurchase program. ","Turning to cash flow. Ecolab's cash from operations in the fourth quarter reflected Nalco merger-related payments of $79 million, a $30 million customer contract modification and other charges which lowered reported net income. Full year cash flow reflected these as well as a $100 million pension payment in the first quarter 2011. Also, please note we have separated depreciation and amortization expenses in Slide 7 for the purposes of this presentation. We redeemed Nalco's senior notes in January. ","Slide 8 shows our short- and long-term debt following the transactions. Reflecting those transactions, our total debt to total capital was approximately 50% at January 31. ","Looking ahead and as outlined in Slide 9, we continue to take aggressive actions to drive both our top and bottom line, expanding our market share and customer penetration as one company among major accounts, leveraging our leadership positions in key growth markets. We are using pricing and innovation to drive benefit margins and expect to more than offset delivered product cost through 2012. Our merger synergies, along with Europe's transformation work, continues to go well, and we expect to deliver on those aggressive goals while building growth for the future. ","Looking at Ecolab's first quarter 2012 forecast described in Slide 10. We will continue to be aggressive in driving our business growth and look for our first quarter results to show upper single-digit sales gains led by global energy and our Asia Pacific and Latin America operations. This strong business performance will be impacted by the much higher depreciation and amortization and interest expense as well as increased share count from our merger in what is our seasonally lowest sales quarter. As such, adjusted first quarter diluted earnings per share are forecast to increase to the $0.46 to $0.49 range compared with the adjusted earnings per share of $0.45 earned last year. ","However, we expect the quarterly earnings growth rate to accelerate through the rest of 2012 as the higher fixed depreciation and amortization and interest expense and shares are offset by the benefits of increasing synergies, cost reductions, seasonally higher revenues and growth of the underlying business. As a result, we continue to look for 2012 full year adjusted EPS to increase 16% to 20% to the $2.95 to $3.05 range. ","Slide 11 shows an EPS bridge for the first quarter and the full year 2012 that details this outlook. Ecolab's legacy 2011 results are shown in the first row. Expected 2012 results, excluding shares and interest from our combined Ecolab and Nalco businesses, is shown on the next line. This is followed by the impact from the higher shares and interest expense from the merger. This nets to a strong base business growth in the 25% to 30% range throughout the period shown and reflects the addition of Nalco and the underlying strength of our business combination. Synergies will further benefit these results. ","Purchase accounting will be a significant headwind on the seasonally smaller first quarter but represent a much smaller impact on earnings over the balance of the year due to the larger business base. Net, we look for strong business base growth to 2012 with adjusted diluted EPS showing accelerated growth through the remaining quarters. ","In summary, as noted on Slide 12, we once again delivered on our forecast in the fourth quarter while offsetting higher-than-expected delivered product cost and while still investing in our future. We look for sales and profit growth to accelerate through 2012's quarters to produce another strong year and make it our tenth year of adjusted double-digit EPS growth out of the last 11 years. ","And now, here's Doug Baker with some closing comments.","Douglas M. Baker","Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, everybody. Look, I'll just have a few comments and then we'll open it up for Q&A. ","So all in all, I feel very good about the way we finished the year. It was clearly on a positive note. It was our best adjusted EPS growth for the year of 17%. We had improving sales trends, which we expect to continue as we move into 2012. Pricing caught up to raws. We had great integration work. We closed on the Nalco merger. And most importantly, we didn't let this work on the Nalco merger distract the team, hence, the delivery of 17%. ","I also feel good, about as good as you can feel in this world today, as we look to 2012 and beyond. The Nalco merger, I would have to characterize as going quite well. We like the business. We like the growth momentum. It's a great team. We've gotten to know the team much better. There's real upsides and synergies. Both growth and cost are real, and we believe we can get after these. There's great operating leverage in this business as we start laying on the Ecolab operating model, and there's great technology sharing opportunities going both ways, Nalco technology into some of the legacy Ecolab businesses and vice versa. So there's terrific opportunities as we foresaw  when we put this together. ","So looking at 2012, we've got the makings for another very good year. We've got accelerating businesses from a top line standpoint, great market positions. I tell you, our teams are quite focused on getting after what they need to, driving new business, driving innovation, executing. There are upsides in cost savings and synergies and possibly pricing should the market or the raw material markets go against us. So net, we have a lot to do, no doubt about it, but we really do see a path to upper-teens-EPS type delivery in 2012. ","So with that as a backdrop, we'll open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question does come from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Doug, you mentioned some upside on Nalco synergies, both cost and growth. Can you quantify when that -- when you might be able to raise actually the cost synergies going forward from the $150 million level?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Well, Dave, we actually had an announcement earlier in the month where we've raised it up to $250 million on a going basis. And so this year, it went from roughly $35 million to $75 million anticipated synergies. And I guess what I was alluding to in the opening comments is as we continue to push and look for this, there are going to be additional cost savings opportunities, and it's going to start to becoming difficult to distinguish between cost savings and synergies as we go forward. But the point is there are additional opportunities in our business should we need to get after them.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just on European margins in 2011 and '12, can you comment on where they ended 2011?  And obviously, they'll be flattish in Q1, but the target for 2012 European margins for Ecolab?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. We were up for the year in 2011 versus 2010. It's a little north of 60 basis points. I think it was 65 basis points. Now I will tell you that was shy of the 100-basis-point target that we gave at the beginning of 2011. And fundamentally, what happened was the Renaissance work, which was a codename that we have for the restructure activity, more than delivered against its plan, but it was offset by significantly higher raw materials. We anticipate the pricing will catch raws in the second half in Europe, and we expect that we will see the 200-basis-point increase in 2012 versus 2011 that we talked about last year.","Operator","The next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you give us any commentary on just timing of the cost savings within the year? Would it be more prudent to expect that much more than half of that falls in the second half of the year? Or sort of any comments on that.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Gary, I think there's 2 things. Yes, most of it is going to be in the second half. That's simply how cost savings come on, and you got 2 factors when it comes to synergies. We have cost to achieve, i.e. we have a dedicated team. The team is going to be at its largest point at the beginning of the year and at the smallest number at the end of the year. So the cost to achieve end up declining throughout the year, and obviously, the growth synergies grow throughout the year. So you're net increases  quite dramatically quarter-by-quarter. So if you look at page -- Slide 11 of the deck that we also sent out as part of the earnings release just before this call, we talk about a $0.02 contribution from synergies, net synergies in Q1 and $0.16 for the next 3 quarters. And obviously, the $0.16 builds. It's not a straight average over the 3.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could just try to get a little more color on Europe. I think I heard some weakness in the legacy businesses and in volumes in the Mediterranean countries, but the overall growth you reported was positive and solid. And how was Northern Europe looking? Has the trend really weakened quite a bit versus what maybe you were seeing 2 months ago? And I guess just any update on how you feel about growing that business this year.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I guess the unfortunate part was we expected Europe growth to be improving this year if you had a solid footing, but we don't have a solid footing. So all the work we've done in terms of capturing new business and the rest is really neutralizing what I call market degradation. So in total, for the year, we expect the same kind of growth in 2012 that we saw in 2011, so a couple of points of sales growth. So not a terrible story, but it's a little frustrating given all the good work that's been done by that team.","Operator","The next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Now that you've obviously had some more time to spend, as you said, Doug, with the Nalco folks, what are some of the surprises and\/or negatives that you've seen in terms of going forward with the business, not only just the combination but just in terms of what Nalco brings to the table?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I would say there's a long list. I think when we got in here, we knew there was a number of similarities. Business model, that fit is exactly as we thought it was. We look at the business very similarly. There's great customer focus I think on both sides from Ecolab and Nalco legacy. They focus on their field like we do. They drive innovation similarly. The talent is quite strong. So we believed it was. And I would say as we've been working together, we feel terrific about that. And  synergies, as we've already gone through, are quite real, and we've increased the cost. On differences -- and I don't know that these are necessarily surprises, but you never know exactly where these opportunities are going to be. I would say Ecolab has driven over the years, and we haven't had any ownership disruptions or anything else. We really developed I would say a very strong operating discipline and operating model, and we felt that was going to add value. Erik and his team agreed as we went through it in the fall, and I think that's really going to play out. So the fact that we go through these monthly reviews, we ask for a re-forecasting every month, we want to understand where the good news and bad news is on every business every month as we look out so people have the opportunity of time to get after things thoughtfully rather than just reacting day to day. And I think that type of discipline, and I think their team would echo this, is going to be positive. On the other side, they've got much better safety discipline, and so their safety metrics -- ours aren't bad, but theirs are outstanding. And so we also see great opportunity in leveraging their know-how in that area in particular, because that's not only going to be good for our team and for our people, but it's also going to be good for our P&L.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And then just kind of one directional thing on the raw material prices. Relative to your original guidance when you gave that out in mid-January, a little over a month ago, are raws are getting worse or about the same from your expectations?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, versus my hope, they're always worse. I'm looking for the crater in the economy to take off, but that hasn't yet happened. I would say they're probably modestly worse in some areas, raw materials. And I would say at the same time, currency is probably modestly better over the same period of time. So as we go through this, we anticipate that we're going to have surprises. If  I took you back to last year, we completely got raw materials wrong. And I would say we anticipated modest raw material increase in 2011, and we got modest times 4 or 5. And so we had to overcome that in a number of areas, and I think we did quite successfully. So I think we're looking at this year understanding that we might be -- we're going to be wrong on something. It might be,  again, raw materials. And I would say the team is all over driving pricing and making sure that we got safe outlets to offset any kind of raw material increases.","Operator","The next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn, Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Just a couple of questions if I may as a lot have been answered. I thought I heard in Mike's prepared comments that you expect a pretty meaningful margin expansion in the fourth quarter of 2012. First of all, is that correct? And secondly, what's going to be the driver of that?","Michael Monahan","Dmitry, there was no comment about fourth quarter 2012. We said that for example, Nalco's business is having a strong first quarter operating income performance. That was about as far as we went.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. I have to go back in the transcript, Mike, but I just had a jot in my notes that talked about 2012.","Michael Monahan","The other side, Dmitry, is if you look at that slide, the EPS bridge Doug referenced earlier, it's very clear that we do look for accelerating earnings growth as we go through the year and such that as you get to the second half, the growth will be much stronger than the first half.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","But -- so cost synergy is not up. Comp is getting better. Correct?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. No. So if we mentioned Q4 margin in 2012 increasing, that wasn't intentional. So I would say we expect margins to increase throughout the year. They will accelerate principally because some of the fixed cost that we alluded to earlier represent a smaller percent of the base as you go throughout the year, and you also have increasing benefits from synergies.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. So the purchase accounting impact of about $0.12 a quarter, it looks like, from the deal, is that going to be accounted in the individual reported business units? Or is that going to be all lumped into the corporate and other expense line? How do you see that being distributed amongst the P&L items?","Douglas M. Baker","We're going to put it in corporate other.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So it will all be just an increase in corporate and other. Okay, very good.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Otherwise, we have a feeling it's going to be too difficult to discern what's going on in the businesses year-on-year.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Absolutely. Agreed.  The -- you mentioned kind of your outlook on the raw material cost and the fact that, obviously, nobody's got a crystal ball when it comes to that. You have a multiyear pricing strategy to recover raw material spikes when they do occur. Is -- given that the economy is softening around the globe, and we kind of get into this part of the year, and people start pushing through pricing, and customers start pushing back on pricing, is the dynamic changing at all? Are customers sort of forgetting the fact that you're still trying to recapture the 2010, 2011 price increases in 2012? Or has that just been so well ingrained that it just goes through without issue?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I would say, Dmitry, all you can ever say about pricing is it's very hard to get. With that said, both the Nalco business throughout '11 ended up I think with 5% pricing in the fourth quarter. And for the year, it was north of 3%, but you can see that it accelerated throughout the year. And on the Ecolab side, not nearly as robust but 1% pricing for the year, 2% for the fourth quarter, so also accelerating. We mentioned -- I did in my opening comments that pricing-based net raw material cost for Ecolab in the fourth quarter, which is what we had forecast in our third quarter call. So we're at equilibrium right now at work [ph] on the Ecolab side. Nalco really crossed that path in the third quarter as they really saw the price hikes hit them fourth quarter of last year, so they hit earlier than they did on our businesses. So going forward, we're going to be as reasonably aggressive as we go out there, and you got to make trade-off calls as you go seek pricing with customers. I would say every business knows that raw materials remains a risk. It's unquantifiable, truth be known. So we got to get after it early and make sure that we offset it and learn from last year, where we ended up delivering our number, but we had to overcome a real surprise in raw materials, and we don't have the same fact hit it this year.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. Got it. Okay. And then just a couple of bookkeeping questions. I know you're going to be repurchasing about $1 billion worth of your shares in 2012. So I'm assuming that's where all the cash is going to go, and we should not model much of a debt reduction during the year.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, that's correct.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And what is your CapEx and tax expectations for 2012 for the combined companies?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. CapEx is $650 million, and tax is going to be right around 30%.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Harrison with First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Just wanted to come back to Europe a little bit. You commented that the Institutional business there was flat, but growth overall was 2%. I think of Institutional as being about half or maybe slightly more than that of the business. So was the remaining business up around 4%? And I guess how do you account for the discrepancy? Or maybe a little more detail on what's going on in the institutional side that it's growing at a significantly slower rate.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Well, Mike, I mean, I guess yes on the balance of the business is up roughly 4%. Healthcare led it with 5%. F&B was around 4%, et cetera, so stronger growth outside of Institutional. Institutional is a collection of businesses. There's no doubt as you go through it Institutional had more exposure in some of the southern countries that were hit hardest given the preponderance of hospitality in Italy and Spain. So they've got a little bit worse geographic mix than some of the other businesses. With that said, I think the Institutional team -- we had a new leader go in there at the beginning of last year -- has I think gotten a much clearer plan of attack of what they want to get after. And we're also seeing Institutional, we are going to be willing to sacrifice volume for margin in that business as we go forward, and what we're really interested in driving is profitable growth there. And if we've got business that does not make sense to us, i.e., it's not worth the squeeze, we are not going to be afraid to exit it, because we want to get that business righted and get the profit correct.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Did -- was there some intentional volume pruning that impacted this quarter? And if so, how much was that?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. There was a little bit, but not -- I wouldn't say that was the overarching story. I would say there was some up in the U.K. But by and large, I think what you see is a business that is somewhat depressed given its geographic mix, but we would expect better outcome this year going forward. And we will be very clear if we've got some pruning and what that impact is as we go forward. I can't lay the flat growth at the heels or at the feet of pruning yet.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Okay. And then on the Asia Pacific, even with the adjustments for Japan, it is showing kind of more moderate growth rates than we've come to expect there. Is there anything that's fundamentally changed in that region in terms of competition or other market dynamics that we can't see that business get back to the kind of high single-digit rates that we have seen in the past?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I'm -- if we're talking about Japan -- I mean, Japan was down 2% for the year. It obviously was impacted significantly by, right, the huge crisis it went through: tsunami, earthquake, et cetera. We will expect Japan, Korea, which we put together, to be low single-digit growth, which is what it was historically for us. China, our greater China had another very good year, plus 20% growth. But fourth quarter was not its strongest quarter, and we see that growth rebuilding as we move into '12. It was double digit but not nearly at the 20% rate.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And then last question. I was hoping you could explain again why the international side of Nalco -- was it just completely not included in your reported Q4 results and kind of how it's going to be reporting going forward, I guess?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. We basically work to get the Nalco international business lined up with the Ecolab international business. The Ecolab international businesses are on a -- not on a calendar fiscal but on a December-November fiscal. And so it's got a one-month lag, if you will, versus the north -- or the U.S. business, and so that's why it wasn't reported in that period. So you will have, in 2012, 12 months of both Nalco international, Nalco domestic, Ecolab domestic, Ecolab international.","Operator","The next question comes from David Ridley-Lane with Merrill Lynch.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. Pricing rounded up to 2% in the fourth quarter. Are we likely to -- given that the pricing momentum continues up, are we likely to see that go to 3% some time in 2012?","Douglas M. Baker","No, I don't think so. We may see -- I'd say that was a round up. And you may see a round down, but they're both going to be 2%. So we expect more pricing, but we don't think it's going to go tip into the 3%.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And you've talked a lot about the sort of timing and pacing of the cost synergies. Any thought on or any comments you can give on the revenue synergies? How much of that is going to happen in 2012? Are you going to sort of take a year just to get everything running well before targeting accounts for cross-selling? Or...","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Our commitment is a very conservative 0 impact in 2012. So we know that number is wrong. I mean, there will be something, but I think what we're trying to signal is that's going to take some time. I would say there has been very good work already laid out, literally plant by plant. We have identified every plant opportunity, because F&B and then Textile are going to be our first focus areas, every plant opportunity that Ecolab has, where the opportunity is for the WPS business, i.e. the Nalco business. So there's a lot of work done, but we really do believe that it's going to take some time. There will be certainly some impact this year, but we think the material impact is going to be '13, '14 and '15.","Operator","The next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Lucy Watson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Lucy Watson on for Laurence. What was your consolidated pro forma gross margin for Ecolab and Nalco in Q4? And I guess as a follow up, what is baked into your 2012 full year expectation for gross margin?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. On -- so we don't have a pro forma Q4 margin. For that -- we do on sales and all the rest. And I would only just say the Nalco business, we were changing the calendar years on the international business. We were going through the balance sheet stuff and everything else. You got a mix there. What we've been really focused on, on the Nalco business is the line between Q3 earnings and Q4 earnings -- or Q1 earnings, and that's what we're really focused on. And Q1 looks good, fine, in line of our sight expectations. So for the year, I guess the question was -- what number are you looking for? Gross margins for the combined business?","Lucy Watson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Douglas M. Baker","47%.","Michael Monahan","And Lucy, we expect to have pro formas out in the next few weeks. That would give you the 2011 margins, but those will be forthcoming.","Lucy Watson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And moving to the cash flow statement, what will be -- I guess will you be making any pension contributions? And what is the cash restructuring charge for 2012?","Douglas M. Baker","I'll do the pension. Mike can do the  restructuring. We're going to -- we've got a requirement of about $109 million globally for pension contributions. We may make north of that, but we haven't made that determination, dependent on do we think it's a smart use of cash. In terms of restructure expense, I think it was -- yes. The total restructure is $125 million for the year. That includes both Renaissance, which was announced last year and the Nalco merger.","Michael Monahan","And Renaissance is the Europe restructuring.","Lucy Watson - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And that's a cash number?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I did want to just check in on the balance sheet a little bit here. Clearly, lots of moves on the debt side of the capital structure here. Are those moves now done? And if so, can you also just remind us what the weighted average cost of debt is here?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. The weighted average cost of debt is 3.5%, which is a number that we gave last July, and it's where we netted out. By and large, yes, the debt is in place, and we don't plan on significant moves this year. There is also, as we mentioned earlier, no plan to have dramatic debt paid down this year, but we will -- in out years '13 and '14, as we move forward, we do expect our ratio, our EBITDA ratio to be down at about the 2.6% range by year end.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then just as it relates to M&A, Doug, it sounded like you didn't rule out the possibility of still looking at deals even though the capital structure is a little bit more elevated today. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing out there and maybe what some of your priorities are now post Nalco? Or is that Nalco related acquisitions, does that take a higher priority? Clearly, Healthcare always has been. Just a couple of thoughts that might be helpful.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. We -- in our cash modeling and plan, we have included some money for continued bolt-on acquisitions. I would say if you go through the priority order, certainly, with the addition of energy and WPS, those guys enter into the conversation in terms of priorities. But I would say, we will look at opportunities, but I would expect these to be more in keeping with our history pre-Nalco merger, i.e. attractive bolt-ons where we think we can really drive both accretion and great returns. And I'd say one of the great stories last year for legacy Ecolab was the 3 businesses that we bought at the very beginning of the year performed exceedingly well. I mean, we had we thought pretty challenging plans, and we crushed them. We had excellent results both on the top line and earnings from those acquisitions as we found more synergy opportunities throughout the year and frankly, had better growth than anticipated.","Operator","The next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just in terms of the longer-term revenue synergies, I want to follow up on that line of questioning. I would think that this is a lot more of what you guys were thinking about in terms of doing the Nalco merger. And given that the merger closed about 3 months ago, have you had a chance to kind of joint market the Ecolab-Nalco in the Food & Beverage area? And I want you to talk a little bit about the receptivity and how long it takes to go ahead and close the deals, what the sales cycles are like.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, great question. We have, in fact, made a number of joint calls at a number of our very large customers. And I guess reception is, as we anticipated, very positive. And so the minute the deal was announced, we had very favorable reaction from our customers, because they really understand the nexus of cleaning, food safety and water, in particular. So that's gone very well. I answered the other, where we've committed to 0 growth synergy contribution in 2012, and it's about as conservative a number as you can get. I mean, truth is we've already sold a couple. They weren't huge, but we've already had some successes. And I would say the team is probably further along in the planning than I would have anticipated last July simply because we had the time, in between before closing and after and we had early determination from Hart-Scott-Rodino, so we got on it quicker. So we've talked about $0.5 billion. We said it would take us to I think 2015 to realize that. I think the $0.5 billion is very real. And obviously, we hope to get to it quicker not later, and I would say early returns are positive.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So is -- are sales cycles in that side -- if you closed a few, are sales cycles shorter than 3 months? Or is it that you were able to start on them earlier? Or like what's preventing you from going ahead and just going through your base in a more widespread manner to accelerate those sales synergies?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I mean, typically, the sales cycle is anywhere from 6 months. It can go as long as 18 months. We just sold a big piece of business not related to this that I think we've been calling on for 12 years. So that would be the extreme case. So typically, 6 to 18 months in the industries that we're talking about. Why did we get a few of them? I mean, sometimes you're lucky. You walk in, it's the right time. Or you got an overwhelmingly  powerful relationship that accelerates the cycle, but that's not typical. And so it's going to take some time for these things to come through. I would say while we always gripe about how long the sales cycle is, this is also why our business is sticky. Once you're in there, you become very ingrained in the operations. You end up installing equipment that becomes really a critical part of our customers' operation, and so it takes a while to separate this type of business. And so it typically works on our advantage as we're the share leader. But when you're going after new business, you got to go through this type of process to prove your capabilities, prove that you're not going to have any issues before they give you the business, hence the light commitment year one.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just one last one. If you could just comment a little bit about the ability to take the 3D TRASAR technology into the other Ecolab products in your client base and what you're seeing initially on that.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. We love that technology. I would say we're all over it. The first priority is going to be in our Food & Beverage business, and we think there's great applications. Even before the merger, Nalco was working on 3D TRASAR for cleaning-in-place technology. Cleaning-in-place technology is really Ecolab F&B's kind of core technology. And so being able to, if you will, meld that work with work that was going on in the F&B side previously gives us a real leg up. So there's some exciting areas to get after. And F&B  is priority  #1, but we think 3D TRASAR will make a big difference.","Operator","The next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Doug, could you talk a little bit about how long do you think it will take to get the Nalco sales force and planning process rather in line with yours and therefore, eliminate any surprises, which has been one concern when you first announced the acquisition?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I think from a operating review standpoint, we've already been through a couple of months of reviews. And I think that's going to be steady progress, but it's going to take months, a couple of quarters as we go through it. That doesn't mean that we expect a bunch of surprises in the meantime, but certainly, you don't snap your fingers and have this kind of sense change. With that said, there's a couple of things. I think the Nalco businesses had very good control about what's going on in their business, great analytics, and a lot of what we're doing is really just kind of the forced discipline of sitting down routinely, asking questions going out a number of months. How do you play out these different scenarios? How does it look? How do you react to these? And all it really is set to do is to force the businesses to look out multiple quarters, while they're also obviously focusing at the quarter at hand. And so I think that doesn't take forever, but it certainly takes more than 2 meetings.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Sure. Then looking at your expectations in terms of the details that you gave us for the first quarter and going back at your expectations given in January, are you planning in getting to the levels you gave us in January by the end of the year? For example, the gross margin, you expect to be 46% in the first quarter, and you have 47% to 48%. And I understand that things are going to improve as you go along throughout the year. Do you think you can still reach those targets either on the gross margin and on the SG&A by the time you reach the  fourth quarter?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Rosemarie, the 47% net range that we gave in the January remains what we expect for the year. And I would say we always have lower margin in the first quarter, because it's the lowest volume quarter. We just don't have the same absorption that you do on the coming quarters.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Right. But do you still think you can reach that particular level for the year as a whole, which means that you will be substantially higher than the 47% to 48% in the last 2 quarters possibly?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Our highest margins would be anticipated in the -- by the end of the year.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","And the same question applies to SG&A? You can also, by the end of the year, get to the 32%  to 33%?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, that's our expectation. It has not changed from the January announcement. And SG&A will come down as synergies build throughout the year. They principally show up in SG&A.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Why is the interest expense higher than what you were anticipating? I mean in January, you had all of that data in hand.","Douglas M. Baker","Based on the share -- the interest rate difference is principally as a result of the share buyback.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And you are buying back fewer -- 2 million fewer shares than you were previously anticipating? Or are you still expecting the 295 million shares by the end of the year?","Douglas M. Baker","I think that, Rosemarie, on the share buyback announcement, which we made last fall, after we announced the merger in July, we talked about a $1 billion share buyback is I think how we articulated the scale. And we said that we would complete it by the end of 2012.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And then lastly, if I may. Could you give us your assumption at the -- for the first quarter? If you don't get above the low end of your assumptions at the $0.46 level, what do you think -- what are you expecting to go wrong which will prevent you from getting any higher than that?","Douglas M. Baker","You mean why do we have a range?","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","No, not whether you have a range, but what are the assumptions behind the low end of the range.","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I mean when you're in here, there's a lot of things that you're estimating: raw material prices, FX, right, distributor inventory volumes. They really are related to consumption patterns, et cetera. And so you've got all those factors going in, and certainly, we try to be clear and work hard to do what we say. So those are what I would call some of the external factors that can have an impact on the quarter that are not easily predictable in a short period of time but are more easily predictable over a longer period of time.","Operator","The next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is actually Brian Maguire on for Bob. Just wanted to dig in a little bit on your comment on Nalco earnings accelerating in the first quarter, and it sounds like they're showing some pretty solid year-over-year growth here. Can you kind of just talk about the component to that? Is it the sales actually accelerating? Or is it more the raw material cost and pressures coming off?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I think you've got a couple of things going on. We mentioned that pricing was accelerating throughout the year. So obviously, you had strong pricing in Q4, that extends into Q1. You had some raw material decline in price for them in Q4. Some of that shows up in Q1 as it moves throughout the system and -- but the most important component is growth. All right. We've had -- as you could see, they came into  the year with pretty strong sales momentum, and they're going against their lowest quarter in Q1 last year at the base.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. And it looked like pretty strong growth out of energy, continued growth there. So for 2012 as a whole, are you looking for Nalco sales to grow kind of like 1.5x legacy Ecolab sales growth?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, you got a mix -- I mean, they're going to be -- it's going to be a faster growth business principally because of energy, right? The energy business is -- as we just talked about in Q4, is growing at 20%. So I would say for the combined businesses, we expect to be in the mid to upper part of our 6% to 8% organic growth position for the year. That's where we ended the year, and we expect to realize that for the full year next year as well.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Got it. And just on Slide 11, the EPS walk is very helpful. And you can see pretty clearly, they're about a $0.50-per-share purchase accounting hit. So it looks like the cash EPS is maybe actually closer to $3.50. Looking out a little bit further beyond '12, I know it's hard to look into  '13. But just as -- how does that purchase accounting kind of roll off? Or would there be a big drop-off from '12 to '13 there such that you get some  EPS growth benefit there?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Well, I'm 53, and I don't expect to see us roll off. It'll take a long -- it takes quite a while, 8 years or so. So I mean 8 years to 12 years, when the different length of it. So it takes a while. So it's certainly not going to be a story in '13, '14.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Got it. And just one last one just on the European sales. Obviously, the macro, we understand, is weak but just curious if you've seen any kind of attrition or lost  sales opportunities because of the Renaissance work you're doing there. Any kind of decline in service levels from some of that restructuring?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. No. I'd say as we went through and talked about Renaissance, I think the riskiest part of our European restructuring is when we went through the EBS through SAP implementation, and that really went quite well. What we're doing here is really back office restructuring, i.e. where are we paying bills and where are we managing credit out of it and issuing invoices. Customers never care if you issue an invoice late as you long as you get the shipment there. So we haven't had really any problems, and so I would say the sales is not a result of Renaissance. I would say the sales, right now, we would expect it to be accelerating given the business we've put on. And unfortunately, I think the ground that we gained was a little bit washed away through some of the challenges in Europe. The good news is we expect to continue to have favorable top line growth, which is critical if we want to continue to see strong OI margin improvement.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In the purchase accounting adjustment of $0.48, that's about $142 million after tax. And so if what we did is we taxed that at 30%, the pretax number would be $202 million. So is there a different tax rate that's applied to the accounting adjustment? Is the accounting adjustment all amortization? Or is there something else in there that's meaningful?","Douglas M. Baker","Jeff, I would say I think when you have -- it's roughly 300 million shares. You may be using last year's share count, because it's $165 million. Right?","Michael Monahan","Jeff, you need to use the last year's share count of 240 million.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And what was your fully diluted share count as of the end of 2011, actual?","Michael Monahan","236 million is the actual shares.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I mean after you issued all of the Nalco shares, if you didn't take an average total but looked at it on a...","Michael Monahan","Yes. Let me get back to you on the actual. I don't have that number here. We've just got weighted average.","Operator","The next question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","Alina Khaykin ","This is actually Alina Khaykin sitting in for John. Just a quick question. What are your thoughts on the potential divestiture of the Paper segment now that you've owned Nalco for a while and kind of had time to look at the businesses?","Douglas M. Baker","Okay. Well, you're right. We have owned it for 90 days. I guess as we said, we were asked this question quite frequently post announcement. And at the time, we would say, \"Look, we love the water. We love the energy. That's why we really went after this merger.\" Paper is part of the package, and as kind of an add-on, it's pretty good. It makes money. It's got a great team, positioned quite attractively given the business and everything else. Our focus this year is really not immediately portfolio review by any stretch. It is getting on the business, making sure we integrate successfully, taking accounts that we make. We've got to capture the hearts of the Nalco folks and bring them on to the Ecolab team. So it's really an operating focus. And so any portfolio work we're going to do is probably going to be in our traditional fourth quarter, which is when we, every year, review our complete portfolio, preparing for a strategic review with the board. And so that's the focus. From now on, the only thing I'll be able to do when asked about this is the same comment I'd have on any other business or any other acquisition target, which is we just don't want to go speculate on it. We have had a history of we're not afraid to exit businesses that we don't think fit nor are we afraid to buy businesses that we think do fit. So I think we've been pretty good stewards, making sure that we got a robust portfolio, and I don't expect that to change as we go forward.","Operator","The next question, which is a follow-up, comes from Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just one question on -- trying to get my expectations to the right place -- on the segment margins for the Nalco businesses. They looked higher than I think what they would have been if you've been including the administrative cost and the other expense that the company used to support segments from the -- differently from the segment profit. Is that because this is only the U.S. business? And can you directionally give us any guidance on how we might think about the operating margins for those 3 segments looking as you're going to be reporting them?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. So one, I wouldn't pay much attention to the December number. It was a U.S.-only number. They have higher margins in the U.S. anyway. It's not indicative of the global margin. Probably that 4-week period is probably not indicative of anything to be honest. So I wouldn't go use that to try to forecast what's going on. What we anticipate is we think their margins, the WPS and energy margins as well as Institutional, F&B and others, will be enhanced by the synergy work we're doing, because the G&A overhead cost that these businesses are all going to have to carry is going to be lower as a percentage of sales. And so we know that automatically starts driving enhanced operating income margins. We will report operating income margins by business, including for Nalco, going forward, because we have worked to allocate cost in the fairest manner. You only know it's fair when everybody's upset, by the way. And so we have everybody upset now, so we've got the allocation perfectly tuned. But we think it's important to get these things allocated and make sure people understand what cost they're bearing and incurring as we go forward. So all that work's been done, and going forward, you'll see operating income. We will work to give you year-on-year comparisons and all the rest on this as well, all right, so that there's real transparency. And late-breaking news, Jeff. We do have our share count now for year end, which is 292 million. Now that's -- which is not diluted, but that's the count. We will get you diluted down the road.","Operator","The last question does come from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Actually, my question has been answered.","Michael Monahan","Okay. Well, if there's no more question, we want to thank everyone for their time today. We appreciate your participation.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Michael Monahan","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's third quarter conference call. We also want to extend a special welcome to those affected by Hurricane Sandy. Thanks for joining us, and we hope all of you are safe. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO. A copy of our earnings release and accompanying slides referenced in this teleconference are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor.","Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on Slide 2, stating this teleconference and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-Q under Item 1A, Risk Factors, and our third quarter earnings release and on Slide 2. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","In addition, as mentioned on Slide 2, this conference call does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities. Also, please note that in order to provide a meaningful comparison of our results of operations, where applicable, actual results for third quarter of 2012 are compared against pro forma results for the third quarter of 2011. The pro forma results are based on historical consolidated financial statements of Nalco and Ecolab, and we're prepared to illustrate the effects of our merger with Nalco. These pro forma statements are available on our website at ecolab.com\/investor, as well as our Form 8-K filed April 27, 2012, and selected portions are contained in our slides and press release.","Starting with an overview in Slide 3, we delivered strong results in the third quarter, reaching the top end of our earnings forecast range despite currency and continuing economic headwinds. We leveraged improved sales volume growth, pricing and our synergy and cost efficiency work to produce yet another strong double-digit increase in our adjusted earnings per share. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to outperform our markets and show strong double-digit earnings gains in the fourth quarter and for the full year as solid sales growth, appropriate pricing, innovation, synergies and margin leverage more than offset more moderate increases in delivered product costs, as well as the impact of higher depreciation, amortization charges from last year's Nalco merger. Further, we expect 2012 will be our 10th year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth in the last 11, and we will do so while setting up strong growth for the years ahead.","Moving to some highlights from the quarter and as discussed in our press release, reported earnings -- pardon me, reported third quarter earnings per share were $0.80. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, third quarter 2012 earnings per share increased 16% to $0.87. The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by volume and pricing gains, new products and new accounts, which along with synergies and cost savings actions, more than offset higher delivered product costs. We enjoyed strong gains in Global Energy, Latin America and our worldwide Kay, Healthcare and Pest Elimination operations. We continue to be aggressive, focusing on top line growth. We're emphasizing our innovative product and service strengths to help customers get better results and lower costs, and through these, drive new account acquisition across all of our customer segments.","We also continue to implement appropriate price increases to help offset higher delivered product costs and investments in our business. We remain focused on expanding our margins, emphasizing productivity and efficiency improvements, to help increase profitability, as well as drive merger synergies. We also continue to make investments in key growth businesses to sustain our technology and sales and service leadership positions. Our work to integrate Ecolab and Nalco is going very well, and we are delivering on or ahead of plan on our cost and growth synergy targets. Our agreement to acquire Champion Technologies, announced October 12, continues on plan for an expected close by year end. While economic trends present challenges, we continue to look for our fourth quarter to show strong sales growth and further margin improvement.","Fourth quarter adjusted EPS is expected to increase 24% to 30% to the $0.87 to $0.90 -- $0.91 range and compare with adjusted EPS of $0.70 earned by our legacy Ecolab in the fourth quarter 2011, as the addition of Nalco, business growth and the increasing benefits from synergies and cost reductions more than offset higher fixed depreciation and amortization and interest expense from the merger. This results in the full year 2012 adjusted earnings per share range of $2.96 to $3, representing a 17% to 18% increase compared to the adjusted $2.54 earned by legacy Ecolab last year. In summary, we expect 2012 to reflect another strong performance for Ecolab, as we deliver upper teens adjusted earnings growth and making the investments to yield strong results in the years ahead.","Slide 4 shows our third quarter results, both as reported and pro forma, with adjustments for special gains and charges, while Slide 5 shows our sales growth detail. Ecolab's reported consolidated sales for the third quarter increased 74%. When compared with third quarter 2011 pro forma sales, which include the impact of Nalco in both years, Ecolab's fixed currency sales was a strong 7%.","Looking at the pro forma growth components, volume and mix increased 4%. Pricing rose 2%, acquisitions and divestitures did not have a significant impact, and currency decreased sales by 5%, rounding accounts for the difference in the total. Reported sales for the U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing operations rose 1%. Adjusted for the transfer of water treatment-related businesses to the Global Water segment, U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing sales increased 4%. Institutional sales grew 3% in the third quarter. Sales initiatives, targeting new accounts and effective product and service programs continue to lead our results, outperforming mixed end markets. Third quarter sales were negatively impacted by the timing of some shipments to distributors. However, our total shipments, meaning our direct plus distributor shipments to our end-use customers, showed the same steady trends as in previous quarters, growing around 5%.","Looking at our end markets, lodging room demand continues to show modest growth, while foodservice foot traffic remained soft. To drive our growth and improve on our industry leadership, we are introducing more new products that deliver increased value and reduced labor, water and energy costs for customers in our warewashing, laundry and housekeeping markets. Programs we launched earlier this year, like our next-generation warewashing platform, called Apex2, have gained traction, and have been very favorably received by the marketplace. We also continue to increase our customer focus and service intimacy through sales force investments, simplified structures, marketing initiatives and improved field technology.","We expect Institutional to continue to show good end customer sales trends and market share gains. When combined with expected normalized distributor order patterns, we look for Institutional to deliver stronger growth in the fourth quarter. Kay's third quarter sales increased 11%. Quick service sales enjoyed strong growth from both large and small customers. Food retail business grew double digits, benefiting from several new customer additions. We look for good sales growth in the fourth quarter, led by continued double-digit food retail growth, resulting in another year of upper single-digit growth for Kay in 2012.","Healthcare sales increased 6%, as strong momentum in our patient temperature management business led results, benefiting in part as guidelines for patient management during surgical procedures gain greater acceptance. Healthcare's growth was also fueled by our innovative infection barrier solutions for leading medical equipment suppliers that help prevent infection transmission. These more than offset soft results in hand hygiene.","Looking ahead, fourth quarter sales are expected to show continued similar sales growth trends. We expect new products, which will be launched next year, will help drive further growth and offset the challenging Healthcare environment.","Food & Beverage sales grew 3%. Good gains in agri and food offset lower beverage and protein sales. Our market focus on improved customer penetration, along with our drive to provide total plant assurance, offering comprehensive plant-wide Cleaning & Sanitizing, water treatment, wastewater and Pest Elimination solutions, has enabled us to win new business. When combined with our innovative products and focus on lowering customer energy and water usage, we expect to see better sales trends in the fourth quarter and into next year.","Sales for U.S. Other Services rose 4% in the third quarter. Pest Elimination sales continue to show improved trends, rising 4%. Growth was led by stronger gains in food processing and Healthcare, improved results in the foodservice segments and robust growth in add-on service sales. We continue to drive new product and program solutions to better meet our customer needs and differentiate our offerings.","Recent new program launches, like the Expanded Large Fly Program and a new hotel protect program, with bedbug assurance offering, are showing good initial results. We expect our new products and programs, along with aggressive selling and improved service levels, to yield continued good sales gains in 2012.","Sales for GCS increased 3% in the quarter. New account wins and appropriate pricing helped to drive strong growth in service revenues, which were partially offset by soft parts sales, resulting from a system change. We continue to see good results from chain account relationships, as we drive sales through the regional and franchise organizations. We expect GCS to show improved results in the fourth quarter, as we expect continued good service trends and improved part sales to benefit results.","Measuring fixed currency, sales for international Cleaning & Sanitizing and Other Services increased 3%. Adjusted for the transfer of water treatment to the Global Water segment, fixed currency sales increased 5%.","Europe, Middle East and Africa fixed currency sales rose 3% in the third quarter. Europe's Institutional third quarter sales were off slightly versus last year. New business gains among regional and local customers leveraged new products, but were offset by continuing weak demand in the south. Food & Beverage sales rose modestly over the last year, reflecting market share gains, a focus on corporate accounts and an emphasis on the cost savings benefits of our innovative products. These worked to offset slower customer volumes.","Next, Healthcare [ph] sales were flat in the third quarter. New products and technology, like lower temperature washing, offset soft market conditions. Healthcare sales in Europe were strong on both a reported and organic basis, as new account gains and new products bolster the impact from our Esoform acquisition to drive sales.","Pest Europe sales showed good growth due to a continued focus on corporate accounts, new programs and the continued operational improvements. Our work to improve operating efficiency in our Europe business continues to show good progress. We are further leveraging our shared services facility, transferring more work to the location, which is in Eastern Europe. We also continue to consolidate facilities and improve procurement savings. We are on track to deliver more than 200 basis points of structural margin improvement in 2012, though the weak economic environment and raw material increases in Europe will offset about half those gains at operating income. We continue to expect to improve operating margins to the low teens in Europe over the coming years, though the current economic challenges faced by Europe is slowing the pace of our progress. Looking ahead, we expect Europe's fourth quarter to show flat fixed currency sales, with good profit improvement, as it outperforms the weak European business environment.","Asia-Pacific sales grew 4% in fixed currencies on a pro forma basis. Better growth in emerging markets and improved China results helped to offset slower mature markets. Institutional sales increased, benefiting from new programs, as well as a focus on restaurant and lodging expansion in the emerging Asian markets.","Food & Beverage sales also realized good organic growth. New account gains and better results in Australia and China led the increase. We remain cautious regarding the strength of the expected economic recovery in Asia. However, we expect our fourth quarter Asia-Pacific sales to show good growth in this environment, as new product sales and new business in emerging markets improve from the slowdown earlier this year.","Third quarter sales for Ecolab's Canadian operations increased 6% at fixed currency rates. Strong growth in core businesses drove the solid results. Latin America reported strong fixed currency sales gains, up 16%. Adjusted for the Brazil Pest and Institutional acquisitions, Latin America grew 11% in fixed currencies, as Institutional, Food & Beverage and Pest Elimination continue to grow at double-digit rates despite some slowing in Latin America markets.","Fixed currency Global Water sales increased 5% in the third quarter compared with 2011 pro forma results. Good growth in Food & Beverage, power, Primary Metals and mining were offset by lower sales in wastewater. Regionally, we saw strong growth in North America, with moderate gains in Latin America and Asia. Sales were flat in Europe, reflecting the continued weak economic conditions in that region. We expect Global Water sales growth to ease in the fourth quarter, as gains in other regions are offset by soft trends in Europe, and a comparison to strong mining sales in the year-ago period. Third quarter 2012 fixed currency global sales for Paper declined 4%, primarily reflecting the strategic elimination of certain low-margin business. Adjusting for those eliminations, sales would have been flat versus the strong period last year. Modest growth in Latin America and Europe, led by the use of innovative technology, was offset by lower customer plant utilization rates in North America and Asia-Pacific. We expect fourth quarter Paper sales will also be about flat as the paper market stabilizes.","Measured in fixed currencies, pro forma Global Energy sales grew an outstanding 20%. Excluding the impact of one-time sales, Global Energy rose 15%. The quarter reflected continued strong volume growth in upstream and market share gains in downstream. Strong double-digit growth in our upstream business was a result of healthy market conditions, share gains and a continued focus on higher growth energy sources. We saw strong growth in deepwater and shale accounts, continued momentum in oil sands, as well as strong activity in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Downstream growth reflected share gains in Asia, Middle East and in Latin America. We expect Energy segment growth to remain strong in the fourth quarter, driven by shale, continued strength in the deepwater and oil sands business and good growth in downstream.","Slide 6 of our presentation shows selected income statement items, comparing reported 2012 with pro forma 2011 information to allow more meaningful comparisons. Reported third quarter gross margins were 46.5%. Adjusted for the impact of special charges, 2012 adjusted gross margins were 46.6%. But compared with third quarter 2011 adjusted pro forma results, 2012 gross margins increased 50 basis points. The adjusted gross margin improvement primarily reflected the benefits of the volume pricing gains, which more than offset exchange and business impact of higher energy sales.","We also expect fourth quarter gross margins to increase versus last year. Reported SG&A expenses represent 32.3% of third quarter sales. When compared with 2011 pro forma results, 2012 SG&A expenses declined 100 basis points. Leverage from the sales gains and cost savings efforts, including merger synergies and Europe restructuring savings, led the improvement.","Reported operating income for Ecolab's U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing segment rose 17%. Adjusted for the transfer of water treatment to the Global Water segment, operating income increased 14%, with margins up 210 basis points when compared with third quarter 2011 pro forma operating income. Volume and pricing gains and cost innovation led the increase.","Operating income for U.S. Other Services increased 3%, benefiting from sales leverage, which partially offset field sales investments. International fixed currency operating income increased 12% versus last year. Adjusted for the transfer of water treatment business to the Global Water segment, operating income increased 14%, with EMEA operating income up 12%.","International margins improved 90 basis points, as pricing and volume gains and our Europe margin transformation efforts more than offset higher delivered product costs. Global Water operating income grew 25% in fixed currencies compared to pro forma results. Margins expanded 210 basis points, as pricing and volume gains led the increase. Global Paper operating income increased 16% in fixed currencies due to pricing, the elimination of low-margin business and comparison to last year, which included the impact of a customer bankruptcy on bad debt expense. Adjusted for that charge, Paper's operating income rose 5%.","Global Energy operating income grew 29% in fixed currencies. Margins expanded 120 basis points, led by the strong volume gain, operating leverage and pricing, which more than offset delivered product costs and investments in the business. Corporate segment and tax rate are discussed in the press release. Consistent with our comments on the second quarter conference call, we did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter. But note this [ph] performance is that Ecolab reported third quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.80 compared with $0.65 reported a year ago. When adjusted for special gains and charges and discrete tax items in both years, adjusted earnings increased 16% to $0.87 when compared with $0.75 earned a year ago.","Turning to Slide 7. Ecolab's balance sheet reflected the impact of the Nalco merger. Total debt to total capital was 50% at September 30 compared with 30% reported a year ago. Our net debt to total capital is 49%.","Looking ahead, and as outlined in Slide 8, we continue to take aggressive actions to drive both our top and bottom lines, expanding our market share and our customer penetration among major accounts, leveraging our leadership positions in key growth markets in food, water, energy and Healthcare. We are using innovation and pricing to benefit margins, and expect to show a margin expansion again in the fourth quarter.","Development of our merger synergies, along with Europe's transformation work, continues to go well and meet or exceed expectations, and we expect to deliver on these aggressive goals, while building growth for the future. As also described in our press release, we look for the fourth quarter results to show mid single-digit pro forma sales gains, again, led by our Global Energy, Latin America and worldwide Kay, Healthcare and Pest Elimination operations. This solid business performance will again be impacted by much higher depreciation, amortization and interest expense, as well as increased share count from our merger.","We also expect Congress will again pass the R&D tax credit before year end, which we expect will benefit fourth quarter EPS by approximately $0.01 per share. As a result, we expect adjusted fourth quarter diluted earnings per share to increase 24% to 30% to the $0.87 to $0.91 range, compared with the adjusted earnings per share of $0.70 earned last year. This results in our 2012 full year adjusted EPS range narrowing to the $2.96 to $3 range, and representing a very strong 17% to 18% increase.","As an update regarding our pending Champion acquisition, we are making the required antitrust filings in the relevant countries. Respecting the procedures of the various antitrust agencies, we will not specifically comment here or in the Q&A on the status of them, other than to say we expect to receive the required clearances in a timely manner to enable the close within the fourth quarter. We continue to expect the Champion acquisition will help us build a stronger energy business and a stronger Ecolab, with better growth opportunities to achieve continued, consistent, predictable and above-average growth.","In summary, we once again delivered on our forecast in the third quarter, while offsetting higher delivered product costs and the weakening economy, while still investing in our future. We look for sales and profit growth to accelerate through 2012 second half to produce another strong year and make it our 10th year of adjusted double-digit EPS growth in the last 11.","That concludes our formal remarks. Operator, please begin the question-and-answer period.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nate Brochmann of William Blair & Company.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Wanted to talk a little bit about kind of the strategic positioning over in Europe for both legacy Ecolab, as well as kind of with the new Nalco business in terms of -- obviously, you have the slower overlying economic growth there, but what are you doing strategically, if anything, kind of different to position yourself in terms of relative to the competition over there to continue to win some share?","Douglas M. Baker","Nate, this is Doug. I would say most of the fundamentals that we've been driving are still quite appropriate, even given the European situation. I would say, obviously, in terms of investments, we're trying to make sure that investments are being pointed towards, let's say, geography within Europe that we have more confidence in over the near or midterm. So that would certainly be Central Europe, still, East Europe and even Russia as we go forward, but we are being pretty judicious about what we do around the southern ring: Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal. But at the end of the day in terms of what we sell, how we sell it, we think the economic pressure typically make our programs even more valuable because you know the trade. We typically try to put together programs that may cost more, but are lower in use cost, and I would say that's typically been a positioning that works well in Europe, is they'll invest often in better technology if they believe there's a pay off. So we don't want to take our eye off the ball there. We've been having good success in terms of new business in spite of a very difficult economy. It's one of the reasons our nose is still above water in terms of sales.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up to that, have you seen any pricing pressure or any competitive issues that are a little bit unusual over there with somewhat other pressure on the overall sales?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I haven't seen anything specific to Europe, no. I would say we've been able to get price this year. It's really the primary driver in our sales growth year-over-year in legacy Ecolab, and there's always price pressure. We continue to see it, but I wouldn't say there's anything unique in Europe that's a standout versus what we've seen in other geographies.","Operator","The next question comes from John McNulty of Credit Suisse.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Abhi Rajendran, calling in for John. A couple of quick questions. One of your competitors just announced a sale of their Japanese business and your Asian results definitely reflected some of the broader regional slowdown. I think you mentioned you expect a pickup in that business starting in the fourth quarter. Could you maybe touch on the broader environment there, and if you see a potential return to double digit sort of growth next year?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. So our Asian business, when we talk about Asia-Pacific, the 3 large businesses are, call it, Greater China, Japan and Australia, New Zealand are the businesses that, if you will, dominate by just virtue of size, that part of the region or world for us. So China, I would say in total, and I can give you a -- break it out by legacy Ecolab, legacy Nalco, if you'd like. China, I think we are -- have seen the bottom and expect to see acceleration across the business, fourth quarter, first quarter, second quarter. When do you start getting at double digits, probably first quarter next year in total, maybe second across the portfolio. We think the legacy Ecolab business will probably accelerate, come out of it faster, simply by nature of the type of businesses, and we would probably expect to even see double-digit growth there, fourth quarter of this year. In terms of Japan, Japan is slow single-digit growth for us. That's not a new story. It's probably what we expect to see there. We still are driving margin. It's a valuable business to us, but not probably a market that we would make a significant investment in. And then you have Australia, New Zealand, slower growth market. We've got a very nice business there. We've got plenty of room to drive increased profitability, which is what we're going to focus on in the near term. So it will be accretive for us, but we don't expect big, big growth out of that market. And then the balance of Asia, right, is by and large, going to be -- we expect to be double-digit-plus growth on a going basis. It's just subscale right now and reaching scale, so it doesn't have the impact, I mean, with the region or overall Ecolab that it will, going forward, as it grows.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And just a quick follow-up. Could you maybe touch on some of the early new synergy you're seeing between your legacy business and Nalco? And how we should be thinking about this ramp up, and also maybe how the addition of Champion could kind of shift this trajectory.","Douglas M. Baker","Well, the synergies we've talked about regarding the Nalco Ecolab merger were 2 basic buckets. There's cost. Basically, the cost has been, first, corporate; second, G&A overlap and then quite a bit of purchasing year one. So we've talked about that migrating broader into the product supply chain as we get into years 2 and 3 of the merger. So you're going to see that impact across the business portfolio, as the purchasing synergies show up in businesses based on raw material, and you'll see it in G&A across the businesses too because, basically, it's the shared infrastructure, where most of the synergies are realized. The other bucket was sales and synergies growth. We committed $0.5 billion in growth synergies by 2016. I would say we're having very solid early traction there. We've had it in all regions, but predominantly in U.S.-based businesses early, but we expect that to broaden as we move forward. So we're happy with the start there. We feel that $0.5 billion is the right projection for what we're going to realize, ultimately, as we develop that. Champion, we don't expect Champion to have any, what I would say, unintended consequences or effects on our Nalco synergies at all. We believe the $150 million in cost synergies we've talked about with Champion are completely additive to the $250 million of cost synergies that we talked about with Nalco. In addition, there may be additional tax synergies there, but that needs to be played out over time. And we get asked about growth synergies, I would say we need to understand the business more, but you're putting together 2 very attractive high-growth businesses together. We expect the combination to continue to be high-growth.","Operator","The next question comes from Gary Bisbee of Barclays Capital.","Theresa Chen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is Theresa Chen, calling on behalf of Gary. First, would you mind just giving us some color on what's causing the deceleration growth in the U.S. Cleaning & Sanitation segment? Does it have to do with just more broad-based uncertainty or is there anything specific?","Douglas M. Baker","I would say as we look at the -- you've got to break it out in components. If you take Institutional, the underlying trends continue to be healthy, albeit Q3 was a bit slower than Q2 if we look at the metric we've talked about previously, which is field sales, but it's still in, right, mid-single-digit growth, around 5% growth range. The Food & Beverage business remains healthy. The poly group, more in the 3% range. However, we expect that, over time, to reaccelerate as we continue to drive new business. So I don't -- we don't believe that Q3 is any huge signal one way or another. We expect to have a stronger Q4 for a number of factors. Some of them are just -- it's really timing quarter-to-quarter factors like days and other things, but those things all wash out in the end. So really, I think we feel like we're in good shape there, but we will continue to focus on driving new business.","Theresa Chen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. Also, just how sustainable is the recent strong growth in Latin America? I mean, it's been doing great. Can you just give us an idea what are the drivers of growth in terms of product penetration, share gains, and such?","Douglas M. Baker","Much of it is -- look, there's a couple of things in that number. One is there's an -- there's couple of acquisitions that are impacting the reported number positively. But even below that, you're still in the teens, and that is where we have the single largest pricing impact, as you might expect, given inflationary environments there. Still, we would have upper single-digit volume growth in Latin America. We would expect that to continue. We've been very successful driving share in Latin America, new business. And I would say we are still very early in the product penetration story in Latin America as well. So we would expect the story in Latin America to continue to be a very solid story moving certainly throughout 2013.","Operator","The next question comes from David Ridley-Lane with Merrill Lynch.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. So SG&A was about 32.3% of revenue in the third quarter, and the fourth quarter guidance was for approximately 32%. I know there's more Nalco synergies and more European cost savings to come, but are we reaching a point where the SG&A investments in field headcount, for example, are going to mostly offset the SG&A cost savings that are ahead of us?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I think, yes, and we even included that number, the 2% increase in field selling over this year. We have more field sales people now than we did pro forma at the end of last year. We will continue to make those investments. So I think we're going to realize $75 million of the overall synergy savings this year, of the $250 million. So there's still a number of savings that are going to continue to drive down SG&A in spite of the need to continue to add headcount. So no, I don't think the story's over.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. That's good to hear. And then second question, if U.S. restaurant foot traffic trends rebounded to 1% to 2% growth or whatever you think a more normalized rate is, what would you -- I mean, what kind of level of growth would you expect out of the U.S. Institutional business?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I think if you got it more normalized, I'd say you'd start playing in the maybe bottom to middle of our 6% to 8% organic growth range that we like to talk about.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So -- and would you describe the foot traffic trends as really being the major holdback for that division?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I'd say it's certainly, no doubt, been downward pressure. It's been going on for a number of years. I think, cumulatively, I think, foot traffic is now down 13% over a 4-year period, which is a pretty substantial number. In spite of that, we've grown during this period. But yes, absolutely. If you can reverse that trend, you're certainly going to see improvement on the top line. I'd say the team, I think, has done a very good job driving share in a tough environment. They've continued to drive margin through new innovation, sales productivity tools that we've launched and other technology. So it's a business, we think, with very good momentum in a number of areas, but yes, we would prefer a better market.","Operator","The next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Just wanted to follow-up on the comment that you guys made about the improvement in the Europe and the 200 basis points that you're realizing there being offset by higher raw material costs. Can you talk about what the raw material environment is going to be like in the fourth quarter and what your expectations there are for 2013? One of the things that you mentioned as sort of a longer-term synergy from the Nalco deal is sort of borrowing on Nalco's ability or leveraging Nalco's ability to get pricing a little bit faster in what is still a service-oriented market. Is that something that's going to help you with your profit improvement in Europe in 2013?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, so it's Doug. First of all, the raw material environment, I mean, it's stabilized in Europe, but what we're dealing with is we had a big run-up late last year, early this year, very late last year. And so for fourth quarter, we're starting to see moderation simply because we're running into the base of higher raw materials as we go through. We do not expect a highly inflationary environment in Europe from a raw material standpoint next year, more broadly, I would say, is our early read on this situation. So I think as we continue to have success with our renaissance initiatives, as pricing starts catching up to the raw material increases that we've already had to take, that you will continue to see, both in fourth quarter and continuing through 2013, increased margins in Europe. Now it's, of course, predicated on the same lousy situation we see in Europe today, not a dramatically worse situation nor a dramatically better situation, which is our forecast right now for Europe, kind of muddle along, don't expect significant upside from an economic turnaround, but don't expect a meltdown either.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Is pricing easier to get in Europe or more difficult to get than North America? Or is it about the same?","Douglas M. Baker","We know the word \"no\" in about 62 languages. I would say, I don't know. It's not easy to get anywhere, is probably the best answer. With that said, we saw about 2% pricing in Europe in Q3, which is not bad in total. That's over the legacy Ecolab business where we have measures and we break it out. And so, we're realizing some gains there. With that said, I'd just say the pricing environment is difficult overall. We don't expect next year's -- we've talked about this before. We -- 1% is kind of our normalized pricing and if you're not in a inflationary environment, we think we'll be trending back down towards that number as we move forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Yang with Oppenheimer.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","On the U.S. Institutional business, Cleaning & Sanitizing, you saw some strong margin improvement there, and it's a record margin level. How did you do that, and is that sustainable?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I'd say there's a couple of things driving it, and we work to drive sustainable benefits, otherwise the business turns into a yo-yo. So the 2 big areas, we've been driving new technology, which is driving improved gross profit margins, and that's been a steady drive for a number of years, and we continue to have success there. Our technology's promise, which is significant reductions in water and energy, continues to resonate even in tough environments, maybe because of the tough environment. And we also have been leveraging sales productivity tools, particularly technology that we've been rolling out to the field, so we continue to see productivity gains. At the same time, it's that -- been a 2 front push that's working successfully in Institutional, and we'll continue to drive it. What we've got to make sure is that we continue to have an offering for our customers that benefits them and makes sense economically for them. And right now, I'd say we think we score well there, and we want to make sure we continue to as we go forward.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I think Mike mentioned some distributor shifts. I think you've seen that periodically in the past. Was that just a broad de-stocking and customers managing inventory, or did you have any change in incentives?","Douglas M. Baker","No. No big change in incentives. I would say the distributor community is very prone to driving down inventory, and they're doing it and probably as aggressively as they can. I expected -- I think we expected that there would probably be moderation on distributor inventory in Q3. We didn't see it the way that we expected. This is not big numbers in total Ecolab, but it is when you talk about maybe a specific business in a specific quarter. But ultimately, I don't think that's going to be the overall story for either our company or Institutional. That, sooner or later, they've got to buy what they consume or what moves out, and those numbers always end up catching up. We look at this thing over long views. We've been tracking this over a long period of time and go through periods of dislocation, but sooner or later, it catches up.","Edward H. Yang - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Sure. And just on Global Paper. Are you done with all the -- I mean, you had some margin improvement [ph] there. You mentioned getting rid of some nonprofitable businesses. Is that margin basically the level we should see going forward? Do you have any other levers to pull to expand margins there?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I would say, my belief is I think the Paper team has done a very good job in a pretty difficult environment. And so, there's quite not a lot of tailwind for that business, and actually, in that industry, they've done, I think, very smart things in terms of managing their customer base. We had some [ph] business which didn't make any sense and we didn't think was promising, long-term, in terms of ever getting to a gross profit that was going to make sense for us. And I think the business did the right thing exiting it in a way that still worked for the customer, but is the right thing for the company overall. So that put downward pressure on sales was -- if you take that out, sales would have been flat, all right? So that's not -- still not a great story, and -- but they're also, I think, successfully driving price where they can and managing through raw material changes. I would expect that we will continue to hold that margin. Hopefully, they will have other tools to continue to drive margin up. We want to get that margin up. We believe it's there. And the priority is probably a little more balance on margin right now than growth and then maybe a little shift in priority for that business.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Ritzenthaler of Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","You had, in the past, thought of 4Q as $0.06 to $0.07 higher than 3Q, mainly driven by a full quarter of synergy and restructuring savings and a little bit by the R&D tax credit. With the guidance this morning, I guess, is it safe to make the assumption that the performance of the end markets and the underlying businesses, as opposed to any of the other assumptions on the restructuring savings side?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, no. I think what we did with our range was tighten both sides of it. I don't think there's a fundamental shift in the middle of our range when you look at Q4. So we don't have a big difference in our view now versus when we had the annual range out. With that said, what shifted here, Mike, in my mind, is historically, Ecolab pre-Nalco, Q4 was typically a slower sales quarter -- lower sales quarter seasonally than Q3. Now, it's about equal to Q3. I mean, almost the same sales level in total, because basically, Energy's big quarters are Q4 and Q1, and so, this neutralizes the natural seasonality impact you had historically seen in Institutional and others as we went through the winter months. So now, we've got a fairly consistent pattern in the second half. We still are forecasting higher, if you will, higher EPS in the fourth quarter than in the third. And it's driven, part by FX, but mostly, it's driven by synergies in renaissance which continue to build throughout the year. You have the tax that we talked about, which is $0.01, right? Which is really the R&D tax credit going forward? And you've got some catch up, if you will, on pricing and raw materials as well. But principally, it's the synergy numbers that are driving the outperformance year-on-year as they build this year.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then on Latin America, just a follow-up to a previous question. Is there appreciable margin difference between growth in Latin America, growth in other places? And then if I could sneak in one last one, is a little bit more on the rationale of the Vehicle Care sales is up.","Douglas M. Baker","So first, Latin America. Latin America's GP is very consistent. We're pushing it versus the rest of the -- rest of our businesses or the businesses, the like businesses in other geographies. The OI margin has been growing and been catching up, if you will, to Ecolab average. And fundamentally, I think our story on LA and EP has always been, if the gross profit is there to drive the kinds of OI margins we see in the balance of the world, it's really been a volume story. When does volume cover overheads, and the overheads were built because we are covering business in 160 countries. So we've had improvements this year in OI in Latin Americas. We continue to build volume. We expect that story to continue moving forward. So it is not dilutive, long term, on margin, by any stretch. It will be, we think, ultimately accretive. Vehicle Care.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And then -- yes, and then on Vehicle Care, if you wouldn't mind commenting on that, too.","Douglas M. Baker","I mean, at the end of the day, Vehicle Care is a very good business, but it doesn't match our strategic focus on clean waters, safe food, abundant energy, healthy environments. I mean it should [ph] a bit of a match. The model was quite similar, you would say, but at the end of the day, the technology we're building there doesn't really have any leverage across the business. That's not true in water. That's not true in F&B. That's not true in Institutional, and not true in Energy. That technology is leverageable across the portfolio. And so, it's just a question of where do we want to spend our priorities, and at the end of the day, we felt that Vehicle Care would be probably better off owned by somebody else who was going to be more intent on driving growth and investing in the business.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. I just wanted to start with an easy one first. I think last quarter you guys talked about $20 million, $25 million of kind of realized cost synergies on the way to $75 million. Does that mean that, as of the end of the third quarter, you're in about the $50 million run rate?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I think...","Michael Monahan","Andy, we said $21 million in the second quarter, it's about the same in the third. So we think we're still on target for the $75 million achieved in 2012.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, we expect -- these are net synergies, right? With their -- minus PMO costs and some other costs, project management office costs. So we would expect that number to be greater, per our earlier discussion in Q4. And on a run rate basis, depends on how you want to handle -- the PMO costs, ultimately, go away as we drive through this. So we'll enter on a run rate well north of $100 million at the end of the year.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just on the Energy one-time sales, by my math, it was about $24 million in the quarter of what you called one-time sales. Are those the type of one-time sales that are just lumpy, but they're somewhat recurring, or should we view that 15% underlying rate as maybe a better way to think about the potential growth rate in the next couple of quarters at least?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, it's a little low. Yes, yes. I would say yes, those sales are lumpy. They aren't one-time, like one-time and never again. They happen episodically. We want to call them out because we do want to have some -- so that you can see what the underlying business is doing. We will have sales of core exit influx or begin in the future, and we'll likely tell you when we do because they are -- they intend to come in big lumps in kind of different timing. The underlying growth rate of -- I think, is consistent with what we said to expect earlier in the year this year. So we said mid- to high-teens kind of growth rate, and I think that's what you should expect.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. And can you just talk a little bit about -- it seems like Nalco's Water, as well as the Energy businesses seem to be driving top line above peer levels. I guess, maybe just a little bit of color from your perspective about some of the competitive dynamics there. Is it your secret sauce of your product and service offering? Is it your end market exposures that maybe are allowing you to have more attractive growth rates? I guess just your view about Nalco's, what seems like outperformance, would be helpful.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. So on the Water and Paper, I guess I'll probably stick to what we think's working in our business. So I would say couple of things. One, we've got, we think, technological advantage with 3D TRASAR. We have now installed our 20,000th installation, or seen that installed. So we've had continued very good success there. We are working on derivative technology advances around this platform, which will be forthcoming and we think, continue the push that we have in this area. Second, I think there's a clear focus. The team had it. I think we are encouraging it around new business activity as we drive the capability. And finally, we've got better reach in terms of service capability. So it's a story that I would say is very similar to stories I could tell you in F&B or in Institutional or others, where I would say we also have outperformance versus our competitive peers. And typically it comes down to technology, focus on sales and focus on service capabilities, and I think we have advantage in all those areas.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Good. If I could ask just one final quick one here. On the Champion call, I don't think it came out what restructuring charges would be for that kind of multiyear plan. I was just wondering if you had a view that you could share with us as we look at our models over the next couple of years, how much and the timing of that.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, well, the bulk of it's going to occur in year 1. So in year 1, there's going to be, if you will, underneath $97 million -- just under $100 million of restructuring. About $60 million is going to be cash, and the balance of it's going to be step-up in inventory, noncash.","Michael Monahan","So again, Andy, we'll be finalizing those numbers. So those are approximations at this point.","Douglas M. Baker","That's year 1.","Operator","The next question comes from John Roberts with Buckingham Research.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Doug, you've got a change in the executive suite major competitor and you've been able to pick up share in the past when that competitor shifted strategies. So any thought on whether this is an opportunity to step on the accelerator again or maybe you've got your hands full already with Nalco, Champion and your European restructuring.","Douglas M. Baker","No, I would say we rarely take our foot off the gas on going after new business and typically, particularly in, I'd say, the F&B world and Institutional world, which is, I think, the world you're talking about here. New business isn't coming from new builds, it's coming from existing customers, which means you've got to take it from competition. And that's the world that we've lived in for quite a while, and I'd say we have not taken our foot off the gas there, if anything we're pressing harder. I don't think it has anything to do with any change in leadership or not. It's simply how we grow the business. So I would say my expectation is we continue to do what we've been doing. We continue to gain from all major competitors. And we're going to plan to do that Q4, Q1, Q2, Q3, you get the rhythm.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then currency was, I think you said negative 4% headwind in the quarter. Could it be half that much of a headwind in the fourth quarter?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. It's going to be flattish in the fourth quarter year-on-year because the movement was last year at about that time.","Operator","The next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I snuck one in. Just curious about what you're seeing in terms of the Apex rollout through Europe. And then secondly, on -- in the Energy business, we've seen a roll over the rig count book globally and in the North America, and I'm wondering has that affected the industry at all? Or have you just maybe offset it from market share or other reasons?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. First of all, the pure play on Apex Europe hasn't rolled yet, so we've got a test going over there, but we have not expanded it across Europe. So I would say that benefit is yet to come. We've got different formulation issues. We want to make sure we've got this thing right before we go. So that's in front of us, not behind us. My expectations are that Apex will be very well-received in that market because the story is very consistent with what customers have been asking us for in Europe forever, right? It's got environmental benefits. It's got cost benefits. There's all sorts of safety benefits, so we think that's spot on for the European market. In terms of rig count, we're in -- we would have to [ph] add more rigs overtime. But at the end of the day, we're in the production phase of this business. We continue to gain share, and are doing the right thing in terms of securing new business, but we expect our business to continue to grow.","Operator","Next question comes from Mike Harrison of First Analysis.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Just looking at the Kay business, we've seen kind of 2 consecutive quarters here now of double-digit growth. I think it's the first time in a little while that you guys have strung 2 together like that. Just curious kind of what you're seeing in terms of kind of core traffic or trends in the QSR business that, obviously, you continue to make nice progress on the Food retail side. But can you maybe just talk about Kay and whether anything has changed there, either from a market standpoint or something that you're doing different?","Douglas M. Baker","No. I mean, the Kay business has always been a business driven by success with new customers. And it's a very steady business. Once you secure the customer, I would say it's less impacted by things like customer count than, say, its brother in Institutional, simply because you don't have the warewashing component of this. The real impact is we've had a lot of new business success in Kay, particularly on the Food retail side, but also on the Quick service side. And that's really what you're seeing come through in the Kay numbers. So it's good news.","Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And then, just another question about Europe. I think of legacy Ecolab and legacy Nalco as sort of having had similar problems historically in Europe in terms of pricing, in terms of difficulty gaining new accounts. Obviously, at Ecolab, you've made the changes on the IT side. But can you talk about maybe what kind of progress you're seeing at the salesperson level in terms of training and in terms of greater ability to push pricing and gain new accounts, and maybe are you guys learning anything from each other as you integrate the Nalco and Ecolab sales teams?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, one, I would say we are not really integrating the sales teams per se, because we plan to continue to run the water business as a distinct business much like we ran our water business distinct from F&B and textile, et cetera. With that said, there are learnings. I would say 2 things. I think we have continued to improve on the legacy Ecolab business in Europe in terms of driving sales performance, in terms of getting price. We just talked about we got 2% price in, arguably, a pretty tough economic situation over there. We continue to also drive share. Volume is flat to up, and you know that the European situation is lower volume, not higher volume overall in almost every market you look at. So we're clearly commanding share and having good success in new business. I would say sales productivity in Europe is up 5% to 6%. Part is we leverage the new technology, do the right things on training. So I think there is sustainable performance benefits that you've seen driven as a result of renaissance and the other focus. So we expect those things to hold and frankly, accelerate, as we move forward. On the Nalco side, I don't have the length of history there. I guess my observation is, I don't think they had the same hole that Ecolab had to dig out of, but that business, frankly, like almost every one of our businesses, can continue to benefit from, right, better leverage of technology and better leverage of productivity tools, all of which we plan to do. And we have a lot of flopping going on right now on technology. 3D TRASAR being developed in Food & Beverage. We've got technology tools we developed in F&B that we are sharing in the water space for industrial applications. So I think those sides are going to benefit greatly from this merger. The businesses overall, if you look at the world and what's going on, we have very good benefit -- very good performance from the legacy Ecolab businesses, right, mid single-digit growth, mid-teens OI growth. You've got around double-digit growth from Nalco, plus around 20% OI growth. I mean, there is nothing to sneeze at. I think the teams have done a great job not letting this merger get in the way of driving business performance, and we see it all around the world. So I think kudos to our -- I really do think the teams have done a good job there. And there is more to come. I think there's more margin to be driven and more share to be driven, so both top and bottom can continue to improve.","Operator","The next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I have a number of housekeeping questions. There was, within the slide deck, noted on the gross margin, an unfavorable energy business mix to gross margin. Can you explain what that was?","Michael Monahan","Yes, that's the upstream portion, which is a little bit lower margin than the downstream.","Douglas M. Baker","And it's growing faster than the down -- it's mixed.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So the upstream portion, is that where you guys got kind of a one-time sale this quarter, and that's what kind of skewed it?","Douglas M. Baker","No, it's more just a mix issue. We are -- both businesses are growing. Both businesses have good margin. You just have -- that lower-margin business is growing faster than the high-margin business, just mix dilution. It's -- we're not -- part of this is where you've got outsized investments going in the upstream part of the business as we continue to push both deepwater, unconventional, some other deployments that we have, that's where you've got outsized investments.","Michael Monahan","New chemistries and technologies, whereas refinery is probably a more staid [ph] industry than the upstream.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, got you. And then some of the other items. In terms of the Vehicle Care business sale, how dilutive to EPS is that on an annual basis taken in a vacuum?","Douglas M. Baker","About $0.03.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So not a big deal. And then...","Douglas M. Baker","I'd rather have the $0.03, but I guess we just -- we decided $120 million, it was worth it.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Right, and then when we think of modeling, both the play [ph] of that and then Champion into our models, you guys gave us $0.12 accretion from Champion. Sounds like you're going to have some offset from that sale. But is there some kind of seasonality or something we should think of in Champion just as we start to layer stuff into our model?","Douglas M. Baker","Well, I think we've talked about $50 million -- part of that is $50 million of synergies. That's not going to be -- even by quarter, that certainly is going to ramp up. Q1 is going to be your lowest and Q4 will be your highest, much like you saw synergies ramp up from the Nalco merger. That's going to be the principal seasonality impact or quarter-by-quarter impact. And over time, we'll give more clarity as we start forecasting next year, what to expect there. But certainly, synergies, for sure, ramp up over the course of the year.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. If I could squeeze in one last one, just in terms of the growth of the business in a quarterly basis, if you've got like 9%, 6%, 7%, and then, you're talking about mid single digits. Is there any real change to the growth trajectory of the business or is there some kind of lumpiness that we're seeing, just the fourth quarter being a slower growth than other parts of the year?","Douglas M. Baker","I mean, I think when we talked -- and this is, I think, very consistent with our conversation in the second quarter where we basically said, \"Look, we think this business -- if you want to look at the 9% to the 6% that we had from first to second, big hunk of that was just energy.\" And we've said you shouldn't expect energy to grow at 30%. We said you should expect it to be in the mid-, high-teens for the balance of the year. And that explains 2 out of the 3 points. The other point was one-time stuff. So we said, really think about it as a 7, and I think that's exactly where we are.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And so, when we think about it, is there -- is this quarter, when you talk about mid-single digits, is it getting closer to that 7% number?","Douglas M. Baker","That's earlier in the call. I mean, you can go read -- I basically said, sales, if you go back into your history, are going to be about the same in fourth as they were in the third, so.","Operator","Next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. A lot of questions have been asked already, but just a quick one on raw materials. If you look at Nalco business, margins went up particularly in Nalco water. How much of benefit did you get from lower propylene?","Douglas M. Baker","We don't buy that per se. It's a feedstock into a number of raws that we buy. So we watch it because it's a bellwether for us as we go through, and it certainly impacts pricing. But...","Michael Monahan","We don't break down savings from particular raw materials, P.J. We'll talk about them in total, but not specific.","Douglas M. Baker","It gets -- it gets very...","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I understand. In aggregate, was there any raw material benefit in the quarter?","Michael Monahan","Raw materials were a slight negative.","Douglas M. Baker","Negative, year-on-year. But pricing more than offset them, which is why you saw gross profit increase year-on-year.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And Doug, in one of the questions, you said you talked about restaurant business, and that has been soft ever since the recession. And can you talk about that business, and if there's anything secular going on there?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. I'd say, look, I think you could say the market's been soft. We have continued to grow in spite of it. Now, this is focusing on the U.S. I think if you look at the food service and hospitality businesses globally, it is a growth business for us. We're growing in all regions. Europe's probably flat, but we can grow there, too. But in total, we're growing around the world, and we think we will accelerate that growth over time, particularly as we start leveraging the technology that we've developed. The question earlier on Apex in Europe where, in fact, [ph] will expand. We've got a lot of technology to roll out around the world that we believe is going to give us great benefit. So it's a business we continue to like. It certainly has gone through a shift in the U.S. for a period of time, where you had foot traffic down. We don't believe that continues forever as we move forward. So it's a business that we think has got good characteristics for us long term.","Operator","The next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Doug, could you talk a little bit about Food & Beverage? It seems to me as though that 3% growth rate is substantially lower than what you anticipated a few years back. So is there a big change there? Do you see more competition? I mean, I know you said the opposite on the competition side. But that 3% somehow seems low versus what -- versus the past.","Douglas M. Baker","Yes. Rosemarie, I guess we wish that business had grown faster in the second quarter, no doubt, or the third quarter. We do not believe that there's any fundamental issue around our F&B business. You've got protein soft, and you've got some softness in brewery. We think this is more -- you go through these periods, as feed goes high and you got a bunch of other stuff happening in these industries. But at the end of the day, we continue to gain share. We continue to build the business. We've got a bunch of new technology that we will be developing and rolling out. So I guess ultimately, I would consider it a mediocre quarter in F&B, but we do not believe we've got any systemic issues in that business.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","What kind of a secular growth rate are you anticipating for that business?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, I think F&B business, both U.S. and globally, we expect to play in the 6% to 8% growth range as well. It may be more oriented towards the lower end of that organic growth range, but we expect it to be there.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And then if I may, on the Pest. Pest seems to be picking up a little bit. Is that mostly international, or are the changes that you have made in the U.S. also bearing fruit?","Douglas M. Baker","Yes, international's growing even faster if we add it on. That's the U.S., and I would say, yes. I think the leadership and plan that put in place has been working. And we've been driving, much more successfully, the top line, which is what we said the #1 objective was in Pest this year.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","And if I may ask one...","Michael Monahan","[indiscernible] some of the new technology, the new programs that we've introduced for them, focus on operational improvements.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Right. Okay. And just one quick question if I may. Textile Care, is that part of your long-term project?","Douglas M. Baker","Part of our long-term project?","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Well, part of your long-term strategy. You said that Institutional, you are looking at that as a long-term core business that it has all of the characteristics that you are looking at. What about Textile Care?","Douglas M. Baker","Textile Care is part of our long-term portfolio. I mean, Rosemarie, the only thing -- the only answer, and this has got nothing to do with either Textile or any other business you would ask about, is every business we're in today is long term until it's not. Vehicle Care was long term until it wasn't. I mean, it's the only way we can go and grow business. And I'm not asking you to read in between the lines there, nor anybody else, about any comment around Institutional or Textile or any other business. So we will -- I mean, if it's a portfolio question...","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Yes. That's what it was.","Douglas M. Baker","[indiscernible] over the year. Yes, we've shown over the years that I think we are active in terms of continuing in trying to refine our portfolio. I think we do it in an evolutionary manner. It's digestible, and we will continue to do that, which means we'll continue to buy businesses that we think make sense for us long term. And when we get in a situation like Vehicle Care, where we believe it might be better run by somebody else, we'll exit. I mean, that's the only answer. And of course, we'd never call out any business that's on one side or the other of that line.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Michael Monahan","Okay, well, thanks, everyone, for your participation today.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Thank you. Mr. Monahan, you may now begin.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's second quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. A discussion of our results along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor.","Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion, and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with a brief overview of the quarter, continued new business gains and pricing drove acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales growth in our Institutional, Industrial, and Other segments as well as increased Energy segment sales during the second quarter. These sales gains along with product innovation and ongoing cost efficiency work offset the impact of higher delivered product costs, which included a previously discussed $0.04 per share unfavorable currency hedge and challenging end markets. These, along with our work to lower interest expense and our tax rate as well as fewer shares outstanding, yielded the second quarter's 5% adjusted earnings per share increase.","Moving to some highlights from the quarter and as discussed in our press release, on an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, second quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share were $1.13. Consolidated acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales for our Institutional, Industrial, and Other segments rose 3%, while Energy sales rose 5%. Regionally, sales growth was led by North America and Latin America.","Reported operating margins increased 30 basis points. Adjusted fixed currency operating margins decreased 70 basis points as volume and price increases were partially offset by the impact of higher delivered product costs in the quarter. Adjusted fixed currency operating income rose 1%. The operating income gain, along with our work to lower interest expense and our tax rate as well as the fewer shares outstanding, yielded a 5% increase in the second quarter 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share.","We continue to aggressively drive our growth, winning new business through our innovative new products and sales and service expertise as well as driving pricing and cost efficiencies to grow our top and bottom lines and improve rates. We expect improving volume growth and pricing across all of our business segments in the second half and look for that to more than offset delivered product cost headwinds, which should ease sequentially through the second half, and yield strengthening operating income growth.","We expect full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share in the $4.70 to $4.90 range in 2017, rising 8% to 12% with the second half results outpacing the first half. We expect third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the $1.36 to $1.44 range, up 6% to 13%.","In summary, despite a challenging market environment, we expect to deliver strong adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in 2017.","And now, here is Doug Baker with some comments.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, hello, everyone. So, we had a solid Q2. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS for the year. If we look at the macro environment, the economies around the world we'd say are mixed but in aggregate, are okay to good. FX headwinds have subsided. Energy markets have recovered some and certainly stabilized. Raw materials, though, are rising and creating some short-term margin pressure but we believe are manageable over the year.","So, this year is going to be a tale of two halves. The first half came in as expected, including Q2. Sales are getting sequentially stronger from pricing, new business, and energy improvement. Margins are under modest pressure from raw materials and hedging comparisons. The second half, though, it's going to be much stronger from an EPS standpoint, up 13% to 14% if you take the midpoint of our range. This is driven by raws plateauing and hedging challenges dissipating, pricing and cost savings continuing to gain ground, and most importantly, sales acceleration from innovation, new corporate account investments and continued improvement in Energy. As a result, we expect to deliver a very solid 2017 and leave the year with excellent momentum going into 2018.","So, with that, I'll turn it back to Mike.","Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.","Thanks. That concludes our formal remarks. As a final note, before we begin Q&A, we plan to hold our 2017 Investor Day in St. Paul on Thursday, September 7th. If you have any questions, please contact us.","Operator, would you please begin the question-and-answer period?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question today is coming from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC. Please go ahead with your questions.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So, I guess, the main question for me is just the dollar has weakened quite a bit in the last month or two. I would assume there is some benefit to that. And so, should we think that something else has changed, leading to the flat guidance for the year? Or given that we're only halfway through, is it possible there's a little more conservatism in that view now given the currency moves? Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Gary, Doug. So, here's the FX. We said it was $0.05 negative in our first quarter release and neutral in the second quarter release. So, there's an implied $0.05 improvement. I would say simultaneously, we've had roughly a leak in raw materials of about a little over $0.03. And part of this move on FX was literally in the last days. And what I would say is what seems to move quick sometimes moves the other way quick. So, we don't know the bake this in fully as we go through the year.","So, there is I guess, a little bit of conservatism in here simply because the FX markets move rapidly and often in opposing directions. So, really what we look at right now is we have some modest gain from FX in total, nowhere near $0.05 because some of it was eaten up by raw materials. If it stays or gets better, I would expect our year to get better.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. And then the follow-up question, can we just get an update on the Institutional business, which in the Institutional segment within Global Institutional, in particular, which continues to lag history, and I think how you think about the growth potential? How close are we to better performance and what's the driver of that growth improving at some point? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, Q2 was in line with what we expected and I think forecasted in Q1. If you cut through the noise, U.S. growth is a little softer. It's around 4%. Globally, I'd say Global Institutional is around 3%, same factors as last quarter which is what we had forecast. Same-store sales are a bit soft in U.S. First-half comps are a bit noisy because of Swisher, and part of it is exits on our own.","New business though, ramp-up is coming. We're seeing traction there. We're not going to really see it in the numbers until the second half. Simultaneously, you'll get a bit of easing comps because we'll start lapping against the takeout on Swisher. So, I would say good news. Margins are recovering in that business. I think you'll start seeing sales pick up. We expect a better second half than first half and probably more normalized results as we close out the year.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John Quealy with Canaccord. Please proceed with your question.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon, folks. In terms of pricing, so in terms of the Energy business, seems like that was more variable. Can you talk about whether it was upstream, downstream? Sounds like you gave some price for share and then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, price for share, probably the latest stuff we've had to do would have been in downstream, but that's been a bit ago. I think if you look at pricing in Energy, we would expect to be net positive by year-end, probably neutral in Q3 from a pricing standpoint. It's been healing quarter by quarter by quarter. WellChem is already positive just because of increased demand. OFC will probably be the next to flip to positive, and downstream will be fourth quarter. That's the pricing situation. And we never had the \u2013 I mean, we had significant pricing give-ups in many instances, but it wasn't like you heard around the industry.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Got you. And then the follow-up, inside Specialty, another double-digit type performance. You've commented in the past on some programs. Can you just give us an update on visibility on that sort of double-digit, upper single-digit growth rate moving forward? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. No, largely, we would expect Specialty to have a strong year. I think in the first quarter, it was mid-single digits and we were asked, it was around 5%, 5.5%, was there anything wrong. It was really a timing issue. And so, now the new business that we talked about in the first quarter has kicked in. So, you're seeing double-digit type results. And we'd expect strong results through the rest of the year for sure.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. I know Ecolab always has potential levers to pull through the course of any year. But the restructuring actions taken during the second quarter were more than what we were expecting. So, any comments on those and potentially thoughts on the magnitude of the cost savings you'll receive?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, payback will be in 18 months in total on the work that we're doing through restructuring, so very quick payback. I mean, some of the work pays back nearly immediately and some takes maybe up to two years max, but in average 18 months.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And then in the water business, it sounds like you've finally getting to flat in mining. Any thoughts on how fast the other areas are growing and if you expect mining to be positive in the second half?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, we do expect mining to be positive in the second half. I will also say we expected mining to be positive in the second quarter. I mean, it was about flush. So, it's always a little hard to predict. But clearly, it's been healing, if you will, if you look at the sequential growth rates. And we do expect it to pop into positive in the second half for sure in probably the third quarter.","Yeah, I'd say, overall, we've got very solid momentum in the heavy and light businesses. We have a very strong portfolio of new business coming on. The team has done a great job of getting after new business, had its most successful last two quarters, so really outstanding results. You're starting to see it. We would expect a stronger second half in every major business in the water area, heavy, light, and in mining.","So, I think that team is in good shape. We feel we're in good shape overall. Margins are starting to heal. We'll start seeing some pricing across the board in that business as well, so we'll have both fronts working more in our advantage going into the second half.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you, guys. The first question is just around raw material increases that you saw. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on maybe where particularly that change versus your expectations and how long before you guys can put in actions to offset that.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, I don't know that the timing is much different in terms of when we start to expect to see light, if you will, on both gross margin and OI margin. So, we would expect to be positive versus prior year in the fourth quarter on both GP or gross margin and also on OI margin. Some of the businesses, Industrial will probably get positive in the third quarter; Institutional and Energy, more in the fourth quarter; total, around fourth quarter. So, I don't think it takes endless patience to start seeing pricing and cost savings offsetting the raw materials.","The delta in terms of our expectations versus first quarter really was driven by caustic , Europe and AP, in particular, that affects Institutional, F&B and water, and then isopropyl alcohol is sort of on a negative tear at least from our perspective in Europe. And that's really Healthcare and water that's up 30%. So, it's really those two have been the biggest change drivers. I mean, it's leaked in other places, and forecasting this is never perfect. So, if you look in total, given our bill, it's pretty darn close. We're pretty accurate, but we spent a lot of money on raw materials. $4 million equals $0.01. It's not hard to be wrong by a penny or two.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on Energy, if I may, I mean, we've seen a lot of the macro analysts and so forth lower their long-term targets in oil prices. I think it's in line with what you guys have been expecting longer term anyway. It sounds like you're still hiring this year to set up for more aggressive maybe share in 2018. Any changes in your view and outlook broadly in Energy there?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","No, I think you're largely right. I think the Energy business and how we see oil price hasn't really changed from what we expected going in the year. So, we didn't have a particularly bullish outlook. So, we don't need to bring it down, I guess, is the easiest way to put it. So, what we're seeing in Energy right now is what's bouncing back first what was hit hardest by the downturn and that was North America WellChem. And WellChem in the quarter was up north of 50% in sales year-on-year. The other two businesses, if you take them collectively, were really flat, downstream and OFC together, versus last year.","But that's better than Q1 where we were down a couple of points year-on-year. And if you look at the second half, I would say we expect more of the same. WellChem, continuing to improve and have strong year-on-year results as drilled wells are completed. OFC and downstream will see continued strengthening as we go throughout the year really from pricing leverage, volume slowly improving from share gains and industry recovery. We'll expect the margin, as I mentioned earlier, to start recovering in Q4, start to make some progress.","So, in that, we think Energy remains positioned to do call it mid-single-digit type growth for the year on the top line, flat to modest OI gross on the bottom line but most importantly, leave the year with good momentum. And we don't expect a magic year in 2018 from a oil price rise standpoint, but we think we're well positioned in this environment to continue improve results, both top and bottom line even if oil doesn't have a substantial recovery.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Any change in new win activity with the recent deals for your largest competitors in cleaning and water treatment chemicals?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, we don't go blow-by-blow, never have. I would say in both, well all of them, Institutional, F&B and water in particular, we've had great success the last two quarters in net new business. And it's been increasing over the performance we had for prior quarters. I don't know if you directly attribute. I mean, we're certainly beating the new business drum loudly within the business. And businesses are on it and starting to show really strong results, so I think it's a whole number of factors. I don't know that there is the same kind of dislocation feeling that we think will occur in the competitors, but we'll see.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And secondly, I don't think this is big, but supermarkets have been in the headlines recently. And I think you used to talk about supermarket locations as growth areas for both cleaning services for fresh food preparation and also a lot of supermarkets we're adding QSR facilities. Has that stalled out with the pressures that are going on in that particular retail market?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","No, I think there's going to be probably more change in the food retail space, no doubt. There's all kinds of change and pressure in that business. But it will include more prepared foods likely, including potentially delivery and other things. So, we'll see a continued shift, if you will, around the foodservice landscape. Our food retail business remains quite healthy. It's a global business, and so we have significant opportunity, not only in North America to continue to gain share, but also around the world. And one of the things that I think we do particularly well is help customers manage through change, particularly when they have to change their risk profile, say, from selling raw food to prepared food. And we think that's going to be still a change and a move that you're going to see in that industry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good afternoon. Can you just benchmark a little bit current thinking around direction of taxes and cash taxes given the progress that you've seen? And secondly, you allude in the prepared remarks to a comp effect affecting Q3. How do you think about comp affecting the bridge for 2018 versus 2017? It should be a net neutral. Is that right?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, I think this year, tax is going to be around 24-ish is where we had expected to end up. You know, Laurence, we do a lot of work every year looking at ways that we can improve our tax rate. We don't take bleeding edge strategies. We've always tried to have a balance between, if you will, kind of cash fungibilities, so we don't end up with significant amount of trapped cash, sometimes as a tradeoff with rate to chase the absolute lowest rate. It's actually at the cost of trapped cash. And so, we try to have a balanced approach as we go through. We would expect 2018 to be similar to 2017 right now as we look at it from a tax rate, so we don't believe it's going to be either a significant tailwind or a headwind next year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Doug, back to the guidance, at the very low end, which seems very conservative, what would need to happen for you guys to hit that $4.70 number?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, I guess, any number of things. I mean, the world is not the most stable place. I don't think it's likely that we're going to be down there. I would say it's unlikely we're going to be there. Looking at the range right now, given we had a benefit really from FX, which was quite recent since we've seen daylight, we're talking days. And everything else, I mean, we are forecasting a pretty aggressive second half, 13% to 14% EPS, which is really kind of double-digit third quarter and a very strong fourth quarter.","We just said it probably made sense to stick with this range given all the uncertainty in the world, but I would be quite surprised if we end up on the very bottom of the range to your comment. I don't think it's highly likely. I think our position is good. Our businesses are improving across the board. We feel like we've gotten most of the stuff in hand and understand it, which is always the time something shakes somewhere that we didn't predict, but I think we've got a little flex in a couple of areas to allow us to manage even some level of unhappy surprise going throughout the balance of the year, which is how we normally manage. So, yeah, there is some conservatism on the bottom of the range, absolutely.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Doug, just on Anios, how is that acquisition progressing seven months into it?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, I mean, we're predicting to be on or above on both top line and bottom line in the first year. We always have very aggressive objectives, particularly when we do a management case, so we do two cases for all acquisition. We do sort of the financial case and then we do a management case. Management has to sign up for the second, and we're beating and exceeding those numbers. So, we feel very good. It's a great company. The culture fit is what we expected, very solid and strong. They're very focused on customers, very focused on growth. We feel like we made the right move buying that company. So, so far, so good.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. Within Industrial, can you sort of view your new account pipeline in F&B, the share gain outlook in conjunction with your enterprise solutions effort for the second half of into 2018 and whether or not it is meeting or exceeding your expectations, which I recall were a little more upbeat during your last call? Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, F&B, we expect to have a better second half than first half, and it's being driven by two of the issues you just cited. One is they've had a lot of success in new business in the first half. It will start showing up Q3 and Q4 as they roll it out. I mean, you have to actually install it and start shipping. It's not the signed contract that moves the needle from the P&L standpoint.","Additionally, I would say, when we look at a number of the new initiatives, the new initiatives particularly Industrial have longer legs than they say in Institutional because it takes longer to get uptake. When you're going in and switching systems in a food plant, there's a lot of things people have to be concerned about, making sure that they don't impact quality or safety as you change out systems or move from one antimicrobial to another, et cetera. So, it always takes a little longer to ramp up.","But our 3DT CIP systems are really starting to take off. We feel very good about a number of antimicrobial platforms that we have coming. So, all in all, I'd say we feel bullish about the F&B business, particularly given what it's had to come through in terms of plant shutdowns and consolidation. In North America and other places, they continue to keep their nose above water in the top line. The dairy business looks like it's starting to move in the right direction. Milk prices were incredibly low for a period of time. So both dairy, food, some of our big segments are improving. We expect it to have a strong second half.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And as a quick corollary to that, as it pertains to the enterprise selling effort, is F&B typically the anchor for your sales force for the water and pest businesses or is it the other way around? Is it typically mixed? Just any outlook on that as well. Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","It's worked both ways. When you're in the food and beverage business, our food and beverage team, the food safety portion of that team had a higher share, if you will, of that business than did Nalco Water when we put the companies together. So, the majority of the introductions, if you will, came from the F&B side to the water side. But it wasn't all F&B introducing water. We've had a number of instances where the relationship was with the water team and they brought F&B in.","But that's been a huge success for us. The customers see these as completely interrelated. They understand the advantages of having, if you will, one company do both for them. We've worked to make it obvious. We continue to do other things around reporting, synergistic chemistries, service. We're looking at organization structures, et cetera, to make this work even better for our food and beverage industry customers. So, we feel good about this. There is still legs, plenty of room and opportunity to sell more here, working together, and we're going to continue to push them.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please go ahead with your question.","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon. I understand that restaurant foot traffic became more of a headwind through the first half of this year than maybe it's been over the last several years. Given how much you guys see the touch points across thousands of restaurants, I'm just curious if you have any insight as to why this deceleration is taking place. Is there some underlying secular trend? Is it more macro related? What do you think is going on here?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, I would say the softness in the first quarter in particular was also timed identically to the retail softness broadly. There's all kinds of assumptions or guesses about what was driving it then, timing of tax refunds, et cetera. I don't think you've got any huge fundamental change that you're currently seeing in U.S. food service, i.e., takeout or some other magical thing. Those things move year-on-year but at a fairly slower rate, so I don't believe those are the trends that we're seeing.","I think what we're seeing is some softness broadly in a certain segment of the foodservice industry. We've chased it before over time. We'll probably chase it again. So, that's really I think the issue. I don't believe there's been any fundamental secular change that we're dealing with at this moment. That's not what the industry sees. It's not what the stats suggest.","So, I think for us, we're having to overcome some softness in one of our key segments. We deal with this all the time. And the best way to deal with it is sell more business, and that's exactly what we're working to do. If same-store sales start rebounding to more normalized levels, we'll be the beneficiary of it, probably on a greater scale because we'll have larger share.","Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. That was helpful. Maybe switching gears to life science. Life science decelerated I think in the second quarter to 5%. Is that how we should think about long-term growth for this business? Or do you think about it more as a high single-digit grower through the cycle? And can you also remind me how large this business is today? Is it about $100 million? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, it's about $100 million. It's going to be lumpy. I think we expect this to be a double-digit business over stretches of time. We'd expect it to grow north of \u2013 I mean, into the teens, maybe early teens in balance of the year. And it's really you sell \u2013 this is the old feed the village with an elephant, so that's the nature of this business. It's a lot like QSR and lumpy like QSR. I'd say over time, QSR has got a big base now, so it's not as lumpy as it was. We explain this all the time in QSR. I think it's going to be the same story in life sciences. They've sold a bunch of new business. They feel confident in the second half. I would expect to see much different results in Q3 and Q4.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please proceed with your questions.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good afternoon. My first question is just on the European business, if you could provide a little more color. It seems like it was weaker across most segments, except for the water business and Healthcare.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, in total, our Europe business was really weak in the first quarter and obviously, better in the second quarter. We expect the top line to be better still in the second half. Water was one of the main drivers for the performance improvement from Q1 to Q2, and it was welcome to see. We'd expect Institutional to improve through the balance of the year, F&B as well. So, I don't think it's going to be only a water story for all of 2017. It was principally a water story in Q2.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","And just a follow-up, on the balance sheet, the leverage is still low but has ticked up a bit. Maybe just frame for us your appetite to do larger deals longer term and ability to use the balance sheet. Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, our appetite hasn't changed nor have our taste buds, meaning we want really good deals that have the ability to deliver favorable returns to shareholders over the long term. And so, if that's the environment, obviously, it's got to be a strategic fit of business, we have a right to own and run and run well, fit our model, and all of the like.","We have a big appetite to do those deals when they make sense. And so, our balance sheet, we don't believe is any way a hindrance in our ability to do that. We've ramped up what we needed to. We have room in the balance sheet even sitting here today. We expect those metrics to improve as we go throughout the year. So, we'll have more room, if you will, by the year-end than we do now, but we don't even view it as an issue right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your questions.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Doug, you talked a little bit earlier on Manav's question about kind of what you're expecting in the back half in Energy. Could you just refresh us on how to think about how well completion activity progresses to production? I know we've seen a steadiness now in the oil price? And then a follow-up on that is in the press release, it was discussed, the soft international markets in Energy. Could you delve in a little on that, too, please? Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","To the first one, I mean, all the pressure initially in the downturn really hit the North American market, the unconventional piece in particular. And that's where you saw almost all the volume takeout in the industry was in the U.S. The rest of the world often I would say oil production is directly tied to some economy like Russia or Venezuela. And when prices go down, oil price per barrel, their production tends to go up over the near term. They're trying to offset, if you will, the bleeding in their economy. And so, you get this kind of perverse activity going on. That can only last so long because it simultaneously cut CapEx. They start losing the ability to keep and maintain production without new CapEx.","And what we're seeing is the shift. First, the pain was in North America. In 2015, our international non-North American business was up in Energy and was pretty strong. In 2016, you started seeing pain on both sides. And what you're now seeing is recovery first in North America because it went down first and international will lag. So, that's, by and large, the geographic story in this business.","Our WellChem business is predominantly North America. And so, we took it on the chin when we had the North America pain early in the downturn. Likewise, when you see \u2013 the really significant pickup in the business is in North America. It benefits disproportionately as well, and we're also seeing that.","In terms of drilling activity, there's a one to two quarter lag often from drilling to completion. Our WellChem business doesn't really realize the benefits until you've got completion. And if you look at drilling but uncompleted units, they have risen recently. It's a little north of 6,000 right now. And those will be completed, and that's what's going to drive benefit for WellChem over the next couple of quarters. So, I don't know \u2013 hopefully, that answers the two questions you posed.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","It did. Very helpful. If I could just sneak a follow-on on that. The compensation rebuild, obviously, it's baked into the guidance for the rest of the year, which we can see, but is that something that's going to affect 2018 as well? Or is that kind of a catch-up right now this time of this year? Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Much more of a 2017 issue than a 2018 issue. I would say both things. You're going to have better balance between price and raw materials in 2018 than you did in 2017. And comp rebuild is predominantly a 2017 story. I mean, it's going to be a little bit in 2018 but not at the same level.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Doug, Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to make sure I understand what's going on with the Energy business and given that your margins are still sort of in the high single digits versus I would expect it by now to see more of a recovery into a low double-digit range. It sounds from your comments like you do expect that recovery in the second half of the year. So, I'm just trying to understand if that's going to be driven by volume or by better sort of pricing, raw material mix or kind of where is your confidence coming from that the revenue growth is going to translate into profit growth and profit margin growth?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, Dmitry, I mean, here is what we're seeing and as I mentioned on an earlier question, a couple back, we will start to see daylight in Energy between price recovery and raw material incremental cost starting really in Q4. We're starting to see some price recovery in WellChem, but as I mentioned, the Other businesses is going to be a little later in the year. So, you'll start seeing that dynamic work more in our favor than against us, which it has for the last several quarters.","The comp rebuild is really \u2013 the heavy pieces are Q2, Q3 on that business, so we'll start annualizing against that, and you just start having more significant volume gains, and those start translating into, right, overhead coverage and the like. I mean, I think we were very clear this year even at the beginning to say we expected sales to be mid-single digit, NOI to be flat or modestly up, which implies margin linkage just by nature.","And so, what we're seeing isn't a real surprise, and it's also quite consistent with past recoveries. You start seeing sales recover before margin. Margin follows more like year two than year one, but it starts recovering. And what we're seeing right now suggests we're exactly on that trajectory, and we'll start seeing improvement in margins Q4.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Q4. Okay. I just wanted to confirm that. And then the second question, I think it was a couple of quarters ago when talking about a slowdown that you guys seen in your Industrial business that you mentioned that uncharacteristically for you, you sort of took the eye off the new wins ball, if you will, or getting new relationships going and just expanding your business and capturing market share. We saw a little bit of improvement in the first quarter, not so much in the second quarter in terms of year-over-year comps. So, where do we stand in that, I guess, re-energized initiative, if I will, of going out and getting the business and making sure that you control more of your destiny than the market?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah, I would say the business is strengthening. I'd say the new business productivity has been very strong the last couple of quarters. You are right. I mean, I think we looked at our new business productivity honestly across the board and felt we needed to turn up the heat and we've done it, and we're starting to see the results.","I would expect Industrial, so predominantly F&B and water, to have an improved second half, both in top line, margin, frankly across the P&L in the second half versus first half, and we think we're well positioned to do it. So, we feel good about what's going on in those businesses. I think the teams have positioned them. The work they've been doing is going to start bearing fruit starting Q3.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your questions.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Great. Thanks. I guess my question is on the Other segment. This is one of your faster-growing segments and has been for a while. In your release script, you guys talked about some investments there. I guess, I'd like to understand a little bit more about those types of investments, what they were, and how you expect them to affect the margins on a go-forward basis from here.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","I mean, some of the investment is just strictly people, so that's a variable expense. And we're having sales growth. We want to continue to make sure that we're feeding it, and people aren't immediately productive when you put them on. So, there's always a little bit of a drag.","I think more significant in past, we've been leveraging much more effectively technology in the field. We had a large group of field meetings this year, which we didn't have the prior year to the tune of a couple million dollars. It didn't sound like a lot. It's not. But it does affect a 13-week period at times, and so that's the other cost. That's a onetime cost this year. It is not going to repeat in three and four. That also has some impact on the margins here, net. We don't have a high concern about the margins in the Other segment. We think they will do what they're supposed to do as we go on. We want to make sure that we continue to drive top line success there.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli. Please proceed with your questions.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Doug, following up on the Other category, equipment care was up only 2%. Could you bring us up-to-date as to what you are doing there and remind me of what the anticipated growth rate over the long term is? Can you get to the 8% or thereabout that pest is enjoying?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. No, I mean, we'd expect our equipment care business to accelerate. The 2% is not anywhere near our target. We were growing upper single digits recently as last year, so I don't think there's anything \u2013 we're in a bit of a lull in that business. We don't plan to hang out here very long. The team is on it. We need to get after it. We got a little behind on keeping manpower levels where we needed them. That's been improved per the earlier question, and so I would expect we'll start accelerating that business again.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","And then looking at both Europe and Asia Pacific and I apologize if you talked about it already, but could you talk about the impacts from the higher raw material costs and then the trend in demand in both of those regions for the different businesses that you operate there?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Well, Europe, we talked about a bit. We've got in Europe, we would expect Industrial recovery first but Institutional improved throughout the year. So I think overall, we'd expect to have a pretty good year in terms of top line performance in Europe. We're up about 2.5% in the second quarter after being slightly negative in the first quarter. So, it was a pretty strong sequential recovery, if you will.","In terms of raw materials, they're biting us in Europe. No doubt about it. We have the same story there. It takes us a while to recover via pricing, but we're starting to get pricing in Europe as well. And we expect a kind of tried-and-true formula we've talked which is absolute raw material cost coverage, year one and margin recovery, year two. Sometimes we do it in a little more accelerated basis, but it's not a bad way to think about it.","So, I think Europe is going to be okay. We probably won't see our 100-point OI margin improvement this year simply because we're dealing with the raws, and we'll expect to have more than 100 points next year. And we've also seen this in the recent past, so I'm comfortable that we're more right than wrong in Europe.","AP, yeah, we've got some work to do on some of the businesses. We see improving results in a number of areas but it's inconsistent. And AP is sort of it's not really a region, right? We've got Australia, Japan, Southeast Asia. You've got very different markets there. And all in all, where we really need growth, I think the team is doing the right stuff. And in some of these markets, we want more balanced growth in margin given our share and where we ought to be in kind of tradeoffs and opportunity. So, I think there is stuff we can continue to improve in our AP performance, and we expect to see that improving throughout the year as well. That's a harder market to get pricing traditionally.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Nomura. Please proceed with your questions.","Dan Dolev - Instinet LLC","Hi, Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions. First one on raws. If I heard you correctly, you expect raws to plateau in the second half of the year. Did I hear you correctly and is that what's embedded in the guidance?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Oh. Yes. Sorry. I missed the pun there. Yeah, it's embedded in the guidance. Otherwise, I wouldn't have offered the comment. But I would say, we look at kind of peak Q3 on raws, but we also have pricing increasing in Q3, so the delta is more in our favor in Q3 than it was in Q2 because it takes a little time for pricing to catch up with raws. Additionally, our hedge, which we've talked about and said it was principally first half challenge dissipates down in the third quarter versus the first two and basically gone in the fourth quarter.","Dan Dolev - Instinet LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then my second question is on the SG&A. If I look back over the last 10 years, you've done a really good job lowering your SG&A as a percent of sales. How much lower do you think you can go? How much more room do you have to decline? I guess, you went from 33% in the first guidance to 32% to 33%, and now, you're at 32%. So, how much lower can you go and how do you plan to get there if you needed to? Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I would say our SG&A has benefited from a number of things. I mean, certainly, we're a lot of bigger, and so you've got a lot better leverage over, say, G&A resources broadly, corporate, regional, et cetera, over the last 10 years. We're also leveraging field technology and improving the way that we drive that technology. And so, you see some of that benefit. I would say what we would expect, we'll continue to grow, so I think you'll still see G&A leverage going forward, predominantly from growth but also from technology.","But in the field, which is really the big spend area, we're working now. We've got, I don't know, some 2 million customer sites nearly if you add up all the restaurants, probably collecting data 90%. But we only have a small fraction of it currently connected to the cloud. So, in most instances, our people have to walk into the unit, download via an RF port, and then they have the data to start analyzing how they can further improve the customer's operation. We know that if we take that and send it to the cloud, do the analytics, send it to our person in advance of them arriving at the front door that we're going to improve their productivity significantly and improve the amount of time they have for up-selling and for doing other things, even handling more accounts.","So, technology, I would say in all industries, we have not yet pushed boundaries in these areas we are going to. We're doing a lot of I think very smart things in these areas, and we believe ultimately we'll see benefits that will show up in lower SG&A ratios, probably the ability to do more for our customers. Also in a host of areas, we think it will benefit our business.","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Monahan, there are no further questions at this time.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Michael Monahan, Senior Vice President of External Relations for Ecolab. Please go ahead sir.","Michael J. Monahan - Senior Vice President External Relations","Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's fourth quarter conference call. With me today are Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and our CFO, Dan Schmechel.","A discussion of our results along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com\/investor. Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion, and the slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projected.","Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, under Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our posted materials. We'd also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with a brief overview of the quarter, continued strong new account gains and new product introductions drove good fixed currency sales growth in our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments during the fourth quarter, nearly offsetting a decline in Global Energy sales. Delivered product cost savings, ongoing cost efficiency work and synergies led the strong adjusted operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the impact of softening economies, weaker oil prices and increased currency headwinds. These, along with the lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding, drove the adjusted earnings per share increase","While 2016 will present challenges, we are prepared to respond. Once again, we will focus on the fundamental Ecolab growth strategies that have proven successful through repeated economic cycles. The best products and service for our customers to give them the best results and lowest operating costs. We expect them to succeed again in 2016.","Looking to the first quarter, we expect our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments to continue to show solid fixed currency growth, outpacing their markets and softer international economies as they leverage investments we have made to further improve sales and service force effectiveness and profitability, and more than offset lower results from our Global Energy business.","We look for the first quarter earnings to show very attractive growth before currency, increasing 5% to 14%, as we continue to aggressively drive business growth. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to reflect about 14 percentage points of unfavorable currency impact, yielding adjusted EPS in the $0.73 per share to $0.80 per share range.","We look for comparative results to improve as 2016 progresses and show strong results for the full year with 9% to 13% adjusted earnings per share growth before the unfavorable impact of currency and the Venezuela deconsolidation. We expect currency and the Venezuela deconsolidation will penalize 2016 growth by approximately 9 percentage points. Net, we expect Ecolab to once again significantly outperform its markets and show a superior performance in 2016 while also investing in the key drivers for future sustainable above average earnings growth.","Moving to some highlights from the fourth quarter, and as discussed in our press release, reported fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.69. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings per share increased 2% to $1.22 despite a $0.13 or 11% currency headwind. The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by delivered product and other cost savings, cost efficiencies, synergies, new products, and lower tax rate and share count.","Our fixed currency acquisition adjusted sales were modestly lower as our Institutional, Industrial and Other segments grew 4%, but were offset by a lower energy sales. Regional sales growth was led by Europe and Latin America excluding Venezuela. Adjusted fixed currency operating margins showed very strong growth, expanding 130 basis points.","In 2015's difficult environment, we focused on driving new business gains and lower costs. We used our industry-leading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve better results and lower operating costs. And through these, aggressively drove new account gains across all of our segments. Further, raw material cost savings along with our cost efficiency work, helped to offset these headwinds. Importantly, we also continued to make investments in our key growth drivers.","These actions delivered a strong fundamental business performance in 2015 with double-digit profit growth before currency. The fourth quarter represented another strong performance on this basis, growing 13% despite the further deterioration in Energy markets.","As noted earlier, the business environment has become more challenging in recent months as the dollar strengthened, Energy markets weakened, and global economies softened. Nonetheless, against that challenging backdrop, we look for 2016 earnings before currency and Venezuela deconsolidation effects to continue to show strong growth as we implement the same approach in 2016 as we did in 2015 and aggressively drive market share and new business gains.","We expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share from operations to rise 5% to 14% before currency and the Venezuela deconsolidation, with adjusted earnings per share in the $0.73 to $0.80 range, reflecting a currency drag of approximately 14% to earnings per share growth.","Results are expected to improve as the year progresses with the second half outperforming the first half. We look for full year adjusted earnings before currency and the Venezuela deconsolidation to increase 9% to 13%. We expect adjusted earnings per share in the $4.35 per share to $4.55 per share range with currency and Venezuela deconsolidation representing an approximate 9% drag to results.","In summary, despite a very challenging global economic and market environment, we expect our underlying business to continue to deliver very strong fundamental earnings in 2016. We remain confident in our business, our markets, and our people, as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years.","And now here's Doug Baker with some comments.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mike. First, I'll just offer some perspective on 2015 and then talk 2016 as well. So 2015, we had very solid business performance. It was clearly shrouded by FX. But if you take it net of translation FX, our EPS was 12% for the year and 13% in Q4.","And this includes the full impact of Energy in the year and in the quarter, full impact of transaction FX. It includes system investments of $0.10 for the year, which is $0.03 over last year. It also includes an increase in sales and service head count, i.e., we continue to invest in the business while driving double-digit results in obviously not the perfect environment.","Our major business drove this. All of them grew faster than their markets, including Energy. While Energy was hit clearly by the oil and gas market headwinds, it outperformed. So in a market with a 60% decline in U.S. rigs, 50% drop in oil prices, our Energy business declined 8% top line for the year, 14% in OI.","If you parse through Energy and look at the core of the business, the production or OFC and downstream collectively, they grew top line 1% and OI 8% for the year. So the core of that business managed very well.","The rest of our businesses, I'd say, also outperformed the markets and had a very, very strong year. So Institutional globally grew sales 6%, OI 12%. F&B grew sales 6%, OI 16%. Water grew sales 6%, OI 12%. Specialty services 7% and 16%. If you add in the rest, Paper, Healthcare, et cetera, the total of all those businesses was 5% growth and 12% OI.","We drove it the old fashioned way. We continued to take share. We're outgrowing our major competitors in the markets we compete in as our team continued to drive innovation and delivered new business. This is what drove the underlying 12% EPS performance.","So as you look at 2016, it's going to be much more of the same. It's going to be continued FX headwinds, see more of the same market conditions. We expect the economies globally to be choppy, but manageable. It's going to be continued tough oil and gas markets, offset, in part, by favorable raw material markets, which is the flip side of that coin. But most importantly, we're going to have continued strong underlying business execution.","So we expect to deliver double digit underlying EPS growth again in 2016. The range is 9% to 13%. We expect Energy to continue to be impacted by the tough market conditions, but our natural raw material price hedge will mitigate this negative impact.","Energy, we do not believe will be as negative as last year, but given our forecast position of no 2016 energy market turnaround, it will likely decline modestly year-on-year, but at a slower rate than last year. The balance of the business is poised to have another very good year; a bit stronger than 2015 on top-line and continued margin expansion.","Net, we feel good about the business. In 2016, as we continue to invest for the long term, we're going to continue to invest in R&D and systems field technology, sales fire power, talent development. We're very, very excited about the future and I think our investment belies (10:40) that. Our positioning and promise of clean water, safe food, abundant energy, healthy environments, we believe remains even more relevant or is more relevant as we go forward.","So, the business continues to do well. The underlying results, I believe, demonstrate our resilience as we continue to deliver double digit EPS, when you exclude translation FX, in far from perfect market conditions.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Mike and we can open it up for Q&A.","Michael J. Monahan - Senior Vice President External Relations","Thanks, Doug. A final note before we start the Q&A. We plan to hold our annual tour of our booth at the National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago on May 23. If you have any questions, please contact my office.","That concludes our formal remarks. Operator, would you please begin the question-and-answer period?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Perhaps your line is on mute, Mr. Bisbee?","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I'm sorry. Can you hear me?","Michael J. Monahan - Senior Vice President External Relations","Yeah, we can hear you, Gary.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Sorry about that. Hey, so the first question just on the global macro, how much worse have things gotten? Is your message more that this is just a continuation of the weak-ish growth we had in 2015? Or do you feel like things really have gotten worse in the last quarter or two? Thanks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Gary, I would say I think the base economy is a little worse. I don't think it's the driver. U.S., we expect U.S. to continue to slog along with positive GDP, but there are some positive impacts in U.S. for us, i.e. in the food service market and some of the others where frankly cheap oil price starts driving consumer behavior in our favor, at least in that part of the business. We think Western Europe's likely to be worse in 2016 than in 2015 as they've just a baseline economy. It was probably our big positive surprise last year. And we would expect it to be modestly off in terms of economic growth, but still growing this year, so we're not predicting recession. China is still more (13:15). Then you look at Latin America, clearly, Brazil is going to be not very healthy. So I'd call it a tick off, but I don't really believe that's what we're trying to forecast as a driver. As long as it doesn't turtle, we should be fine and able to grow. I think next year, I think our base sales are going to be better in 2016 than 2015.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then the follow-up question, just on margins, I guess the midpoint of the margins within the guidance assumes a deceleration of the expansion. I guess, wondering if you could just talk about the puts and takes there from underlying trend, how the benefit from lower raws is flowing through or you think it will this year, and anything else, in particular, that you've got implied in that guidance. Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, I would say, this year, clearly, margin accelerated throughout the year, which is what we predicted. And that was that raw material savings increased as the year went on, which is how they manifest themselves. We also had the other side, which is the Energy business cost savings effects really built throughout the year too, as we had to take out heads and other things. And obviously you have more heads out of your business in Q4 than you did in Q1, if it's an initiative that you undertake at the beginning of the year.","In 2016, we would expect margins to continue to expand at a somewhat slower pace than they expanded in 2015. And really that's mainly driven by the fact that raw material delta isn't going to be a significant savings. It will be a savings, but not the same level in 2016 versus 2015 as 2015 was to 2014. But we would expect margins to continue to accelerate and improve.","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourselves to one question and one follow up. Our next question is coming from Nate Brochmann from William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company, L.L.C","Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone. Hey, Doug, just a little bit on the Energy business. Obviously, you've seen a lot of pressure in WellChem throughout the year, and we continue to see that a little bit. The rest of the business has held up, some way, okay.","Could you comment a little bit in terms of, obviously, I'm assuming that you're getting some pricing pressure across the board, but also ex-WellChem, kind of what you're seeing in terms of whether those trends remain stable or there you're seeing a little bit of an increasing pressure here and there? And what could be some of the puts and the takes as we move throughout 2016?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Look, we expect there's going to be continued WellChem pressure throughout the year, but obviously, it's a smaller piece of the portfolio given its decline last year. In terms of the production piece of the business or OFC, there's pricing pressure there. We had very strong production volumes in 2015. I think production will be \u2013 it's going to be about even with last year for the year, so we don't think that's really going to be the big negative impact. But there may be some slight negative in our OFC production business, not material and not significant.","And then downstream, we would expect to be quite strong this year as it goes forward. I would say, net on balance, Energy, simply because the comparative period becomes much easier, is going to be at worse less of a drag than last year, at better maybe no drag in terms OI.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company, L.L.C","Okay. And then just a quick kind of bookkeeping thing, but on the interest expense being up a little bit. Is there any structural changes going on there in terms of some permanent things or is that kind of a temporary kind of one year up mark?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll let Dan answer this one.","Daniel J. Schmechel - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Nate. This is Dan. Nothing structural going on. The increase in interest expense is really based on the continuity of how we're thinking about managing the capital structure, first of all. So a slight increase in the total amount of debt. We are also doing a fairly significant chunk of refinancing of term debt, and likewise anticipating, based on the current yield curve, slightly higher short-term interest rates during the year. So, I would say, it's a tiny bit of volume, but mostly it's a rate impact. Okay.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company, L.L.C","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Doug, just on the Water in Q4, it looks like that business did decelerate a little bit. Reasons why that happened and what's your expectations for 2016?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, you're right. The headline number on Water looked like it decelerated. If you strip out mining where we really had some significant pressure, Water was up 5% in the quarter year-on-year, so no real deceleration, continued strength. As we look for the year, I would say, we expect Water to accelerate through 2016. The headline number is going to be a little impaired again in the first quarter, mostly because of mining again, but that dissipates as you start annualizing against some of that pressure. And Water, for the year, we'd expect to be a pretty strong number in 2016.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. And just on WellChem, Doug, how large is that business now as a percentage of the overall Energy business? Is it roughly 10% or a little bit more, a little bit less?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's about 10% of the Energy revenues.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Ridley-Lane from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. Another question on Energy. Just roughly what percentage of your business today is related to U.S. shale production? And if you have a view as to what's embedded in your revenue outlook in terms of U.S. shale related revenue?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. In total, it would be around 15% of the Energy business.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then the fourth quarter results show pretty significant cost savings in Energy. Are there other levers that you're planning to pull or are you just counting on anniversarying the cost reductions you've already done?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, there's a little more to come but most of the benefit in 2016 versus 2015 will be annualization of what you're seeing in Q4. There's a bit more that's coming, but that's the bulk of it.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Quealy from Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon, folks. So, in both Global Institutional and Global Industrial, specifically industrial food and beverage and institutional, the core institutional business, can you talk about the dynamics for 2016 price versus volume? They've held up still very well all-in in this market. So if you could just talk through some of the variables that play in 2016 for growth there on the top line.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I would say Global Institutional, the division not the sector, we would expect to have a very similar, strong 2016 as 2015, and maybe some dynamics as to where the growth is that are a little different. We would expect margins to continue to increase in 2016. And so, that's a bit of a benefit from raws, but not significant in institutional. Continued innovation driving margin, which has really been the play in institutional for a number of years, and we have a very good innovation pipeline.","In terms of F&B globally, I would say, we expect a better year in 2016 than 2015, and they had a good year last year. So there's been a bunch of new business, improved performance in North America, in particular, and continued margin expansion there. That business benefits a little more as a percent from raw material market benefit than institutional just by the mix of raw materials that they buy, but again, they're also doing a good job in innovation.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","And then last, on the M&A environment, given the slowdown in the macro, have prices come in at all? Does it make you want to change the total dollar amount that you talked about on the Analyst Day for deployment, et cetera? Thank you very much, folks.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","M&A, look, is kind of an ongoing interest. We don't really get interested and then lose interest. I would say, right now, we've got a very rich pipeline. We ended up closing deals last year that are going to deliver over $300 million in sales. I hope we do better than that this year. The wildcard is valuation. And I would say, the market is fairly richly valued at this point in time. And so, I think we're working to be very smart and choiceful. Ultimately, we want to do deals that we know we can get very good returns on long term. That's the main metric we pay attention to, not accretion, dilution, et cetera, but what is the ultimate return going to be. We've seen this cycle before. It does come and go, and we're going to be very, very careful while we're in a frothy environment.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today's coming from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is actually Greg (23:04) calling on for Manav. I was just wondering if you could give a bit more color on the inputs into your Energy forecast in terms of what you're thinking about for the oil price trajectory. And then during Investor Day, you kind of talked about a snap-back in 2017. Is that still your base case or are you guys kind of thinking about more of a U-shaped recovery as we look out into 2017?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I would say, for the year, we've been fairly consistent. We do not expect the Energy market, i.e., if you're measuring, say, oil price, to recover in 2016. It doesn't mean that we might not see increased oil prices in May and June as we move into the summer driving season, but we think that could be followed by a bit of a dip. We do believe in 2017 that the supply and demand lines start converging and that we will see a change in oil price over time. We're not predicting a snap, a U, a saucer or anything else. I think it's too early. We're probably not the best people to predict that. But ultimately, we do believe that the oil price will move north of $30. We don't believe that really happens for any extended period of time until 2017 and beyond.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Fair enough. And I think you talked about the cheaper gas prices as a potential tailwind for your consumer businesses. We've seen a couple of reports that that tailwind hasn't played out as much as some people would've thought of. So I'd love to hear what you're seeing in your businesses and if you're actually seeing some marginal benefit there.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Look, you can find all kinds of metrics. I would say, the food service business, traffic hasn't really turned around, but sales in many of the food service establishments have improved, not in all. And I would say we look at both lodging and food service as healthier than they were a few years ago. Lodging has been fairly consistent, but food service in particular. In our U.S. sales, where you see the singles biggest decline in gas price because you don't have currency neutralizing it as you do in other countries, we've seen pretty robust market conditions, better.","Unknown Speaker","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Good afternoon, gentlemen. Couple of questions, if I may, first of all, you mentioned Latin America as a source of strength for your Industrial and Institutional businesses. That's a rare thing to hear these days. Can you talk about what you're doing to succeed in that region and how you look at it in 2016, obviously, with Venezuela being the deconsolidated operation now?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So I'll give you numbers ex-Venezuela. For the year, we were double-digit in Latin America. This is on fixed currency. So that's not a small thing, given the real and everything else. What's driving it is just underlying success in securing new business. I mean there is no other \u2013 there's nothing fancy going on.","We've got a good team. Businesses are focused. This is more on the Industrial side of the business is where we're having the most success throughout Latin America. And we would expect to have continued success in 2016 in that market as well.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","All right. So it's a question of not so much the economies or your sectors of the economies doing well, it's just getting new business and hopefully getting pricing to offset some of the FX headwind?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Dmitry, I would say, look, the economy can get bad enough where it absolutely impacts us. So, we're not bulletproof and we've never pretended to be. But when I had that earlier question on the economy, if it's growing at, I don't know, 4% or 3% or 3% or 2%, we're not that sensitive where we're going to feel those types of changes. What we really focus on is driving share. And we have enough share upside in virtually every business, every market we compete in that we believe, in most situations, we control our destiny. And our teams are out there trying to go secure new business. And the headlines around Latin America being in the dumps are interesting, but we believe we can continue to be the exception to that rule as long as we keep focused on driving innovation and new business.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","Got you. And then the follow-up question with respect to international operations and foreign exchange expectations, you highlighted about a $0.36 headwind for the year. That's about $0.10 above the midpoint of the range you gave a couple of months ago. So I guess the question is which currencies have gotten worse since then or is your outlook on the recovery in exchange rate changed for 2016?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think the difference between the old forecast and the new is Venezuela. And a lot of the Venezuela impact we have in FX, because there is, in fact, a huge devaluation of their currency, which was sort of a reflection of the turmoil they have in their economy. So I think that dealt it, and if you have more questions on that, we'd be happy to address them.","In terms of expectations going forward, we've given the best forecast we can. We were way off in terms of our anticipated FX impact in 2015. If you looked at what we thought was going to happen in the first quarter versus what we ended up happening, I think it was $0.18 over plan for the year. We don't pretend to be great at forecasting this. We're trying to give clarity to you so you know what our underlying forecast is and you know what our FX forecast.","Obviously, if FX comes in a lot lighter than we've stated, then we are going to have better results. And conversely, if it's a lot worse than we stated, we're going to have worse results in terms of our adjusted EPS with FX. I think the FX we've got is realistic and makes sense given the environment we think we're in.","Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC","So I understand, I thought that the currency did not include the Venezuelan operations, but if they do, then I guess the guidance was about the same because I think the sum of the two impacts was about $0.40 and now you're guiding to $0.38. So that's pretty much in line. Okay. That's all. Thank you.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today's coming from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Doug, I'm just going to kind of continue to kind of beat this Energy horse over here on, if you can just walk through some of the underlying assumptions, particularly if the WellChem should decline, you're assuming production is flat, but are we going to end up or are you anticipating a scenario where the production goes to kind of the cheaper-to-produce type of oil that just requires less chemicals?","In other words, I'm trying to get to what the assumptions are if we have kind of flat production revenue and (30:40) modestly lower top line, what's embedded in that? I assume there's a little bit of pricing, but are we in a situation where just the oil that they're going after is just cheaper to get oil right now?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I guess. I may even go a little higher on this for a few minutes. I think the big change year-on-year in terms of when we talk about oil's impact, the energy impact on our business, is the fact that we're going against an entirely different base. So when we're giving an EPS forecast and growth forecast, I mean, obviously, we're comparing it against 2015 not 2014, and that's not insignificant when you look at the Energy business. So, the really only negative comparison that we have ever talk is the first quarter. And that's when the market really started diving and our business started feeling the impact of the market.","So, in terms of WellChem, we think WellChem is going to be negative for year, but nowhere near the types of numbers we saw last year. It's going to be mitigated by the fact that it's going against last year. We've gained share in a couple of key segments and we feel a lot of the rig count decline is in the base as we move forward. U.S. is down 62%, so even a 20% decline isn't all that material given that you've already taken 60% of the market.","You have OFC is going to be flattish for the year. We have pricing pressure there. We'll continue to have fairly solid volume. We've got some new business coming on. I mean we have secured some new business. Some fields came on during the year that were basically CapEx that was spent prior years and\/or platforms that went out to sea, etcetera, that's going to be net new business.","In total, we look at that flat to modestly down, but very modest. And in the downstream, we expect to have a stronger year this year on the top line than last year. So net, I think it's a very modest decline in the top line to something resembling this year's decline, which is 8%. I think it's going to be less than that would be the downside case.","When you look at OI, there's mitigating. We've got cost savings going this year, started really seeing full effect in Q4. They're going to annualize. The head count moves have been taken. There are not a lot more anticipated or any really anticipated going forward, but we're going to be very judicious about heads that we add as we move forward. So cost savings are going to be a bigger positive. And the raw material markets are going to continue to benefit the Energy business.","Now part of that is given back in the form of cost-plus arrangements, but not all of it. And so last year, we had some margin decline. Fourth quarter margin was up. Some of that was one-time benefits but it was probably up, if you neutralize for that, about 90 basis points in the fourth quarter. We don't expect it to be that strong throughout the whole year, but we do have steps in place now that we think mitigate margin decline. And we think volume is going to be not a significant story this year. So that's the Energy story.","In net, this natural hedge we have of energy pain offset by raw material gain in the balance of the business is going to be true next year too. Those are almost a net neutral in 2015. We would expect they're going to be close to a net neutral in 2016. And so, then it's back to the Industrial, Institutional, and other businesses, which we think are going to have another strong year. I mean that's the fundamental equation.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much for that color. We didn't hear anything about pension. Last year, we talked a lot about pension. Is there a plus or a minus going on in pension underlying, Dan?","Daniel J. Schmechel - Chief Financial Officer","Hi. So, this is Dan. Thank you. We'll see a favorable year-on-year pension expense, okay, driven by \u2013 primarily by the lower rate environment. We are changing our accounting in the calculation of the pension expense, but we will see a year-on-year benefit. Look, I'd say this, it's largely all offset within the compensation line. You think on the back of a year like this, there's pretty significant variable compensation rebuild that has to go on in the businesses, in the corporation, which offsets most of that. Any remaining piece is essentially offset by less year-on-year benefit in the raw material markets.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So, is there any way to quantify that or way that we should be thinking about that. So when we model our 2017 numbers, we don't assume a similar type of gain?","Daniel J. Schmechel - Chief Financial Officer","It's about $0.14 and $0.14 I think, plus and minus. The pension benefit year-on-year is like a pickup of $0.14, and that's about the offset.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Andy Wittmann from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. I wanted to maybe get a little bit more detail on the margin and kind of break it down. Looks like the SG&A guidance for the year suggest that SG&A will be roughly flat as a percentage of revenue. Gross margin at least the range brackets the 2015 reported number. So I guess the question is, you said that there'd be some margin expansion in 2016. Where does it come from? And do you see it as a result of identifiable cost reductions? I guess you mentioned a little bit in the last question, Doug, or is it more as a result of just operating leverage from the business?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say on the margin improvement in 2016 is pricing, still favorable raw markets, and innovation, and it's a little different by each business. Those are the inputs, mostly it's going to be in gross profit. You're right, SG&A, any pick up we would see from growth and\/or volume benefit is going to be offset by investments.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And then a question on cash flow and the balance sheet. I guess in the part of the script that wasn't highlighted on the call, you mentioned that there's a $700 million buyback assumed. Cash flow, I guess, don't know exactly what it's going to be, but it should be well over $1 billion, probably $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion, I would imagine. So are you expecting to deleverage the balance sheet? Or should we assume that that might be \u2013 that other capital that's not considered in the $700 million buyback is maybe the M&A budget for the year that you hope to deploy?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Since Dan is not at the mike, I'll handle it and he can walk over and correct. So, yeah, free cash this year was $1.2 billion. It was up 15% in 2015 versus 2014, which we considered a strong performance. Cash will be a little beneficial to that next year, but not nearly as dramatic an increase. Uses of cash are going to be nearly identical in 2016 as in 2015, i.e. you saw the share buyback. It's virtually the same number in dollars as last year. And you can go and do your implied M&A, right?","Daniel J. Schmechel - Chief Financial Officer","That's right.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Same number.","Daniel J. Schmechel - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think a good assumption would be that M&A will be directly in line with this year's. Of course what the actual number will be depends on where individual conversations progress.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Daniel J. Schmechel - Chief Financial Officer","But certainly no leveraging is anticipated. We'll be slightly up in debt, but the increase year-on-year in interest expense is really a rate conversation as I indicated earlier.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your questions.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Mike.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Doug, just looking at the organic sales number in Water, you called out the mining piece. I think that's about 15% of sales in Water. So was that down 25% or 30% year-on-year? And can you talk about what the growth rates look like on the light side of Water and heavy side?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it was down. Mining was down double digits in the quarter. It went down 20% or 25%, but we got 15%, and you need a point and a half, I mean, that's what we're talking. And I'm talking on the core Water. There's other parts of the Water business. In terms of heavy, heavy was up 4% in the quarter, and light was up little north of 5%.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","And then looking at the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation, you called out that it's $200 million in revenues. How much of that revenue is in the Energy segment? And I guess I'm under the impression that that was relatively high-margin business. So what's the revenue and operating income impact of that deconsolidation on Energy?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I can't read that number. Energy ought to have been off by 8% (40:45). Energy was $158 million of the $200 million in sales. And I think we gave a total operating income impact number, didn't we?","Daniel J. Schmechel - Chief Financial Officer","No. EPS is $0.17.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh. Okay. EPS is $0.17. You got our share count.","Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right. I can do the math there. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. Good morning \u2013 good afternoon, rather, everyone. Looking at the Paper side, you talked about a decline in Asia-Pacific and then an improvement in North America and Europe, yet paper mills or machines or paper machines are still closing in North America and Europe, and the paper demand is expanding in Asia-Pacific and China especially. So I was just wondering where Ecolab is doing so well and why your result seems to be in opposite direction as to that of the paper industry?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, our Paper business was, what, 3% ex-Venezuela in the fourth quarter, which is probably good in the Paper business and we'd still like to see 5%. So look, tissue, towel and cardboard continue to grow. You're right. We've had to go work through and I think everybody's timing on when they have plants that are being shut down or shuttered is different.","Our business in China is not healthy, and that's obviously in the 3% number. And that's a business that we're working on making sure we get positioned right moving forward, because we do believe it represents a good opportunity long term. And I would just say we've worked hard and this team has worked hard over the years to continue to improve the position, i.e., make sure your pointed to where the growth is both regionally and within the Paper segment.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","And then on the Healthcare, Doug, it is the first time, at least that I remember, where we actually see a little growth. So what are you doing there that is totally different from what you have done in the past? Is it a new marketing team? Have you figured out whom to talk to in order to convince them that they should be cleaning up those hospitals? Could you give us a better feel?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I would say two things. I mean, our Healthcare still is not performing where we want it to, but it did clearly improve. It was 1% growth in 2014. You adjust for the recalls, 3% to 4% in 2015, pick whatever number. It was improved, but not meeting our expectation. We expect it to be stronger this year.","The reason we believe we're accelerating is that we continue to do an improved job convincing healthcare systems that our program makes sense in light of the EHAIC challenge (43:56). And the team has improved the program, improved the story and improved the sales focus. I think what the team has in store, we feel very good about. I think we anticipate that we will continue to accelerate that business. I think that's one of the businesses that has significant upside in our portfolio, outsized upside, if you will, and we aim to get after it. But I would say we are continuing to improve there. Got a good team on it and I think we'll see better things even in 2016 versus 2015.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. And if I may ask one last question, on the M&A, any particular areas where you are focusing more where the opportunities are more attractive than in others?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We've said we have our strategic priorities. With that said, we're open to smart bolt-ons, i.e., think Swisher in virtually every business. But we always figured there was probably going to be significant low-hanging fruit in Water, simply because prior to our acquisition, they were a bit capital-starved, et cetera. So, yeah, Water is a priority. Healthcare is a priority. But if we see good technology and\/or bolt-on opportunities in any of our businesses, we are very willing and able to move forward. So right now, I would say, it's much more what the market is going to offer in terms of what can we buy at a price where we're confident we can deliver good returns for shareholders long-term.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Doug, I was wondering if you could characterize what was different in your Industrial versus your Institutional business in terms of the margin expansion you delivered in 2015.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, if you look at the segment, you'd have to pull out the recall out of Institutional, but even if you do that, you'll see more significant margin expansion in Industrial. And that's just they've got more exposure to the types of raw materials that lowered as a consequence of oil lowering. And it's a mix of raw materials. So that's the single biggest impact and it built throughout the year.","Look, raws go up, go down, we typically work to sell in both our Institutional and Industrial markets based on value delivered. And our equation needs to bring benefits to our customers that are financial in nature as well as, say, safety and\/or risk reduction. And as a consequence, we work hard to do that ongoing so raw materials can benefit us. We tend not to give them back long-term as long as we continue to have a great value story to our customers.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Makes sense. And then can you talk about what you anticipate on sales head count and how that's changed over the last few years? And I think most folks expect GDP to grow in Europe. So is there something more sinister or something about your particular end market exposure that leads you to think Europe could actually decline as a region?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh. Well, one, I'm sorry if I \u2013 I don't think Europe's going to decline as a region.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sorry, decelerate.","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well \u2013 yeah, so this year, our European business, all in, grew by 5%. That's pretty good performance in Europe and we felt pretty good about that. It also had very good OI leverage. It was 100 basis points, 110 basis points, consistent with our Renaissance program that we talked about. So all told, we've added 550 basis points to our Europe margin over the last five years.","Our view on Europe is just that the economy is not going to be as robust in 2016 as 2015. It's not going to go upside down, so we'd expect growth maybe more in the 3% range than in the 5% range, but I don't think that's all the drama. It's 20% of our sales.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Good afternoon. I guess just kind of high level, looking at the 2016 EPS guidance range, what would be the major, I imagine we could guess at the top one or two, but maybe the top three or four swing factors that would put you at the extremes or outside that range?","Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I would say, the number one plus minus is going to have to be FX. The second would be change in the Energy market. I would say, there's probably going to be more impact if it goes up than if it goes down from here. But it could go down bad enough or could have a material impact I imagine too. But it's starting to get squeezed on the downside. And then overall economy, but typically, that doesn't impact us immediately. So, I would say, that's probably a distant third as we look at it.","And then it's just other exogenous events, right, that none of us can predict, but would affect any company dealing in a global basis, be it terrorism or major economic calamity in a market. I would say this, I think our business has proven pretty resilient. If you look at our underlying forecast, we have a midpoint of 11% for EPS ex-FX in 2016. And that's really driven by business performance. It's neutral when you look at shares, interest and tax. And last year, they brought a benefit. So it is indicating that we expect our business performance to be even a bigger contributor in 2016 than in 2015. And the reason we believe that is we have the underlying trends. We know what we've sold. We know where the innovation pipeline is. And we know what's happening on pricing. And so we feel like we're well-positioned to continue to do well even in this environment.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. And then as a follow up just for modeling purposes, Dan, I think you said $0.11 ForEx impact in the first quarter and ballpark a range surrounding $0.20 for the year. How should we think about the cadence for the year just on the way you're looking at it? Thanks.","Daniel J. Schmechel - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, well, sort of as the first quarter and the full year numbers would progress, right. I mean we think that this will drop off a little bit by quarter as you go through the year just based on how the currencies weakened throughout \u2013 continued to weaken throughout 2015.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.

You may now begin your presentation.","Michael Monahan","Thank you. Hello everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's first quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. A discussion of our results, along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results and our outlook, are available on Ecolab's Web site at ecolab.com\/investor.","Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements in these materials, stating that this teleconference and the associated supplemental materials include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described under the Risk Factor section and our most recent Form 10-K, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.","Starting with a brief overview of the results, continued sales growth and margin expansion drove Ecolab's double-digit earnings per share growth in the first quarter. Pricing, new business gains, and product innovation lead the sales and operating income growth, which along with cost efficiency actions of reduced tax rate and lower interest expenses yielded the first quarter's 13% adjusted earnings per share increase.","Moving on to some highlights from the quarter, and as discussed in our press release, acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales increased 3% as the industrial and other segments both showed strong sales gains, and along with modest growth in the institutional segment more than offset a slight sales decline in energy. Adjusted fixed currency operating margins increased 80 basis points, continuing the good acceleration shown throughout 2018. Growth was lead by double-digit gains in the industrial, energy, and other segments. Net operating income increase drove 13% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share to $1.03, representing another quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Currency translation was an unfavorable $0.04 per share in the quarter.","We continue to make progress on the spin-off our upstream business. We currently expect the spin-off to be completed by mid-2020. We continue to work aggressively to drive growth, winning new business through our innovative new products in sales and service expertise, as well as driving pricing, productivity, and cost efficiencies to grow our top and bottom lines, and improve rates across all of our segments. Our digital investments are developing well, and we look for them to add an expanding range of new actionable insights for our customers to improve their operations, enhance their experience working with us, and increase our sales force effectiveness. We continue to expect consolidated 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share to rise 10% to 14% to the $5.80 to $6 range as volume and price gains and cost efficiency benefits more than offset the impact of moderating deliberate product cost increases and business investments.","Currency translation is expected to be an unfavorable $0.11 per share in 2019. Second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the $1.36 to $1.46 range, up 7% to 15%. Currency translation is expected to be an unfavorable $0.05 per share in that quarter. In summary, we expect improving top line momentum in 2019, which should more than offset moderating deliberate product cost increases and unfavorable currency exchange and along with cost efficiency actions yield a 10% to 14% adjust diluted earnings per share growth. We continue to make the right investments in the key areas of differentiation including product innovation, digital investments to develop superior growth for this year and for the future.","And now here is Doug Baker with some comments.","Doug Baker","Thanks Mike and hello. So a quick overview, look, we had a very solid start to the year and are in a good position to deliver 2019. On the plus side, Industrial sales were very strong so were margins as pricing is overcoming inflationary pressures that we have been feeling leading to margin recovery. Energy also had strong margin recovery even with predicted soft sells of -2%. Our other segments, our other specialty businesses QSR and FRS were strong also.","The only disappointing news is Institutional whose sales were weaker than expected. The underlying sales were 4% U.S. and 3% globally. This is better clearly than the 1% reported but still off expectations by a point or so as distribution inventories were reduced, it happens frequently, and the exited business we discussed last quarter converted quicker than we had forecast. We expect the Institutional business to show improvement and reported an underlying sales through the year particularly in the second half.","So, as we finished the first quarter and move into the balance of the year, we are well-positioned we believe. The heaviest lifting of our U.S. SAP implement is behind us with our fourth and final supply chain wave completed in the first quarter of '19. Our pricing, cost savings, innovation, digital, and talent initiatives are all on track. A new business is tracking ahead of last year's record pace. As a result, we expect to deliver double digit adjusted EPS for the year ending every quarter and most importantly leave the year with good momentum as well.","So with that, I am going to turn it back to Mike who will open up Q&A.","Michael Monahan","That concludes our formal remarks. As a final note before we start Q&A, we plan to hold our annual tour of our booth at the National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago on Monday May 20. Looking further ahead, we also plan to hold our 2019 Investor Day on Thursday September 5. If you have any questions, please contact our office.","Operator, would you please begin the question-and-answer period?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","David Ridley-Lane","Hi, this is David Ridley-Lane filing in for Gary Bisbee. Can you discuss the revenue trends in Europe particularly in your core segments, Institutional and Industrial?","Doug Baker","Yes. We had a strong quarter in Industrial than Institutional. Industrial was organic 5 and Institutional was down a point. QSR had a fairly strong quarter, so if we put them together you end up with a little better answer. Institutional, Europe, I think is an area where we feel like we are doing the right things to improve this. We put a new GM in Europe late last year. The new GM, Martin [indiscernible] starting Institutional; he was the GM who turned around Pest [ph] North America. We have added a sales field leadership position in Europe reporting to Martin. And collectively, that team is focusing on three things, localizing innovation. We have got too global in much of our institutional approach. We want to make sure that we are doing the right things and making sure our innovation is tailored for local approach. We are also enhancing field execution discipline. This is really the key role in the sale field leadership position. We are also adding sales fire power by converting some field resources we are little heavy and converting them into corporate account selling resources. Obviously, it's not same bodies in every case, but it's the same money.","David Ridley-Lane","And then as a just a quick follow-up, heard the comment on new business growth, could you maybe quantify that a little bit? Or, put that into context of your hiring -- average hiring on the sales force? Chances are getting increased productivity out of sales force as well of just hiring more people? Thank you.","Doug Baker","Yes, over 2018, we added about 3% in sales and service resources last year. So, we feel we are in a good position to take care of the growth that we are generating as we move forward.","David Ridley-Lane","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chip Moore with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","Chip Moore","Thanks, wondering if you could touch on Life Sciences as it continued outperform the market very nicely there, Doug, maybe talk a bit about the runway for growth. Any changes you are seeing in the competitive there?","Doug Baker","Yes. No, the Life Sciences business continues to do well. And while it was performing decently before we, if you will, created a focused Life Sciences business, it clearly has kicked into a higher gear. And we've averaged double digit since that point in time. Look, we love that market. So the market is global. It's consolidated many cents. If you think about the customer set, fairly fragmented competitive set. That's a good environment for us. We continue to reach out and drive our advantage which I would say is kind of three front. We have very good clean room technology. We have world class CIP technology so the lessons that we have learnt over the years in food & beverage and increasingly in other industrial applications perfectly applies here. And then, finally, the water capabilities that we have are really well-suited for this industry as well because it's a prime source for contamination potentially et cetera.","And so, we are leveraging these advantages quite successfully growing that business. We made an acquisition as you will recall in U.K. Bioquell just fourth quarter is when we closed. And so that's going to also give us additional technology and a new entry point, if you will, into this market. Finally, we just added manufacturing capability in North America where we have now registered products. So, it's going to open up in much broader swath of the U.S. market. And we have been able to compete against previously. That will in essence change competitive environment for us, I don't think for the worse simply because we will be able to go after bigger part of the market.","Chip Moore","Got it. That's helpful. And just a follow-up, in terms of you mentioned the U.K. acquisition, is there a pipeline of potential targets in that space?","Doug Baker","Absolutely. And I would say it's relatively new space for us. And so it's not an area that we probably mined as heavily as we have others in the past. So, yes, there is a nice long list. Obviously, it's going to be at the right time, right price et cetera.","Chip Moore","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good afternoon, Doug. Just on the Institutional side, you talked about the distribution inventory issue. Could you just elaborate that -- elaborate on that and maybe in past quarters where it might have happened so that we can take a look back? And if that was the main reason why you were a point or two behind your expectations there?","Doug Baker","Yes. Clearly, it was one of the issues. I would say distributor inventories move up and down and we have printouts from the distributors. So we know where every case moves to. Meaning, we have a very good understanding of consumption in the industry, and as a consequence it's very easy for us to understand what's happening in terms of distributor inventories up or down based on ins and outs if you will. So this happens almost every year in a quarter, we have some conversation. Last year, in the first quarter, our conversation was the opposite. Distributors had built inventory during that quarter and we talked about how the reporting number was a little stronger than the actual underlying sales at that time and that don't expect that immediately in the second quarter, but we expect to end the year in a 5% run rate.","So this happens frequently. If I were going to sum up institutional, I would say this. We expected a downtick in Q1, part because of the previously announced [indiscernible] low margin business. However, it was worse than we expected which we talked about in my opening remarks and Mike referred to. So one, the low margin business exited faster than we had forecast and expected. That's not going to result in any change long-term. It's just the timing issue. The distributors did drop inventory in the quarter, which happened typically we'll see a rebalancing in that come back and follow-on quarters, I can't predict if that's Q2 or Q3. It's probably one of those two.","In the final piece, I would describe for lack of a better term is the fog of war, and this is related to the SAP U.S. implementation. This doesn't mean we lost consumption because of SAP -- we didn't. But when you do these implementations, and I'll just remind you, we had four waves in the U.S. [technical difficulty] a couple of months ago. The first wave was the February before and wave three was in quarter four. And what happens during these waves is you preload i.e. build inventory in your direct customers and in the trade. You do it in case you have a supply chain short-circuit as part of cutover. Now, we never saw a short circuit. We were able to get up and running very quickly in every one of our waves, but you still prepare as if that may happen so that you don't end up shorting customers. But as a consequence after these waves was all this rebalancing activity. And so it's noisy short-term and hard to go figure out exactly what's happening.","In Q4, North America Institutional was up 6%, but that was driven by a 7% growth number in U.S. Institutional and we said at the time it's higher than our run rate, don't use that as a terminal value. We knew it's a little inflated. We weren't exactly sure how or how much, and as we look at first quarter, obviously we see a lower than expected number and certainly in that wash there is this rebalancing and all the other stuff going on here. Now, when we look at March and April we see much more normal activity in our North American, particularly U.S. institutional business and see sales as we would've expected all along. So we think the noise as we would expect from past experiences sort of moving out of the business and what we're going to see is more normal behavior.","So when we look at all the underlying things, pricing, new business, other than the low margin stuff I've talked about, a lot of stuff is exactly on track. We know that if we continue to focus on these things we'll show improvement. The key metrics to us are new business and pricing. If we drive these, and we expect to, the rest self cures. The loss is annualized the distributor inventory is rebalanced, and the SAP implementation costs which are not insignificant by the way and in 70% hit institutional are also recouped.","So, there's some natural like margin lift as we move through this just as we start getting through this noisy period. We think we'll see an improvement in Q2. I'd say modest, but a more significant improvement as we get into the second half in institutional. So I think we have a good understanding of what's going on. Business is doing what it needs to do to go drive value and we expect institutional to be a strong business as it always is.","Manav Patnaik","That's super helpful with the color. Maybe just along the same lines on industrial, like, should we think of that 7% growth is sustainable or maybe there's some timing in, it might sort of stabilize later?","Doug Baker","Yes, look our industrial business is really led by water and F&B have obviously been strengthening sequentially for a number of quarters. It's driven by both pricing activity and by volume, volume driven by a lot of new business which we've been talking about right in almost every call how we're having very good new business success. That's clearly in the water and F&B business in particular, also in institutional et cetera. The food and beverage rate, organic growth rate is 7%. I wouldn't say that's our terminal value but F&B has really done a heck of a job partnering with water to bring outsized value to customers and this turned into big sales with big players.","Now annualize again some of these sales in quarter, so every quarter is not going to be a seven organic. But with that said, we expect to have a very strong year in F&B and a very strong year in water. So it's exactly sustainable. I'm not going to commit that to every quarter but we expect mid to high single digit organic growth rates in these businesses and we also are starting to see the margin leverage that we've talked about, we had significant raw material and logistic inflation impacting all of our businesses but in particular our industrial businesses. And so, they've been on pricing and this pricing is now starting to overwhelm the inflation in that business and we're starting to recoup the margin losses that we've seen. But this isn't going to be overnight either. Right, this is going to take us some time to rebuild these margins but you should expect to see positive margin build throughout this year and it's going to need to continue into next year.","So, some of that's going to come from pricing, some from cost savings, some from doing a better job operating supply chain now that over 80% of our volume is on SAP. So we just have better visibility and a better and a more easier, if you will kind of foundation to run on. So those are not the key things to look for and watch particularly in the industrial business.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.","Laurence Alexander","Good afternoon. Two questions, so first on the institutional growth rate as you think about the cadence of this year and the pricing initiatives you have underway, should we see that business sort of exit the year at about a 4% to 5% kind of run rate? Is that a fair way to think about it and secondly can you give a little bit of flavor about colloidal and how long you think that can sustain a double-digit growth rate?","Doug Baker","Yes, I'll do the small one first. Colloidal, I would say colloidal is an interesting technology. We have it, there's capacity constraints in the world and other areas will continue to drive the growth there. But that business we're going to continue to manage, we think very intelligently for cash and return and other things. We want to do the right thing for our customers. But we're also going to do the right things for shareholders as we look at this business. In institutional, yes I would say there's really not a caveat because if you want to say do we expect to be at a 4% to 5% run rate if on December 31, the answer would be yes because by that time, we would have no longer be lapping the lost business, right. It would be pretty much out of our sales. So I think that would be a comfortable yes that we would exit the year at that run rate because of that.","Laurence Alexander","Okay. And can you give a bit of a flavor for how you're thinking about the sales force incentive programs that is are you comfortable with the current sets or are we going to go through one of these periodic refresh and refocus my calls. Can you just give us a sense for where is your rationale on that?","Doug Baker","I would say we re-look at comp every year and make minor adjustments almost every year. And there are episodic times where we go through major adjustment in a given business meaning we went through one in past about three years ago quite successfully I would add you could even you could even see it in the business but we change a comp there dramatically. In institutional, there's certainly areas of that business where we are going to revise comp programs part to reflect new regulations or the way regulations are being enforced and some because we think it's going to just and we'll do that in a way like we did with past where I don't think it's going to be visible to anybody except those in the business. You know we want great people. We want great people the incentive to do the right thing and also incentive enough where they want to continue to stay here and can make enough money to make a career out of it. And so we always have evolutionary change around here and I wouldn't there's nothing on the horizon that I would say would be noteworthy.","Laurence Alexander","And maybe if you wouldn't mind just one last one on health care is there a reason why the business model there hasn't flexed more in response to this the disappointing growth rates. I mean like why it hasn't evolved into like a partnership with an insurance company or some kind of other way to get an end run around the bottlenecks that you've seen in terms of the purchasing managers.","Doug Baker","Yes, well look we've certainly explored a bunch of different things here. Here's what I would say. You know the healthcare business our program business which is really what we're emphasizing continues to do well. These are programs around room cleaning to reduce HAIC around all our turnover and accelerating turnover both time and efficacy and also in central sterile et cetera. These programs are doing quite well. The issue which is principally in the U.S. is just one of portfolio mix. These programs are still relatively small versus what I'd call the historic product approach. And as time goes on obviously since the programs are growing so much faster than the products, they're becoming a larger percent of the portfolio. And what you'll see is that sales will reflect that - but that just is going to take some time and the team I think is doing exactly the right thinking and after that but that is having good uptake. In Europe our mix is a little bit better and in Europe we expect to have mid single digit, low single digit organic growth rate, [indiscernible] is doing well in Europe, they've got very strong program mix in a number of areas.","Some of those we're exporting to other parts of the world including the U.S. once we get registrations. So I would say underneath the covers we think the healthcare business is more right than wrong. It's certainly we would like to accelerate it. We would like to see faster better results too. But if you look underneath, good things are happening and we want to make sure that we stay focused on what we think the long term advantage is.","Laurence Alexander","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","Josh Spector","Hey guys this is Josh Spector on for John. Just a question around energy, given some drivers with spin around customer buying patterns shifting and maybe moving a bit away from kind of the Ecolab heritage model and slower growth there in the quarter, do you see any risk of another shift going on that could impact the second half? Or do you have pretty good visibility into the sales growth there?","Doug Baker","Yes. The energy quarter if you will -- the soft sales of negative 2%, I mean -- we expected it to be flattish coming into this quarter -- plus or minus. And so the 2% to us what kind of weather at plus 2's then minus 2, no doubt about it but it was around where we expected it to be, it's not the easiest business to forecast and really we expected these types of top line results for two reasons.","One there is a dramatic reduction in just activity, a lot of this is occurring in Permian. I mean if you look at others in this business you're going to see -- I would say even lower sales rates than we had. And so we're not alone. It'd probably be on the better side. The second reason was we were going against a high base i.e. first quarter last year was an 11% growth quarter and even at the time we said it was in part driven by one timers and we knew those one timers weren't going to recur again in this quarter. Hence the reason we were sort of bearish on the first quarter. So it's not a change in buying pattern, it's not a change and all of a sudden we're out of favor at all. We would expect that as the year goes on, you're going to see stronger top line performance.","And most importantly, even in the first quarter with negative 2%, with double-digit LI growth in that business. As we are recovering on the margin side handily due to the pricing work that we talked about every quarter last year and is continuing and now is being coupled with excellent cost savings efforts as well impacting both gross profit and SG&A. So we expect mid-single digits in this business for the year top line, and outstanding margin recovery driving even much better live results for the year as well. So I'm not, I'm not really worried. I think the stuff that the energy business is doing is smart right, and it's going to bear fruit for the year.","Josh Spector","Okay, thanks. And just a quick follow-up on around the energy spend. I don't know if it's too early to ask about any numbers around that. But I guess if I try to think about how much amortization stays with Ecolab and goes with the spin, do you have a rough cut there?","Doug Baker","Yes, $170 million of amortization goes with the spin.","Josh Spector","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Thank you, Doug. You have new competitors, the last six to nine months in water and institutional. How are they acting in the marketplace?","Doug Baker","Well, I guess our new competitor and institutional would be new owner.","David Begleiter","New owner, yes, I'm sorry.","Doug Baker","Yes. And I would say they're acting like they've always acted. So I don't, we really don't see a significant difference, it can be really aggressive at times bidding on new business. This has been a pattern for years and years. There have been frequent times over the last -- I've been here 30 years anytime during the 30 years, but over the last 15, 20 I have a better memory where we've blinked and walked from business where we're not going to make money, in some cases not make cash. And we don't think that's smart to stay in those situations. And we've had some recently, but we've had them two years ago, three years ago, five years ago, seven years ago, 10 years ago. In many instances, these businesses end up back with us, not a 100% but a fairly high percentage. And what we want to make sure that we do is maintain our ability to do a great job for customers. We are there for customers when they need us and we've got to be able to make money so that we continue to invest in innovation, and digital and all the like, and so we got to be play a disciplined game, as well, and that's the story there.","On the water side, you know, GE Water is known by SUEZ. I don't know that there's, a dramatic difference day-to-day. We were, we thought we are well positioned against GE Water. And I'm not, we respected them. We respect them now that they're owned by SUEZ, but we remain in our minds quite well positioned as a competitor in this area. And you can see it in the strong results. So I don't think our competitive environment has really dramatically changed one way or another.","David Begleiter","Very good and just selling, you delivered product costs. I know there'll be migrating of the year. What were they up year-over-year in Q1, Doug, and what should that be up by the end of the year on a quarter or maybe on a Q4 over prior year basis?","Doug Baker","Yes, we're forecasting 3% to 4% inflation for the year. You know, I'll be honest, for the first quarter was, the most significant year-on-year 5 plus probably percent increase in the first quarter, but at a base for two reasons. I mean, mostly because we start running into an inflated base. If you will i.e. raw materials got more expensive throughout the year last year. So the Delta decreases as you move forward. As long as you don't see dramatic inflation this year, we have some inflation forecasts this year. We've held that forecast last year, we got burned on raw materials. The indices we follow, we are completely wrong last year. If you looked at the indices this year, they would say that inflation is going to be less than we have forecast currently. We don't know if that turns into upside for us or not. We're being a little more conservative this year based on last year's experience which means we'll be wrong two years in a row I hope.","David Begleiter","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks. If I could just ask a question on pricing and you touched on this a bit earlier in the institutional comments but just want to know how price was across the segments if there were any meaningful discrepancies or anywhere where you were still need to work a little bit harder. And then just within institutional is price flattered at all by the exit of the low margin businesses in any meaningful way?","Doug Baker","No, but they would show up in for us in more mix and it would have an absolute price the way that we measure the margin stuff, I would say two things. We continue to accelerate on price, if you will, it's five quarters in a row. And so, it still is around the 3% rate, industrial had the strongest price number they needed because one they were probably the furthest behind and have been playing catch up and doing a very good job doing it but they got a couple of years a big raw material inflation numbers in their business and they're working to recover those and obviously working with customers to do it in a way that works et cetera.","Institutional always takes more a slow and steady approach on pricing. They don't get hit in rock significantly with raw materials as some of our other businesses do, partisan mix of the raw materials in part is solids and the other technology that they've deployed over the years and so they've got a lower more like a two price if you will year-on-year and energy was also 3% in the quarter as well, energy also obviously see significant plays and we expect to continue to get pricing throughout the year, we need to, we have margin recovery goals. Our plan isn't to expand margins during this cycle but we certainly our goal isn't to lose margin either as a result of this, we'll expand margins through our own efforts internally i.e. leveraging the SAP implementation and other work to help improve margin and or innovation but that that's where we are on price. I would say team is doing a very good job in a very, it's always hard.","Vincent Andrews","And just as a follow-up on the de-stocking, it sounds like from your comments earlier that this would be something that would take place within a quarter that it wouldn't straddle two quarters based on your look at the printouts of the books and stuff in the conversations with the distributor customers is that correct?","Doug Baker","Yes, we don't expect. I mean look we don't control and absolutely obviously, if I went on history and we go through this literally every year in a quarter and obviously when it helps us nobody remembers it and when it hurts us you don't remember what the bounces back. And I would say this is a very normal thing, we would expect it to bounce back and as I said earlier, I don't know exactly if that second quarter or third quarter but it's probably one of the two most likely that's typically the pattern we've seen in the past and there's no reason to believe that that won't be the pattern we see here.","Vincent Andrews","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Hamzah Mazari","Hey, good afternoon. Thank you. My first question is any update you can provide as to your circling the customer initiative, specifically which verticals it seems like food and beverage is one which may be sort of optimized in terms of selling your entire product suite to corporate clients and where you think there's room to sort of improve that?","Doug Baker","Yes, look it's been a key part of our strategy and a key part of our success particularly in industrial as we put Nalco, I mean, Nalco a part of Ecolab. We came out of the gates and said one of the key areas we wanted to focus on was the F&B market. And if you look at what's occurred in F&B over the last six years, it's been really amazing. And if you look at the brewery business in particular, how we've been able to very successfully marry water in our F&B cleaning and place, food safety technologies together to create outsized value for customers, it's driven share and it's been a key part of how we went to market strategically, how we created value for customers and the reason that we've won coupled with that is always pest elimination.","It's also lead us to understand other parts of the pest business like fumigation, and it's then lead pest to start one buying and acquiring some fumigation businesses which we've done recently and starting to build a larger business in that area because it's core to the F&B market. So that's a great example of how circle the customer drives value for customer's share for the company and also opens the door to new opportunities as well. There are other examples. I mean, I can do -- we're watching technology being leveraged in QSR and in some instances in our food retail business, coupling with the institutional capabilities. I mean, there's plenty more, but I don't want to take up too much more time.","Hamzah Mazari","No, that's helpful, and just a follow-up. On health care -- and you may have touched on this earlier in a question, but specifically, does your go-to-market strategy in that segment need to change? Specifically, you know, more of a C-suite type sale? Are you just talking to the wrong people in health care? I'm just curious around go-to-market, if that's a drag at all on growth. So you may have touched on this, but any color there? Thank you.","Doug Baker","No, I think we talked health care earlier. So I'll just sum this like I think the way -- we've really focused strategically on program selling there. And the programs that we have out in the market are growing and we're having success selling them. And those are programs around room cleaning and HAIC reduction, operating theater, if you will, changeover and also better efficacy and then also in the central, and both programs are working and growing. Now, the issue which is principally U.S. is they're just -- they're still a relatively small piece of the total portfolio. So that failed to sort of mask if you will, by the product sales that represents the balance of the portfolio where you don't have the same strategic advantages that we have in program selling. So our nose is to the grindstone, sell programs, keep focusing, the portfolio will shift overtime, because it's growing at 3x, 4x faster than the others -- we know what will happen and then you'll start seeing the sales come through, but that's our strategic focus and there we are -- this is clearly calling on the right people. We're not flying the white flag on the product side, but it's just a different competitive environment and equation which is why we're -- our efforts are going towards programs.","Hamzah Mazari","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. And so, moving on to Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.","Tim Mulrooney","Good afternoon.","Doug Baker","Hello.","Tim Mulrooney","So first, Doug, your industrial business, can you just give us an update on the industrial business in China? It's hard to know what's going on over there sometimes, but your numbers are so strong. So just curious if the market is getting better or worse or about the same?","Doug Baker","Yes, look our China business, overall, was mid singles growth -- mid single-digit growth in the first quarter, decent profit. I would say it was really driven by the institutional side so I'm getting to the point you'd like me to talk about. And institutional collectively was double-digits doing quite well. The industrial side of the business was flat to down modestly in total, really driven by paper, which was down more dramatically. They're not making as much corrugated for export shipments in the meantime as we go through this. So certainly we're impacted somewhat with the trade discussions there.","We don't see this ultimately turtling our China business for the year by any means. We think it'll probably. One, if we get the trade agreement figured out, it'll open the door, but even barring that as we look at the progression and everything else, we think we got more good and bad net business and we're going to have a good year either way.","Tim Mulrooney","Okay. Thanks for the update. My follow-up is on SG&A, SG&A adjusted for one time, it was actually lower than the last year despite revenue growth. Is that primarily the result of your cost savings initiative and do you expect a similar dynamic through the remainder of the year?","Doug Baker","Yes, I would say SG&A certainly we have, strong cost savings initiatives in place. We would have said in the first quarter probably delivered about 20 million bucks, which is on page to the 80 that we've talked about. For a handicap the year, we probably have upside and the cost savings side of the initiative pile in terms of you need some upside because you never know what's going to happen and other things like FX, et cetera. So yes, those are driving it. We're also leveraging technology in a number of parts of our business as we go forward, and this is also enabling us to do more via each person. So it's a combination of things but cost saving certainly is a driver.","Tim Mulrooney","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.","John McNulty","Yes, thanks for taking my question. A quick or one or two of them, one on the raw material front, where are the buckets that you're actually seeing the inflation because it does seem a little bit counterintuitive, given oil coming off the way that it has that you are forecasting something in kind of the low-to-mid single digits for the year. So maybe help us to understand where you're seeing some of those pressures.","Doug Baker","Yes, well, oil year-on-year is up nearly 50%. So, it's you know, we got to go compare back to Q1 last year. That's what our comparison is here. But beyond if you will sort of oil derivative raw materials, certainly caustic is up for us, transportation costs grew double-digit last year, particularly in the U.S., but we had inflation also in other markets, Europe in particular. So, our two biggest markets, if you will, so the number of areas where there has been inflation in raw materials. And you know, I would say last year was significant it followed a fairly significant year, the year before. So as you kind of a two-year run, we are forecasting, moderation and the inflation rate, but not deflation this year. We still think that's the right forecast. And we hope we are on.","John McNulty","Got it. And then it's been a couple months since you announced the split or potential or the upcoming split of the upstream energy business. Can you speak to whether or not you've seen interest from potential buyers in that business at this point?","Doug Baker","Yes, that's not something we would comment on publicly one way or another.","John McNulty","Got it. Fair enough. Thanks for the time.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you. So when you look at your various platforms, what are the largest opportunities to improve margins over the long-term outside of simply price cost is suppressed, perhaps shifting more even more, even more I'd say to us service model and just, I know institutional in Europe has clearly been a longer term opportunity, but where are the other ones that long-term you know guys should be thinking about? Thank you.","Doug Baker","Yes, look, I think there are a number of areas. I mean, you started in Europe and we had a 3% OI margin in Europe and are now nine and knocking on double-digit. And we've done all that over 7, 8-year period of time. And I would say the opportunities that existed there still exist and they exist everywhere else. And so, as we now have SAP implemented through our supply chain and our finance backbone, and in North America, we now have visibility and different visibility into the U.S. markets. And we've had ever via ERP. I mean, it's replacing a system called Collinet [ph], which we think is 40 years old, but we can't find any marker on the box.","So, let me just say our visibility is enhanced significantly. So we would expect there's significant savings in supply chain. The -- if you will, kind of free channels throughout North America. The pricing on those channels has changed dramatically over the last 2 years. We know that we've got to recognize that in the way that we shift supply or manufacturing in plants and where do we supply, what customer from where and how do we do that? There's significant money there. We know that there's a number of policy issues that we're getting after that didn't reflect the current reality and now -- do that is going to reduce the number of shipments it takes to shift the volume we're shipping today. So we know we've got to get better standards there; formulation reductions, not just SKU, the most important part of SKU is formulas, if you reduce formulas, we reduce raw materials and end up with more scale and buying. And so there's a lot of work around that area, right now in energy but increasingly in our water business and in other areas as well.","If you look at just relative margins by business, we know there's significant upside still in water and some of the other businesses that came over the Nalco acquisition. Their margins have been enhanced significantly since they've come over. But the team does not believe we're at the edge there or at the end by any means. And we want to keep driving that. So we talk about 50 to 75 basis points in sort of your typical run rate. Clearly with the announcement of the accelerate initiative and the cost savings there and also that we're in margin recovery zone time because of those recent run ups we expect to run significantly over that range for a period of time. We need to recover and get back on track and margin build.","Christopher Parkinson","And yes I apologize for the stereotypical simple sell side question but can you comment on the overall M&A landscape particularly in Asia and Europe. Thank you very much.","Doug Baker","Well Europe's probably as good as it gets in the U.S. right now simply because a lot of people were unsettled. And with that often comes opportunity certainly in the U.K. but I would also say on the continent in terms of Asia you know I mean the challenge in Asia as is scale and culture i.e. can you buy a company that's meaningful enough in size to be worth the risk and the effort to bring it on an integrated and then culturally and this isn't the Asian culture just make sure it is a company what's the company's culture and how it been built in terms of how it sells and creates value et cetera.","So there, you know, we've got to be make sure that it's a company that we would have a right to own and run as we go forward. Generally I guess you know I think or we're going to enter a period where you know acquisitions of even size are going to make sense again. I know it'll happen I don't know exactly when it's going to happen. But being smart about the price you pay is always a good idea. And it proves out over time we believe that value is created through return on invested capital and our ability to generate cash. And those are the things that we look very carefully at when we make acquisitions that can we do those things over a period of time and the answer is yes we're all in it the answer is no we're quite careful unless it's got some seminal strategic value beyond just cash creation which is hard to find often.","Christopher Parkinson","Great color. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your questions.","Mike Harrison","Hi good morning. I was wondering Doug if you can talk a little bit about what kind of trends you're seeing in restaurant foot traffic and if you could maybe talk about that by region, sounds like really, really outside of Latin America, nothing's really much to write home about.","Doug Baker","Yes. Mike I would say I kind of agree I think you know the -- I would say this I don't think the foot traffic anywhere is going to impact our business. It's neither dramatically. I mean you know the places where you got fast, fast growth and food services Asia and you know we're all about scaling getting after share we've made a number of key moves in the last 12 months in China which we think put us in a much better position to get after that business on a faster basis. I mean it's a business it's already growing in the teens but it should do better. And we're working to do that. In the U.S. your foot traffic seems to have been soft my whole career and you know yet every time I walk into a restaurant it seems to be full. So I can't quite get over these two problems. And you know but by and large throughout that period we've had very good growth. There are a zillion restaurants we don't sell yet. We would like to sell them. So until we have 100 share we're not going to talk about foot traffic is our problem.","Mike Harrison","All right. And then when I also ask about the strength that you're seeing in food and beverage are we seeing any improvement at all in the underlying market there or is it really just share gain that we're still capturing?","Doug Baker","That's principally driven by share gain. I mean people are still eating obviously but you know you've got some markets that are still fighting through some challenges. But you know the team's done a very good job for all the reasons I discussed earlier partnering with water and Pepsi et cetera driving outsized value which is leading to some very significant wins.","Mike Harrison","All right thanks very much.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with G. Research. Proceed with your questions.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Doug I was wondering if you could give us a little more detail on how the changes you have made in order to grow faster in China. You said double digit is good but you can do a lot better. So what changes have you made?>","Doug Baker","I think in a couple of areas. So if you want to talk institutional we've organized a bit differently simply because that food service market is developing differently than markets have in the past part they get to learn from U.S. history and European history. They have concepts which don't - fit neatly in boxes and we've got to go be prepared to offer what those concepts need and a around service custom designed for those concepts not maybe the same exact service package that we've had in other markets so designed for China.","So we've invested more if you will on innovation resources in China on digital for China resources in China, organize our constructive businesses a bit differently to allow a better blurring of lines and have somebody overseeing it, so they can make smart choices for customers first and by doing that for the company. So they've been a number of steps and most notably increased resources. And so for all those reasons we think we're just better positioned, we've learned a lot over the last few years. We've done decently. But as we look at it we just thought the way we were structured and the way we were resource was a hindrance if you will not - an offensive weapon and we wanted to change that.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay. And then looking at -- now you have your SAP more or less internationally installed, so now that you have this, can you see the potential benefit from the restructuring to be above the 325 million that you have initially estimated?","Doug Baker","Yes I wouldn't, I mean look, we would agree with you as long as it's positive for the business i.e. doesn't hinder our ability to deliver for customers more would be better and not lost on us. But we're not in a position right now to increase our estimate of those. I mean we just took it up 125 million from 200 -- 325 when we announced the spin, which will enable us as we all recall to both cover the 70 million of estimated stranded costs and still deliver 200 and if you will, Ecolab ex spin. And so I think it positions as well. And on the spin side there'll be more than able to cover their costs of building the kind of public company infrastructure that they need to build which they estimated 35. So I think we're in good shape there, if we can do more we will. It behooves us and the shareholders and that's what we're paid to do.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thanks and if I may squeeze one in. You said that you were expecting to close the Bioquell acquisition by the end of the year by the fourth quarter. Are there some issues regarding the competitive environment, are you dealing with anything that you may have to change?","Doug Baker","Oh yes. Bioquell we did close. I mean we've close but we're going through a competitive review and you know I would say right now you know we're working with the authorities and in the appropriate way and that's the path we'll follow.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Good afternoon Doug. Specialty has been a real bright spot in global institutional another good quarter and you cited I believe some business wins I saw also that second quarter may slow down a bit on new customer rollouts but still a solid year. Please elaborate a little bit on this sub-segment, what is going on with the new business wins in some of these initiatives that you've highlighted in the release. Thanks.","Doug Baker","Yes, I would say both the QSR teams and the food retail teams are doing a really good job of one driving new business. They're leveraging innovation to do it. They have a strong pipeline. They've been at the forefront on institutional and digital food safety technology which is already making a difference and we think going to make increasingly a difference in their ability to secure new wins going forward. That's been significant development cost which has really been borne principally in the institutional side of the equation. And so you know that starts bearing fruit. I think you're going to see enhanced margin as well as we go forward. So there are a number of large opportunities that exist both in QSR and as far as U.S. and around the world that I think our team is doing a good job targeting and getting after.","There are occasions. So we give you a heads up on Q2 that they may have slower than current run rate sales for a quarter that's on a lap an unusual quarter the year before where you might have had a pipeline load for a new customer i.e. you've got to build their distribution network and their stores simultaneously which just means you get four months and three you know and when you lap that it's tough to replicate it. So, we just try to give fair warning that occurs in many of our businesses occasionally through quarters throughout the year.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. And one more if I could. The CapEx and free cash flow a little a little lower this year in the first quarter than last year I guess you last year a bit of a unique compier but just any thoughts -- I know it's early in the year about what we should expect from these two going forward for the full-year.","Doug Baker","Dan, can have that one?","Dan Schmechel","Thank you. Sure. Absolutely so, yes, you're right, it was annualized and first of all in the first quarter of '19 against a very strong performance last year in which we grew the business but consumed almost nothing in the way of incremental cash flow. So part of the year-on-year comparison is what you're seeing. Look, we still feel great both about our longer term record of delivering great cash flow generation from the company and think that 2019 will be another great example of that. So sitting here today I expect that our free cash flow conversion which is the metric that I track most closely will be in the mid 90% range. So feel good about cash flow and how it's developing and for the year.","Scott Schneeberger","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Thank you. This is [indiscernible] on for PJ. In water, could you just discuss the growth profiles underlying and in light industry versus heavy industry. And perhaps provide an update on 3D TRASAR penetration.","Doug Baker","Yes, they were very close in fact. Not a big differentiation in growth rates between heavy and light. So both performed quite well and we expect both to perform well for the year, terms of 3D TRASAR unit penetration at this point time, I mean we're nearing 40,000 units outstanding if we give you an exact number if it's important if you want to call Mike or Andy.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then secondly your first quarter volume growth to 1% is kind of lagging the overall fiscal year '18 with 4%. How do you see that going forward? And do you expect price to make up delta?","Doug Baker","Talking about - the 1% for the company?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, 1% of the first quarter versus 4% for the full-year '18.","Doug Baker","Yes, I mean the 1% was clearly impacted also by FX and FX is going to be a particular challenge in the first quarter and second quarter, but at current rates and forecast not a significant challenge in the second-half. So, some of it's just that. The other we talked, institutional, which we expect to improve, and energy we expect to improve.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Monahan, there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","Michael Monahan","Thank you. That wraps up our first quarter conference call. This conference call and the associated discussion slides will available for replay on our Web site. Thank you for your time and participation, and our best wishes for the rest of the day.","Operator","Thank you for participation. Today's conference has concluded.
