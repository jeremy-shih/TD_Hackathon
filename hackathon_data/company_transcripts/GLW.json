Welcome to Corning First Quarter Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Now I'd like to introduce Ken Sofio, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Sofio","Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to Corning's first quarter conference call. Jim Flaws, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, will start the call with some prepared remarks. Wendell Weeks, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; as well as Dr. Richard Eglen, Vice President and General Manager of Life Sciences, will join us for the Q&A. ","Today's remarks contains forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks are detailed in the company's SEC reports.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Flaws.","James B. Flaws","Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Hopefully, you had a chance to read the press release we issued this morning on our first quarter results. If you haven't, a copy can be found on our Investor Relations website.","I'd like to begin with our key messages this morning. Two months ago, at our Annual Investor Meeting, we announced we were facing a significant reset in the company's profit levels. The reset was primarily due to significant price declines we were experiencing in our Display business over the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012. We told you one of the most important objectives was to reduce the level of these very significant quarterly price declines. This morning, I'm very pleased to report we expect our glass price declines in the second quarter will be much more moderate than the average of the previous 2 quarters. In terms of glass shipments, Display volume was better than we expected in the first quarter. Volume at our wholly-owned business was up in the mid-single-digits sequentially versus our expectations of being flat. SCP volumes were down less than 10% sequentially, which was also better than our guidance of down in the low double-digits.","We told you at our Investor Meeting that in addition to needing significant slowdown in the glass price declines, we also needed to continue to grow our other businesses. I'm very pleased that in the first quarter, all our other businesses grew sequentially. Specialty Materials sales were up 21%, led by the stronger-than-expected demand for Gorilla Glass. Sales in Environmental were up 12%, also more than anticipated.","We also told you to reach our goal of $10 billion sales by 2014, we would supplement organic growth with acquisitions. Hopefully, you saw our announcement to acquire a significant portion of Becton Dickinson's Discovery Labware unit. This acquisition is expected to be completed later this year and is part of our strategy to becoming a bigger, more balanced company. We're delighted with this pending transaction. Several years ago, we established a plan to grow our Life Sciences business to be a $1 billion business. We have grown organically, and with the acquisitions of Axygen, Gosselin and Mediatech reached nearly $600 million last year. The pending purchase of BD's Discovery Labware unit will complement our existing portfolio and provide access to new customers. We believe this business will help catapult our Life Science segment towards its $1 billion goal by 2014. I'll share some more details on this shortly.","I do want to stress this transaction will not impact our ability to increase dividends or buy back additional shares. And we have the financial flexibility to pursue additional acquisition opportunities in both Life Sciences and Telecom. For those who have not had a chance to see our balance sheet yet, we ended the quarter with $6.8 billion in cash.","In summary, we are pleased with our first quarter results and our progress against our key initiatives. So with that intro, I'll walk you through our Q1 results and our Q2 outlook.","First quarter sales were $1.9 billion, up slightly sequentially and consistent with a year ago. Gross margin was 42.4% and lower than the fourth quarter, as we had expected. Lower gross margin in Display offset improved gross margins in Environmental, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences. SG&A was lower on a dollar in the percentage of sales basis while R&D was slightly higher. Equity earnings of $218 million were down about 10% sequentially, compared to equity earnings, excluding special items, of $241 million at quarter 4. Now, as a reminder, we had excluded a significant onetime gain that occurred at Dow Corning in Q4.","Earnings per share excluding special items were $0.30, just slightly lower than Q4, but a material decline from a year ago. Growth equity earnings in EPS is stated here in non-GAAP measures. You can find a reconciliation to GAAP on our website.","Now, let's start with Display. Display sales were $705 million in Q1, a decrease of 10% sequentially, and versus last year. Volume was up in the mid-single-digits, exceeding our expectations. Price declines over Q4 and Q1 were in line with our expectations. Q1 results were negatively impacted by the weaker yen, which averaged 79 for the quarter.  Volume at SCP was down less than 10% sequentially, which is better than we had expected, and the result of customer utilization rates strengthening in March. Equity earnings from SCP's LCD glass business were $182 million in Q1, a decrease of 5% from the fourth quarter. Now, for your modeling purposes, SCP's first quarter LCD sales were about $730 million, a decline of 8% from the fourth quarter. As a reminder, this represents SCP's LCD sales only. Our public filings will report SCP's total sales which, of course, includes CRT glass and other product sales.","Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing inventory levels in the Display supply chain, glass supply, demand and retail. We have revised our estimate of Q4 supply chain inventory now that we have the final data. The fielded Q4 number was 15.2 weeks and the supply chain had actually reduced more inventory than we previously thought. Our preliminary estimate inventory at the end of Q1 was approximately 15 weeks. We think the supply chain built a small amount of inventory in Q1. We will continue to monitor inventory levels, especially as we progress to the second quarter. Historically, the second quarter has been the most difficult time period for the supply chain because of the lower seasonal retail sales.","In terms of glass supply and demand, we believe both were in a relative balance entering the second quarter. Regarding our own capacity, we continue to evaluate our need to bring back glass capacity for both LCD, and of course, Gorilla Glass. This time, we consider our own glass inventory levels to be at the low end of what we would consider to be healthy. As a result, we'll likely take some measured steps to ensure we have adequate supply to meet demand.","Now, turning to retail, we don't have a lot of new data. In the U.S., we're seeing growth rates that are a little higher than we had expected, this is likely driven by continued growth in larger screen TVs. However, in Europe, demand is definitely weaker, likely a reflection of the economic uncertainty there. This is an area we're going to continue to monitor. As expected, year-over-year unit sales in Japan are down due to the tough year-over-year comparisons with the eco-point promotions last year. In China, there was an interesting dynamic this year, with the Chinese New Year falling in January versus February. And therefore, the promotional activity for the holiday actually started in December, leading to strong pull-in of demand. You may recall, in December, units grew 45% despite the lower demand in January, but we were pleased to see a strong growth rate return in February. We've aggregated the months of December, January and February to deal with the holidays changing, and the blended unit growth rate in China was 15% up.","In terms of PC demand for the year, we have no change for our estimate of 4% in unit growth, excluding tablets. In terms of glass demand into retail, our estimate remains at the 3.6 billion square feet. As we mentioned on our January conference call, we have a variety of cases with retail demand being above or below that point estimate of 3.6 billion, driven primarily by different economic scenarios.","Lastly, in terms of our migration to Eagle XG Slim, we continue to make excellent progress. We are well on our way to meeting our goal of more than half of our glass being shipped thin.","Now, turning to Telecom. Sales were $508 million, up 4% sequentially, but slightly below our expectations of being up 5% to 10%. This slight miss from expectations was due primarily to lower demand for cable products. Fiber-to-the-home and optical fiber demand grew sequentially, and while enterprise sales were consistent. Net income was $21 million, down from $26 million in Q4 and $41 million a year ago. Now, compared to year ago, the decrease in net income largely reflects weaker submarine cable sales and an increase in project spending to support fiber-to-the-home and growth initiatives for NBN in Australia, China and India.","In Environmental, sales were $263 million, up 12% sequentially, which was higher than our expectations. In addition to the normal seasonality increase in Q1, we saw additional growth. Strong auto demand in North America drove sales of gasoline substrates and higher heavy-duty sales reflected manufacturing improvements during the quarter. Net income in Environmental jumped from $28 million in Q4 to $40 million in Q1.","In Specialty Materials, sales were $288 million, up 21% sequentially and much higher than we originally expected. This better-than-expected sales was due primarily to very strong demand for Gorilla Glass. We saw a surge in demand in March, which we believe was due to finishers preparing for the launch of new product models. Gross margin expanded significantly in the quarter and the segment posted net income of $21 million versus a net loss of $105 million in Q4. Now remember that loss in Q4 was primarily due to onetime charges.","In Life Sciences, Q1 sales were $155 million, up 8% sequentially and 8% above the year ago, driven primarily by acquisitions. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have great expectations for our Life Sciences business. We have been and will continue to be innovators in Life Sciences. In fact, as a result of our innovative new business platforms such as unique cell culture vessels and novel surfaces, business has grown organically at a faster rate than the overall industry in the past 3 years. It is an industry that remains very attractive to us. Life Sciences is very different from our telecom and consumer electronic-related businesses, as it is more immune to economic recessions and has much less seasonality. In addition, the amount of new capital required is typically very low, which is a nice divergence from our other very capital intensive businesses.","Very excited about the pending purchase of BD's Discovery Labware Unit. This business is currently profitable and generates cash. They have an excellent long-standing reputation the market. In fact, even those who do not follow Life Sciences industry have heard of Beck and Dickinson and their world-class products. We could not be more excited to welcome the Discovery Labware unit into the Corning family. We expect the transaction to close by the end of this year, and be accretive by 2013, excluding the amortization of purchased intangibles. And looking ahead to 2016, which is the end of our planned integration timeframe, we expect to reach $0.05 per share accretion, also before the amortization of purchased intangibles. The estimate synergies will contribute about half the accretion through revenue expansion, SG&A reductions and manufacturing efficiency gains.","Let me quickly highlight the revenue expansion. You'll recall this chart from our Investor Day in February. I've highlighted, in blue text, some key examples. First, the BD unit bring complementary products we hope will add to our sales opportunities. Additionally, we have multiple revenue synergy opportunities in adjacency areas, like biological coatings on Corning products, expanding our products like Epic and services into the ADME toxicology. For analysts who may not know what ADME toxicology is, Dr. Richard Eglen, Vice President General Manager of Life Sciences, is actually on our call this morning and he can answer any of your questions you have regarding the pending acquisition and the business.","Now, turning to Dow Corning, equity earnings were $35 million, down 29% compared to the equity earnings, x specials, of $51 million in Q4. And as a reminder, we had excluded a large onetime gain in Q4. In the silicon business, Dow Corning did see good volume growth and much more moderate pricing pressure, which led to an increase in silicon sales. However, this is more than offset by the results at Hemlock. I'll have more commentary on Dow Corning and Hemlock in our outlook section.","Now, moving to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $6.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $5.8 billion from the end of the year. Increase was primarily due to the $750 million debt issuances during the quarter. Biggest outflow in the quarter was cap spending of $412 million. Free cash flow was a positive $345 million, and a great start to the year, as the company often experiences an outflow in Q1. We also continued our share repurchase program during the first quarter, although the pace of repurchasing was much slower than the fourth quarter. Investors should not view our repurchasing pattern in Q1 as being less bullish. Board management continue to believe the company's current stock price is trading at a value that is lower than the long-term value of the company. I'll not speculate on how fast we'll go through the remainder of the approved amount or what the board will decide to do next. I can tell you that our current cash balance and cash flow expectations over the next several years, we expect to have ample financial flexibility to fund additional share repurchases, do M&A or to increase the dividend. Regarding the BD transaction of U.S. cash, we have ample cash on hand domestically to pursue all 3.","So that completes my remarks on the first quarter.  To summarize, I'd say we're very pleased with the first quarter performance, especially in light of the headwinds we talked about just 2 short months ago.","Now I'll turn to the outlook and I'll start with Display. In the second quarter, volume at our wholly-owned business should be consistent with the first quarter, and at SCP, volume should be up slightly sequentially. Our primary reason for these levels of expected volume is that TV demand in some areas of the world has been weak and the supply chain has already built some inventory. As always, we can be wrong, we're monitoring  panel maker utilization closely. We do expect stronger pickup in glass demand in second half assuming normal retail seasonality.","Now for glass pricing, as I mentioned in the beginning, we expect our price declines to be much more moderate in Q2 compared to the significant declines that we experienced over Q4 and Q1. As a reminder, the pattern of price declines varied in those quarters but all customers received significant price declines over that period.","Moving to Telecom. We expect sales to be up in the low- to mid-teens, sequentially, driven by growth across all product lines. Environmental, we expect sales to be consistent with the first quarter while we anticipate strong growth in heavy-duty filters. We're forecasting softer sales in the European market for light-duty filters for cars.","Specialty Materials should have another strong quarter, led by Gorilla Glass. Sales are expected to be up 10% to 15% sequentially. And in Life Sciences, we expect sales to be up 5% to 10%. At Dow Corning, we expect equity earnings to be up about 40%, driven primarily by the higher volumes for both silicons and polysilicon. ","Now, at Hemlock, we're anticipating the challenging price conditions in poly will continue. The global oversupply of poly, combined with the decline of subsidies for 2 of the world's biggest markets for poly, to Germany and Italy, continuing to impact poly pricing and solar demand. We do not expect pricing to improve until supply demand levels return to balance and the current overcapacity situation subsides.","Now, turning to the rest of our Q2 forecast. We expect gross margin to drop almost a percentage point. While we expect some margin expansion at Telecom and Specialty Materials, these will be offset by slightly lower margins in Environmental and Display. Display, gross margin will be slightly lower, even though price declines will be much more moderate than previous quarters. From a modeling standpoint, it typically takes a higher amount of volume increase to offset even moderate price declines. The volume levels are not enough to hold gross margin this quarter. SG and R&D will be consistent as a percentage of sales in the second quarter. Equity earnings, excluding special items, will be up slightly, sequentially. Our tax rate will remain around 20%.","Now, for FX, the yen has significantly weakened over the past few months. The fourth quarter, the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate was 77, Q1, it was 79. Month of April it actually reached as high as 83, and today, it's bouncing between 81 and 82. As a reminder, our results move with the changes in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate. Weaker yen lowers our results, a stronger yen helps. So if the yen averages 1 point higher or lower in Q2, we estimate our sales and net income would decrease or increase by approximately $7 million.","That concludes my opening remarks. Ken?","Kenneth Sofio","Thank you, Jim. Operator, we're ready to take questions for Jim or Wendell or Richard.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum from Morgan Stanley.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's Ehud. First of all, Jim, of course we know what ADME stands for. It's absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. I think that's what it means, at least. A couple of questions quickly. First of all, can you give us an update on the China tanks coming online and timing-wise and progress there? And you previously had talked about having 25% of your capacity off-line and spoke about one of your competitors having a 35% of their capacity online and that helping create a better supply demand balance. You made some comments that your own inventory of glass was low and so -- did I detect that you are bringing some of that 25% back online or are you letting the move to thin glass sort of add to your capacity? And so, where do you see the off-line amount of capacity a quarter or 2 out from here?","James B. Flaws","So your first question, on China. We haven't had a change in the display factory in Beijing. We expect the capacity to begin coming online in Q3. We're going to only bring up a portion of the factory, we're going to be very deliberate about how much capacity that adds. Obviously, we're already shipping by customer there from our facilities elsewhere, but we will start one tank there in the third quarter. In terms of our own capacity, we're not giving out the new number. We have brought out some Gorilla tanks. We are being very careful about how much capacity we have online, it's less than 25%, but we are keeping it in balance with what we see as demand. It's our feeling that the glass industry, overall, is doing exactly the same. We see no wholesale charge to light up a ton of capacity by our competitors. And so that's why we continue to believe we're, basically, pretty much in line with supply and demand.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","If I could just ask a follow-up. On the Korea customer that you had the issue with over the last several quarters. Is that now settled and where do you stand with them, with respect to -- their clearly not down to 0, but where do they stand with respect to what they were purchasing from SCP, let's say 3 quarters ago, and is that now stable going forward or do you anticipate more gyrations?","James B. Flaws","So, 3 quarters ago, if you're talking about the summer quarter, it should be Q3. We clearly are -- they are purchasing at a lower level, probably not too far off of what they did in Q3, which is when we lost the share originally. Compared to Q2, obviously, it's a lot lower. But they are continuing to buy from us, we continue to talk to them. But as I indicated, I think, actually at your conference, we are not going to give very low prices to try and gain share back.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Sue from RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Jim, maybe if we could get a sense of the quarterly sequence of price declines in Display glass, it was bad for 2 quarters. It sounds as if it gets better as, near term, as capacity is taken out of the system. Is this kind of the new norm going forward? Maybe some insights into how the negotiations for pricing proceeded and what indications that holds for pricing discussions over the longer term.","James B. Flaws","Well, Mark, we had significant price declines in Q4 and Q1, at essentially all customers. They didn't happen exact same time at each customer, but in the end, all customers got significant price declines. We went for Q2, we obviously wanted to try and get back to a much more moderate price decline pattern, and that's what we rolled out. We were delighted that we were able to achieve that. We think the primary precursors to allowing that to happen is, number one, that capacity is more in line with demand; and number 2, that demand at retail has been okay. So that has worked for Q2. We obviously haven't negotiated the pricing for Q3. And I think the thing for you to pay attention to is if retail demand flowing through to the panel makers is as we expect in Q3 and Q4, and the industry continues to balance its capacity utilization from a glass point of view, that will be very favorable for pricing. But obviously, we are not giving guidance at this point in time for Q3.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then Jim, separately, Gorilla Glass seems to be reaccelerating. What's driving that? Is that broad-based adoption in terms of applications or is it a concentrated customer that's kind of lifting your outlook for Gorilla Glass?","James B. Flaws","So I would say that we had some disappointment in the third and fourth quarter on Gorilla where we would say, in the end market, the demand for smartphones and the mix of smartphones, overall, is quite strong, as well as tablet sales were good. But that wasn't flowing through to us in quarter 3 and quarter 4, and now we feel like we are catching back up to that. The reason why we think we are off of it was that we do know that some customers built inventory in the first half of 2011. Remember, we were very tight on capacity, and then also, their own yields have been improving over that period of time. So what we're hopeful of is that the demand that we saw in Q1 is more representative of us being in line with the real end market, where smartphones and tablets continue to be doing quite well at retail, and that's why we hope that will continue in the second quarter.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, so a more broad-based return.","Wendell P. Weeks","Yes, so let me just add to that, in that it is broad-based and we view that it is driving more in line with what is happening with the market. It's just important to note, this is a long supply chain, it's a complicated supply chain. We take glass, we ship it to finishers who cut it and exchange it. They, in turn, ship it to a touch panel manufacturer. They, in turn, send it on to a ODM who then assembles the whole thing, and then finally, it goes to the brand who is the person that we sold to, really, originally. And each of these steps has different yields and different players have different yields, somewhere between 70% and 95%, depending on the step and depending on the player. And our market position is so strong in this. It means that classic supply chain variability, right? We're going to feel 100% of that. And so that can mean, just depending on how the supply chain works, that our glass shipments, in any given quarter, can be different than the end market pull-through. And that's what we experienced in the back half of last year and now you see us sort of moving in line with the overall pole. And we're going to continue to have some fluctuation here, not because anything bad that's happening, but only because of the strength of our position and the length and excitement in the supply chain.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nikos Theodosopoulos of UBS.","Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. I guess the first one is, in the press release, you mentioned that you think that the LCD revenues could show growth in the second half of the year. Even under a more moderate price decline environment it would seem that, in the third and fourth quarter, you would have to have roughly 15% kind of sequential increases in volume to achieve that. So I guess the question is, what gives you confidence that, that would happen? And then first, quarter number one. And then question number two, on Life Sciences. I guess, maybe if I look at -- it's an area, I don't know that well for Corning. If I look at your other businesses, you have very high market share and leadership. And when I look at this business before you started acquiring companies, you were doing just slightly over $100 million a quarter, it didn't seem like a business you had material leadership. Can you give me an update on what you think your market share is in this business and what this -- why the rationale in doing these acquisitions? Do you think you could become a material leader in that segment?","James B. Flaws","So I'll start with Display. I think what we were trying to say at the back half of the year is that the volume available for glassmakers, from the flow through of retail back to the panel makers, would be substantially higher, driven by the fact that the end market is seasonally stronger then. And what has happened to this industry, for the last couple of years is that, in fact, people don't have to build for televisions back in April for the Christmas season, they can do it much closer. So what we were talking about is strength in volume, sequentially, compared to the first half of the year. I'll let Wendell maybe open on Life Sciences, why we find it attractive, and then ask Richard to add a few more comments.","Wendell P. Weeks","To your point on leadership. It was exactly that, that we identified as the opportunity, Nikos, is that we could bring to bear some of the same things that make us be a leader in our other segments and become a leader here. And leadership in 2 ways that matter. I think one is innovation, where we've shown with our ability to grow organically at about twice the rate of the underlying market growth. And that has been solely due to our ability up bring more innovation to bear, and then also with brands. And so what you see us doing on the acquisition front is augmenting our already strong brand in the Discovery Labware market, with additional brands like Falcon, which are quite strong. And then, global expansion, which also plays to our strength because we're already very strong, as Corning, in a lot of the markets that are going to be the real hyper-growth areas for doing more discovery work in the Life Sciences area, which is where our product strength lies.","Richard Eglen","Yes. I mean, just a few words to add to that. I mean, a good number to bear in mind is that the Life Sciences division at Corning has grown about 16% from 2006 to 2011, and that's the combination of the innovation that's been brought through as well as the strategic acquisitions, of which, the proposed acquisition of the Discovery Labware business would be the fourth there. So as we grow and, as Wendell say, and expanded our geographic reach, we can now move with a broad product portfolio offering into both the academic research market as well as the drug discovery market as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays Capital.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jim, I was wondering if we could talk a bit about some of the ASP declines that you've seen. I mean, you said that there has been a reset, with respect to ASP declines, obviously, and with respect to margins on your Display business. With your commentary that you now expect to see sort of easing pricing declines going forward, should we now expect that, that -- largely, that reset is behind us or are you still somewhat cautious going into some of the forward quarters to see some level of stabilization here?","James B. Flaws","Well, I would say that we're hopeful that we've achieved back-to-the-moderate level. If you go back over most of the last 5 years, the majority of the quarters where this moderate price decline philosophy that we had brought out at the end of 2006, and we're hopeful that we have, with what we've achieved in quarter 2 and the conditions that we think are allowed that, that we'll get back on that. I cannot guarantee you that we've achieved that in perpetuity, but what we have done is to try and have capacity be in line with the demand, and we think that allows for more moderate price declines. We achieved it in Q2. We're hopeful the same set of conditions will allow us to achieve it in the back half of the year. I can't make that guarantee yet.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then if I think about sort of innovation on the LCD TV market, I mean, a lot of us investors have seen some of the developments on the OLED side, at CES earlier this year. There's been a lot of talk, also, of possible new entrants into the TV market, perhaps bringing some of their innovation to bear, from other tangential markets. I was wondering if you could give us an update on where you see sort of OLED development and its impact for you folks, and whether or not you are seeing potential new entrants that could help drive further -- either replacement sales or some level of increased innovation that gets people a bit more excited about replacing televisions here?","Wendell P. Weeks","It's a great question, because as the LCD market has been going through the great challenges and sort of maturity that it has been, what our customer base has done is to invest very strongly in new innovations. I think OLED captures a lot of the headlines. But really, it's part of a overall innovation trend around high performance displays that are in the area of doing very high pixel count displays, as well as thinner, faster refresh, and then OLED adds the opportunity of a little bit more dynamic color with the potential to go even thinner. These higher performance displays, you put -- do 2 things that are helpful. First, the point you're making, which is higher performance displays encourage the market to trade up because it's more visible, literally, what it is you're looking at. And then the other is, from our perspective, it puts way more challenges on the glass itself, because the way you get a higher pixel count-style display is by putting -- by making more complicated electronics packages which put more stress on the glass, which offer us the opportunity to innovate. So those, I think, the 2 positive forces. There's a lot of different technology nodes out there. And what we're doing is covering our bets across, as you saw with the new OLED venture for glass with Samsung, who is the leader in OLEDs. And as you see, when you start to hear things like oxide TFTs, all of these new backplane technologies. We're also having a significant amount of effort and innovation in that space, and alliances with the leaders in that space as well. So, overall, we look at the amount of innovation in LCD right now, in our Display business, to be really at a high. And you're not going to see it in television first. Where everybody is focused is where the growth is at, which is in the same areas that Gorilla is at. So that going to tend to be in mobile displays -- is where you're seeing the bulk of the focus. There is work going on TVs and large size, but I think that's going to be a little bit later, as opposed to sooner, in terms of the size of its impact on the display technology landscape. If that makes sense to you.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That certainly is very helpful. And perhaps, on the question around meaningful [ph] potential entrants into the LCD TV market, have you folks been seeing any or can you even comment on that?","James B. Flaws","I cannot comment on the activities of any of our customers. It's for them to comment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall from JPMorgan.","Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, I've got 2. One is a little bigger picture question about the industry, the panel industry. So not profitable and marginally profitable. I guess that's the primary reason that pricing remains sort of volatile and uncertain in the future. And I just wonder if you guys could comment a little bit about what it is that repairs that industry profitability. Is it only demand that we have to look forward to or are there other things that could happen that help these panel manufactures to get more profitable so there's not much pressure on pricing. I guess that's my first question. And just a quick housekeeping question for Jim. I didn't hear you mention the overall industry glass volume, up to be -- glass volume for Q1 and I wonder if I just missed that or if you didn't mention it, if you could talk about that a little bit.","James B. Flaws","So we didn't give out the glass volume for Q1. We stopped giving at that level of detail about the supply chain. In terms of the panel industry, I'll start and ask Wendell to jump in. I think, what we have seen over the past quarter is stabilization and slight price increases in panel prices. And as Wendell was talking about, we've seen the industry, I think, slowing their capacity additions or actually, in some cases, stopping them. And we see them focused on products that could bring them higher revenue off of that capital, as Wendell was talking about, with some of the high performance displays. Wendell, anything you'd like to add on the industry?","Wendell P. Weeks","First, I think you're on a really excellent question in that the Display industry, our customer base, are quite challenged financially. And I think there's 3 things that they're doing to try to address that. First is getting an industry structure, where you see a sweeping set of moves by a bunch of different players as they either emphasize or deemphasize their investments in the space and consolidation. That, basically, is aimed at demand versus supply balance and that's where Jim is addressing. And the best proxy for that usually, one way or the other, is what's happening with panel prices and none of us would overreact to the latest sort of relative stability in panel price. I think we just got to look at this going forward and see how that plays out. Second is what's leading to their challenges is, first, the market wasn't as big everybody was expecting. And second, there's lack of strong differentiation in the product sets. That's where you see the emphasis on innovation for high-performance displays, which by the way, people talk about OLEDs. Note, oxide TFT technology, which is a new backplane technology, is revolutionizing what LCDs can do. It is making them faster refresh rate, much higher pixel count, it's way more dynamic displays. So it is far from over on which displays are going to win, in which segment. But you see that strong focus on differentiation, all right? And we'll see how that plays out in the technology nodes in one area or the other. And then, finally, you see the focus on those areas in the market that are growing the strongest. And their profitability pools are more aimed at the smaller mobile areas and that's why you see the emphasis towards that space. So I think those are the 3 things that the customer base is working its way through and we'll have to see how it all plays out. Clearly, the best and most important thing that can happen in the near-term is for the market, the end market, to perform in line with our expectations and theirs and that'll certainly help create the type of environment that's a little more stable.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'd like to ask, with your commentary about more moderate pricing, was that something kind of in a range of 3% to 4%? As I noticed, the company did not say like historical ranges which had traditionally been down closer to 2%. Or sort of differently, is the future pricing now slightly more aggressive or am I just being too sensitive on the wording, as I think you know, I'm a sensitive guy.","James B. Flaws","We think all our analysts are sensitive. Don't read too much into the wording. I will tell you that the price declines are significantly down from what we experienced in Q4 and Q1. And I'm not going to give out an exact number for competitive reasons, but you'd be very pleased by the reduction in the price declines that we've had, particularly because you're a sensitive guy.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I take you back to your original plan, I believe it was in the 2007 time period or something, where you implemented this new pricing discipline nature of disciplined pricing. Does that take you back to that type of level or -- I guess, what I'm trying to get at is are we back to the original plan of pricing or something just slightly more aggressive?","James B. Flaws","I'm sorry, Jim, I'm not going to give you an exact number, for competitive reasons.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Well maybe I can ask a different question. On the gross margin, I think I heard you mention they will be down about 1 point. If that's correct, does that imply that you think maybe Q2 will be the bottom for your gross margins or will some things such as ramp in China, impact that going forward? And I don't if when you ramp China, are you just layering in that additional supply slowly or will you be taking off production elsewhere in the impact to gross margins?","James B. Flaws","In terms of our gross margin -- in terms of China, we will balance all of our production against what we think the market needs. So if China came up and we didn't need it, we need to light one tank there, we would cut back elsewhere. But we actually think that in quarters 3, which is when China would start, and quarter 4, that the glass demand will be higher if we're right about the normal seasonal uptick at retail and the fact that the supply chain doesn't appear to be building excess inventories. So you should -- based on what we think, you shouldn't expect China to be a drag along profitability of Display. In terms of our gross margin, as to whether Q2 was the lowest, it all depends on what we see in Q3 and Q4. If our hopes turn out, that we're back on a path of moderate price declines and we see volume grow at a greater rate in Q3, that will improve Display gross margins and that will improve our corporate average gross margin.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski at Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's Simona Jankowski here. Just a couple of clarifications on your Display business and then a couple of questions. I just wanted to clarify first. In terms of the upside you saw in the quarter, on your volumes, was that better demand that you saw or was there some better share gains for you at some of your customers, particularly as you caught them up on some of the pricing? And then the other clarification I had was on the competitive situation at your Korean customer. Looking at that now, do you feel that, that was really kind of unique and contained to that one customer or is there anything that would lead you to believe that there could be some similar type of situation, maybe not to that same magnitude, arising at other customers? And then I have a couple of quick questions.","James B. Flaws","So the upside was better utilization by various customers. That was the improvement. As to our characterization of what happened in Korea in Q3 and Q4, we regard that as a very unique situation and not something that we really are experiencing elsewhere.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a couple of quick questions is, one, you didn't mention anything on the Olympics and I guess we've all kind of been burned with that in the past. But if could just give us a sense of what you're expecting or seeing in the supply chain ahead of that, if anything. And then lastly what impact, if any, do you see from the change there, at Sharp, in terms of Hon Hai's purchase of an equity stake in their 10G plant?","James B. Flaws","Well, I'll take the Olympics and let Wendell take Hon Hai. So we're not hearing the same buzz about the Olympics as we heard before the China one. And as you know, generally, our philosophy is that sporting events create a minor uptick. It's usually less than what people's expectations is. So we're actually quite pleased that people aren't getting overhyped about this. But we really don't -- I'm not hearing the buzz like we saw in 2008 before the Olympics in China. Wendell, would you like to comment on Sharp and Hon Hai?","Wendell P. Weeks","Well, first I'd like to take a little piece of the Olympics one and then I'll move on to Hon Hai, which is -- actually, we were hoping that -- my daughter who is a track athlete was going to make the Olympic trials this year. So I could guarantee you there was going to be a huge upsurge on television purchases here in the upstate New York region. However, she injured her ankle, so now I don't know. Anyway, I digress. The Hon Hai Sharp play. So let's contain ourselves to the publicly disclosed information from Foxconn, Hon Hai, Terry Gou basically, and Sharp. Because I just have to, okay? In their rationale for the transaction, what it really comes down to is Sharp is an absolute leader in Display technology. They're the people that we did all the original work with LCDs. It is true. And they're a leader -- earlier in the call, you heard me talking about oxide TFT and the revolution going on for LCD, Sharp is an absolute leader in oxide TFT especially very large-size oxide TFT. So they have that strength. Terry Gou says I have enormous market access, but I'm missing the relevant technology to be able to take my market access and turn it into volume and panel plants that I have an ownership interest in. Hence, for the merger here or Terry Gou's investment in Sharp and in Sakai city. And the logic is, he will take his market access, fill up Sakai City and be able to take this new technology as well as some of the existing technology, and be able to greatly enhance the position of the non-Korean panel manufacturing industry. So that is the state of logic of the transaction. If that is indeed how it plays out, given our position in Sakai City, that would be a very favorable outcome for us.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right. So, in that scenario, you would expect utilization to rise and indirectly you'd gain share in that situation?","Wendell P. Weeks","In that situation, if that it is the way, indeed, that it plays out. It's early days. So sometimes industrial logic of transactions doesn't carry its way all the way through to reality. Sometimes it does and it's better. It's just a little early for us to be able to call it definitively.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carter Shoop from KeyBanc.","Carter B. Shoop - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","First question. Assuming you increase inventory levels at the wholly-owned Display division in 2Q, can you comment on the magnitude of that increase?","James B. Flaws","It would not be significant such that you would notice the impact in our results.","Carter B. Shoop - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, in response to a question by a particularly sensitive analyst, you mentioned that China won't be a drag to gross margins in the third quarter when that comes on line. Are you suggesting it's not going to be a net decline in gross margins? Are you saying that the increase won't impact at all? Because, I know when we brought on the Gen 10 Facility, obviously a much larger facility. I think it was 2.5 points drag to corporate gross margins in June '09 quarter. So you don't expect any drag there whatsoever. Is that accurate?","James B. Flaws","My comments was, I do not expect a drag on Display margins in Q3 from the start up of a tank in China. Going back to the Sakai City, it was a very large facility. And remember, both the Display business and Corning, Inc., were much smaller then. But definitely, I don't expect to see a drag from China based on what I know today with how we're going to phase the start up.","Carter B. Shoop - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just 2 housekeeping questions if I may. Did you say what Gorilla Glass sales were in the quarter? If so I missed that, and if you didn't, could you provide that?","James B. Flaws","We did not and we are not providing.","Carter B. Shoop - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the acquisition, the BD acquisition. When you say it's going to be slightly accretive in 2013, what type of financing are you assuming in that calculation? Is that a WAC or is that using cash financing?","James B. Flaws","We're doing it all with our cash, which we earn nothing on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Notter from Jefferies.","George C. Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess, if I look back on pricing historically, you had these catch up scenarios play out where Corning, for periods of time, has experienced more moderate rates of price erosion. And then we found, 4 or 5 quarters down the line, that you've been kind of out of whack a bit relative to your competitors and you've had to catch-up period where your pricing comes down more aggressively. Do you think that scenario could play out here going forward? I guess, in other words, I'm wondering if you see everyone kind of behaving like you guys in terms of price erosion for the next few quarters?","James B. Flaws","Well, I would say, clearly, our hope is that we are getting back to moderate price declines for ourselves. And we're hopeful that, that's what the entire industry is going to do. And it'd be pure speculation for me to say how long that would last. I mean, our hope is that it continues for a long period of time.","Wendell P. Weeks","Just one other point because of your lead-in on the logic flow I just want to touch on, which is -- usually, us, relative to our competition, yes, we indeed get a premium. That premium has that sort of couple 3% range of premium. That within that, we can maintain our share position at a given customer. Above that, pressures increase. So it's not so much that our -- we're not deliberately trying to expand that premium and that our competitors are dropping lower than us. Usually, what leads to this sort of disconnect, and more catch-up, is when market demand is very different than glass supply and our competition moves more aggressively on price in a given quarter. And then we are usually more restrained in our reaction and that's what tends to open up the gap. Just want to make sure, logic flow, we're all seeing it the same way.","George C. Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then just switching gears real quickly. Any new perspectives on capital spending relative to what you guys were talking about that the Analyst Day? I think $1.8 billion this year and $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion for next.","James B. Flaws","No change to that. We still expect a decline in 2013. So you should count on those numbers.","Kenneth Sofio","Operator, it's Ken. I recognize we're coming up on the market open and with respect to people's time, so we'll take one more call.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you give us, maybe, some indication of concentration now in Gorilla Glass versus where you where a year ago? There were a lot more devices that we're being launched, new devices. It seems like a lot of them have really not met with market success and it's been concentrated with a few key players that really have shown success. I'm trying to understand if we should expect significant volatility in this business outside of the supply chain issues that Wendell alluded to earlier. And what risk, if any, do you see from any substitution of alternative materials? And I have a follow-up.","James B. Flaws","So I'll comment on concentration. I think that, in smartphones, we're seeing demand by a number of players. The things that you referred to, last year, really were the launch of the early tablets by some people who didn't do that well. But we are seeing broad-based demand in smartphones for Gorilla. Wendell, you want to comment on competition?","Wendell P. Weeks","Yes. So competition continues to be about the same as it was last year, which is, there has been competition throughout last year. There is competition now. We've been blessed with continuing to have our very strong position. The change between Gorilla Glass 1 and Gorilla Glass 2 sort of reestablished an advantage again. Enabling customers to go about 20% thinner and have the same strength. And so, following our classic model, which is do a combination of product-leading innovation, together with strong process work to develop competitive cost advantage, that typical model for us continues to work right now in Gorilla. And hopefully more innovation to come, so watch this space.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And as my follow-up here, you mentioned oxide TFT several times today. So I'm curious to get your opinion on the possibility of the use of lower quality alkali glass as one of the 2 sheets of glass if oxide does become the backplane technology of choice?","Wendell P. Weeks","That's a very good question. So, oxide TFT is going to require 2, probably, higher performance pieces of glass relative to what it is, is used today. And that mainly has to do with that the backplane is more challenging. If the backplane is more challenging, then you're creating an overall sandwich and then you want to match the expansion rates between the top and the bottom of that device. If you have an alkali containing glass in the top, first, you have the potential for poisoning in these relatively complicated electronics packages. But also, you have different rates of thermal expansion. So those factors will tend to bring you into a more concentrated approach of 2 pieces of technical glass. You hear the more 1-piece, 2 pieces of glass when you hear about OLEDs and especially those OLEDs that are a little bit lower pixel count and whether or not it's bottom emission or top emission. Bottom emission has the potential to use a different encapsulant material other than glass because it's coming out the bottom. The top of it doesn't necessarily need to be transparent. Most of the work that we are seeing, right now go on, is leaning towards the technology node of 2 pieces of glass. But this is going to be a continually evolving technology as the industry seeks true differentiation.","James B. Flaws","Yes. Just a couple of quick comments at the end. First of all, we're going to have a fairly robust Investor Relations schedule over the next months. There are actually 4 conferences. First, we'll be at Jefferies Global Conference in New York City on May 8; and then we'll be in the JPMorgan TMT Conference in Boston on May 15; and back in New York City at the Barclays TMT Conference on May 22; and finally, at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference in New York City on May 31. So hopefully, you gather we'll be on the road a lot. We would love to see you all in person. Lastly, our annual shareholder meeting is going to be held tomorrow, right here in Corning, New York. Staring at 11:00. If you happen to be in the Corning area, please stop by. But for those who can't, we will be audio-casting on the website, for the speeches. And to wrap up, we've just completed 4 months of the year and we continue to feel very good about our results. Our non-display businesses are all performing well and continue to demonstrate the growth potential we've been anticipating. And in Display, we're more encouraged now, than we were just a few months ago, especially on the pricing front. We're looking forward to continuing this momentum as we head into the second quarter and we will continue to keep you updated along the way. Ken?","Kenneth Sofio","Thank you, Jim, and thank you all for joining us today. A playback of the call, available beginning at 10:30 AM Eastern Time today.

They'll also be available on our website for downloading.","Now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.","Wendell Weeks ","Thank you, Ann and welcome everyone. This morning we reported a strong finish to an outstanding year and we feel great about our progress and our prospects. Strong growth and strong investment generated $800 million sales increase for the year and set the stage for additional growth. We exited the year running at full capacity in several of our businesses and with committed customer demand that supports our current capacity expansion initiatives. We expect to see the benefits of these initiatives in the second half of 2018 and beyond as production ramps. ","2018 will be another year of strong growth and investment consistent with our strategy and capital allocation framework. All of our businesses contributed to the outstanding 2017 results highlighted by 18% year-over-year sales growth and Optical Communications 25% growth in specialty materials, 7% growth in environmental and price declines in display that were the best seven years. ","As we shared, the strategy and capital allocation framework outlines our leadership priorities. We continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength to extend our leadership, drive our growth and reward our shareholders. Under the Framework, we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion in cash through 2019. We plan to return more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends, and we invest $10 billion to extend our leadership and deliver growth across all of our market access platforms. We made great progress towards those goals since we announce the Framework in October of 2015. ","Our cash generation is on target, and through the end of 2017, we return $9 billion through share repurchases and dividends. We\u2019ve invested $4.5 billion under the Framework in RD&E capital expenditures and acquisitions. We\u2019re starting to see the returns already. As you can see in our most recent results 4-year sales increased 8%, EPS increased 11% and we expect these returns to accelerate. We believe that these results illustrate to benefits of our framework. We are best in the world in three, core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market access platforms. ","We focus 80% of our resources on opportunities that use capabilities in at least two of these three categories. We stepped up our investments over the last six months to meet opportunities in front of us in all of our market access platforms. Significant portions of the investments going towards capacity expansions to meet committed demand. Currently, we have 23 projects underway including construction of 11 new plants. These investments tap into our profitability in the second half of 2017 and will do so again in the first half in 2018. For we really see the benefits of those investments in sales and profitability in the back half. So, we feel great about the year ahead of us. ","Now let me review progress in our market access platforms starting with Optical Communications. With the world leader in passive Optical Communications and the only true end to end supplier of integrated optical solutions, 2017 was another great year. We expanded strategic relationships like the ones we've recently announced with Verizon and Saudi Telecom, which supports our view of strong future growth. We expanded our manufacturing capacity to support growing demand and initiated programs to further expand capacity in 2018. ","During 2017 we acquired SpiderCloud to enhance our wireless portfolio and announced an agreement to purchase 3M's communications markets division. We expect that transaction to close later this year. It brings us a talented group of employees and it enhances our offerings in the rapidly growing fiber to the home and optical solutions markets. We expect to continue growing more than twice as fast as the communications infrastructure market. Rapid adoption of optical solutions in more market segments combined with the strength and relevance of our technology and co-innovation approach supports our superior growth. We believe that the opportunities ahead of us are much greater than those that are behind us. To capture these opportunities, we continue to invest in plants, innovations and market access. We expect 2018 growth to keep us solidly on pace to reach $5 billion in sales by 2020. ","Now let's turn to mobile consumer electronics where we are the world leaders in glass for Smartphones, tablets and emerging categories like wearables and augmented reality devices. Our goal is to double mobile consumer electronics sales over the next several years. We made significant progress towards that goal in 2017. Major milestones during the year included the tenth anniversary of Corning gorilla glass. Rapid adoption of gorilla glass 5 and Apple's commitment to our future innovations through its American manufacturing initiative. ","The fundamental properties of gorilla glass make it an ideal choice for smartphone enclosures. Flagship models from Samsung and others now feature glass on the front and the back. Glass backs double the area we sell for phone and also support new innovation opportunities like fabric. We expect additional growth in 2018 as more devices adopt our latest innovations including our next generation of cover glass which we plan to introduce later this year.","Turning to our automotive market access platform our expertise focuses on helping customers build cleaner, safer and more connected vehicles. Corning pioneered the substrate at the heart of catheretic converters and is now leading the next wave of emissions control with our introduction of gas particulate filters. Most European and many Chinese OEMs have now awarded platforms and we won the majority reflected on market leadership. We had our first commercial sales in the second half of 2017 and we expect a sales ramp in 2018. ","Once regulations are fully implemented in Europe next year and slightly in the early 2020, we estimate the GPF opportunity will exceed $0.5 billion in sales for Corning.","Moving to Gorilla Glass for auto. Innovation trends continue to point towards a significant growth opportunity. On the exteriors of cars, Gorilla Glass laminates are tougher and lighter than conventional auto glass, plus the superior optical quality allows larger and clearer head-up displays. ","For interiors, integrated and interactive displays are becoming a seamless part of the cabin and user experience. Corning is helping OEMs with this transition because Gorilla Glass provides an advanced, durable, optical interface surface with tremendous economics. Earlier this month, exhibits at CES provided impressive evidence for the increasing use and importance of glass in cars. We believe that our solutions provide compelling value and we are investing to prepare for the industry\u2019s transition to highly connected and autonomous vehicles which will use Gorilla Glass. Pole [ph] for collaboration for the leading OEMs is increasing and we\u2019ve already been awarded the for these platforms globally. We expect to make addition and significant progress during 2018. ","In our life science vessels platform, we\u2019re building a new and long-term multibillion dollar franchise. Last July, we introduced Corning Valor Glass, our remarkable new pharmaceutical glass packaging solution. Valor Glass dramatically reduces particle contamination, breaks and cracks, while significantly increasing throughput. Valor helps protect patients and improved pharmaceutical manufacturing. The industry is excited about our innovation, and announcement and we continue to make strong progress although it moves at a deliberate pace.","Recently, the Parenteral Drug Association hosted a two-day conference dedicated to glass quality. Corning presented in a session focused on new development and innovations in pharmaceutical packaging. We remained closely engaged with our development partners, Merck and Pfizer, and are pleased with the progress we have seen with our customers over the last quarter. While we successfully completed multiple collaborative projects to support customer adoption of Valor. We also continue to engage with the Food and Drug Administration which is committed to streamlining the introduction of new innovations so technologies like Valor Glass can reach patients quickly.","In 2018, we plan to invest in high volume manufacturing that will enable us to deliver commercial volumes to our customers. You will hear more from us regarding the manufacturing site and location in the coming months. While we continue to believe Valor has the potential to power Corning\u2019s growth for the next decade in vehicles.","In display, we remain the global leader. Our priority is to deliver stable returns and win in new display categories. We expect 2018 to be another year of strong progress for our display business.","Our new plant in Hefei China has started shipping the world\u2019s first Gen 10.5 glass. We are the only manufacture to have successfully scale glass production through this time. Ramping our new Gen 10.5 facility on a pace with BLE our major customer will augment volume growth. ","In addition, pricing has become consistently more favorable over the past two years. In June, we stated that improvement to mid-single-digit decline was possible. We now believe this will happen in 2018. Reaching mid-single-digit annual pricing is a huge milestone toward our goal of maintaining stable returns. ","Finally, Iris Glass which adds a third piece of glass to LCD displays is gaining momentum. We are excited about Lenovo's and Dell's new ultra-thin monitors which offer the world\u2019s greatest monitors in a thin, no bezel package, uniquely enabled by Corning's Iris Glass. ","I think it\u2019s pretty clear, we\u2019re making terrific progress across all of our market access platforms. We are investing to capture these opportunities and expect to maintain the 2017 momentum in 2018. We plan to deliver another strong year of sales in earnings growth, stay on track to fully achieving our strategy and capital allocation Framework goals. ","Now let me turn the call over to Jeff for a review of our results, details on our outlook and additional updates on our Framework.","Jeff Evenson","Thank you, Wendell and good morning, everyone. Our 2017 results were outstanding. In 2018, we\u2019ll continue investing to support our customers and extend our leadership. We expect core sales to grow to approximately $11 billion or about 7% on a constant currency basis. Before reviewing segment results, I want to talk about two items affecting our GAAP results, FX accounting and tax reform. As we\u2019ve discussed before, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter.","For us, this resulted in after-tax GAAP gain of $1 million for the fourth quarter and a loss of $247 million for the full year. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges are protected economically from foreign exchange fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. We\u2019re very pleased with our hedging program and economic certainty it delivers. We receive $1.6 billion in cash under our hedge contracts over the last five years.","Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a fixed currency rate aligned with our yen and [indiscernible] translation hedges and also by adjusting for other items that do not reflect ongoing operations. For 2015 to 2017, our core reporting use a constant currency rate of 99 yen to the US dollar at 1,100 yen to the US dollar. ","For 2018 to 2020 we established hedges for approximately 90% of our expected display earnings. We expect these hedges to result in average rate of 107 yen to the dollar and we plan to use that rate for our core reporting over the next three years. Additionally, we will use the cost of break of 1175 Korean won to the dollar which is closely aligned to our current won portfolio of foreign currency hedges. Nearly all the analysts covering Corning are already publishing estimates for 2018 and beyond at a yen exchange rate of approximately 107 yen to the dollar.","For today's discussion I will present fourth quarter and full year 2017 core results at the 99 rates. My comments on our 2018 outlook will be based on 107 yen per dollar and 2017 results will be recast to our new core rates for comparison. We provided 2016 and 2017 results recast to the new core rate in [indiscernible]. So, you can update your models and compare operating results on an apples to apples basis.","Turning to taxes, our full year and fourth quarter 2017 core results have been adjusted to exclude $1.8 billion in non-cash items related to US tax reform. The majority of the $1.8 billion is a onetime toll charge of approximately $1.2 billion on unremitted foreign earnings. The cash cost is almost entirely offset by our foreign tax credit carry forward. We have also revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities. While we are still finalizing the impact of reform on our effective tax rate for 2018 we expected to increase to between 20% and 22%. In 2018 our projected tax rate will reflect the new lower tax rate offset by anti-base erosion provision. The net impact does not fully replace the benefit of our previously available foreign tax credit planning. ","Near term tax reform provides greater flexibility in accessing our non-US cash and we have already benefited from that flexibility. Longer term as we execute on our growth initiatives and our US income grows, we will further benefit from the lower tax rate in the United States. ","As a final note our investment in shareholder distribution target in the 2016-2019 strategy in capital allocation framework are not impacted by tax reforms.","Now let's look at our results and outlook. For the fourth quarter core sales were up 7% year over year and EPS was $0.49. Full year sales rose 8% and EPS was up 11% to a $1.72. Core earnings were $1.8 billion consistent with 2016. An apple to apples comparison that reflects the strategic realignment of Dell Corning by excluding Silicom's equity earnings from the first half of 2016 shows that core earnings grew 5% year over year.","As Wendell mentioned growth in operating margins dollars grew more slowly than sales in the back half of 2017, primarily because of planned and very attractive growth investments. These include capacity expansions for optical fiber and cable. Our Gen 10.5 Heisei display glass, capacity for gas particulate filters plus development for gorilla glass, Valor and a few other projects that we're not quite ready to dive into publicly. ","Turning to the balance sheet we ended the year with $4.3 billion of cash. with the new flexibility created by US tax reform we brought $2 billion in cash back to the United States already this month. Adjusted operating cash flow for the year was $2.6 billion and keeps us on track to meet the goals of our four-year Capital Allocation plan.","Now let's look at detailed segment results and outlook beginning with Display Technologies. Display's 2017 core sales were $3.4 billion and core earnings were $944 million. Fourth quarter $217 billion was up slightly sequentially exceeding our guidance and in line with the market. Sequential LCD glass pricing decline were slightly better than Q3 and better than expected. For the full year, our volume was up mid-single digits in line with our expectations. Pricing improved and reached single digit year-over-year decline in both Q3 and Q4. ","Let\u2019s turn to 2018. We expect further pricing improvement with year-over-year declines reaching mid-single digit. Reaching mid-single digit annual declines is an important milestone toward our goal of stabilizing returns in Display and is occurring earlier than the view we communicated to investors in June 2017. Three factors drive our view of a more favorable pricing environment.","First, we expect glass supply to be balanced or even tight. Our Gen 10.5 plant supports the expected growth of large sized TVs [indiscernible] with and dedicated to our customer BOE. We pace underlying capacity in tandem with BOE to ensure our Gen 10.5 glass supply is balanced to demand. ","We expect glass supply demand balance below Gen 10.5 to tighten further because demand continues to grow in 2018 while public information indicates there is little capacity growth planned in this segment by glass makers. ","Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current price declines. Therefore, we expect their price declines with fall further as they try to remain profitable. ","Third, LCD glass manufacturing requires ongoing investment in current and new capacities to support growth to generate acceptable returns on investments; glass pricing will need to improve even further. ","We typically see the largest quarterly price change in the first quarter. In Q1 2018, we expect sequential glass price declines to again be moderate and more favorable than first quarter\u2019s sequential price changes in recent years. In sum, pricing will be favorable in 2018.","Let\u2019s turn to volume. We expect LCD glass market volume to grow mid-single digits as television screen size growth continues. We expect our volume to grow faster than the market as we ramp production in tandem with BOEs Gen 10.5 demand in Hefei. ","For the first quarter of 2018, we expect both the LCD glass market and our volume to climb sequentially by low single digit in line with normal seasonality. First quarter volume will be up low single digits on a year-over-year basis. We feel good about price and volume and gross margin should improve throughout the year.","Two factors will dampen Display's gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2018. First, we are starting up our Hefei facility. As always during our plant startup and fixed cost and staffing ramp ahead of production. ","Second, we\u2019ll be taking advantage of the seasonally wider volume in Display and Gorilla to rebuild tanks and optimize the fleet with our latest technology. As you may recall, in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, we ran a handful of tanks outside of our optimal range to meet strong demand. We will be correcting this in the first half. ","The higher utilization at the happening plan and the fully optimization will improve productivity and gross margin especially in the second half of the year. ","In summary, we had essentially all of our 2018 volume under contract. We remain very pleased with the current dynamics of our display business and our progress in maintaining stable returns.","Let\u2019s move to Optical Communications. Full year sales were $3.5 billion, up 18% and core earnings were up 33%. Fourth quarter sales grew 13% over last year. Fourth quarter earnings decline slightly as we invested to support growth in 2018 and beyond. In addition to fiber and cable capacity, we invested in building supply chain and new products for Saudi Telecom. Our first significant sales occurred during the quarter and required some setup costs. We\u2019re honored to support Saudi Telecom as it begins the largest network build in the history of the Kingdom. ","In the first quarter and for full year 2018, we expect sales to be up about 10% year-over-year excluding any contribution from the pending acquisition of 3M\u2019s Communications Markets division. Key growth drivers include strong demand from carrier enterprise customers that will fill new capacity as we bring it online. We expect profitability to improve through the course of the year as we ramp our plans to meet committed customer demand. For your modeling purposes, we expect the 3M transaction to close in the middle of 2018. The transaction will add about $200 million in sales and be neutral to EPS in 2018 due to integration costs. As previously announced, we expect it will be accretive in 2019 and beyond. ","Stepping back, we\u2019re excited about 2018\u2019s growth potential for Optical Communications and pleased to have additional opportunities ahead of us. Environmental technologies, 2017 sales were $1.1 billion, up 7% driven by worldwide growth in the auto-market and from winning additional business, which allowed us to grow faster than the market. Fourth quarter sales grew 19% year-over-year with core earnings rising 33%. As anticipated the North America and heavy-duty market improved in the second half of the year driving 7% growth in our diesel sales for 2017. ","In addition, our gasoline particulate filter business delivered its first commercial sales in the third quarter as the initial phase of Euro VI regulations to comeback in September 2017. In the fourth quarter, we had additional sales and we want additional platforms. We have won the majority of platforms awarded to-date. 2017 core earnings were $139 million as investments in select capacity and engineering to support the ramp of our GPF business partially offset the benefits of increasing sales. ","In the first quarter and for full year 2018, we expect high-single-digit sales growth, driven by continued strength in auto sales ongoing improvements in the heavy-duty diesel market and from the GPF launch. ","In specialty materials 2017 sales was 25% over last year and core earnings were up 32%. We\u2019re clearly benefiting from the rapid adaption of Gorilla Glass 5 and the trend for glass backs on devices. We also made progress with our innovations in other areas including Gorilla Glass emerging as the most widely used cover material on smart watches worldwide. ","Fourth quarter sales increased 17% and core earnings were up 12% year-over-year. Sales benefitted from brands building aggressively to support their launch cycles. This demand pull-in is the primary reason we expect first quarter 2018 sales to be down about 10% year-over-year. ","Overall, we remain very pleased with our performance in specialty materials. We expect to grow then for the full year 2018 following our strong 2017. The 2018 growth rate, will depend on new model launches and the adoption of our innovations. In the second half of 2018, we expect year-over-year growth as customers launch their new products and as we announce new innovations to meet customer needs in mobile consumer electronic including the introduction of our next generation of Gorilla Glass. ","In life sciences, 2017 sales were $879 million and core earnings were $80 million with strong fourth quarter sales as we continue to outpace market growth. For the full year 2018, we expect sales to grow mid-single digits. First quarter sales should be up high single digits year-over-year. ","As a reminder, my comments on our 2018 outlook are based on a new 107 and 11.75 of rates. While comparing to 2017 result recast to our new quarter rates. For 2018, all of our businesses have positive momentum and we expect full year sales of about $11 billion up 7%. We expect the full year gross margin to exceed 41% similar to 2017. The first quarter will be the low point for the year. We expect gross margin to be about 40% of sales consistent with 2017\u2019s fourth quarter. ","In the second half of 2018, our investments for example in the Gen 10.5 facility gas particular filter capacity, and new fiber and cable plant will exit the startup phase and result in new sales. Quarterly gross margin should exceed 42% in the second half. Annual operating expenses should remain consistent with last year as a percentage of sales. For the full year, SG&A is expected to be about 14% of sales and RD&A about 80%. The slides we are showing give you additional details for the first quarter and for the year. ","In other items, we expect other income, other expense to remain at our fourth quarter 2017 run rate, generating a net expense of approximately $200 million for the year or about 45 to $55 million in Q1. Full year 2018, total growth equity earnings are expected to be similar to 2017 at approximately $200 million predominantly from hemlock [ph] semiconductor, with first question at about 25 to $30 million consistent with typical seasonality. As a reminder, our tax rate should be between 20% and 22% for the year and for the first quarter. ","In 2018, we expect to spend slightly more than $2 billion on capital expenditures with programs in every market access platform. How much more will depend on how quickly we ramp some of our investments. We\u2019ll provide more information as the year progresses. ","Stepping back, the fourth quarter marked the half way point of our four-year strategy and capital allocation framework and I will conclude with a look at our accomplishments and our expectations. In brief, our progress on all dimensions had been excellent and we expect to deliver on all of our goals. In the first two years of the framework, our cash generation has been on target. We have invested $4.5 billion in planned investments to grow and extend our leadership and we have returned more than $9 billion to shareholders from share repurchases and dividend. Over the next two years of the framework, we plan to invest an additional $5.5 billion in our growth initiatives and we plan to continue repurchasing shares and paying dividend totally at least $3.5 billion additional over the remainder of the program. We expect our board to increase the dividend by at least 10% next week and at least 10% again in 2019.","Putting it all together, as we invest $10 billion to drive growth and extend our leadership we are rewarding our investors by returning more than $12.5 billion which compounds the benefit of our future growth for long-term shareholders. We are very pleased with our continued positive momentum. We\u2019re focused on keeping that momentum heading into 2018. We remained on track to deliver the goals of our strategy and capital allocation framework and are excited about the ridge stand of opportunities ahead.","With that, let\u2019s move to Q&A. Ann?","Ann Nicholson","Thank you, Jeff. John, we can open the line for questions. We have live in the queue today so we\u2019re hoping that you can keep one question for everybody.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","George Notter","Hi guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to dig into the Optical business a bit. You guys are adding a lot of capacity here, I saw the announcement the other day about that your cable manufacturing facility I guess the question here, can you refresh us on the amount of new capacity you are adding in that business and then also the timing with which that capacity comes on line?","Wendell Weeks","Thanks George. We are not giving exact guidance on how much capacity we\u2019re adding for obvious competitive reason. We launched on this latest round of the capacity expansion really anchored by the Verizon announcement in their commitment to $1 billion over the next few years. that together with a few other building blocks of key customer committed demand had us really try to expand our capacity footprint across all those products that we\u2019ll be acquiring. ","What you can fix that on timing where you heard from Jeff is that investment in capacity is a bit of a drag on our profitability in the back half of 2017 and the first half of 2018 and you are going to feel those plants ramp up and increasing utilization in the back half of 2018. So, the return from the drag to being a real force for positive momentum in the back half.","Operator","Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vijay Bhagavath, your line is open if you are on mute possibly.","And we will move on to Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.","Mehdi Hosseini ","I\u2019m looking at the display as a percentage of net income and the mix has steadily declined back in 2013 was, in the high 60% and now is almost 50%. As you accelerate the investment in other areas like what happened in the second half of \u201917. Should we also expect acceleration in this decline, decline in display net income as a percentage of overall net income? I\u2019m just trying to better understand how other segments or the net growth and have continued diversify the revenue and operating income mix?","Wendell Weeks","So, I think, you\u2019ve got it -- I think your observation on what\u2019s happened in the past and your projection of what\u2019s in the future is directionally correct. Our other market-access platforms are going to grow faster and our display market-access platform and therefore it will become a smaller part of our overall corporate mix.","Mehdi Hosseini ","I guess the question is, since you have a stepped-up investment in other areas, should we expect acceleration in contribution from other segments?","Wendell Weeks","Yes. ","Mehdi Hosseini ","Would you like to elaborate on the rate of increase?","Wendell Weeks","No. There is only so much guidance we really want to give and project mainly because, we don\u2019t want to -- everything has a higher compatibility set to it. But I think in general on track with it, which you heard from Jeff was it is expect an $11 billion of revenue this year. With the bulk of that revenue growth coming from other segments other than display. I think that type of numbers that you saw, that you can interpolate from there and what you saw for 2017, I think directionally, that\u2019s the way to think about it going forward, there is very strong growth for the company overall with display being stable. Certainly, with the pricing dialogue you heard from Jeff, there is a possibility that display as a segment begins to gross up, but still, it will be at a lower rate than the rest of the company I believe.","Operator","And next go to Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox ","Two questions from me please. First of all, on the gross margin swing there in 2018. Can you give us an idea of how much of the swing is just from ramping down some of the spending versus expecting new volumes to ramp in the second half? ","And then as a follow-up, can you just give us a little bit better color on some of the grow gas auto wins. Maybe just buy large buckets of interior versus exterior and how you expected to realize revenues from that? Thanks. ","Jeff Evenson","Steve, when we open any new plant, the staffing and fixed costs tend to ramp earlier than the production. We had to commit demand for these plans and as we move to higher utilization rates due to volume increases and meeting this committed demand, we would expect our gross margins to improve throughout the year with especially strong growth in the second half. ","Wendell Weeks","And on auto Steve, did I hear your question right how we're feeling about the ramp and the mix between glazing exterior versus interiors.","Steven Fox ","Yeah, I was just trying to understand like if you looked at the 35 new wins sort of what kind of buckets they fall into within the vehicle location, whether outside inside, what type of things inside and when would these programs start to ramp.","Wendell Weeks","The majority of the platform wins that we have right now are on the interior. But one of the reasons for that is people refresh interiors and adopt new design in interiors much more rapidly than they refresh the exterior of a car platform. So, the majority of those are in interiors. I think that when we think through the revenue opportunity we don't see a lot of difference between the revenue opportunity in interiors and exteriors. Even though the glass area is quite higher in exterior the relatively higher value that we had in interior with special optical surfaces to create a particular viewing experience means that that's quite a high revenue realization business for us. So, I would say determining between the two probably isn't as important as the overall rate of adoption as we try to drive this business to another $1 billion sort of revenue generator for Corning over time.","Steven Fox ","And this would be for 2019-2020 model year vehicles.","Wendell Weeks","We'll start shipping commercially for those products late this year, right we'll begin. But you won't start to see a significant ramp till starting in 2019 and beyond you should look for when we start to put in some high-volume manufacturing for the part finishing and optical treatment should give you some more evidence and you should hear about that sometime this year Steve.","Operator","Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan","So, I was just wondering around these price declines sounded from your Q1 commentary that there was an improving but higher than mid-single digit decline which will improve the pricing improves, more so throughout the course of the year close to Q1. I appreciate your volumes are lower in Q1 relative to full year but is 2Q the right timeframe to think about price declines to get to mid-single digits.","And secondarily I know Tony in the past has said that the core rate could be locked in maybe over a five-year period. Is the FX volatility causing you to rethink for the period of locking in the core rate at this 107 for three versus five years? Thank you.","Wendell Weeks","Thanks for your questions Wamsi. First one on pricing, so let's make sure we're talking about the right terms. There's no sequential price decline in Quarter 4 and Quarter 1 for instance and then there's year over year declines Quarter 1 this year versus Quarter 1 last year. What you heard from Jeff was that we're talking now about the really important milestone of towards the back half of this year. We expect the year-over-year decline to be a mid-single digit. That\u2019s a very significant milestone. ","The sequential declines are there have been a low single digit and continue to be. We\u2019re seeing improvement in this Q1 decline versus Q1 of last year and of course we are going to continue to see improvement in the sequential declines to be able to reach much lower year-over-year decline rate, but that little shift in terms can be a misunderstanding. I think the key granule we see the rate of price decline improving for us and we would expect to see that especially in the back half of the year that we had additives for it already in Q1 and anticipate it as well in Q2.","Jeff Evenson","With respect to hedging, we are probably giving a three-year core rate to be effective, it\u2019s a good window to buy certainty for our cash flows and earnings. It allows us to execute in a focused way our strategy of capital allocation framework and deliver all the goals consistent with our financial policies. We do have hedges in place for the next three-year period, but at lower coverage than the 90% we have through the 2020. So, we\u2019ll give you more details on how we expect our core rates evolve as we get closer to that 10-year period.","Operator","And our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath","My question is on your optical portfolio in 5G in particular 5G if you'd agree with me is fundamentally different from previous wireless generations, 5G uniquely needs both wireless and optical communication. So, my question is around, would you focus primarily on the optical communications opportunity in 5G or any thoughts in building up a wireless communication portfolio for 5G now with the fixed wireless starting to pick up and then we\u2019re getting into mobility in 5G? Thanks.","Wendell Weeks","An excellent question, Vijay. I think your assessment of the difference between 5G wireless technology in previous generations is accurate and that wireless now becomes a very optically rich offering as people move towards dense 4G and 5G. ","As far as expanding outside of optical, mainly our focus will be on those things that are fully integrated into our passive optical system where we can uniquely be able to package and\/or facilitate the implementation of wireless for our customers, we would augment our offering. But that is a dialogue which we\u2019re involved with deeply with our key customers and is really quite straightforward, it becomes do you want to view this or do you want to source it and what is the least expensive way to build out this infrastructure. So, depending on how those dialogues go in a more the value could shifted beyond the optical, but I think it\u2019s too soon yet to conclude where those dialogues end Vijay.","Vijay Bhagavath","Thanks Wendell. Truly helpful. A quick follow on, as you bring up more optical fiber capacity I mean I keep seeing these blurbs on the news wire, you keep continue to build up new optical manufacturing capacity. Would that have any near-term impacts on segment margins? Thanks.","Wendell Weeks","Yes. Excellent question Vijay. As you would have heard from Jeff is, we had from our investments in optical, a bit of a drag in the back half of 2017 and we had a bit of a drag here in the first quarter of 2018. We would expect as those facilities will ramp, that drag will disappear and then turn into strong positive. As you know having visited our Optical Communications plants, our fixed costs in those facilities is high. So, our variable margins are also quite high. So, as we feel that up, you can expect to see it have a pretty potent effect on our gross margins. ","Operator","Our next question from Patrick Newton with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Patrick Newton ","Excuse me, I want to dig a little bit more into gross margin perhaps a two-part question. So, I guess, I\u2019m strongly see how the commentary on several segments running at full capacity exiting the year results in the 4Q gross margin missing your guide by about 100 bps. And it appears to me that the comments that you\u2019re making on the investment headwinds tend to be more targeted at the first half of \u201918. So maybe, you can help us bridge the 41% gross margin results relative to the 42% guide. ","And then if we look forward and taking into account that a substantial portion of your growth is coming from some larger -- some lower margin businesses, how should we think about gross margin post investments, I think that you talk about 42% gross margin in back half of the year? But is that a good intermediate term target meaning that 43% plus that we saw in the 2014-15 timeframe is unachievable given mix going forward?","Wendell Weeks","Let\u2019s start with the Q4. So, in Q4, we\u2019re also seeing that the drag from our investment cycles. And you\u2019re having, what can cause timing delta is that as we actually start-up a plant then there is certain costs that are attributed that are sitting in a project now flow through our P&L in our gross margins. So, some of that fitting quarter four as well as you may have seen the announcement from Saudi that the major new strategic alliance we\u2019ve announced. That also started to shift and so there we had to build a new supply chain and that as about 4th generations of product to that. So, it\u2019s a new product, new supply chain and so as we started to shift that, that also as profitability was not at the level that it will be ultimately. ","So, I think really quarter four and quarter one is the same basic story, a little bit different mix revenue investment is. But you\u2019re seeing that strong investment takeaway from some of this strength in the overall operations and we\u2019d expect that to reverse. ","Now turn it over to Jeff for the back half, but you\u2019re right on the target for our gross margins. Jeff?","Jeff Evenson","At our new core rates of 107 yen per dollar and 1,175 Korean won per dollar, the 2017 gross margin was 41.3%. We expect to be about it at this year. First quarter we're going to be at 40% in the back half of the year for Quarter 3 and Quarter 4 we expect to be above 42%. The two primary drivers of that are that our new factories will act as the startup stage as we ramp to meet the committed demand and then the second factor is we're taking advantage of the seasonally lighter demand and display to upgrade our display tanks with the latest technology and that will also have a strong benefit in the back half of the year.","Operator","And next we go to Stanley Kovler of Citi Research, please go ahead.","Stanley Kovler","Just one question on displays and then a follow up on the optical side. Panel makers have commented recently that they wanted to refocus on profitability and so one question was for 2017 for example when in the second half of the year there was more discounted to get inventory moving in China. How should we think about those types of developments going forward when maybe panel makers or OEMs will be less inclined to discount to get volume through. Your thoughts would be great.","Jeff Evenson","We think that the supply chain inventory in actually 2017 had a healthy level and we think it will be healthy throughout 2018 as we see growth at the retail level. In terms of impact on us, we think that the glass market volume is going to be up mid-single digits and we believe that our pricing can reach mid-single digit year over year decline. We think that pricing is going to be driven by three things, the supply demand balance, competitive profitability of glass makers and also the need for attractive returns on ongoing investments. If you look over the last three years correlation between tail [ph] makers performance and glass pricing has been very low. So, we feel pretty confident on our guidance.","Wendell Weeks","Stan was that the question you were asking or were you aiming more at the display market.","Stanley Kovler","Appreciate it, no that was the question. I just wanted to follow up on optical related to Verizon. The amounts from [indiscernible] capabilities I think that allow them multiple wavelengths on a single fiber for some of the edge [ph] deployments and I think the focus more from these technologies was to get to speed up on a single wavelength. Does this have any implication for you guys on demand or ramp of single mode fiber, is this an accelerator or could this actually slow things down for you, thank you.","Wendell Weeks","So, in general what drives our demand is going to be footprint by neighborhood or by city. It is putting the [I in telecom] [ph] it is putting in place the regional infrastructure that we're going to service. As always when you put in something like [indiscernible] the capability of the fiber is always well in excess of what you're driving it at. And so quite often what you'll see is our demand comes when we basically due to home passes and then ultimately the home drops and then it\u2019s always the telecom company can turn up the rate and turn up the service level with pretty simple upgrades in the [indiscernible] system inside sort of a level of itself. So, this is atypical and we don\u2019t see it as impacting us frankly one way or the other, even negatively or positively other than to the extent that the degree with which auto customers serve their customers better, that net long-term turned in to more demand for us.","Operator","Right. And next one is James Fossa with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","James Fossa","Thank you very much. Just wanted to get a little more color on growth drivers for especially materials and Optical and Displays. Wendell, you talked a little bit about interior glass starting to move specialty or starting to contribute really in 2019. How should we think about bit it as a growth driver for specialty materials overall kind of meaningful in 2019 as a contributor or is it going to take longer than that? And I guess in light of your recent comments on this call related to Iris similar question on Iris, can Iris be a meaningful contributor to Display in 2019 or once again is that going to take longer? Thank you very much.","Wendell Weeks","So, let\u2019s start with your first question. The segment was sort of accounting method. Right now, we account for auto in glass area inside other, right. Ultimately, I don\u2019t agree determine where we live is a segment, but it links more closely with our automotive market access platform than it does on mobile consumer electronics platform. ","That being said because what you really care about is, does it generate revenue or not. I think 2019 will be the year if everything goes well that we will start to feel it in automotive. We\u2019re a big company and this is just the beginning of this so it\u2019s not going to be a life changing field in 2019. ","But we will expect it to be really start to build its momentum in 2019 and then start to really contribute much more in the next decade. So, in the near term, what drives us in specialty is the adoption of our new innovations by more and more of the OEMs and we expect specialty to grow this year in mobile consumer and electronics and rate of growth will depend on how quickly people adopt our innovation sets. ","In Iris, it\u2019s still too early to tell. I think it\u2019s very encouraging that two major players in monitors; Dell and Lenovo have adopted the Iris technology for the top of their line. I think we need to see they become a lot mainstream before that turns some of the investment area into a margin producer.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Joseph Wolf with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joseph Wolf","Hi. Thank you. I had a question back to Display but on the transition in the industry towards OLED and not on the TV set but on the smaller panel size and the lower -- I guess the Gen 6, 6.5. Competitively is there any impact, I know you guys are involved in OLED manufacture, but are you competitors involved in the same way and is there any longer-term consideration where the other businesses or your competition is looking at the OLED opportunity differently than Corning?","Wendell Weeks","So, could you just build on your question? When you say OLED, what exactly do you mean.","Joseph Wolf","Both in flexible and in rigid, where, I know that Corning product is used in the manufacture of the end product, or perhaps it\u2019s in the final device. And I\u2019m wondering, if you believe that your competitors have the same sort of manufacturing capability or they are looking at that market differently?","Wendell Weeks","How can we tell our competitors are looking at it? So, let me share instead how we think about it. Starting back a number of years ago as we evaluated OLED versus LCD technology. We determine that OLED probably will be most successful in the flexible small mobile area. Because the opportunity need performance advantage is that we\u2019re highly value. So therefore, that\u2019s where we focused a lot of our innovation effort and our share and that business is impressively high. So, to the extent that devices go into OLED mobile consumer electronics as opposed to LCD, that is revenue enhancer for us. ","Now to small revenue enhancer, because in glass, the area of the device matters and so overall mobile is relatively small percent of the overall glass demand. What we felt then and we continue to feel is that all OLED for TV can become a player, but a small player that fundamentally it doesn\u2019t offer enough value validate to the cost will create versus the continually improving LCD technologies like you just saw recently at CES with some of the big quantum dot technologies. That being said, we have a strong position as well. Anytime, anybody wants to use the glass. So, I don\u2019t have great insight into how do our competitors feel about it. But I really like our position.","Operator","And that will be from Doug Clark with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Doug Clark ","I had a question on the display glass volume expectations. First for the market being up mid-single-digits in 2018. Can you explain what that means from a TV unit standpoint? Two units have been down for the past few years, I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re assuming or reacceleration in growth. ","And then secondly on Corning share gains in the relationships with BOE driving above market volume growth. Can you quantify that, should we be expecting high-single-digit glass volume growth for Corning in 2018, so essentially the materiality of BOE in 2018? Thanks. ","Jeff Evenson","Sure. We expect screen size to be the primary driver of growth this year. And in terms of our growth BOE is ramping our Gen 10.5 facility, we\u2019re ramping our glass in tandem. So, we expect stability in other areas and that to be a little add for us, but that\u2019s all the guidance we are looking at this time. ","Ann Nicholson","Great, alright thank you all for joining us today. before we closed, I just wanted to remind you that we will issue an 8-K today within our core data recap again a 107 and a one at 1175. We'll be attending the Goldman Sachs conference on February 13th and we'll be planning to attend at least one conference at Corning for this quarter for the rest of the year. We'll also be providing some virtual presentations and webcasts on business topics throughout the year.

It is my pleasure to turn the call over to Ann Nicholson, Division Vice President of Investor Relations.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Sean, and good morning. Welcome to Corning's first quarter conference call. With me today is Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. Before we begin our formal comments, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These remarks involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports.","You should also note that we will report our results using core performance measures. These core performance measures are non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation can be found on our website. We have slides posting live on our website that are accompanying our formal comments, and they will be available on our website later this morning.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Wendell.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. As we said in this morning's press release, we are pleased that first quarter sales in Display, Environmental, Specialty Materials, and Life Sciences met or exceeded expectations. Demand in Optical Communications was as strong as we expected, but deployment issues with new manufacturing software interrupted our cabling production and interfered with our ability to fill customer orders.","Now, we are well down the path to resolving these problems, but we estimate that they reduced first quarter sales by approximately $100 million. The combination of reduced sales and spending to overcome the issues reduced first quarter net income by about $40 million. Absent this, Optical Communications results would have been consistent with expectations. Even with this impact, however, core EPS was $0.28, consistent with consensus.","We told you coming into the year that we expected the first quarter to be the weakest. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the sequential growth that's beginning across our businesses. We're also pleased with the progress we've made on our strategy and capital allocation framework. You'll recall that our priorities are to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength to grow, return cash to our shareholders, and create significant value. As we shared with you in October, we expect to generate and deploy more than $20 billion through 2019. We will distribute more than $10 billion to our shareholders, and we will invest $10 billion to grow and to sustain our industry leadership in our focused portfolio of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market access platforms.","Recent successes include cash distributions, strategic transactions, product introductions, moderating pricing environment in Display, and our advancement of lowest cost manufacturing positions. Here are a few highlights in each area.","We've distributed more than $2 billion to our shareholders since October. We completed a $1.25 billion accelerated stock repurchase program in January. During the remainder of the quarter, we distributed an additional $751 million through share repurchases. In February, we announced a 12.5% increase in our quarterly dividend, in line with our plan to increase dividends per share by more than 10% annually.","We also initiated three transactions to focus our portfolio and advance our growth. In December, we announced the strategic realignment of Dow Corning. As a reminder, we plan to exchange Corning's 50% interest in Dow Corning Corporation for a subsidiary that will hold 40% ownership in Hemlock Semiconductor and $4.8 billion in cash. The $4.8 billion is approximately 30 times the equity earnings from Dow Corning's silicones business. We expect this realignment to be substantially tax-free and to create tremendous value for our shareholders. We've made excellent progress and continue to anticipate that this transaction will close by June.","In January, we announced a joint venture with Saint-Gobain Sekurit to develop, manufacture, and sell light-weight automotive glazing solutions. Saint-Gobain is a leading global producer of automotive glazing. Corning will continue to produce and market Gorilla Glass to this JV and other glazers, retaining 100% ownership of the glass business. This venture allows us to manufacture and sell glazing solutions with a premier glass glazing company that enjoys an excellent reputation among car manufacturers. It also provides a low-cost path for us to scale Gorilla Glass glazing solutions globally.","Two weeks ago, we announced an agreement to acquire Alliance Fiber Optic Products for approximately $270 million net of the cash required. We expect the acquisition to be accretive during 2016, and offer cost, product and customer synergies. This acquisition will expand our market access, and provide products that we can integrate into our solutions. For example, it will deepen our relationships with growing cloud data center customers, expand our access to OEM and Asian customers, and enhance product sets in our fiber-to-the-home and data center portfolios. We're excited to bring AFOP on board.","Turning to product introductions. Earlier this month, we announced Vibrant Corning Gorilla Glass, which adds value to Gorilla and supports our strategy to double Corning's revenue per mobile device. With fiber and Corning Gorilla Glass, Acer and other leading device makers can dramatically expand their options per device design with individually customized multicolor high resolution images on Corning's industry leading cover glass solution. These features add value for consumers and increase our revenue per device.","We also continue to leverage our competitive advantages and strong customer relationships in display to stabilize returns. You will recall from our fourth quarter conference call in January that 2015 was the display industry's most challenging year in the last five years, and that panel makers began reducing utilization in the back half to help return supply chain inventory to a healthier level.","We also told you that even in this difficult environment, we expected continued moderation in LCD glass pricing, and that exactly what is playing out. After experiencing the smallest price decline in eight quarters during quarter four of 2015, our price declines in the first quarter equaled the best first quarter price decline in five years. And we believe sequential price declines will further moderate in quarter two. We can now mark two years of moderate quarterly sequential price decline.","Finally, we enhanced our lowest cost positions through several moves to consolidate our manufacturing footprint and our progress on reducing energy consumption and cost was recognized by the EPA, who named Corning an ENERGY STAR partner for the third consecutive year.","So to summarize, we're making solid progress delivering on our new framework. We are creating significant value for shareholders by utilizing our financial strength both to enhance our focus portfolio by investing in growth and to distribute cash to shareholders.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Tony, who will review our first quarter results and second quarter outlook. Tony?","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We met expectations in Display, Environmental, Specialty Materials, and Life Sciences in the first quarter. However, as Wendell said, we experienced an issue in Optical Communications due to the implementation of new manufacturing software in our cabling operations. This interrupted production and seriously impacted our ability to meet customer demand in the quarter. The estimated impact to sales was about $100 million. The lower sales and additional cost to address these issues reduced net income by about $40 million. As Wendell said, absent this issue, our Optical Communications business would have met expectations.","We have been working with customers to minimize the impact to their operations and are making steady progress towards restoring production. We are confident that we will resolve the software implementation issue during the second quarter. The financial impact in Q2 will be much smaller than Q1 and we expect to make up a good portion of the missed sales during the second half of 2016.","Now let's get into the first quarter financials. As a reminder, these are core results. Sales in the quarter were $2.2 billion, down 11% versus last year. Without the software implementation issue in Optical Communications, we estimate that sales would have been down approximately 6%, driven by lower volume and pricing in Display, but in line with expectations. Corporate gross margin was 41%, and in line with expectations. SG&A and RD&E costs were relatively flat to Q1 of 2015 at $309 million and $109 million respectively.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14% and lower than expected due to lower profits in Optical Communications, which incur a tax rate above the corporate average. Net income was $340 million and lower than last year. The lower year-over-year earnings reflect the lower volume and pricing and Display and also the software implementation issue in optical. EPS was $0.28 and met expectations. Now, these results are core. In Q1, our GAAP results were significantly lower than our core results, driven almost entirely by the mark-to-market accounting treatment on our currency hedge contracts. I'd like to provide a bit of context.","As most of you know, we sell LCD glass in yen and a 1 point move in the exchange rate impacts net income and cash flow by about $23 million annually at the current exchange rate. We enter into currency hedge contracts, predominantly yen, to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flow. By hedging, we increase the predictability of our results and are confident that we can achieve our financial goals. We are very pleased with the results of our hedging program and the economic certainty it delivers.","Since the inception of this strategy, we have settled hedge contracts and received cash totaling $1.1 billion that offsets much of the decline in Display's earnings due to the weaker yen. We recently increased our hedge coverage which further reduced our risk and increased our confidence in achieving our financial goals. We have hedged 70% of our projected yen exposure through 2022 at a blended rate of approximately \u00a5106 yen per $1. For any investor who has been worried that the weakening yen could negatively impact our business, hedging earnings and cash flows through 2022 substantially mitigates that concern.","Now, let's move from the economic impact of our hedging program to GAAP accounting. GAAP requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be marked-to-market and recorded at their current value. In other words, under GAAP accounting, each quarter we are required to revalue all of our existing contracts at the quarter end forward rates, and record the difference in value from the prior quarter through the P&L as unrealized gain or loss. This requirement results in significant GAAP earning volatility if the exchange rate changes from quarter to quarter, and given the size of our hedge portfolio, these adjustments can be large. For example, in Q3 and Q4 of 2014, we had large unrealized non-cash gains after tax of $431 million and $410 million respectively as the yen weakened. In the first quarter this year, the yen sharply strengthened and we had a $599 million unrealized non-cash mark-to-market loss.","Our GAAP results will continue to see this volatility when the yen rate moves. Now to be clear, the amount of hedge contracts we settle in any given quarter is designed so the cash received or paid on the contracts substantially offset the change in Display's translated yen earnings and cash flow in that quarter. Our core reporting convention is designed to convey this matching and to simplify comparisons of underlying business trends. Now for investors who have additional questions, Ann and Stephen (17:33) are available after the call.","Also in our GAAP earnings for the first quarter are charges of about $109 million pre-tax associated with reducing our cost structure, enabling us to enhance our cost leadership position. We anticipate additional charges of approximately $40 million for the remainder of the year. We estimate that the full year cash impact will be $40 million, and the annualized savings will be $50 million. So that's our first quarter from an overall P&L perspective.","Now, let's look at the detailed segment results, beginning with Display Technologies. As I described in the January call, there was a significant inventory buildup in the supply chain during the back half of 2015 because the industry overestimated retail demand. We expected panel maker utilizations to decline sequentially in the first quarter in reaction to falling panel prices and a weaker end market, allowing the supply chain to reduce inventory. We expected this to result in sequential glass demand being down mid to high single digits.","Now despite this very tough environment, we expected Q1 prices to decline moderately sequentially, and that is exactly what happened. Panel makers reduced utilization and panel price declines improved to low single digits in March. Weeks of inventory ended the quarter in a healthier position. The glass market was down mid single digits. Our volume was down mid single digits sequentially, and price declines were moderate as expected, matching the smallest sequential first quarter decline in five years. Display sales were $829 million and net income was $223 million. Now during the quarter, we secured the remainder of our 2016 volume under customer agreement, helping us maintain stable share, which in turn enables us to be more efficient in planning, manufacturing and reducing costs.","Let's move to Optical Communications. Q1 sales were $609 million, down 13% versus last year and below our expectations. Net income was down 64% versus last year, primarily driven by lower sales volume and additional costs associated with software implementation issues. We expect a much smaller impact to sales and profits in Q2 and to resolve these issues during the second quarter.","In Environmental, Q1 sales were $264 million, down 6% versus last year, but better than the 10% decline that we expected. Stronger than expected demand for light duty substrates drove the beat as growth in North America and China produced record light duty substrate volume sales. Segment sales are down year-over-year due to continued weakness in the US and Chinese heavy duty truck markets, as expected. Truck production in North America is down after a two-year peak and China's production is also expected to be down for the second year, driven by economic weakness. As a result, year-over-year profitability was down for the segment, in line with expectations.","Now during the quarter, we also made important progress on pioneering a new mobile emission control category that is not yet reflected in our sales. Let me explain. Euro 6c, starting in 2017, introduces real world driving emission standards and requires an order of magnitude reduction in particulates generated by gasoline direct injection engines or GDI. GDI represents 23% of the global market now and it's growing at a 17% rate. Today, none use a filter. The 2017 regulation will require, for the first time, a filter solution and we are well positioned to lead. We made progress in the first quarter by winning several new platforms designed to meet the upcoming Euro 6c regulation. Since the filter is used in addition to products that we already sell, Euro 6c increases our total sales opportunities for GPF vehicles by a factor of three to four.","Moving on to Specialty Materials, performance was in line with expectations. As expected, Gorilla Glass volume was down sequentially and versus a strong Q1 2015. As a reminder, comparing year-over-year Gorilla Glass growth rates in individual quarters is challenging because the volume depends on when the supply chain is building in preparation for new product launches and the timing of OEM production ramps varies year to year. Last year our Q1 volume was stronger because the supply chain was building, whereas this year we don't expect production ramps until later in the year.","Advanced optic sales were consistent with last year. In total, segment sales were $227 million, down 17%. Net income was $32 million, down 30% versus last year on the lower sales.","In Life Sciences, Q1 sales were $204 million and met expectations. Net income was $18 million, down $1 million versus last year.","First quarter gross equity earnings from Dow Corning were $58 million, and exceeded expectations of $45 million.","Let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion of cash, including approximately $1.1 billion in the United States. We expect full year operating cash flow to be relatively consistent with last year. The first quarter is typically our lowest quarter of the year and Q1 adjusted operating cash flow was approximately $110 million. Capital spending was $270 million.","Now for the outlook. We expect second quarter sales to grow sequentially in all of our businesses, except Environmental, which will be down slightly, but consistent with the second quarter of 2015.","Let's begin with Display. For the full year, we continue to expect the overall glass market, measured in square feet, to be up mid single digits and for the retail market to be up 8% to 10%. While it's early in the year, we see some puts and takes that net out neutrally relative to our initial expectations for the year. Preliminary data indicates that TV unit growth might be a little less than our 2% expectation, but that is offset by early evidence that diagonal screen size will increase by more than our 1.5 inch expectation. The outlook for handheld and IT is lower than our initial expectations, but those segments are a relatively small part of the overall display glass market. Handheld and IT play a bigger role in our Specialty Materials segment, which I'll address in a minute.","We begin the second quarter with healthier supply chain inventory, and panel makers are increasing utilizations to meet demand for the second half retail season. We expect glass market and our volume to be up high single digits sequentially in the second quarter. We expect our LCD glass prices to decline moderately sequentially and be more moderate than Q1. We are very pleased with this more stable environment. As we have previously explained, we expect this more favorable pricing environment to continue and maybe even improve, for two primary reasons.","First, the financial situation of our competitors continues to indicate they cannot continue historical price declines and remain profitable. And second, as we said before, we believe that glass supply and demand will remain balanced despite occasional dips in panel demand. We are keeping capacity offline to match our supply to our demand. Other glass suppliers have said publicly that they have levers to take similar actions. For these and other reasons, we continue to believe that sequential pricing will be better for us going forward.","Now moving to Optical Communications. For the second quarter, we expect sales to be up more than 20% sequentially. Compared to last year, we expect sales to be down mid to high single digits. Two components of lower sales versus last year are sales impact of $20 million to $40 million from the software implementation issues, and last year's record second quarter included some service-oriented business that doesn't repeat.","For the full year, we previously guided Optical Communication sales up in the mid single digits, but now expect sales to be up low single digits, with the change due to the software implementation issues. Demand in carrier and enterprise is as strong as we expect it, and we plan to recover a portion of the missed sales from the first half of the year. We expect sales in Optical Communications to be up more than 10% in the back half of 2016 versus last year.","Now turning to Environmental. We see continued strength in the auto market, but expect ongoing weakness in the heavy duty truck market in North America and China to continue. We expect second quarter Environmental sales to be consistent with 2015.","In Specialty Materials, we expect second quarter Gorilla Glass volume to grow both sequentially and year over year. As a result, we expect Specialty Materials sales to be up low single digits in Q2 versus 2015. For the full year, as I said earlier, the handheld and IT retail market outlook for 2016 has weakened, which impacts sales of Gorilla Glass. We now expect sales growth in Specialty Materials will be in the high, or the mid to high single digits.","On the cost side, we experienced a power outage in one of our glass technologies facilities at the end of March. We quickly recovered from the incident to meet customer shipments across all product lines. We expect costs associated with recovery and repair expense to negatively impact gross margin percent and profitability and Specialty Materials in the second quarter.","In Life Sciences, we expect Q2 sales to be up low single digits versus last year, despite drag from the weaker euro.","Now we expect gross margin to improve sequentially in Q2. Gross margins expand with growing volume in Display and higher sales in Optical Communications. The expansion would have been greater, except for the impact of the power outage. In total, we expect gross margins to be in the 41% to 42% range. We expect further gross margin expansion in the third quarter.","SG&A and RD&E will be approximately 14% and 8% of sales respectively. We expect other income, other expense, to be a net expense of approximately $55 million, and we expect Q2 equity earnings to be between $50 million and $70 million, depending on the closing date of the Dow Corning strategic realignment. Once we close, we will no longer recognize equity earnings from Dow Corning's silicones business. Therefore, an earlier closing date corresponds to the lower end of our estimated range. We will update you more precisely when the transaction closes. And we expect our effective tax rate for 2016 to be in the range of 15% to 16%.","So that concludes our outlook for the second quarter. To summarize, in the first quarter, we met or exceeded expectations in most of our businesses, and we expect strong sequential growth in the second quarter. We made great strides delivering on our four-year plan to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength to grow, return cash to our shareholders, and create significant value. Ann?","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Tony. Sean, we'll now open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Patrick Newton with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, Wendell, Tony, Jeff, thank you for taking my questions. I guess number one is, given the expected close of the Dow JV in the current quarter, could you elaborate a little bit further on your intentions with the $4.8 billion in proceeds? I think that investors have varying opinions of the use of cash within your capital allocation framework and the pace at which it can be harnessed. So I guess at a minimum, should we anticipate a buyback to offset dilution from the loss of equity earnings? And then given the substantially tax-free transaction, are there any structural timing issues that prevent the immediate access to the proceeds?","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So Patrick, good morning. Let me take that question. I think that from an overall standpoint, let me first start about the timing of the transaction. I mean we expect it to close sometime during this quarter. We're on track. We've made a lot of progress with everything that needs to get done. We feel pretty good about that. We said all along that when we do close, that we would discuss more what we do plan to do from a cash standpoint. I think it is reasonable to assume that over a period of time, as we make this transaction, that we offset the dilution on the equity earnings at some point in time, although we're not actually talking about a very specific timing on that.","In terms of the cash availability, as we've mentioned that from an overall standpoint, there are restrictions relative to the cash availability, but that's cash that we need to control and manage internally from an investor standpoint. If we use the cash to invest in the business, then we're able to offset that with cash somewhere else. So for example, if we were to make an acquisition, that we could use cash from that and that would offset cash in another place. So from an overall standpoint, that's how we're thinking about the Dow Corning transaction.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So Patrick, a little bit shorter version. After we close, we'll tell you. Okay. Until then, give us some time to not count our chickens before they're hatched, and then we'll be really clear on how we think about our overall capital allocation plan in terms of our total availability of cash for the company overall. All right?","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you. And I guess just as a follow-up. Tony, you talked about recent strengthening in the yen. You talked about how your yen hedging practices have removed some of the volatility. And I'm curious, if you're looking at using the current strengthening of the yen to bring your total hedge rate in the 2016 to 2022 timeframe to \u00a599 relative to the average of \u00a5106 because that would remove any need to change the core reporting convention at some point in the future.","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Patrick, that's a great question. I mean I think we are always looking at where the yen is, thinking about when we have opportunities to opportunistically add to our hedge portfolio. We made a big move in the first quarter, and that's something that we are evaluating and considering.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks, good morning. Just looking at the Optical business a little bit more and color, could you talk about some of the end markets and how they performed and how you think they're going to perform going into the second half of the year, specifically wireless, fiber to the home and data center? And then I'm just curious, given what I understand lead times to be on some of the optical cables, how you expect to make up some of the lost sales. It doesn't sound like it's going to be an easy task to regain some of that share, given what might have shipped during the quarter. Thanks.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Steven. So let's start with the situation in OpCo. First, the main dynamic in the numbers were the problems we had on implementing this software solution. This hurt. I mean, we've had to apologize to our customers who totally rely on us in certain segments. Thank goodness that actually enterprise started a little slow this year, but our big telecom network providers totally felt this. And you got to remember, we've gained so much share over these last several years because of our advantaged product sets that we have customers that basically rely on us for 100% of their deployment. So no question, our real extending lead times there have meant we've had to apologize to our customers and do our best to get those back on track.","But also, we owe our investors an apology because we missed an opportunity to beat expectations and get off to a great start to the year. So now it's further added degrees of difficulty for us to be able to climb steeply to the back half and still hit everybody's expectations for ourselves, but we think we can do it. So to your core question, enterprise started off slow, but we expect it to be strong, to come back. That's what we're hearing from all of our big customers. So like I said, that ended up being a gift, but seldom is slow markets a gift, but it was for us.","Second, in telecom for the core network stuff, we expect that demand to be strong this year. Just because of where they rely on us and where they don't, we do expect to recover a significant hunk of our missed shipment set to just go into extended backlog. But we'll also lose some business too. It's hard to exactly estimate that right now, Steven, but I think you integrate everything together and the way you should think about it is we're going to be growing in quarter three and quarter four with the software issue behind us, sort of in double digits in OpCo, despite any sort of lingering impact. So that's the way we're thinking about it. As we get through quarter two we'll understand the actual customer impacts in a little more finer detail. But that's sort of the rough outline. Does that make sense to you, sir?","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Yes, that's very helpful. I appreciate that. And then just as a quick follow up, just directionally in terms of gaining content per device that you've talked about since the analyst meeting, should we expect some of that in the second half of the year? And if so, is there any hints you can give us on how that would sort of play out? And then I'll pass the baton. Thanks.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, one again, so on one hand in Gorilla, as you heard from Tony, we're seeing less growth. It's sort of IT and small, right. On the other hand, we see the opportunity for revenue enhancement and it's going to come in sort of two broad areas. First, that as we introduce more advantaged glass products, just in our base glass business, we expect price to stop going down. Okay. That still has to happen, right, and the customers still have to love it, but that ought to be enhancing our gross margin. And then second, we will be increasing our revenue per device through other ways by adding value. Right, and that's an example we just talked about on the Vibrant Corning Gorilla Glass, which basically moves us to selling a part, and then a customized part, in terms of the images that are on it.","We have other efforts going on in terms of the parts business to serve our customers at that higher revenue spot. And then finally, we have some other new value add products that you've heard us talk about, but now we expect to commercialize, like fire technology for wearables, et cetera. Exact timing on how it comes in, my friend, is hard to call, because there's technology adoption. But yes, we would feel that that sort of revenue enhancement could help us close some of that gap that we see with the small end market.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Great. That's very helpful. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Please go ahead.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks for taking my question. Just as a follow up to the Gorilla commentary, what gives you confidence that this is not ASP pressure and just a reflection of lower volume due to demand?","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well Mehdi, as we take a look at what we expected at the beginning of the year versus today, and what's really has happened in the market, is lower demand for handheld, and also lower demand from a tablet standpoint. We expected tablets to be down this year, but they're going to be down a little bit more than that. And so that takes our overall area growth, which we had expected to be up in the mid single digits or so down to the low single digits. From a pricing standpoint, our contracts get set at the early part of the year. So we feel good from an overall pricing standpoint. And the reason that we think our sales can be up mid to high single digits has to do with the value adds that Wendell talked about in the previous answer.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it. Thank you. And then just looking at your cash flow, there was a cash burn from operation, and can you help me understand what happened there? I see you're \u2013 go ahead. Go ahead.","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, sure. So, I think the first thing that's important to focus on is our adjusted cash flow, which also includes the impact from the hedges, and when you take those positive impacts from the hedges, we had about $110 million of cash flow from operations. That was down from last year, and two major drivers of that, the first being lower profitability in the overall business, and then the second item is, we had a big cash tax payment that happened in the first quarter of this year. As we look out for the entire year, we feel good about our ability to generate the operating cash flow kind of consistent in line with what we did last year. So there's nothing to be concerned or alarmed about on that, and Q1 is usually or always our lowest cash flow generating quarter.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Doug Clark from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Douglas Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick ones and then a follow up. The first one is on, have you seen any impact from the earthquakes in China? Not as much for your facilities or the glass industry, but for the rest of the TV supply chain? And then secondly, can you help quantify how big the impact to gross margins is for the corporate average in the second quarter from the power outage in the Specialty Materials segment?","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. I think from an overall supply chain standpoint, it is our understanding that there was some impact on the Taiwan earthquake. And so we clearly would have seen that in March, in terms of some of the utilizations. In terms of the impact in gross margin, of course it will depend a little bit on how this all gets itself resolved, but we would have guided our gross margins to be 42% if we hadn't had this issue. So think of it somewhere, half a point, something like that.","Douglas Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, great. And then a follow-up question, interesting that nobody's really asked on the Display business yet. But there, I think you mentioned during the prepared remarks that utilizations from the panel makers have started to move back higher. Does that suggest that the first quarter indeed was kind of the lowest point for utilizations and we should see a recovery throughout the rest of the year? And then similarly and relatedly, are you seeing further shift to thinner glass, kind of 0.3, 0.4 millimeter glass, and if that's having any impact on productions?","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, the answer to your first question is absolutely, we think that Q1 is the low point. I mean, we had said in the call last quarter, and we still continue to believe that Q1 would be the low quarter and we'd start seeing increases in demand. And as our guidance shows, is that we're looking at the market and our own volumes to be up in the high single digits. So we feel good about where the market is on glass, and where our volume is going to be in the second quarter, but even in the second half of the year. So the short answer is, is that we thought that was going to be the case, and it's absolutely turning out to be the case. Do you want to talk about thin, or?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'd say that no definitive move yet to the 0.4 or 0.3 millimeter in a broad sense. But certainly an awful lot of dialogue; 0.4 millimeter is growing some. We'll have to see how some of the big players end up working through the changes they have to make in panel making, and how that interacts with what they see as the value prop on the thinner glass. So more to come. Watch this space.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Next question, Sean.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath, from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hi. Good morning. Hi, Wendell, Tony. Two questions, if I may. The first is, if you look at your Optical Communication business, in addition to the manufacturing issues you noted, was there any weakness in any of the end markets you sell into in Optical? Would be very helpful to hear. Thanks.","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay, well I think Wendell talked about that before. The enterprise market did start off a little weak at the beginning of the year. If you take a look at our slides, you'll see that sales were down, a lot of that of course driven by the issue with our software implementation. But it did start off a little weak, but it definitely picked up as the quarter progressed, and is very strong right now. And the carrier market has been strong the entire time. So we feel very good about the end markets in Optical.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. And then, Tony, a quick follow on for you. Cash flow generation in Q1 was quite weak. Help us understand what drove the weakness in cash flow. Thanks.","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. I mean, I think I already answered that, Vijay.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Rod Hall from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess I have two. The first one is, we're tracking a lot of OLED capacity provisioning out in the marketplace, and I'm just curious if you guys have an expectation for when OLED really starts to take share in the smartphone market. Is that next year that you would expect that, late this year? Can you just give us some color on that? And then, what the impact on your own business would be?","And then secondly, on Optical Communications, I just wanted to follow up. I think, Wendell, you had said that carriers are very reliant on you guys. I'm assuming that means you haven't really lost much share, but it's more an impact on projects. And I wonder if you could comment on regionally at least, where projects may have been slowed down in terms of optical build out. Thanks.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Rod, and thanks especially for the question on OLED because I was worried if no one asked, I would just have to tell them. So that when Tony and Ann go out to talk to investors, they'd be able to have a reference point. So, but let's start with your OpCo question. Very observant, Rod. So a rough piece is, that's why we expect to recover in the back half a significant hunk of our OpCo businesses is there's some of it that you just can't get the product or the systems anywhere else. But there's also a hunk in cable that is just going to be lost, that you could get an alternative at the cable component level.","The region you feel it the most in for us has been North America, right. So that's the region that's felt it the worst. We felt it everywhere, because once we get a constraint of our capacity, we sort of draw it down. But North America has felt it the worst, because that's the area where we had the software implementation points, and telecom customers tend to qualify specific product sets in particular production facilities. So that's where we felt it. It's why we're pretty encouraged we can recover, as well as the fact that things are really tight right now in fiber and cable. So that's our thought on OpCo. Before I move to OLED, does that work for you, Rod?","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, that'd be great, Wendell. Thank you.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So OLED. So for those of you who aren't following it quite as closely as Rod, the OLED capacity that has been largely announced or discussed has been for a technology called polyimide OLED. Let me start with what the impact is on us and then give you a little background. So the impact on us is that the adoption of this P-OLED technology will increase Corning glass sales. Now, that seems unusual, right, so probably we should take a moment to explain it.","So a little over five years ago when OLEDs first began emerging as a number of the different OEMs started to promote them, we developed a strong point of view on how OLED would play out versus LCD. So the first step is you got to separate between large size and small. These are very different applications and they use different types of display technology, today and going forward. In the large size, which is 90% of glass volume roughly, we believed strongly then and continue to believe that OLEDs will be at best a niche product, and we thought that because we could see how LCDs would continue to improve and what we believed is that OLED's incremental cost would not be worth their shrinking benefits relative to LCD. And that's played out where we've gone from three major OEMs promoting OLED strongly to now just one. And certainly the market has played out in terms of demand, as we expected. We continue to expect that technological outcome for the foreseeable future.","Now, in small there is a different matter. Small, about 10% of the market. We thought then and now that polyimide OLEDs were very, very interesting and we thought they were interesting because you could potentially conform them behind a nice piece of our Corning Gorilla Glass and get a very different customer experience where you'd have displays bending around corners, and therefore very small bezels, and long term, the potential for a flexible display. So that's where we focused our strategic and technical energy. And as a result, what we've done is we've developed a very advantaged product and very, very, very high market shares.","So as a result, even though polyimide OLED consumes less glass, this is way more than offset by our share gain in this technology. Plus, because this is a small part of the market, we don't see any overall impact to overall glass supply and demand in any sort of meaningful way. Rigid OLED versus LTPS, LCD, they're going to split that market. That's not that big a deal. Now as goes to timing, so we have a really good idea on timing, but we can't really discuss it, because that would disclose our knowledge of our customers' exact product plans and that wouldn't be appropriate.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is it, Wendell, is it fair to say that most of that capacity in the industry comes online next year as opposed to this?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So I think what makes that question hard to answer is I don't know whether or not you've got the totality of what people's capacity plans are, right. Clearly we are going to see very robust growth in capacity in this space. How that will then tie to how and when products are introduced is a little more complicated question that starts to get more confidential. But, usually you can count on announced capacity increases by the types of players that can actually manufacture this to be relatively reliable.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Notter from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks guys. I wanted to ask about the cost downs you mentioned. I have to apologize, I think I missed some of the details here, but I think it was $40 million in cost downs. I think you were talking about the Display business. Can you kind of walk back through the numbers you were referencing? And then what precisely are you doing there and why call it out this quarter as opposed to kind of the normal cost reduction efforts you guys go through? Thanks.","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think you're referring to the charge that we took in the first quarter that's not in our core results, but is in our GAAP results. It was about $109 million and it was across a number of businesses, particularly some industry, or some facility consolidations. And what we were highlighting was one, why the charge was there and then the second item was just it continues in our journey to always be the lowest cost manufacturer. From a cash standpoint, it equates to, once all the charges are taken, that it's about $40 million of cash. The annual savings is about $50 million and that's obviously why we did it.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And then our next question will come from the line of Wamsi Mohan from BoA Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thanks for taking the question. One of your initiatives, if we just step back here and look at sort of over the last few years has been bringing stability to the Display business. Now in the context of seeing the best pricing you've seen in five years in Q1 and improving from here on and improving inventory situation, your Display core net income declined 24% on a year on year basis. So can you talk about stabilizing the business from a profit context in the context of these results? And you're still guiding 300 basis points of gross margins decline year on year. Can you talk about why the gross margin isn't improving more sequentially when you are seeing such a nice uptick in display volumes? Thank you.","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. Let me take the first question. What it's going to take to stabilize our display earnings, we've always said it's a combination of two things. One is moderate price declines and the second is volume growth. And what you saw in the first quarter, although the price declines were moderate, our volume on a year over year basis was actually down. And so that's the key driver of the reduction in profitability. In terms of from a, and so as you look out moving forward, as we get into quarters where we have moderate price declines and we have significant volume increases, we certainly are going to get much closer to having stability in our display industry, or in our Display business. That's fundamentally what we have been focused on and we do believe that what's happened from a pricing standpoint over the last two years gives us greater confidence in the ability to do that.","On your second question in terms of gross margins, we would have had a greater expansion on gross margins if it wasn't for the power outage in Taiwan. It will depend a little bit on actually how much that ends up costing us. But you could think of it in terms of half a point from a gross margin standpoint. So that when we get into the second half of the year, when we don't have that impact, we don't have the impact from the software implementation, and we have higher volumes, we expect continued gross margin expansion getting much closer to where we were in the first half of last year.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Tony. Operator, we'll take one last quick question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will come from the lane of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Wendell, I wanted to follow up on the OLED question on a couple of just updates on other future initiatives, particularly what progress you've seen if any around Iris, as well as what feedback has been after kind of the reports you've released in conjunction with Ford on the auto glass opportunity, especially coming out of some of the recent trade shows and supplier shows in that space. Thanks.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Well thanks for the question. Iris continues to get strong engagement from the grants and you're right to ask that in or around OLEDs because it is a way to get sort of sub 5-millimeter thick LCD technology, which is starting to put you right in the zone of OLEDs. So that is part of one of those technological innovations. So we're continuing to see good, strong interest in it.","Fascinatingly enough, the fastest moving set of brands in this space are in China. And what we are seeing is real up and coming brands use this as a way to differentiate their very large TVs. So it's way too early to call this idea a success, to add a third piece of glass to a TV. I think let's keep asking the question as we roll forward. We should know a hunk more by the end of this year, how much momentum this tech has got or not. But so far, I would color it as continuing to be quite intriguing to our brands, basically because you can get thinner TVs with smaller bezels, and that helps you versus OLED. So it will all be about how does the economics work with that value prop, and more to come.","On auto, I think you rightly noticed the amount of sort of coverage we've been getting, mainly because one of our big brands has been promoting it so strongly. It's really on the back of our customers being so excited about this, that we've getting all this press. And the most recent one has been, is what they basically announced is sort of a joint technical study that they've done with us, that shows not only is the glass lighter weight, but that it breaks a lot less. So you have the potential for a reduction in rock strike breaks by up to half. And so, they got really excited about that, and they believe it's the only way to get to very thin lightweight glazing, and the traditional ways to do it with soda lime just won't work technically and be safe. So they got really excited about that and published those papers. Expect more pieces on that.","That all being said, I will say about this business what I've said from the beginning, is don't get too excited until we actually see an everyday platform brand adopted. And until we get there, I don't think we've reached a tipping point, no matter how excited our customers seem to be. Until I get by that point, I won't feel confident in being able to predict that we've really got something here. Does that make sense?","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","It does. Thank you.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Wendell.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Well, thanks everyone for listening. Once again, apologize for the execution issue in telecom. Other than that, we are marching along as we anticipated to do. We look forward to updating you on strong sequential growth and the closing of the Dow Corning transaction.","Ann H. S.

It's my pleasure to turn the call over to Ms. Ann Nicholson, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ann H. S. Nicholson","Thank you, John, and good morning. Welcome to Corning's First Quarter Conference Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Flaws, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Before Wendell and Jim begin their formal comments, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These remarks involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's SEC reports.","You should also note that this presentation contains a number of non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation can be found on our website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Wendell.","Wendell P. Weeks","Thanks, Ann. Good morning, everyone. At our Investor Day in February, we explained to investors why we believe Corning is a strong investment. We highlighted growth in our existing businesses, our expectations for solid cash generation and a rich R&D portfolio with the potential to create entirely new businesses. We reminded investors of our goal to return to earnings growth. We outlined the progress we made in 2012, and we noted that our fourth quarter results provided evidence that our strategy was working.","I am very pleased to say that we started off 2013 with a strong quarter, exceeding analyst consensus. Our first quarter core earnings per diluted share were up 15% year-over-year and up double digits year-over-year for the second quarter in a row. You may recall that early in 2012 we identified 2 priorities for returning to earnings growth: reestablish positive momentum in display and grow our other businesses. In display, our number one priority was to moderate LCD glass price declines. As expected, quarter 1 2013 price declines for LCD glass were more moderate sequentially, and we expect price decline to moderate further in quarter 2. Going forward, we believe price declines will continue to be moderate as a result of the customer agreements we entered into last year, as well as the weakening yen. This improved price outlook, the stabilization of our share and new product introductions are creating positive momentum again for display.","Now for the second priority; to grow our other businesses. We believe that we are on the right track here too. Our other businesses had solid operational results, combining to contribute 70% higher net income on a year-over-year basis. Jim will give you more color on our financial results, but I just want to summarize by saying that the combination of moderating LCD glass price declines, improved operational performance and 2 consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year earnings per share growth demonstrate that Corning has begun the march up in earnings.","I would also like to take a moment to talk about our other announcement this morning. We previously told investors that we were entering a period where our strong operating cash flow and lower capital spending would allow us to devote more cash to shareholder returns. We are delivering on this commitment with a new $2 billion share repurchase. This comes on top of the $1.5 billion buyback that we completed in the fourth quarter of 2012. This reflects our belief that the company is undervalued at the current stock price. We are also increasing the quarterly dividend to $0.10 per quarter. This 11% increase means that we have doubled our dividend level in the last 18 months.","Finally, I would like to comment on the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate, which affects the translation of our display and specialty segments results. We moved decisively in the first quarter to hedge Corning's exposure to changes in the yen exchange rate. Investors should be aware that Corning's risk exposure to changes in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate is capped at 93. And now I'll turn the call over to Jim.","James B. Flaws","Thanks, Wendell, and good morning. I hope you've had a chance to read our quarter 1 earnings press release this morning. In it, you'll see our results reported as core earnings. I'd like to begin my comments by explaining to you our rationale for changing the core earnings and its major components. In February, we said that we wanted to clearly show you our performance so you could directly assess the status of our plan to return to earnings growth. Core earnings excludes nonperformance-related items from our results so you're better able to see operating results. Similar to our prior reporting, it also excludes special items, like nonoperating charges and certain accruals.","Core earnings measures the performance of the company without 2 significant external factors: first, the yen exchange rate fluctuations; and second, the solar industry upheaval. Let me say a little more about each. Sales of our display products are currently priced in yen so we must translate these sales back to U.S. dollars for our financial statements. Additionally, our glass manufacturing cost in both display and Gorilla Glass are primarily denominated in Asian currencies, including the yen, but again, we must report our cost of goods sold in U.S. dollars. As a result, movements in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate can impact our results in display and Gorilla as we report them in U.S. dollars.","Now we've experienced changes in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate before, but typically these changes have been more gradual. Since November of 2012, the rate of change has been dramatic, with the yen weakening by more than 20% since that time. So while we remain focused on managing reducing our vulnerability to foreign exchange rate changes, we decided to report our results with a constant yen. This reporting will allow U.S. investors to see the operating results without the impact of yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate changes. The use of constant exchange rate reporting is not uncommon for U.S. companies and is an accepted practice. The exchange rate that we will use, called out as a management rate, is JPY 93 per U.S. dollar.","Now as Wendell explained in his remarks, the company moved decisively to hedge exposure to further weakening in the yen exchange rate. Our hedges protect the company from any further weakening above JPY 93. Because we have this economic protection at the JPY 93 level, we chose this rate for the constant yen core performance reporting. Now in an attachment to this morning's press release, we provided you our 2012 results restated with this exchange rate so you can update your models and compare apples-to-apples. We'll also provide history for 2011 in the near future.","Now our second adjustment for core reporting relates to our equity venture, Dow Corning Corporation, that has a subsidiary, Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation. Hemlock makes polysilicon for the solar industry. I went into great detail on February 8 about the dire situation in the solar market, driven by the macro environment and the investigation by the Chinese government regarding dumping of polysilicon. Driven by these events, Hemlock's earnings over the last 18 months have been unpredictable, and we expect that to continue. Pending the outcome of the investigation and instability of the solar market, Hemlock may have to take actions to write-off assets and call in their take-or-pay contracts. These potential actions, to whatever extent required, are unrelated to its core operations. Therefore, our core earnings also exclude equity earnings from Hemlock. This was a relatively minor impact in quarter 1.","Our core earnings are a non-GAAP financial measure, and of course, we will continue to report GAAP results, and you can refer to the GAAP reconciliations on our website. As always, Ann Nicholson, in Investor Relations, will be available after the call today to answer any questions you may have about the financial reconciliations as you update your models.","So now I'd like to turn to our quarter 1 core earnings results. First quarter sales for the corporation were $1.8 billion, consistent with the year ago. Gross margin was 43%, up 1 point year-over-year and better than our original expectation of 41%.  Telecom and specialty material had very good gross margin growth versus last year. Gross equity earnings of $180 million, and as a reminder, this is also at constant yen, were consistent with the year ago, and I'll provide some more color on this in a few minutes.","Our core effective tax rate for Q1 was 16%. We did have a special item, a $54 million tax benefit to record the impact of the American Taxpayer Relief Act, which was enacted on June 3, which we excluded from our core earnings. Investors may recall we actually excluded a loss from the same item in Q4. It was the unusual timing of Congress approving this bill on January 3 that caused these 2 entries. The most important impact of that bill was it allow us to have lower ongoing tax expense this year, and we expect this benefit to continue into 2014.","Core earnings per share were $0.30, up $0.04 over 1 year ago and well above analyst consensus. Now it's important to note that moving the core performance did not impact quarter 1 of this year's results because the actual rate in the quarter was 93, and the same as our management reporting rate. Better operating performance drove the core EPS improvement over analyst consensus and EPS, as a stated here, is a non-GAAP measure and as always, a reconciliation to GAAP can be found on our website. As a reference versus a year ago, SG&A and R&D were consistent as a percentage of sales.","And now I'd like to go through our quarter 1 segment results and I'll start with display. Core sales for display, which exclude the impact to changes in the yen exchange rate or at a constant yen, were $650 million in Q1, an increase of 7% versus last year. LCD glass volume was up significantly, more than offsetting price declines. Gross equity earnings, also measured at constant yen from our equity venture in Korea, SCP, were at $133 million in quarter 1, a decrease of 8% year-over-year. LCD glass volume at SCP was up slightly versus quarter 1 of 2012.","For your modeling purposes, display equity company's first quarter LCD sales in constant yen were about $608 million, a decrease of 4% from last year. Now as a reminder, this represents SCP's LCD sales only. Our public filings will report SCP's total sales, which include various other products. As we expected, our total LCD glass volumes were down mid-single-digits sequentially and up mid-teens year-over-year. SCP's volume versus last year was up slightly, reflecting the Korean panel maker's relatively consistent utilizations. Our wholly owned business volume was up significantly versus the prior year, reflecting the growing Chinese television market.","Last October, we explained that going forward after Q4 with our shares stabilized and the industry maturing, we expected price declines to moderate at all of our customers, including those with new agreements. I'm very pleased to report that our share remains stable in Q1, and our price declines in Q1 were less than Q4. Core net income was up slightly versus Q1 of 2012, which is a good sign that we're stabilizing display. We were able to have volume increases offset lower glass price declines.","Now on the supply chain front, we estimate that weeks of inventory grew in quarter 1, which is the result of several things in combination: a healthier cash position, the need to carry more inventory for growing emerging markets and the proliferation of television screen sizes in preparation for China's May holiday. We continue to monitor the supply chain inventory closely, and I'll comment more on the supply chain in our outlook section.","Now in telecom, quarter 1 sales were $470 million, down 7% year-over-year. Fiber and cable sales in North America were down due to decline in the U.S. government stimulus spending versus the prior year. Sales were also down versus our expectations, primarily driven by slower NBN ramp-up and a slower start than we expected in China for fiber and cable. We are seeing China fiber and cable market pick up in Q2. Despite the sales decline, net income in telecom was up almost 70%. Lower volume was offset by improved manufacturing performance and the implementation of strong spending controls.","In our environmental segment, sales were down 13% year-over-year, but actually slightly higher than our expectations. Now you may recall in Q1 of 2012, it was an unusually robust quarter for the auto and heavy-duty truck demand. Since then, the European auto market and the U.S. Class A truck build rate have softened. We do expect sales growth throughout 2013 with demand picking up in the coming quarters. I'll talk more about that in our outlook section.  Net income was down 34% in this segment, driven by lower sales and production volumes.","Specialty material quarter 1 sales were down 10% versus a year ago, driven primarily by Advanced Optics. The cyclically down semiconductor market impacted Advanced Optics sales. Now core net income in this segment was up 39%, with very significant improvement in Gorilla Glass gross margins versus the prior year. We are very pleased with Gorilla's improvement in gross margins over the last several quarters.","In Life Sciences, Q1 sales were up 34% due to the additional sales from our Discovery Labware acquisition, which closed on October 31 of last year. The acquisition integration is just underway, but it's going very smoothly and it was accretive to this segment this quarter. Year-over-year core net income doubled on the additional sales.","Now I'll turn to Dow Corning, and as a reminder, we excluded Hemlock, gross equity earnings were up 31%. On the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $5.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, with about $1.2 billion in the United States. We did repay a loan in China during the quarter, using about $500 million of cash. Our net cash position is $2.8 billion. Capital spending for the quarter was $194 million, and we remain on track to spend approximately $1.3 billion for the year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $323 million. As a reminder, free cash flow is actually a non-GAAP measure, and the reconciliation to GAAP on this measure can be found on our website.","So now let me turn to the outlook. As I mentioned at the beginning of my commentary, we have begun showing our results as core earnings, which exclude the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, but we've also told you we want to mitigate the negative impact of the weakening yen. In February, management obtained authorization from the Board of Directors to execute a series of foreign exchange contracts over a 2-year period to hedge our exposure to movements in the Japanese yen and its impact on our earnings. We completed the execution to purchase Color Options in late February. These will settle quarterly for a total of 8 quarters. The simplest way to think about these transactions is they protect our P&L from the yen moving higher than JPY 93, which is good, given that the current yen exchange rate is JPY 99. The protection above JPY 93 is the reason that we chose JPY 93 for our management rate for constant yen reporting.","Now we've kept the cost of this hedge low by implementing a collar structure. If the yen averages above JPY 93, we get a hedge benefit, and it offsets the negative translation impact. If the yen exchange rate is between JPY 87 to JPY 93, we currently will not have any hedge settlements in those quarters. If the yen is below JPY 87, Corning will owe on the hedges, but of course, our display segment would be experiencing favorable translation results to offset these hedge payments. In summary, we think we've moved aggressively to protect the company and investors from the unprecedented sudden weakening of the yen, driven by the new Japanese government.","Now let me turn to the display outlook. Let's start with the current view of the end market in 2013. We still expect the retail market, as measured in square feet of glass, to be up mid to high single digits. For reference, 2012 was 3.5 billion square feet. We think LCD TV units will grow in the mid to high single digits, with area growth higher. Large-sized televisions continue to sell well in many regions. Through February, 50-inch-plus TV sales were actually up 107%. You've probably seen reports regarding weakness in the PC market. We're not bullish on the PC market either, expecting only 10% year-over-year growth, with more than all of that attributable to tablets. Monitored units are actually expected to be down about 5%.","Now let's talk about quarter 2. As we near the end of April, we see Q2 LCD glass market at a consistent level sequentially. Our wholly owned business in SCP are combined to expect a consistent Q1 volumes as well. While Q2 is the seasonally slowest quarter at retail, glass volumes are actually up year-over-year and slightly bigger market. We believe inventory will grow again in absolute square feet, and is measured in weeks during Q2 before beginning to deplete in the back half of the year when demand at retail peaks. Quarter 2, we expect our share will remain stable, and that our price declines will further moderate. We expect LCD glass price declines will decline by only 2% to 3% sequentially.","Going forward, we believe price declines will continue to be moderate, as a result of customer agreements we entered into last year, as well as the weakening yen. The change in yen-dollar exchange rate actually helps most of our customers, as they sell their LCD panels in dollars and buy our glass in yen. So the change in yen dollar rate actually increases their profits on our glass, which we believe should decrease their pressure on us for price declines.","Now turning to the telecom outlook, we expect Q2 sales to be up slightly versus Q2 of 2012. This will be driven by the NBN ramp. Sequentially, we expect Q2 sales to be up approximately 20%, coming off a slower-than-expected start to the year.","In environmental, we expect Q2 sales to be up slightly sequentially. This is flat to down slightly year-over-year across the light and heavy duty business compared to a stronger market in Q2 of 2012, which have much higher levels of U.S. Class A truck builds. For the full year, we believe auto production will grow, driven by strength in North America and Asia. We believe tighter regulations in Europe and China will be leading to growth in demand for our heavy-duty diesel products. Specialty materials sales are expected to increase sequentially about 15% to 20% in Q2, which is about 5% up year-over-year. Advanced optics sales are expected to be down year-over-year, given the continued end market softness. Gorilla Glass volumes are up significantly year-over-year in quarter 2.","For the year, we believe there will be double-digit market growth for Gorilla Glass, driven by the penetration of touch on notebooks and the continued growth of the smartphones. We'll likely see most of this impact in the second half. In Life Sciences, we expect sales to be up about 35% to 40% year-over-year, mostly due to added sales from our acquisition. We expect equity earnings from Dow Corning silicones segment to be up about 20% year-over-year.","Now continuing down the rest of our Q2 forecast on the P&L. We expect core gross margin percent to be similar to Q1, which is up year-over-year driven by manufacturing efficiencies and increased sales. SG&A is expected to be down versus last year as a percentage of sales, while R&D spending should be consistent, and core equity earnings should be down about 15% versus last year. Our core effective tax rate for 2013 should stay around 16%. And that concludes my opening remarks. Ann?","Ann H. S. Nicholson","Thank you, Jim. John, now we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first, we'll go to Jim Suva with Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If we just take a step back and look at the big picture of how you kind of see the macro supply demand balance shaking out kind of currently, as well as looking forward to stay for the rest of the year, can you help us understand the supply, demand dynamics? We know Corning, I believe, has, in the past year or so, opened up a couple of plants and have some more efficiency gains, not only from Corning, but also competitors to either improve our increase in supply. But then on the demand front, we are seeing TV unit growth, which I think is kind of in the mid-single to upper-mid-single digit growth, and then service area is increase in the TVs. Can you just maybe take a step back and let us know the supply\/demand equilibrium today and looking forward, how you see it there at Corning?","Wendell P. Weeks","Sure, Jim. Basically, things look relatively in balance right now. It's just that simple. There's, of course, going forward, there's always dynamics on both the supply and demand side, but our opinion right now is things look relatively in balance, which helps in addition to our contracts that we've entered into and the weakening yen with our view of a relatively more benign price environment.","James B. Flaws","I'd like to add on to that if I could, and that is I think that the market is in balance partially because of the discipline that Corning Incorporated is doing and some of the other manufacturers are. As you know, we continue to keep capacity offline in Korea, and we will do that to make sure that we stay in balance.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jim, I think you said the yen has hedged out for 2 years and settled quarterly. Can you talk about the cost to implement this collar? And I have a follow-up.","James B. Flaws","Yes, the cost was about $100 million for the 2 years.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And that would be realized all as the hedge continues? Those will be implemented over the course of the 2 years?","James B. Flaws","No, it's spread over the 2 years.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then can you talk a little bit about some of the new capacity that's anticipated to come online this year? And if LG Chem's early shipments are changing, anything at all from a pricing dynamic or share dynamic?","James B. Flaws","In terms of new capacity coming online for us?","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","For the market. So NEG have some capacity coming online and LG Chem too.","James B. Flaws","So NEG has capacity coming online. They've announced that they're building a tank in Korea, and I believe their expectations are that for the back half of the year. They have said in the original announcement that they will be shutting down capacity in Japan when that occurs, and we're taking that as their stated announcement. Their second tank is not until sometime late next year per their statements. LG Chem has 1 tank running, and it's actually been running almost 2 years now. And the second tank, as far as our surveillance says, consists of only a few steel pilings in the ground, but we are not feeling LG Chem is a significant supplier in the industry.","Operator","And next, we go to Patrick Newton with Stifel.","Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I guess, sticking to the hedge question, you talked about taking care of translation exposure between 87 and 93 on the yen exchange rate, but you still have transaction exposure. So I guess if we look at your 10-K and take that as a base, I think previously and prior to these hedges, a 10% move in the yen dollar FX rate would impact net income by about 6%. So using that metric, where would that stand post your hedge?","James B. Flaws","Well, you have no further impact. I mean, that amount between JPY 93 and JPY 87, you would see that impact of about -- I think it's about $5 million per yen on an annualized basis. So you could calculate that between JPY 93 and JPY 87 if you want, but we're reporting basically at JPY 93.","Wendell P. Weeks","And the key element to what we sought to accomplish with the yen hedge is to basically take the risk off the table for the next couple of years, right? So that capping the exposure at JPY 93, it puts us in a spot where it gives us much more stable earnings pattern going forward. The relative degree of gain on that hedge or not will depend on what the yen actually performs like. One of the reasons we did it, why we moved the core earnings in Q1, was because it really didn't impact quarter 1 earnings per share because our hedge rate and the actual yen in quarter 1 are close to the same thing. So that no matter how you looked at our earnings, GAAP, our normal way of x specials or core earnings, we're significantly better than consensus. As we go forward, if the yen stays where it is right now for quarter 2 and it's closer to JPY 100 to the dollar, we'd experience some significant gains on the hedge, which would offset any of the translation loss of bringing on yen-based pricing deterioration in the yen factor back into dollars. Does that make sense?","Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, that makes sense. So in essence, though, no transaction exposure at the yen-dollar level?","James B. Flaws","That's what you should be -- that's what you will see in our results.","Wendell P. Weeks","Right.","Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then, I guess, something, Jim, it seem like in your prepared remarks, you kind of inflected in your voice that LCD prices are currently priced at yen. Maybe I'm reading too much into that, but I'd love you to discuss the likelihood of changing the price into U.S. dollars, the thoughts on could that happen within kind of this 2-year hedge window, and the pros and cons of what has kept to you from changing the past and perhaps with the change in FX rate, what makes it more attractive in the future?","James B. Flaws","So it clearly is a possibility, as we talked about in our IR Day in February, that we could convert over to U.S. dollar pricing. And clearly, it could occur during this 2-year hedge period of time. It's obviously a complex shift because you have to figure out what rate you're going to do it at, and you've got to get your customers to agree, and of course, we also have to think about what our competition will do. But I didn't mean to imply anything with my inflection, but clearly, I will state to you that the possibility of us going to U.S. dollar pricing for our display business is very real.","Wendell P. Weeks","To add to it, I would agree with James' statements. When we told you at the beginning of the year that our time and attention was going to the yen and making sure that we would be taking the appropriate action, we look both at commercial changes, like shifting to the dollar in the near term, as well as doing what we did in the hedge. What we did is cover this next 2 years. It would give us time to figure out what the appropriate commercial change is, as well as opportunities to reach very considered opinions on how we should handle the yen going forward.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Gentlemen, the pricing change, as it relates to market share, it's good to see that things are stabilizing in price. What's the staying power and what's been the competitive response, if any? And are we getting indications that rationality for the display industry can prevail on a going forward basis just as we move through the back half of the year and into next year?","Wendell P. Weeks","Well, clearly, what we're seeking to accomplish is just that or we really control are our actions. And what we've done with the series of agreements we put in place is to stabilize our share, to develop a fixed relationship between our price and market price, which should make for economic decision-making by all the players involved. We're encouraged by the progress that we've made in quarter 1, as well as quarter 2. Only time will tell how this all turns out, but we're encouraged.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Will it be a quarter or so, what you could kind of call a success to the change in pricing, or is this an ongoing thing that we have to kind of monitor?","Wendell P. Weeks","Clearly, getting another quarter under our belt with this continued moderation, we feel even better. But at the core of it, pricing and pricing strategy is always going to be important in this business. So we think we can reduce the volatility, and we're making some progress toward just that, but it will continue to take a good amount of time and attention.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then separately, if the regional demand for display continues to change around the world, does that make you reconsider your CapEx by region? I understand the plans for this year at $1.3 billion, just thinking about if things move around in 2014 and beyond.","James B. Flaws","I'm not quite sure I follow your question, Mark, about regionally. You're asking about spending in glass business?","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's in display as you try to move closer to your end customers. So we understand the plans you're making for this year in China, for example. Do things change the following leap [ph] year? Do you concentrate your progression in capacity in certain regions and does that require changes in CapEx longer term?","James B. Flaws","No, I don't think in 2014 you should expect to see much change in the company's capital spending for our glass business. We're really at what we would call more of a maintenance level in the display area now. And because of the result we've seen, we think we're in good shape there, and we feel that we can regionally supply very effectively between Taiwan, Japan and Korea, and so we don't feel that the fact that China is growing very rapidly causes us problem. I mean, we've been shipping glass to China for a long time. So capital spending, you should feel pretty good about the $1.3 billion this year. And right now is, as I think we've told you, we think it's $1.3 billion again next year, and display is not a big good portion of that. It really is driven by some spending in our other business, including environmental.","Wendell P. Weeks","Yes, we're pretty happy with our asset platform in China as well. It's all been previously announced what we're doing. The productivity there looks really good.","Operator","Our next question is from Amitabh Passi with UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just had a couple of questions. Jim, on the $2 billion buyback plan you announced, from a funding perspective, will you need to repatriate any cash? Or do you think you can fund that based on what you have onshore? And I just wanted to clarify your gross margin of 42.4% came in about 200 basis points above, I think, your expectations. Again, I think, given all the restatements, can you just help me understand is that a \"clean number\"? How does it compare to last year's gross margin? It seems like it was flattish, and then I had one other follow-up.","James B. Flaws","So on gross margin, the 200 basis point improvement was driven by very strong manufacturing within, particularly, telecom and Gorilla, really drove the improvement in expectations, and I can't remember what last year's number is. Maybe Ann can look it up in the script. I just can't remember off the top of my head. Your first question was on?","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just the funding mechanism of the $2 billion buyback plan, would you need to repatriate any cash? Or do you think you have enough onshore to fund the $2 billion buyback if you chose to go through the entire amount?","James B. Flaws","We don't have a need to repatriate the cash. We are not changing our assertion that it's permanently invested during the timeframe that we're talking about.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, maybe one for you, Wendell. The sequential growth in telecom and Gorilla Glass, can you give us any insight in terms of what the drivers are, where you're seeing that sequential growth coming from?","Wendell P. Weeks","Definitely, and I'll add quick -- briefly to Jim's previous comment. So I think your question was right on, on are these results clean? And given our move to core earnings, it's great question and they are. It's one of the reasons we're doing it this quarter, and to try to match going forward, the economic reality of being hedged out at JPY 93 ought to be able to help us and help you all be able to get a nice, clean forward-looking forecast as well. So now on to that forecast in sequentials; in telecom, we would expect the sequential ups to be driven by a season output; normal, it's a little bit above normal seasonality increases out of China especially, as well as some uptick in our enterprise business. In specialty and in Gorilla, we'll see that uptick be linked more to new product launches, and we'd expect that to ramp through the year. For example, something like the Galaxy S4, which is just going to start really ramping up their supply chain in quarter 2 with Gorilla Glass 3.","James B. Flaws","Just a follow-up on your gross margin question, Ann tells me quarter 1 of the year-ago was 42%.","Operator","The next question is from Steven Fox of Cross Research.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","A couple of questions for me. Just following up on that last question, could you talk about SG&A in a similar manner? It looks like it came in, by my count, $30 million, $35 million less than you guys were originally guiding to now, and I was curious if that's sustainable. And then secondly, Jim, just on the equity earnings line, that came in greater than expected. How much was that related to, not including the solar polysilicon results in the numbers? And by not including it, is that sort of an admission that we're definitely going to see a write-down of those assets?","James B. Flaws","On the latter, I think it was $5 million. So Hemlock was not a significant exclusion, and no, it's not an admission. It really was our choice on taking Hemlock out. I really feel it's got -- it's so much influenced by what's happening on the trade war between China, the United States and Europe, that you really run the risk of the results being affected by that rather than really what we focus on, which is making and selling product. We do not have a ruling for MOFCOM. They delayed it. Again, we now think it's going to be in June. We don't know what it's going to be so we're not predicting that, but we just decided it would be easier for you to not have the potential swings in Hemlock in our results, but in quarter 1, it was a very tiny amount. I think some of the SG&A gain is sustainable from quarter 1, but not all of it.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","And then just one quick follow-up on the equity earnings line. So just a little bit more color around Dow Corning. It looks like, I guess, the core silicones business is improving more. Is that -- can you just talk about your outlook now for that business recovering as the year goes on?","James B. Flaws","Yes, we're expecting it to improve again in quarter 2. Silicone does go through a cycle. The cycle is driven somewhat by capacity adds in the industry. Dow Corning did that, as well as some of our competition. There has been raw material pressure but -- so 2012 probably was a low point if you look at silicone margins. And we think we're still getting as the industry grows in some of that new capacity and with moderation in some raw material pricing, we think that we're starting to move up on the margin cycle, and so we're expecting improvement in silicones in quarter 2. And as of now, I have no reason to not expect the back half of the year to be good year-over-year also.","Operator","And next we'll go to Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask first what the EPS would have been in the quarter under the old accounting or maybe kind of put another way, I just wanted to understand in terms of the FX impact that was included, clearly, the cost of the hedges excluded, but what about the move of the yen up to JPY 93, was that included in the quarterly results or it's not? What would that have looked like if it had not been excluded?","James B. Flaws","Well, the yen, there really is no change. I mean, because the yen was PJPY 93, and so there really was no impact and the cost of the hedge for the quarter after tax was a very small amount.","Wendell P. Weeks","Yes. So I think the core answer to your question is no difference. That's one of the reasons we wanted to do it this quarter. Core earnings are about going forward on the volatility standpoint and to be able to link to our actual hedge.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then the other question is on your guidance for a relatively flat volume into the second quarter. That seemed a bit weaker than I would expect it, given that you had some correction in the first quarter in seasonality, and even some of your customers, like LG Display, had guided for something a bit higher. So can you just go into the drivers of that view and then what you see in terms of inventory downstream?","James B. Flaws","What goes into that view is our reflection on the fact that inventories grew again in quarter 1 and are likely to grow a little in quarter 2, and we think that level will temper a little the potential volume that the panel makers will take. We recognize we could be wrong in that. And I would say if we had to say where the error would come, it might be stronger. Clearly, the demand right now from our panel maker customers is quite strong. We're actually air shipping in order to meet their demand. So it could be that it is -- that we'll actually see it go up. It's just that our caution is we measure the amount of inventory in the supply chain north of where the panel makers are as we're worried that it is -- it's built up quite a bit, and therefore, that's what led us to our flat guidance.","Wendell P. Weeks","Based on the high side, are healthy. But to your point, it's -- we'd like to see the May sales in China, and then it could be that we're underestimating where the market is going to be.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And in your view, what explains that disconnect between your customers requiring you to air-ship while at the same time you're having excess levels of inventory?","Wendell P. Weeks","I don't think they're in excess. We'd say they're just on the high side of healthy, right? And I think what it really comes down to is how big a sales cycle do they see, especially in China as the retailers get ready for the May day sales.","James B. Flaws","I just want to make sure you understand that the inventories we're talking about are not at the panel makers. So it is our estimation of what exists at a set assembly in a retail, and the panel makers are continuing to run strong. In order to keep up with them, we're doing some air shipping, which, regretfully, is costing us a little bit in gross margin. But if China, the May holidays perform as well as what we saw in the New Year's holidays, we could be surprised on the upside and do a little bit better what our guidance has been.","Operator","The next question is from Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of clarifications first. Jim, the $100 million hedge expenses, where does that show up or where are we going to see in the P&L? And also the change in pension accounting that you made, did that have an impact on EPS this quarter and what do you expect that to be for the year? And then I have some fundamental follow-ups.","James B. Flaws","Well, on the pension, it basically was $0.01, and it's in both this year and last year so it really isn't making a change statement. The cost of the hedge, we exclude from core performance. But as you divide the $100 million by 8 quarters and tax effective, it's a very small amount.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. That is helpful. Digging a little bit deeper into the equity earnings, the $173 million versus -- we had about $120 million, count that SCP was probably around $17 million of that. The rest, did that come basically from silicones? And can you just give more color on what is driving that? You did make some comments that you think it's sustainable and it comes back. Just what are the drivers there and sort of to understand kind of the moving pieces? And then on cash, someone asked before and I'm not sure I caught the answer, what is your U.S. cash balance right now? I think it was $1.5 billion at the end of last year.","James B. Flaws","Cash balance is $1.2 billion right now.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","In the U.S.?","James B. Flaws","In the U.S. And in terms of equity earnings, it's -- we believe that silicone business is doing quite well in the current quarter. It's going to continue to do well in the second quarter.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Any drivers behind that? I mean, what's creating that so that I can track?","James B. Flaws","So we've said demand is good. Pricing has been okay. Raw materials have been -- costs have been improving versus where they were. So those are the primarily things. Demand is good in China, good in the United States, weak in Europe.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I've always thought sales have just more been somewhat of a GDP-related thing because they go into a lot of different areas. So is that a comment on macro, in general, looking better from the perspective of product that silicones go into...","James B. Flaws","They have a very high correlation with GDP or industrial production. It depends on which segment, the usage of it. But I think the thing you have to remember, as emerging economies start to move up the scale, if you will, of development, they actually use more silicone per population. So you actually get a multiplier effect even though, say, China's GDP is 7.7%, as an example, the growth in silicones will be higher because -- consistently seeing developing economies as more silicones per person, if you will, as they move up the scale of life, and so that's what where we think we're seeing some of the strength.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And China's GDP was even stronger last year, and yet, it wasn't really helping you then. So I'm just trying to find out what was the turning point of what's happening now that hasn't happened previously that seems to be bringing that category back up again? Is there anything you can pinpoint or...","James B. Flaws","Because last year, we -- you were seeing perspective from our price competition and we're not seeing that right now.","Wendell P. Weeks","So overlaying the GDP pieces in those factors, you also have just sort of the supply-demand cycles that you get in silicones over time, and feel like it bottomed out last year, and it's starting its lock-up as an industry as they get better and better balance between demand and supply.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And from your standards, is this a 1, 2, 3-year cycle? So this is the beginning of a multiyear upswing or is this a -- does it happen every year, it goes up and down?","James B. Flaws","No, we think silicones is coming off a low point in terms of margin performance. And assuming the world's economies behave, sales should grow. The unknown for us is really going to be Europe. It's really hard to tell what's going to happen in the European economies, and that's clearly been a drag on Dow Corning, but I think we're starting to stabilize a little. Even though it's at a lower level, that's helpful for Dow Corning.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Rod Hall with JPMorgan.","Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So first of all, congrats on the hedging. It's a pretty cheap price to get for all that for $5.2 billion worth of hedges, and a couple of questions on the rest of the business. I wanted to just check in on the inventory again and see -- you've been talking about this structural reduction in inventory over time, and I wonder, based on what we're seeing now, do you think that we're coming to an end of that and that inventory is actually kind of reaching its stability point, or do you think this is just kind of a short-term fluctuation in inventory we're observing? And then I also wanted to talk a little bit about the -- or get you to talk a little bit about the panel supply\/demand situation as we head into the back end of the year. I mean, we see some of these -- well, a lot of these panel manufacturers running pretty high utilization rates now, and we're not at the peak season. So I wonder, do you think that -- do you think there's going to be enough supply in the second half of the year to meet demand even in a more cautious economic scenario? And then I've got a follow-up to that as well.","James B. Flaws","A lot of questions. So the structural reduction in inventory that we talked about in December of 2011, we still believe that, that can occur. What has surprised us is the willingness of the supply chain to carry more inventory than what we expected, and we continue to struggle a  bit as per the reasons as outlined in my prepared remarks. We clearly think that there could be some impact from the fact that panel prices have been relatively stable, and what has often driven supply chain fluctuations has been when -- particularly when people think there's about to be a big reduction in panel prices, no one wants to look dumb and buy when they're seeing that. So we think that stability maybe playing into effect. The second thing, again, hard to prove is the LCD television market basically gets the full penetration, and we're capturing the more emerging parts of China as an example and other parts around the world. It may be that the supply chains are just less efficient. The third factor that we're seeing is that the panel industry has chosen to improve their own efficiencies and also position themselves better, seeing the proliferation of new sizes. So at one time, life was pretty simple. It was either a 32 or 37 or 40 or 42 or 46. Now you see these new sizes like 39 coming in. And the more models you have, the more inventory you have. So we still believe over time that the supply chain will become efficient and will go down, but it's definitely carrying more than what we originally expected. Do you have any comment on the panel supply, Wendell, in terms of, we know there's more capacity coming on in China, and as the year progresses so we're hopeful that, that is enough to supply the demand, but I don't have a lot of current data on panel supply.","Wendell P. Weeks","It's hard to tell at this point in time, I'd say. But boy, it would really be good if you were right.","James B. Flaws","Yes, exactly.","Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I need my follow-up. I don't know, Jim, I wonder if you could make any comment on your cash return policy, going forward, particularly the dividend as you're thinking about metrics there. Do you have a payout ratio in mind or a yield in mind? Or can you just give us any feeling for how you're thinking about that looking forward?","James B. Flaws","We have not yet set a firm policy with the board as either a yield or a percentage of our free cash flow. I can tell you that the board's deliberations went into the announcement today is that we're really dedicating our free cash flow over this year and next year to shareholder returns through a combination of dividend and share repurchase. And I think, as always, I think we'd love to continue to increase the dividend as our earnings go up. We want to be cautious not to get too strong on the dividend because you never want to have to lower it and we lived through that once before. But I think you can expect to see the dividend continue to go up as our earnings go up, and that's dedicated to free cash flow, the remaining free cash flow against share repurchases as long as we feel the company's undervalued, which we clearly do.","Operator","And that will be from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Two questions. First off, Wendell, if the yen continues to weaken further, the prognosis being much closer to like JPY 115 to JPY 125 or something like that over the next 12 months, how do you think that your competitors are likely to respond in terms of pricing, given that you have hedged, do you think that it doesn't matter anymore? So I would like to have your thoughts on that, at least on the qualitative perspective, and then I have a follow-up.","Wendell P. Weeks","Well, what -- economically, you would believe if there were macroeconomic [ph] decision-makers is that it ought to have a very moderating effect on pricing because customers are getting the benefits from that and actually, the weakening yen hurts their financials because of the way their cost structures are built and the way their P&L works. So that ought to give strong motivation to them to be more moderate in their pricing behavior, if indeed they're macroeconomic [ph] decision-makers.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Just as a follow-up, Jim, just -- you alluded in your prepared remarks that the gross margins on Gorilla Glass was getting better. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the puts and takes in terms of how the ASP declines were in Gorilla Glass and how your cost reduction initiatives have begun?","James B. Flaws","Our cost reduction is exceeding our ASP declines on Gorillas. So just a reminder on Gorilla, this remains a relatively new business and new product and we're making improvements in our cost structure as we're making that glass thinner and improving our yields so we are moving up the gross margins of that, and the profitability remains well above the corporate average and it's improving.","Ann H. S. Nicholson","And Jim, do have any closing statements?","James B. Flaws","Yes, I do. A couple of quick wrap-up comments for me. First of all, we do have one Investor Relations announcement. We'll be attending the JPMorgan TMT Conference on May 14 in Boston, and we hope to see a number of you there.","I'd like to just summarize the call this morning. First, we think we've made great progress on stabilizing display, and then returning that business to positive momentum. We didn't talk a lot this morning, but we continue to do well with new products for various usages. Second, we're executing on our goal to grow our earnings and our other businesses. We saw very strong aggregate growth and profitability from our other businesses. Third, we grew core earnings per share year-over-year by double digits, both in quarter 4 and quarter 1, and we think this is very strong evidence that we are marching up on earnings. We think we've moved very assertively and appropriately to protect the company investors with our yen hedges. And we remain very committed to shareholder returns, and we've acted on that commitment by increasing our dividend for the third time in 18 months, effectively doubling it, and announcing a $2 billion share repurchase. You should consider these new actions is approximately a $3.2 billion commitment over the next 2 years, essentially putting our free cash flow work for shareholders, in line with our belief the company is undervalued at its current price. And finally, looking ahead to Q2, we are very confident that we will have a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year core earnings growth, driven by moderate LCD glass price declines and excellent growth in telecom, Gorilla Glass and Life Sciences.

[Operator Instructions]","It is my pleasure to turn the call over to Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ann Nicholson","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, and welcome to Corning's fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.","I'd like to remind you, that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports.","You should also note that we will be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data.

They are also available on our website for downloading.","And now, I will turn the call over to Wendell.","Wendell Weeks","Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. This morning we reported fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. For the fourth quarter sales were $2.9 billion, net income was $406 million and EPS was $0.46. For the full year, sales increased 2% to $11.7 billion, net income was $1.6 billion and EPS was $1.76.","While our 2019 growth did not meet our long-term targets, we once again outperformed our underlying markets. We grew Environmental sales 16%, while car sales were down. We grew Specialty Materials sales 8%, while smartphone units were down. In Life Sciences, we exceeded industry growth on the strength of new products for bioprocess and advanced cell culture.","In Display, our glass volume grew mid-single digits, while TV unit sales were down, and in Optical, we outperformed the passive optical market, which declined a high-single digit percentage. Changing market and customer dynamics impacted our 2019 performance significantly. Corning entered 2019, building on two years of strong growth, and that growth continued in the first half with sales up 11% and EPS up 24% year-over-year.","In the second half, a supply chain correction in the Display industry and weakness in the Optical market, highlighted by capital spending reductions at two of our significant customers, led to declines in Display Technologies and Optical Communications. While we acted quickly to mitigate lower than expected second half demand in Display and Optical, we did not fully overcome these challenges. As a result, our second half sales were down versus 2018 and as our volume decreased, factory utilization declined and so did our profitability, especially gross margin.","We're confident that the situations in Display and Optical Communications are temporary, and we expect the company to return to sales and profit growth in the second half. In Display, we see indicators that the supply chain correction has ended and we expect normal seasonality to resume with the majority of volume and growth in the second half. We also plan to start production at our next Gen 10.5 plants, which will support faster than market growth as the plant's ramp.","In Optical, we expect year-over-year growth in the second half, driven by projects for 5G, fiber-to-the-home and hyperscale data center deployments. We expect these higher volumes to increase factory utilization and support higher profitability and we expect to benefit from the recent and ongoing cost actions in Optical Communications and Display. Tony will provide additional segment details and I will focus on our overall progress and outlook.","2019 was challenging from a financial perspective, but we remain committed to our new Strategy & Growth Framework introduced last year. Our new framework is the evolution of our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework, which we successfully completed last year. Building on the strong foundation of our original framework, we made excellent progress on many strategic initiatives during the year. We made commercial and regulatory progress on Valor. We opened a dedicated factory for our burgeoning auto interiors glass business and grew our order book significantly.","Display pricing remained moderate and we advanced several compelling innovations in Gorilla Glass and Optical Communications. We met or exceeded all of the goals of our 2016 to 2019 Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework, including returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders over four years through share repurchases and a 67% dividend per share increase, all while creating a better, stronger, more resilient company.","Under our new Strategy & Growth Framework, we expect to continue capturing significant organic growth and creating additional value for shareholders. From 2020 to 2023, we expect to deliver 6% to 8% compound annual sales growth and 12% to 15% compound annual EPS growth; expand operating margin and return on invested capital, invest between $10 billion and $12 billion with a focus on organic growth. And return $8 billion to $10 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases.","How do we plan to achieve these goals? We are targeting an incremental $3 billion to $4 billion in annual sales along with improved profitability by the end of 2023, driven primarily by our strategy to create and sell into new product categories that enhance our customers' offerings. As I've said before, we're not just counting on everybody buying more stuff. We're putting more Corning into the products that people already buy. This provides a mechanism for us to grow even in challenging environments. We saw that happen during 2019 in Environmental, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences as I outlined earlier. In short, a big part of Corning's story over the next four years is a content story, and we expect to see it across the company. Let's look at how we advanced our strategy in each market access platform in the fourth quarter and for the full year.","In Optical Communications, we are currently feeling the impact of capital spending reductions in both the carrier and enterprise markets. We expect recovery, driven by 5G, fiber-to-the-home and hyperscale data center deployments. Our goals in Optical Communications are to advance our product portfolio and align costs with demand in the near-term. We're making progress in both areas.","From a product perspective, in 2019, we continue to transform the way the world connects by enabling 5G solutions with industry leaders. New collaborations with Intel and Verizon demonstrate our commitment to helping our customers increase efficiency and address the challenges of new network deployment. We also extended our leadership in data centers as Altice Portugal, the country's largest provider of telecommunication services selected our EDGE product.","EDGE provides the increased speed, power and capacity needed to withstand future pressure on servers and network capabilities. EDGE has been playing a vital role in our continued success in enterprise, it's been deployed in 30 countries, used in 50,000 installations and has received 10 global awards since its introduction.","Stepping back, the long-term trend in Optical is strongly positive due to the benefits of photons replacing electrons in network after network, and we're uniquely situated to enable that shift. But it's not always a smooth line. As one network or segment upgrades to Optics, there can be a pause before the next one begins. That pause is where we are right now. So, we're aligning capacity and inventory to current market demand. We\u2019ve idled equipment and reduced headcount and we're delaying capital investments. In the long-term because of our leadership, we are positioned to continue putting more Corning solutions into every network that is built. We will return to growth as the inevitable Optical trend continues.","Turning to Mobile Consumer Electronics. We're making significant progress on our goal of doubling sales. Since 2016, we've added $500 million in sales on a base of $1.1 billion. We grew sales 42% cumulatively, while smartphone unit sales did not grow. In 2019, we bolstered the presence of Corning content on and in mobile devices with amplify screen protectors, decorative backs and durable solutions for wearables. Apple announced that it is awarding $250 million from its advanced manufacturing fund to Corning, building on the $200 million we received from Apple's fund in 2017. Both investments support Corning's state-of-the-art glass processes, equipment and materials integral to the delivery of next-generation consumer devices.","In 2019, as one of our prominent customers noted, we took a major step forward in state-of-the-art cover glass. In 2020, we will continue to advance and introduce new glasses, and we are confident that the adoption of our technologies will enable us to our sales goals, so stay tuned.","Moving to the Automotive market, our goal is to double sales by 2023. In 2019, we ran production capacity in Hefei, China to meet committed demand for both our auto glass solutions and our gasoline particulate filter products. We are well on our way to building a $500 million plus GPF business by 2023. Sales in 2019 exceeded $250 million, and in 2019 Automotive Glass Solutions deliver the industry's first AutoGrade Gorilla Glass for 2D and 3D interiors along with Corning's patented ColdForm Technology.","Earlier this month, we announced collaborations with industry leaders across the auto ecosystem including Visteon, LGE, BOE and VIA Optronics. We are beginning mass production and have built an order book worth several hundred million dollars, with nearly half of that book under contract.","In Life Sciences Vessels, we reached several exciting milestones in 2019. We exceeded $1 billion in sales in our Life Sciences segment as adoption of our industry-leading bioprocess and advanced cell culture products continues, driving our organic growth rate 7%. And we continue to build momentum for Valor Glass. We signed commercial agreements with three leading pharmaceutical companies and received FDA approval for use of Corning Valor Glass as a primary package for a marketed drug product. These major milestones validate our strategy to build a long-term multi-billion dollar franchise as we create a new standard in pharmaceutical glass packaging.","In Display, our goal is to stabilize returns. The market continues to shift to large size TVs, which are most efficiently produced by our customers on Gen 10.5 fabs. Our leadership in Gen 10.5 glass supports medium and longer-term volume growth. In 2019, we continued to increase output at our first Gen 10.5 plant. In 2020, we plan to ramp additional Gen 10.5 capacity in tandem with our customers. And 2019 was a great year for display glass pricing. We saw low-single digit percentage price declines for the full year, which was even more moderate than anticipated. And we expect a moderate pricing environment again in 2020.","You can see that across our markets, our strategic investments are well aligned with major trends and our relationships with industry-leading customers are creating new opportunities. We've got the structural steel in place. Our strategy is sound. We're advancing growth in each of our market access platforms and we will overcome the challenges in Display and Optical.","In 2020, three operational priorities drive our focus; successfully ramping our next Gen 10.5 plants; aligning cost and capacity to current demand; and commercializing innovations to support our customers. Execution against these priorities will create the momentum needed to achieve our strategy and growth framework goals.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tony for more details.","Tony Tripeny","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. In the fourth quarter, we delivered on sales and EPS expectations. Sales in each of our businesses performed at or above expectations and we generated over $1 billion in adjusted operating cash flow. We accelerated actions in Optical Communications to align production output and working capital to current customer demand. This impacted gross margin, which was below our fourth quarter guidance.","For the full year as expected sales and profitability were down due to the challenges in Display and Optical Communications. While we also faced challenges in other markets, it's important to note that Specialty Materials, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences powered through and grew sales. As we turn to 2020, we expect continued strong growth in all three of these businesses. We also expect Display and Optical sales and profitability to grow year-over-year beginning in the second half. As a result, we expect margins and profitability for the corporation to improve in the second half of the year.","Now, before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the largest difference between our GAAP and core results are related to charges associated with capacity realignment in Display and Optical Communications and at our equity venture Hemlock Semiconductor. Other differences between our GAAP and core results come from a non-cash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts and a change in our tax reserves.","Now, with respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earning translations, hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded a current value at the end of each quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this impacted GAAP earnings in quarter four by $59 million. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.","Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than five years ago.","Now shifting to results, fourth quarter sales were $2.9 billion, net income was $406 million and EPS was $0.46. For the full year, sales were up 2% to $11.7 billion, net income was $1.6 billion and EPS was $1.76. Now, let's look at the detailed segment results and outlook.","In Display Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $795 million and net income was $180 million. Q4 glass prices declined slightly sequentially as expected. Our fourth quarter volume was up low-single digit sequentially, better than expected. Display\u2019s full year sales were $3.3 billion and net income was $786 million. Our full year 2019 price decline was a low-single digit percentage.","Retail demand in 2019 was strong. Our preliminary view with most, but not all of the data in is that retail display area increased mid-single digits in 2019, driven by TV screen size growth. Last month glass market volume was up low-single digits, less than retail as set makers took a conservative stance in the back half of the year due to macro uncertainty. This conservatism drove panel maker utilization reductions and led to a supply chain correction. We believe that supply chain inventory exiting 2019 is healthy, and we think the correction is largely behind us.","Full year 2019 \u2013 for full year 2019, our glass volume was up mid-single digits, outperforming overall glass market driven by our increased Gen 10.5 output during the year. The glass market shipped more volume in the first half than the second half, due to the supply chain correction and so, did we. The lower shipments in the second half reduced our gross margin.","For 2020, we again expect the retail market measured in square feet to be up by a mid-single digit percentage driven by TV screen size growth. And given that the supply chain is now at a healthier inventory level, we expect the glass market to increase in the mid-single digits and for our volume growth to be similar to the overall glass market. In the first quarter, we expect the glass market to be up low-single digit sequentially as panel maker utilization increases. We expect our volume to be down low-single digit sequentially underperforming the glass market because of a structural shift in the Korean panel market.","Up until two years ago, South Korea was the leading provider of panels. Korean panel makers are going through structural changes that will reduce their capacity significantly as the global center of panel making moves to China. This reduction impacts our shipments in Korea. In the second half of 2020, we expect to grow faster than the glass market as our new Gen 10.5 tanks in China fire up and absorb the panel demand that is shifting from South Korea. Given Corning's leadership with three of the four planned Gen 10.5 fabs, we expect the benefit from this regional shift. We expect more normal seasonality in 2020 and from almost all of our year-over-year volume growth to incur in the second half. As our volume increases, we expect our margins to improve.","Turning to pricing, we expect Q1 sequential glass price declines to be moderate. For 2020, with over 95% of our volume under contract, we expect full year price declines to be at mid-single digit percentage. We reached our goal of mid-single digit year-over-year declines in the second half of 2018 and had even more favorable changes for several subsequent quarters. More recently as just discussed, the panel industry is working through a fundamental restructure of capacity migrating from Korea to China. The fact that we continue to have moderate price declines, while these changes are happening is positive.","We believe that three factors continue to drive the favorable glass pricing environment we've been experiencing. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced with demand or even tight. For Corning, we are aligning our capacity with demand. We are also pacing our Gen 10.5 capital projects to align with panel makers\u2019 schedules. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Glass prices must support acceptable returns on those investments.","Now to recap Display, the industry is emerging from a temporary supply chain correction. Retail remained strong with the increase in TV screen size, continuing to drive glass volume growth, we are well positioned with our customers and successfully ramping new Gen 10.5 facilities, and we expect to return to year-over-year growth in volume, margins and profitability in the back half of the year.","In Optical Communications, fourth quarter sales were $903 million and net income was $62 million. Profitability was impacted by lower volume and reduced production output to bring down inventory. For the full year, sales were $4.1 billion, down 3% in a market that declined by a high- single digit percentage. Net income declined 17% to $489 million.","In 2020, sales increased 13% year-over-year in the first half and declined 16% in the back half. The lower volume in the back half negatively impacted sales, margins and profitability. Nearly 90% of the second half year-over-year decline can be explained by changes in spending by two large customers. A large carrier completed its fiber-to-the-home build and redirected capital to pay down its debt. A hyperscale data center customer concluded a period of unusually intense building. We have excellent relationships with these customers and continue to co-innovate with them. We expect our sales to increase at both companies as they spend more on Optical passes.","In 2020, we expect year-over-year sales to be down 5% to 10% as the lower level of sales we experienced in the second half of 2019 continues throughout the first half of 2020, and we expect first quarter sales to be down about 25% versus the strong project spending in Q1 of 2019.","In the back half of 2020, we expect year-over-year growth in sales and profits to resume, driven by projects for 5G, fiber-to-the-home and hyperscale data center deployments. Now, the exact timing of these projects is hard to predict. If they proceed as expected, we\u2019ll be in the upper range of our guidance. If the projects start later, we\u2019ll be at the lower end of the range. When year-over-year growth occurs, our factories will fill and our margins and profitability will improve. We are working closely with our customers and we'll keep you informed as the year progresses.","Stepping back, we are innovating to improve network speed, cost and capacity. We also continue to receive confirmation that Optical is essential for 5G and hyperscale, and to secure long-term agreements with major industry players, all of which sustains our confidence in our ability to deliver long-term growth.","In Environmental Technologies, fourth quarter sales were $374 million, up 17% year-over-year and ahead of expectations. Continued adoption of gasoline particulate filters drove the growth. Net income was $64 million, driven by strong operational performance and successful ramping of additional GPF capacity in China. For the full year, sales were $1.5 billion, up 16%. Net income was $263 million. 2019 GPF sales exceeded $250 million and we are well on our way to building a greater than $500 million gasoline particulate filter business.","With our market-leading product, we continue to earn a majority position globally as automakers award platforms to make Euro 6 and China 6 regulations. Sales are accelerating as Euro 6 regulations are in full effect and automakers are preparing for China 6 implementation in 2020. Our Hefei plant startup is ahead of schedule and has been key to delivering incremental sales and net income. We expect continued growth.","Looking to 2020, despite continued weakness in the global auto markets and the expected downturn in the North America heavy duty market, we once again expect to grow year-over-year, with sales up in the mid-single digits in the first quarter and for the full year. We expect GPF sales to exceed $350 million for the year.","Specialty Materials ended 2019 strong, driven by demand for our premium glasses. Fourth quarter sales were $453 million, up 14% year-over-year and net income was $94 million. Full year sales were $1.6 billion, up 8% year-over-year and grew for the fourth straight year, despite essentially flat smartphone unit volume. Net income was $302 million.","Similar to 2019, we expect our growth in 2020 to come from further advancement and adoption of our premium glasses, as well as our additional innovations for Mobile Consumer Electronics. We expect Specialty Materials sales to be up by a high-single digit percentage for the full year. We expect Q1 sales to be up a mid-single digit percentage year-over-year.","Life Sciences also ended the year strong, exceeding expectations with fourth quarter sales of $256 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Net income was $38 million, up 31% year-over-year. For the full year, the business reached the milestone of \u2013 with sales of $1 billion, a 7% increase year-over-year. Net income was a $150 million, up 28% year-over-year.","For 2020, our market outlook and customer demand remained positive, and we expect growth to continue, with full year sales up mid-single digits. In the first quarter, we also expect sales to be up mid-single digits year-over-year. Now let's turn to the consolidated results and outlook.","Operating cash flow in the quarter was $1.1 billion. As we said in October, we expected to reduce working capital in the second half. We did reduce working capital in Q3 and again in Q4. Full year adjusted operating cash flow was $2.1 billion and CapEx was just under $2 billion. We are taking actions that will result in stronger operating cash flow and lower capital spending in 2020. We expect CapEx to be approximately $1.5 billion for the year.","Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 37%. Gross margin was impacted by the lower volume and reduced production output to bring down inventory in Display and Optical Communications. In the first half of 2019, gross margin was 40%, in the back half of the year as Display and Optical Communications volumes declined, gross margin also declined to 38%. In the first half of 2020, we expect Display and Optical volumes to remain low impacting our gross margin percent.","We expect volume in Display and Optical Communications to grow sequentially and year-over-year in the second half. When that happens, gross margin should improve to approximately 40%. In the first quarter, we expect sales to be seasonally lower than the fourth quarter and gross margin to be the lowest for the year, down 100 basis points to 150 basis points from the fourth quarter. We expect gross margin dollars and percentage to increase sequentially thereafter.","Moving on to the rest of our P&L. As a percent of sales, we expect SG&A and RD&E to be nearly 14% and approximately 8.5% respectively for the full year. In addition, we expect other income, other expense to be approximately $275 million in 2020. Full year gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $170 million, down $67 million from the prior year. The expected decline in 2020 is due to lower expected sales at our Hemlock Semiconductor JV.","Most of Hemlock Semiconductor\u2019s business is under long-term take-or-pay contracts, which include upfront cash payments. In the fourth quarter of 2019, similar to prior years, Hemlock settled some of their solar customer contracts. The settlements positively impacted their 2019 cash flow and reduced expectations for future sales in the solar segment. Hemlock took a charge related to realigning capacity to the lower sales level. The business remains quite profitable selling primarily semiconductor products, which are supported by Hemlock's quality leadership and long-term take-or-pay contracts. We expect our effective tax rate for 2020 to be approximately 20% to 21%.","Now, before I close, I know there are a lot of questions on the impact of the coronavirus on Corning. The safety and well-being of our people is our number one priority. We are in close contact with our employees, customers and suppliers, and we are engaging with governments and health services organizations as we monitor the situation, at the same time, we have not factored any meaningful operational or financial impact in our guidance, the situation remains fluid and as more information becomes available. We will update you accordingly.","In closing, we expect 2020 to be in many ways the mirror image of 2019. We believe that the first half will remain challenging as markets and customer dynamics reflect. We expect the first half will remain challenging as market and customer dynamics reflect what we've seen over the last six months. And in the second half, we expect to return to growth in Display and Optical Communications improved and a strong growth continues in Environmental, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences. As this happens, we expect the company to return to grow to growing sales and profitability as we saw in the first half of 2019.","Overall, Corning is operating on a strong foundation that we've built over the past four years and we continue to make progress in key areas, as evidenced by our ongoing customer announcements. We are confident in our ability to achieve the objectives we laid out in our 2020 to 2023 Strategy & Growth Framework.","With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?","Ann Nicholson","Thanks, Tony. Okay, Steve, we're ready for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Rod Hall","Yes, thanks for the question. A couple of quick ones. So, on Display pricing I wanted to start off, Tony and Wendell to whoever wants to answer this, on the movement of pricing through 2020 understand that the mid-single digit declines are being driven by the movement from Korea to China. But could you talk us through more of that dynamic? What is driving that? Are you assisting that movement with your own pricing or is there a mix of factor or something like that. And then could you also talk about the timing of that is the first half pricing view that we're going to see different from the second half in Display?","And then I also wanted to just quickly ask you about Optical. I know Jeff's been working on modeling that. And it sounds like you feel like you've got some better visibility. I'm just wondering on the low end of that guide, are you \u2013 do you think you are adequately cautious. I guess the answer is, yes, but how do you have any confidence in engaging the risk on Optical? Thanks.","Tony Tripeny","All right. Rod, Let me first start with the pricing answer. I mean, as you know, most of our contracts get put in place in the fourth quarter and the seasonally the largest price decline that we have in any quarters in the first quarter and that is the case here too, and we expect more moderate price declines as items move out throughout the year. I think from a Korea standpoint, I think what's important to highlight here is that there is just a lot of change going on in the industry. I think Korea capacity is going to be down around 40% on a year-over-year basis.","So that's a pretty significant decline from a pricing standpoint or from a capacity standpoint. And has that capacity comes offline, it shows back up in China. So, as we see our year flow out, we're going to see less volume \u2013 a little bit less volume in the market in the first half of the year and more volume in the back half of the year. And so, I think that that's a trend that's been going on and that's a trend that we really see the impact on 2020.","Wendell Weeks","I think if we just think through Display. First, I think you've got it right. Rod, on that, just the way in which we do our contracts sort of the pattern of price through the year in a little more weighted earlier in the year than later. I think what Tony was trying to get across is, if you take a look at the Korean market or the Korean production and their share of the overall world market, just two years ago they were the largest producer of large size panels in the world. And what's happening is Gen 10.5 plants in LCD are to so much lower cost and you're seeing sort of the China industrial policy of that capital being underwritten to China, that is giving our Korean customers a challenge to how do they compete when they haven\u2019t made that investment in Gen 10.5. So, you're just seeing a pretty natural switch begin and what Tony was talking about was that we've seen announcements out of the Koreans that over time you're going to see about a 40% reduction in their capacity, it won't all happen this year, but over that time period and you're just going to see that shift towards China and the Gen 10.5 plants.","Now, when that shifts, there are players at the glass level who are better or worse positioned in that. We are extremely well positioned in that, but the overall industry structure just sort of has to move with that dislocation and so, the fact that we are able to maintain such really good strong pricing performance in the face of this level of announcements for folks, I think is what Tony is getting at is why we feel that's really good news for the pricing environment. And then just sort of the \u2013 that is since we're so well positioned in China, we'll just see that progress that he talked about in the back half just continue to accelerate through time","Rod Hall","And Wendell, Can I just ask you, do you guys think that this year is the year that all this kind of, is this play out this year and the next year things go back to more of a normal trajectory or do you think this is a multiyear kind of transition and it will continue next year to be strange?","Wendell Weeks","Well, I think you're going to see the bulk of it happen with the \u2013 this year with just the fact that how clear the Korean panel makers have become just on their future. We always anticipated, much like we move from Japan to Taiwan and Korea happened that and then we prepositioned for that, that we see this move to China.","I think this year what was surprising to everybody in the industry is, as we went through this last supply chain correction is that the Chinese players continue to produce pretty strongly and pretty aggressive pricing for panels and this made the Korean customers sharply act, and sort of implement sort of some the long-term strategy thought they had in nearer term. And they're just focusing their guns on next-gen innovations for their Korean-based panel capacity. And while they\u2019re set - arms are sourcing more and more out of the Chinese panel makers. So, our view that the bulk of this move has been announced we\u2019ll feel the industry will continue to feel its aftereffects. It's pretty big change. But I think the bulk of it going to be behind us this year [indiscernible].","Rod Hall","Okay, thank you. And Optical visibility?","Tony Tripeny","Yes, I think from an Optical visibility standpoint as you're right, Jeff and his team have been doing a lot of work, relative to what the future especially in the near-term looks like over the next year or so. And we've tried to integrate that work along with what we know from a business standpoint and what our customers are telling us. And the range is really informed by both of us \u2013 both of that work. I mean, at the minus 5% of the range, that's an indication that we've got certain customer projects and we're following those closely and if that happens, we'll be closer to that and at the lower end of the range, the minus 10%, that would be reflective of what some of those projects actually get themselves pushed out. So, I mean, that's how we've done the work and clearly, we've really focused on getting better at that over the last six months.","Rod Hall","Okay, great, thank you guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you can maybe talk a little bit about your plans to use this capacity is going to be stranded in LCD in Korea. What timeframe can or should we expect asset redeployment and that to show up in your financial results? And I have a follow-up.","Wendell Weeks","So we \u2013 basically we've already done most of that. Korea is a low-cost production facility for us. So, what we are doing and what we've been planning for is to continue to use that as a strong melting source for full sheet to feed some of our finishing operations in China. So, therefore the main piece that we'll see will be on that part of the plants, which is where we finished the glass cut it into the right sizes. So that's where we\u2019ll primarily see that. We've made those adjustments. We have to continue to work our way through just sort of what's the appropriate way is to work our way through all the workforce implications and we're continuing to do that.","But remember, so much of our higher cost capacity in Display, we have evolved to play into our Gorilla plays, right, and in Korea as well, we've taken a hunk of their panel making production and instead put that in the Gorilla. So, this is all playing out on our long-term planning. It's just, it's happening at a little more accelerated fashion, Wamsi.","Wamsi Mohan","Okay. Thank you, Wendell. And just as a follow-up, there was obviously a meaningful step down here in your CapEx plans for this year. How should we think about sort of the next couple of years, given what we know about the demand environment here, is this sort of a level that we should expect that we can sustain over a couple of year timeframe or is this something that, given the market conditions and given sort of the more elevated CapEx levels over the last couple of years that this is sort of more of a one-time. How should we think about this CapEx levels over the next few years. Thank you.","Tony Tripeny","Wamsi, as you know, our CapEx is really kind of divided into two different pieces, one is what it takes to kind of sustain and continue to improve our businesses and then the second is what it takes to build and grow the businesses, especially as we get new customer demand. And so, what always going to matter in the longer-term is how much additional customer demand and commitments do we get. And then what is going to drive as far as capital spending.","Now of course, once we start those projects, it takes a couple of years for the \u2013 for both the sales and the revenues to show up. And if you think back on to IR Day, I think Jeff, did a good description of that. But I think as we look at in 2020, there are certain projects that we\u2019re finishing up with customer demand that will drive growth in 2021 and 2022. And exactly what we'll spend in 2021 and 2022 will just depend on how our innovations continue to evolve and how much customer commitment we get there. So overall, we said we'd spend $6 billion to $8 billion and I think these numbers are really consistent with that.","Wendell Weeks","Yes, I think the way to think about the timing is, we've got now sort of the bulk of the investment that we need to deliver the revenue and earnings growth that we laid out on our Strategy & Growth Framework.","Wamsi Mohan","Okay, thank you for the context. That's helpful.","Wendell Weeks","And they only thing now, we told to is what happens in the period after that and then how much strong demand will we see then, and then we'll just have to start early because it takes a while to build those facilities. So, that's a little bit far out in the future for us to be able to dial-up exactly. And as we get closer to it, we'll be a lot more clear with you, sir.","Wamsi Mohan","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Meta Marshall, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Meta Marshall","Great, thanks. I wanted to dig a little bit into kind of the growth in Specialty Materials next year. And just, it seems as if just get a sense of how much of that is just from newer generations of Gorilla Glass versus kind of a new use cases. And then maybe second, just a little bit of a description of kind of what is the difference between core and non-core gross margins, kind of backing out one-time effects that impacted in Q4 and just how that carries forward to Q1 would be helpful. Thank you.","Tony Tripeny","Well, why don't I start with that, I think that there is \u2013 as we do the various restructuring actions, some of that shows up into the gross margin and since that is in part of our ongoing operations that ends up in our GAAP results, but not in our core results. We did a number of things during the quarter, in particular in Optical Communications and in our Display business, and those are one-time charges and that's where you see that.","Wendell Weeks","And in Specialty, the bulk of our financial drivers are the new generations of glass. But we will also see some revenue growth out of our new innovation sets that are non-glass especially our group of very durable optical treatments. And that has a little bit lower gross margin percent then glass, but clearly this next year we're counting on our glass innovations to get adopted and that providing strong growth in an overall unit growth market, which we are not anticipating to grow strongly.","Meta Marshall","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Samik Chatterjee, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Samik Chatterjee","Hi, thanks for taking the question. If I can just start-off on Environmental Technologies and going to be, if you can talk to the \u2013 what are you expecting? What's the driver for the moderation in growth that you're expecting from the teens growth rate you had this year in 2019 to more of a mid-single digit in 2020. Is that kind of content moderation on automotive or is that more driven by the diesel segment, which obviously has a more challenging outlook, I believe?","Tony Tripeny","It is mostly driven by the change in the diesel segment. GPF we feel continues to be very strong and we expect sales to be up a $100 million in 2020. They were up more than that in 2019, but we're well on our way to the $0.5 billion goal that we set out for this business, where we are clearly the market leader and continue to have great success.","Samik Chatterjee","Okay, thank you.","Wendell Weeks","In the diesel segment, you're going to see us \u2013 because you're going to see the North American heavy-duty diesel market, as you'll see from talking to our customers that we expect to go through down cycle here, but we are replacing that with our gains as the Chinese adopt some of our new tech and there diesel market. So that's why I've sort of moderating.","Samik Chatterjee","And Tony, if you can quickly clarify what's driving the confidence in improving cash flow in 2020 versus 2019 when the outlook on the profitability or profit side seems to be more kind of flat to down modestly.","Tony Tripeny","So, there is a couple of things there. I mean I think the first thing is that in 2019, we built a lot of working capital. Now we always build inventory and working capital as we expect businesses to grow, but obviously compared to the first part of the year, our businesses didn't grow as much. So there is, we wouldn't be growing as much working capital in 2020 as we did in 2019. And then the second thing is, in the back half of the year, we do expect to see growth on a year-over-year basis and I think that will help us from a cash flow standpoint. And then of course, finally, we are going to also reduce our capital spending compared to what we spent in 2019. So from an overall standpoint, we expect our free cash flow to be much greater than it was this year.","Samik Chatterjee","All right, thank you. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox","Hi, good morning. I had a question \u2013 a couple of questions on Optical actually. First of all, I was curious on your view on the, just the industry supply situation. My understanding is that, there is quite a bit of excess capacity in China for fiber and cable. I understand you cannot move seamlessly across the globe. But it seems to be making its way into Europe, are you guys factoring in any of those any of that excess supply into your model, should we be concerned about pricing pressure risks as the year goes on. And then I have follow-up.","Wendell Weeks","I think on that one, Steve. Where you\u2019re seeing that to the extent that is going to impact us, is already in our financials. The actual level of excess inventory in China has been trending down, there is still some to come. I think how rapidly the Chinese market tightens up will depend a lot on this upcoming tender, it will see out of China Mobile. We anticipate that is part of this, they will lay forward a little more clearly what their 5G plans are and therefore what they'll need to densify that network. If that comes out with a very aggressive set of 5G builds, then the China market itself will tighten up very significantly. If it's not quite as aggressive, we'll just have a little bit longer-tail. We think we've got the bulk of that in these numbers.","Steven Fox","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks for that. And then just in terms of the Optical margins. I guess the rough math is you did about 9% pre-tax margins this quarter, which is about half of what you are doing a few quarters ago. So, I guess maybe just I think I understand the walk from 18% to 9%, but if there is anything you want to point out there. But more importantly when you get to the second half of the year, if you're executing or demand is where you think it's going to be, are the 18% margins reasonable or should we think about that is taking a little longer to come back? Thanks.","Tony Tripeny","I think from an overall standpoint, our margins in this business and its Display are all about volume and we had significant decline in volume in the back half of last year, 16% on a year-over-year basis and that really impacts our factory utilizations and the like and that clearly causes our margins to go down. And we do expect to return to growth in the back half of 2020 and when that happens, we get both the benefit of that volume. But of course, we've also done some cost reductions during that period of time. So we expect, from an overall company standpoint, we'd get back to the 40% gross margins and Optical both Optical and Display would also get back to where they were before.","Steven Fox","Great, very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Asiya Merchant of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Asiya Merchant","Great, thank you for taking my questions. Lot of them have been answered, but just had a quick question on Specialty Materials, knowing that this primarily goes into a lot of smartphones. We're starting to see smartphones inflect to growth this year, calendar 2020 driven by 5G models, etcetera. The growth rate that you talked about should we expect some inflection there? I think you're guiding for growth rate to be similar to what it was this year given that it was slightly down market for smartphone. Thank you.","Tony Tripeny","Yes, I think from an overall standpoint, clearly if smartphones started to grow, you would \u2013 that would certainly impact our business but what's really has made the difference from our business standpoint is the content that we provide on the smartphones. As Wendell said, I mean, we've grown 40% over four year has grown every single year in the last four years, even though the number of smartphone units have been down in most of those years. And so, yes, I think as you get more smartphones that might put us at the higher end of the high single digits. But what really matters there is our premium glass strategy and some of our other innovations and that's what's really driving our growth.","Asiya Merchant","And so should we expect that 5G phones. We have higher content, but I think you guys have talked a lot about higher content and other category in other consumer electronics as well. So, if you could just maybe talk a little bit about that. And then just on margins. Sorry to keep talking about that. The 40% inflecting to 40%, is that something we expect in the third quarter \u2013 third calendar quarter? Is it more towards the fourth quarter? It really depends on how quickly or does it just simply a matter of that 5% to 10% range that you talked about that in the Optical segment? Thank you.","Wendell Weeks","Let me start with the 5G phone and then I'll turn it over to Tony, on the profitability. So yes, I think your hypothesis on 5G using more of our content is true. We don't anticipate that 5G becomes a very large segment in smartphones here in this coming year, but you are right, it has more of our content, it tends to be the most premium phones, which is our very best glass. And because of the nature of what it takes to deliver 5G, we have an increase in the need for RF transparency, which tends to increase the amount of glass required on those phones.","I think sort of a question back for you. We would be very interested if you are now predicting a positive inflection point in smartphone unit sales. We currently aren't counting on that, if you have any insight into that, that would be helpful to us.","Tony Tripeny","And then on margins, you're absolutely right, I mean I think what requires for the margins to get back to the 40% is the volume increase that we expect in the back half of the year and exactly where that ends up in the timing of that volume increase is what's going to drive us back to 40% in the back half of the year, we should be back at the 40% number.","Asiya Merchant","Great, thank you.","Ann Nicholson","Operator, we've got time for one more question.","Operator","And that question will come from the line of Tim Long of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Tim Long","Thank you. Yes, let me just squeeze two quick ones in if I could. I just wanted to go back to the GPF market. You highlighted better-than-expected results in 2019 and $100 million additional next year. Just talk a little bit about what you think drove the outperformance this year? Do you think it was better share? Were there any advance sales into the China market? Or what specifically drove that, and that help in the trajectory next year. And then on the auto glass side, can you just give us an update on timing there, it sounds like still a lot of wins, but when can we start to see more meaningful contribution there. Thank you.","Wendell Weeks","So on the GPF side, our product strength, the relative advantages of our product led to us winning more than we originally planned. So that is one driver. The other is that with the move to real-world driving the automotive companies are envisioning perhaps use of GPF, and even some more advanced GPF technologies on more and more of their vehicle platforms. So, that's more of a longer-term piece. I think pretty much everything that we've learned so far has been positive about our relative position in GPF and the need for this technology to help clean-up cars even further, especially in a city environment.","Tony Tripeny","And then on the auto glass piece, I mean, clearly we're winning these awards and our factories ramping. So we will see some increased sales this year. But as you know, the automotive market in the supply chain takes longer than say the mobile consumer electronic supply chain. So the bigger impact of that will be in 2021, but we will see some increases as we go through each quarter of this year.","Wendell Weeks","Yes. And then after we break through that sort of $100 million revenue run rate level will our analytics will be able to click and can be a lot more helpful to you and us and being able to guide the trajectory going forward. We just need a little more data. We need to get implanted in a few more places was breakthrough that run rate and then we should be able to be a little more accurate for you, sir.","Tim Long","Okay, thank you very much.","Ann Nicholson","Thanks. All right, thank you everybody for joining us today. Before we close, I wanted to let you all know that we're going to be at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference on February 11. Mobile World Congress on 26th of February and at the Susquehanna Technology Conference on March 12th. So once again, thanks for joining us.

These results keep us on track to deliver the growth and shareholder returns we designed into the four year strategy and capital allocation framework introduced in October of 2015.","We targeted returning more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends, while investing $10 billion to extend our leadership and deliver growth. We continue to make great progress and we expect to meet all our stated goals.","Our cash generation is on target. Through the first quarter of 2019, we have returned $12.3 billion to shareholders, reducing outstanding shares by approximately 37%. And we\u2019ve increased dividends per share by 67% since the framework began, including an 11% increase in February. Our investments in RD&E capital expenditures and acquisitions are also on track, totaling $8.8 billion through first quarter 2019.","Now let's take a closer look at our progress in each of our market access platforms, starting with Optical Communications. Our performance in Optical Communications continues to be outstanding. We remain on track to surpass our goal of $5 billion in 2020 sales. We are growing faster than the overall market as our unique co-innovation model continues to deliver the right product at the right time for the right customer.","Our first quarter results reflect our progress with 20% sales growth. We continue to earn recognition around the world for our stream of product and technology innovations that reduce network cost and increase the speed of installations. For example, in the first quarter, Lightwave Innovation reviews recognized two of our solutions in extreme high density cable, which make hyperscale data center fiber deployment up to 30% faster and a surface mounted in home fiber connection solution that is not only fast and easy to install, but also integrates seamlessly into the decor because it's transparency renders it essentially invisible. This product is among the innovations added to Corning's portfolio through our 2018 acquisition of 3M's Communication Markets Division.","At the Global Conference, OFC, in March, we demonstrated that our EDGE 8 solution provides data center operators with of simple migration path to 400G transmission speeds and beyond. This helps them stay ahead of requirements for emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. We were first for 100G and will be first for 400 as well.","March also marked the introduction of the new Corning Technology Center Montr\u00e9al. The center will service as Corning's global home for software solutions for telecommunications networks and will support emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality, cloud computing and data analytics.","The center will eventually become a hub for software innovation across all of Corning's business segments. And we're off to a strong start as two major North American service providers are now using our software for their fiber-to-the-home installation and maintenance. Overall, recognition of the value created by our solutions and co-innovation approach continues to grow. And that results in our Optical Communications sales growing faster than the market.","Now let's turn to mobile consumer electronics where we are the world leader in glass for smartphones, tablets and emerging categories like wearables and augmented reality devices. Our goal has been to double mobile consumer electronic sales over the next several years, despite a maturing smartphone market. And we continue making significant progress toward that goal with steady adoption of our premium glass and the other innovative solutions we offer for smartphones, laptops, tablets and wearables.","We launched our Amplify line of glass screen protectors on OtterBox.com and in more than 1,600 corporate owned Verizon stores in the United States. Amplify screen protectors provide a new channel for Corning to capture an additional piece of high-value glass on smartphones. Our strategy combines the best screen protector glass with the number one selling smartphone case brand in the United States.","In the first quarter, we also continued our success in emerging regions with multiple device launches featuring Gorilla Glass in India and Turkey. Overall, we are making great progress on our goal to double sales in mobile consumer electronics. We expect continued momentum throughout the year as we look forward to more new device announcements and we will continue to innovate for our customers and you'll continue to see more Corning in your devices.","Turning to the Automotive market access platform. Our core technologies are helping to propel the auto industry into a new era of cleaner cars with enhanced cockpit functionality, connectivity and design. Our objectives are to grow our environmental business by continuing to win in Gasoline Particulate Filters and to launch a disruptive automotive glass business.","We are off to a great start in 2019 on both objectives. Our Gasoline Particulate Filter technology makes cars significantly cleaner and it increases our sales opportunity per car by a factor of 3 to 4. We continue to seek strong GPF sales in the first quarter as European Regulations are in full effect and China demand is materializing earlier than expected. And we continue to win the majority of platforms with our industry-leading solutions.","We now expect to exceed our goal of delivering $150 million in 2019 GPF sales and we're investing more to capture accelerating demand. We also continued to demonstrate our ongoing leadership in the industry with a Daimler supplier award that recognizes our collaborative development of next-gen emissions control solutions.","Next, excitement about Corning Gorilla Glass for automotive continues to grow as the industry transitions to highly connected and autonomous vehicles that use technical glass. Customers have validated their desire for Corning's technical glass solutions by awarding us hundreds of millions of dollars in our automotive glass pipeline.","Our new and industry first auto grade glass solutions are making it easier and more affordable for automakers to bring curved and flat displays to market. To service the growing pipeline for our solutions a dedicated manufacturing facility in Hefei, China is expected to begin ramping in the third quarter this year.","In our Life Sciences Vessels platform, we continue to make strong progress on the path to a new, long-term multibillion dollar franchise. Valor Glass substantially reduces particle contamination, breaks and cracks, while significantly increasing throughput. Valor helps protect patients and improve pharmaceutical manufacturing.","We are making headway with our development partners Merck and Pfizer and our interaction with regulators has been favorable. We also continued important on-site research with a number of customers at their facilities where we completed in-depth validation and filling line studies that reinforce our progress towards certification. What this means, in essence, is that various customers are doing test runs of our Valor Glass vials on their lines.","They\u2019re confirming that its viable on their machines and that it provides the value we described. They\u2019re documenting firsthand how significantly Valor Glass will increase their throughput. We are getting ready for adoption of Valor Glass by scaling up our production capabilities. We brought new capacity online in 2018 and expanded our range of products. We are also progressing with the construction of the new high volume manufacturing facility in North Carolina that we announced last year. Although this market is slow to adopt new technologies, we continue to invest and make encouraging progress.","In Display, we are delivering stable returns consistent with our goal. First quarter sales and net income were both up year-over-year with the most favorable first quarter sequential price declines in well over a decade and we expect continued progress. Full-year 2019 price declines are expected to improve further to a mid single-digit percentage and to be better than in 2018.","Our first in the world Gen 10.5 glass facility is ramping to support the expected growth of large size TVs, allowing us to grow faster than the overall market. Overall, Display will continue to execute its proven strategy to deliver stable returns. These examples demonstrate significant progress across all our market access platforms. Ultimately, we remain on track to fully achieve our strategy and capital allocation framework goals.","Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustained performance. We\u2019ve multiple businesses driving our growth. Our capabilities are becoming increasingly vital to important trends. Our relationships with industry-leading customers are opening new opportunities. We continue to invest in capabilities and capacity that will create substantial additional growth and you can see the benefits of these investments in our recent results.","We are not only succeeding at building a bigger company, we are building a stronger, more resilient one. We look forward to outlining the next phase of our strategic framework in the coming months and we are on path. Some of the opportunities that I\u2019ve discussed today in more detail at our Investor Day on June 14.","Now let me turn the call over to Tony for a review of our results and outlook.","Tony Tripeny","Thank you, Wendell and good morning. We had another outstanding quarter. We grew sales 13% year-over-year with every business segment growing. We also grew net income 22% and earnings per share 29%, all while continuing to invest for even more sales growth this year and beyond.","Now before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the primary difference between our GAAP and core results is again a non-cash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts. As we\u2019ve discussed before, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded a current value at the end of each quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter.","For us, this resulted in an after-tax GAAP gain of $138 million in Q1. Now to be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions.","Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We are very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We\u2019ve received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than five years ago.","That brings me to our results and outlook. For the first quarter, sales were up 13% year-over-year to $2.9 billion. Net income rose 22% to $365 million and EPS was $0.40, up 29%. As Wendell noted, our strong growth results from our technology and manufacturing leadership. We are benefiting from recent investments, including capacity expansions for Optical Fiber and Cable, Gen 10.5 Display Glass, Gasoline Particulate Filters and multiple development projects such as Gorilla Glass for mobile devices and automotive.","We are very pleased with how these investments are playing out and we're continuing to invest. Throughout the year, additional manufacturing plants will come online creating capacity for committed demand and driving additional sales growth in 2019 and beyond. Capital spending in Q1 totaled $524 million and we expect to spend just over $2 billion in 2019 with programs in every market access platform.","Now let's look at the detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technologies, our goal is to stabilize returns and we had a very strong quarter. First quarter sales were $818 million, up 10% and net income was up 12% year-over-year. First quarter sequential glass price declines were more moderate than we expected and the most favorable first quarter in well over a decade. Second quarter sequential price declines are expected to remain moderate as well.","With all of our volume under contract, we expect our full-year 2019 price declines to improve further to a mid single-digit percentage and be even better than they were in 2018. Now three factors continued to drive our view that this favorable pricing environment will continue. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced or even tight. Our Gen 10.5 plant supports the expected growth of large size TVs. It is co-located with and dedicated to our customer BOE.","We pace and align capacity in tandem with BOE to ensure our Gen 10.5 glass supply is balanced to demand. That ramp remains on schedule. We expect the glass supply demand balance below Gen 10.5 to continue to be tight as public information indicates there is little capacity growth planned in the segment.","Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. Therefore, we expect their price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable. And third, display glass manufacturing requires ongoing investment in current capacity to maintain operations. To generate acceptable returns on investments, glass price declines will need to improve even further. For Corning, we will only add capacity if we can get an attractive return for our shareholders.","In the first quarter, the Display Glass market grew mid single digits year-over-year and our volume grew significantly faster, as we expected due to the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant. In the second quarter of 2019, we expect the display glass market to be up mid single digits year-over-year and our volume to be up significantly more. Again due to the Gen 10.5 ramp. Sequentially, we expect the market and our volume to increase by a mid single-digit percentage, consistent with normal seasonality.","For the full-year, we continue to expect the display glass market volume to grow mid single digits, driven by TV screen size growth. We expect our volume to grow faster than the market, again, resulting from the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility. In summary, we remain very pleased with the current dynamics in our Display business, including our ability to capture Gen 10.5 half glass growth and deliver stable returns.","Let's move to our fastest growing segment, Optical Communications. The business is on track to surpass its goal of $5 billion of sales in 2020, with further growth beyond. In the first quarter, sales were $1.1 billion and were up 20% over last year. Net income for the quarter increased 30% year-over-year.","Sales growth in this segment is driven by multiyear data center and carrier projects as well as sales from the recently acquired 3M's Communications Market Division. As planned, we are leveraging our capacity investments to deliver higher volume and earnings.","Our 2019 outlook has been impacted by a major fiber-to-the-home customer, shifting its deployment from homes passed to homes connected in quarter two, not quarter three as originally anticipated. This will impact sales by about $100 million. As a result, we now expect our full-year sales growth to be up about 10%, which is revised from the low-teens guidance we provided last quarter, but still well ahead of the market.","For the second quarter, we expect sales to grow high single-digits year-over-year, driven by strong data center, fiber and cable growth. Overall demand for our fiber, cable and connectivity solutions remains strong. Our customers, the world's leading networking cloud operators, continue to deploy Corning's optical solutions to densify their 4G, 5G and data center networks. We continue to outpace the competition and we\u2019re very excited about the growth ahead of us.","Environmental Technologies first quarter sales were $362 million, up 12% year-over-year. Net income grew 6%. We are well on our way to building a $500 million gasoline particulate filter business. European regulations are in full effect and auto makers in China are preparing for full China VI implementation in 2020. The market appears to be developing faster and we are winning more platforms than we anticipated.","As a result, we are accelerating our investments and we are raising our short and long-term sales targets. We now expect GPF sales to exceed $150 million in 2019 and to grow robustly thereafter. China is also considering early implementation of its heavy duty regulations as part of their Blue Sky initiative. This could further increase both our investment and our sales opportunity.","We will have more clarity on the exact timing and impact by the end of quarter two. As we invest to capture the opportunities I just described, it mutes our profitability somewhat in the short-term, but will result in greater sales and profit growth in the medium and long-term. Based on our accelerating demand, we now expect full-year sales to be up 10% or slightly more versus our prior expectations of high single-digit growth. We also expect second quarter sales to be up about 10% year-over-year.","In Specialty Materials, first quarter performance was strong. First quarter sales were $309 million, up 11% year-over-year and driven by continued strong demand for the company's portfolio of Mobile Consumer Electronics glass solutions. Net income grew 7% year-over-year.","For the second quarter, we expect sales to grow high single digits year-over-year. We continue to expect to grow again in 2019, despite a maturing smartphone market, exactly how much will depend on the adoption rate of our innovations. Our results and outlook demonstrate the value of our premium glasses and the strength of our innovation portfolio.","In Life Sciences, we continue to outpace market growth. First quarter sales were $243 million, up 5% year-over-year, net income was up 15% year-over-year. We expect both second quarter and full-year sales growth of low to mid single digits year-over-year.","In summary, we had an excellent first quarter with strong performance across the company. The benefits of our recent investments are evident in our results. All of our businesses have solid momentum and we expect continued sales growth through 2019. For the second quarter, we expect year-over-year growth with sales up by a high single-digit percentage, operating margin up 75 basis points and EPS up by a mid-teen percentage.","As both Wendell and I described earlier, we continue to invest in all of our businesses. We are increasing capacity utilization in plants that came online in 2018, and at the same time we are building new plants, including facilities for GPFs and auto glass finishing.","While we build, startup, ramp and optimize those facilities, associated costs offset some of the normal leverage on our gross margin line. As the commitments from and to our customers increase, so does the pace of our work on the manufacturing floor. As a result, the offset to our gross margin line is slightly higher than we anticipated a quarter ago.","As sales grow significantly in the second quarter, we expect our gross margin dollars to also grow significantly, both sequentially and year-over-year. We expect our Q2 gross margin percentage to be slightly better than Q1. Now similar to last year, we expect our gross margin percentage in the second half to improve versus the first half as we utilize ramping capacity to meet committed demand.","Depending on the pace of facility startup and optimization, we now expect our second half gross margin percentage to be between 41% and 42%. For your modeling purposes, we expect that 2019 operating margin percent to be greater than 2018.","Now moving to additional outlook details, we expect other income, other expense to be approximately $250 million for the full-year. Full-year gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $210 million, predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor with the second quarter at approximately $20 million to $25 million versus the first quarter 2019 gross equity earnings of $26 million. We expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 20% consistent with Q1.","Finally, I would like to make a couple of comments on the economic environment, in particular, China. First, as we said previously, we do not expect a material impact from the enacted tariffs. Second, we incorporated conservative estimates for China end market demand for TVs and autos and our strong guidance and outlook for 2019. If Chinese demand is better, there's an opportunity for upside.","In closing, we are off to an excellent start in Q1. We are benefiting from our recent investments and we are delighted with the customer reactions to our innovations. We welcome the opportunity to invest and continue delivering strong sales and earnings growth for our shareholders. Our strong guidance reflects the rich set of opportunities ahead of us in 2019 and beyond, as we continue to grow faster than the market across all of our businesses. We are within striking distance of fully delivering on the strategy and capital allocation framework. And I look forward to sharing our exciting longer term outlook on June 14.","With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?","Ann Nicholson","Thank you, Tony. Tanya, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. Your first question comes from the line from Asiya Merchant. Please go ahead.","Asiya Merchant","Great. Thank you, everyone. If you can just clarify Optical once again and then talk about how we should think about margin improvements in this segment, as you continue to grow. And what\u2019s driving potentially higher margin? Is it -- should we think about utilization being a bigger factor, should we think about mix here that\u2019s helping drive improved margins in the segment? Thank you.","Wendell Weeks","Sure. In terms of the sales adjustment, I think it's pretty straightforward. We have one fiber-to-the-home customer that we expected to shift its deployments from homes passed to homes connected in Q3, and it's actually starting in Q2. So that impact sales about $100 million and it means we will be up around 10% in sales versus low teens, but that's still a lot faster than the market is growing. So we feel good about that. And in terms of the margin profile, yes, we see the opportunity to expand margins. Part of it is, is that just like all of our other businesses, we\u2019ve been investing in this business. And as we ramp capacity in those businesses, you would expect margins to improve. And then the second thing is that we are offering a lot of great innovations to our customers and those innovations help save them money and also give us an opportunity to provide solutions in some of our technologies and that\u2019s good from a margin standpoint too.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Rod Hall","Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess, I wanted to focus in on cash flow a little bit, because we are struggling to model the cash flow on a quarterly basis. And it actually came in a little bit lower than we thought this quarter, but then if you look back last year there were some seasonality then as well. So I\u2019m wondering, Tony, is there any way that you could give us some idea of what you think cash flow might be for 2019 and maybe talk about some of the puts and takes around working capital in Q1 and then I\u2019ve got a follow-up to that.","Tony Tripeny","Sure. I think if you go back and look at our cash flow cycle for the last several years, I mean actually -- probably longer than that, we always start off with Q1 being our lowest cash flow cycle and we grow robustly throughout the year. And that's exactly what we expect to happen in 2019. And the reason for that is, is that we kind of wind down a lot of our sales in the fourth quarter, especially as we entered December and we wind them up in the first quarter, especially as we get to the month of March. And so you have significant change in working capital in those two periods. And then in addition to that, we\u2019ve some of our payments like our incentive payments get paid out in the first quarter. So they improve during the year, but they get paid out in the first quarter and we expect exactly that similar cycle to continue in 2019. Now, I think if you go back and look at, you will see that same cycle last year. Last year did have some incentive payments that happened in the first quarter. So it was a little bit higher than what it was the first quarter this year, but the cycle is exactly the same. And we are certainly on track to what we said we were going to do from a full-year standpoint in our capital allocation framework.","Rod Hall","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox","Thanks. Good morning. Two questions, please. First on gross margins. Tony, I was wondering, the gross margin guidance quarter-over-quarter is solid, but maybe a little less than some of us were expecting and you called out some puts and takes in that. I was wondering how much you can sort of quantify where maybe there's a drag from adding capacity versus where you\u2019re getting better mix, etcetera to maybe better understand how you are coming up with your gross margin guidance for the second quarter? And then I had a follow-up.","Tony Tripeny","Sure. I think the news in this call is the investments that mute our gross margin percentage are going to be a little bit higher than we thought a quarter ago. In particular, in the second quarter, as both Wendell and I talked about, we see GPFs accelerating, the market is appearing to develop faster and we are winning more of those platforms. And so that clearly is having an impact on second quarter gross margin. In Specialty Materials, we are investing now in some innovations that our customers are going to introduce in to the back half of the year as they launch new products and so that\u2019s occurring in the second quarter. And then in the Auto Glass factory, we are beginning to put that together because we are having good success in that market. As you know we\u2019ve introduced the AutoGrade glass earlier this year. And so we need to be prepared for what happens with sales probably in the fourth quarter, maybe in the first quarter, but it takes a few months to ramp up in advance of that. And then in the back half of the year, besides those kind of opportunities exactly where we end up with the Blue Sky initiative in the diesel factory will just depend on exactly where things end up in the back half of the year. But from an overall standpoint, I mean we are really happy with this, we consider this all to be good news. It's going to drive both short and near-term growth. And on top of that, our operating margin is expanding, and so we end up actually with more of our revenue dollars to the bottom line and that makes a CFO very happy.","Steven Fox","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just -- I was just curious, Wendell there were some -- there was a Tier 1 auto supplier this week that had a -- or in the last week had a push out related to having trouble ramping some hot formed display technology. And I know you guys are patented on cold forming, but the question is, as you think about sort of these ambitious displays, which have different shapes and curves and are larger than typical [indiscernible]. How confident are you in the ability to ramp these displays or at least your glass portion to manufacturing volumes? It seems like it's a big leap based on what we heard over the last few days? Thanks.","Wendell Weeks","Thanks for the question. Very insightful question. The struggle of that particular Tier 1 is actually what our innovation is about is that we believe that trying to get shape in a vehicle, if you want a hot form the glass and then try to laminate, try to put the different coatings on something that has shaped already is way more difficult and is way more costly than our innovative way to do it, which is cold forming where basically we do all those processes in the flat 2D form and then because of our unique glass and our patented way to get form, we then take and create the form after those processes. This saves just a ton of money and it's really, we believe, going to put us in a position to extremely well in the industry. And needless to say after that Tier 1's experience and another Tier 1's experience, our phone has been ringing off the hook with interest to get a chance to collaborate with us to help bring this innovation to market.","Steven Fox","Great. I appreciate that color. Very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Samik Chatterjee","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just one from my side. You talked about the single customer in Optical, which had a change in the schedule. Can you just talk about kind of what you are seeing in terms of fiber demand from other customers, particularly, if we look at kind of data center customers we\u2019ve kind of heard of some movement in the CapEx number -- outlook there. Also we saw some auctions in China over the last quarter, was there any result or the outcome -- did the outcome of that impact your guidance for the year?","Tony Tripeny","The only thing that\u2019s impacting our guidance is this change with this one customer. The rest of our businesses are very strong, the data center business is very strong, our other carrier business is very strong. We aren't -- we haven't been that strong in China and so that doesn't have much of an impact on us. But everywhere else, I mean, we feel really good about the business and I think what we are trying to get across is that the changing guidance is totally related to this one customer, and we are growing a lot faster than the market.","Wendell Weeks","I think just add some commentary on growth for us. Where we've succeeded is to broaden our product offering as well as our customer base. And we are seeing a glass and fiber optics and our innovative products penetrate more of the networks and in all of the different style networks. And so as a result, what\u2019s interesting is, here we are talking about a customer who has just moved by one quarter their fiber-to-the-home, but, in the old days one customer of that size and scale moving something as significant as fiber-to-the-home, we would have felt in a really strongly. Instead, we are just talking about how fast do we continue to grow and that is a really interesting spot where we\u2019ve tried to engineer and has happened and we will still feel as our different customers do big civil works projects at different times right, how much growth that we have. But the big mega trend here is that you are seeing densification, enter into the wireless network, enter into the cloud computing network, and densification means glassification. And the exact timing of those builds can sometimes be hard to predict, but we are seeing a ton of wind behind us solutions. Just from a little bit broader perspective as we look at it, we think it's quite exciting calling exact timing during a quarter, not so easy, right? But the mega trends look really good here to us.","Samik Chatterjee","Great. Thanks for the color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath","Yes, thanks. Hey, good morning, Wendell. My question is on, just a quick report card from you on the 3M asset, how's it going? And then, any thoughts on adding similar such assets to the Optical portfolio -- you think you -- you have what it takes now for your customer expectations heading into the rest of the year and into next year? Thanks.","Wendell Weeks","Thanks for the question, Vijay. Yes, we are really happy with the people and the products and some of the customer access that we brought on board with 3M. They were stronger with some customers that we were weaker and now we are able to bring our integrated package and we feel really good about the revenue synergies we've gotten there. And the people that we brought on board, feel delighted to be part of it, Enterprise, where Optical Communications and connectivity is so important. So that we're really happy with. As far as bringing on additional pieces, we are always going to be looking for those opportunities that fit just right, our market-access platform and allow us to grow any asset we would require faster than the current holders. That being said, as you heard from Tony, we actually have -- we are quite busy delivering on our organic growth opportunities. We are having so much pull from our customers that it means we are having to invest more, we are quite busy delivering that incremental growth. So we don\u2019t have any big targets in mind right now, mainly because we are having so much, pull, but we are always open and if you have any ideas, Vijay, we would be glad to hear.","Vijay Bhagavath","Always. Thank you, Wendell.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","James Faucette","Thank you very much. I wanted to follow-up on your comments on the work that you\u2019re doing with the cold form for auto as well as the Valor Glass testing. Just in those conversations you are having, are you seeing any change in in-design times or time-to-market opportunity, especially if automakers are having to change kind of what the roadmap look like and catch up or not? And then, on Valor Glasses, as your potential customers are going through that testing, any update on timing of when we could start to see Valor move into production and general availability.","Wendell Weeks","Thanks for the question. It's you\u2019re -- it's something really interesting, James. I would say in automotive interiors, it's going faster than we anticipated. We thought we had a pretty good understanding of the automotive market-access platform, because we\u2019ve been in it so long and we felt it was going to be relatively slow for our advanced glass solutions, just because of the way that industry works. We've actually gotten a positive surprise by how quickly people are pulling on our interior solutions and how excited they\u2019re about some of our new cost advantage solutions. So as a result, we\u2019ve accelerated our investments to bring up a dedicated facility to do these large area glass parts with the various optical treatments that we had through our vapor deposition platforms. So there, it's gone faster and we are sort of playing catch up with the supply chain, not because anybody else is ahead of us, but because we have so much pull. So the way we are sort of doubling down on a positive surprise there. Valor, I'd say is moving at a very stately pace, okay? In this industry, as you know, if you follow it, adopting new technologies tends to be slow, it's a highly regulated industry and because margins tend to be quite high in the industry, there tends to be a relatively slow move of gravity towards new solutions because they\u2019re quite profitable where they\u2019re. That being said, we are seeing just tremendous amount of excitement from our customers, especially because of the opportunity to provide more out of existing facilities. And as if you follow the industry, you\u2019re going to see many reports of drug shortages and inability to get enough vaccines and inability to provide enough of lifesaving medicines and where we are getting very strong pulp, like come as fast as we can adopt it, tends to be in those areas where they\u2019re missing revenues and endangering patients' lives by an inability to supply with the capital platform that they have. So, Valor I view as stately, but feeling very strong attraction from the industry to bringing us into it to help them serve patients better.","James Faucette","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","George Notter","Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess, I wanted to ask about the Display business. I guess, I'm wondering if you guys are seeing the inventory build in that supply chain? And I bring up the question, because if I just do the math on your Display business, it's grown about 12% or 13% over the last six months. Just in terms of revenue growth and given your comments about pricing, I think that translates into about 17% or 18% in terms of area. We tend to think of the end markets as growing 7% to 8%. I certainly heard what you said about BOE and ramping share there, but it seems like a pretty big gap and I'm wondering if you're seeing inventory or indeed it's [indiscernible]? Thanks a lot.","Wendell Weeks","We are not seeing any inventory build in the supply chain. We are growing faster than the market because of our ramp of our Gen 10.5 factory. Demand is exactly where we said it was going to be at the beginning of the year and it's all driven by screen size growth. This business is delivering on stable returns and I mean we couldn't really be any more happier than where we are right now. At the core, I totally get how you are wrestling through it, when you take a look at the total industry and if you take a look at many of our competitors' releases. But at the core, it is just, we had the right product at the right time with the right customers. And that means that area growth is falling more into our hands, right? And allowing us to capture the growth in the industry and it's all concentrating with us. And that\u2019s the dynamic that you're seeing in the numbers.","Ann Nicholson","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes, thank you. Good morning. I have one for Tony and Wendell as well. Tony, how do you feel about leverage and the possibility for Corning's ability incrementally to take on more debt and do you see the need to do that to fund some of these growth opportunities that you are investing in? And Wendell, in the Display segment, can you maybe comment on this faster than market growth? Clearly, you're benefiting from the BOE exposure, but doesn't that also mean that structurally there is a shift under way for panel capacity to be -- for the Chinese panel makers to be taking share relative to the Taiwanese. And if that happens over time, would you need to drive incremental investments in China, and maybe shut down some of the capacity that\u2019s located in other regions? Thank you.","Tony Tripeny","Let me take the leverage question first. We don't need to add any leverage to meet these investments. We have very strong operating cash flow and that\u2019s more than sufficient to meet the investments, both in our capital spending, our R&D and actually continuing to increase dividends every year. So I think we are in good shape there. We certainly have the ability to add leverage, but we are doing it selectively, I mean, places where we\u2019ve added leverage over the last couple of years has been in Japan where the interest rates are low and we have high exposure and that\u2019s been over 10 years maturity. And in the United States, where we've added a lot of -- we\u2019ve added -- what debt we've added has been at the 30 to 40 year maturity. And we are also looking maybe in the China market, where we have some -- where we also have a lot of exposure. But we certainly don't need that leverage in order to fund our investments.","Wendell Weeks","Let me take on the Display piece. The only thing I would add to Tony's is, the great benefit of the investments that we\u2019ve made is that we are going to see very nice expansion in our operating cash flows. And that expansion in the operating cash flows, which we will talk more about when we all get together for IR day, is really giving us just very, very nice financial resilience and strength to pretty much fund, both our growth as well as nice shareholder returns. So we feel really good about that. Now let's deal with Display. So I think you are quite right to point out that, as some of the major new Gen 10.5 plants come on stream, they are lower cost than some of the older plants and so therefore they'll get most of the growth and then the question is what happens to some of the older generation LCD plants for our customers and will those lose share. So first, from our customer basis, you're seeing them try to develop new markets and technologies, things like the automotive display, market wearables, a bunch of other areas, to put their product to use. But really from a more selfish standpoint, from Corning standpoint, this is what is behind our strategy for things like Gorilla, we're already a pretty significant part of what was display capacity, we've already moved over, to doing Gorilla for Mobile Consumer Electronics and now increasingly for Auto. And you can expect us to continue to do that and that allows us to basically repurpose those assets and to capitalize those businesses without having to spend a lot of capital. So that\u2019s worked out really well. I think what\u2019s more of a dynamic for us will be our increasing productivity as we bring our new -- you are seeing us invest in new technologies in our LCD glass plants and our Gorilla Glass plants. This allows us to continue to improve our cost position, which usually means increasing productivity. And as a result that could give us the opportunity to consolidate facilities etcetera, but it has more to do with how quickly we can develop those new process technologies than it does our ability to repurpose, we\u2019ve done a really good job of repurposing.","Ann Nicholson","Operator, we got time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Tejas Venkatesh with UBS. Please go ahead.","Tejas Venkatesh","Thanks for taking my question. The delta between depreciation and CapEx has widened significantly over the last couple of years. I think that helps gross margin near-term, but perhaps keeps your gross margin pressured in the future years. Can you comment a bit on that? And then, if I could push you one more time on Optical, normalizing your 2019 Optical revenue outlook for the 3M acquisition and the $100 million impact from the single FTTH customer, organic growth appears to be decelerating to 8%. I know this is much higher than market, but this was a business that was organically growing well into the double digits. So, I was hoping you could provide some color into how your customer conversations have evolved over the last year?","Tony Tripeny","Sure. Let me start with your question about increasing depreciation versus capital spend. I mean, there's no doubt that we are investing in our businesses. And the reason we are investing in the businesses is that our customers are coming to us with lots of great opportunities and we are inventing products and solutions for those customers. And when we do that, we grow significantly, and we\u2019ve seen that growth in the back half of 2018. We are seeing that growth this year and we are going to see that growth into the future. So there is no question that is happening, we are getting greater depreciation, of course, that will have an impact on the gross margin line. But it creates a lot of great cash flow and gives us the opportunity to continue investing in. So, we are really happy about where we are right now from that standpoint. And then in terms -- from a standpoint of where we are in Optical Communications again, we are very pleased with our results here. We are growing considerably faster than the marketplace and we\u2019ve been working closely with our customers and you look at our results and you will see strong results, both in the carrier market and in the enterprise market, which is where we have our hyperscale data center customers and we feel good about the growth there.","Wendell Weeks","Yes. And I think your observations on, sort of how much organic growth at what time period, it's truly important, when you think about Opto [ph] is how these are large movements in architecture and they can get pretty inevitable, but their exact timing of when they start and which individual player starts a given program, right, all can move you around from one quarter to another, especially when you're doing, sort of year-over-year comparisons, where you may be comparing to someone's great big fiber-to-the-home build in the last part of last year, right? And then you're comparing that to this year when that same customer isn't doing a major pass, right, but then we still growing and it's made up by other pieces. I think what\u2019s really important here to think for the long-term perspective is, do you believe that wireless is going to move from a structure that is relatively glass light to one that becomes very glass heavy and that\u2019s what we believe 5G does, densification happens. And so now in the biggest telecommunications network in the world, which is wireless, right, moves to being a very glass heavy network that speaks very well for our growth opportunities. As cloud continues to grow rapidly that -- what that leads to is this sort of centralization of data flow, which means you get a lot more bandwidth and that area has to get there and get out, which once again leads to very dense very glass rich network. That we also look at and say, that's going to continue, but these are big build. So the exact timing of how they all work out and what periods you are comparing that will -- that can allow you to be -- for it to be hard to just lay a monotonic growth rate out there, right? So, I feel that some of the difficulty of doing the comparisons, but when you step back just architecturally and it looks pretty good to us for glass.","Ann Nicholson","Thanks, Wendell. And I want to thank you all for joining us. Before we close today, I wanted to let everyone know that we will be at the JPMorgan Tech Conference on May 15 and as we said, hosting our Investor Day at the Conrad in New York City on June 14. Registration for that event is open on our Events and Presentations webpage. Finally, a web replay of today\u2019s call will be available on our site, starting later this morning. So once again, thank you all for joining us. Tanya, that concludes our call. Please disconnect all lines.","Operator","Thank you.

It's my pleasure to turn the call over to Ann Nicholson, Division Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ann Nicholson","Thank you, John and good morning. Welcome to Corning's fourth quarter 2016 conference call. With me today is Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.","Before we begin our formal comments, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These remarks involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the Company's financial reports.","You should also note that we will be discussing our results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found on the investor relations section of our website at Corning.com.","Slides are posting live on our webcast to accompany our formal comments and with encourage you to follow along. They'll also be available on our website for downloading. Now, I'll turn the call over to Wendell.","Wendell Weeks","Thank you, Ann and good morning, everyone. Early last year, we told you that we expected our momentum to build steadily throughout 2016 and it did. As we reported this morning, we finished the year with a very strong fourth quarter, with sales up 6%, net income up 24% and EPS of $0.50, up 47% year-over-year. We see this momentum continuing and anticipate year-over-year sales, net income and EPS growth in the first quarter. Tony will cover our financial performance and outlook in greater detail, in just a few minutes.","These corroborating results and our progress on key value creation initiatives continue to reinforce our confidence in the strategy and capital allocation framework that we introduced in October of 2015. The framework outlines our leadership priorities and articulates the opportunities we see across our businesses.","We designed the framework to create significant value for shareholders, by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength. As you know, under our framework, we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion in cash through 2019 and plan to return more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends.","We have made great progress against that goal. Since October 2015, we have returned a total of $6 billion by increasing the dividend 12.5% last February and by repurchases that reduced outstanding shares by approximately 22%. In 2016, we also realigned our interest in Dow Corning. That transaction further focused our portfolio and unlocked tremendous value for our shareholders. In addition to cash distributions, we plan to invest $10 billion to sustain our leadership and deliver growth over the long term.","We're best in the world in three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms and five market access platforms. We focus 80% of our resources on opportunities that use existing capabilities in at least two of the three areas. We're investing in research and development, capital expansion and acquisitions, to advance our innovation initiatives, strengthen our leadership and low-cost positions and ultimately outperform our competitors.","By pursuing this strategy, we believe that our likelihood of success increases, our cost of innovation decreases and we create higher and more sustainable competitive barriers. Our focus in leadership also attracts some of the world's leading companies to our ecosystem, because they see how our unique expertise can help address some of their toughest challenges. This is leading to improved performance and excellent momentum in our market access platforms.","Let's look at a few examples. In our optical communications market access platform, our goal is to add $2 billion in sales by 2020. Optical communications is a fully-evolved example of our focused 3-4-5 portfolio.","We began more than 40 years ago, by leveraging our deep knowledge of optical physics, glass science and vapor deposition, to disrupt the telecommunications industry with optical fiber. Over time, we increased our value-add by leveraging ceramics, extrusion and precision forming. Today, we're reaping the benefits of this unique combination of our capabilities, in segments like fiber-to-the-home and hyperscale data centers.","During 2016, we improved our cost position and won customer commitments that support long term growth. In the fourth quarter, optical communication sales rose 11% year-over-year and we expect growth in this business to accelerate in 2017.","In our automotive market access platform, we're building on our existing environmental business, with the addition of a significant new business for gas particulate filters, or GPFs and a Gorilla-sized automotive glass business. Consistent with OEM announcements, we believe that GPFs will be the preferred approach to meet new regulations for particulate emissions from gasoline direct injection engines.","GDI engines offer both higher performance and better fuel economy. And, as a result, have grown to about a quarter of passenger car sales worldwide, with units growing in the high teens annually. Platform awards began in 2016 and we have won the majority.","In December, the European Union agreed on its 6C regulations which introduced new real-world emissions tests, starting in September of 2017. All new cars will need to comply with the rules, starting in September of 2018. In December, China also finalized related regulations.","We expect gas particulate filters to become a significant business for Corning. GPFs offer the potential to increase our sales opportunity per vehicle by a factor of three to four, with profitability similar to our current business. In line with our commitment to invest $10 billion in growth opportunities, our investment in GPF is ramping to support customer commitments. You will see both cost on our P&L and capital expenditures in the near term and we'll start to see sales in the second half of the year.","In 2017, we also expect progress towards commercialization of Gorilla Glass for auto, for both vehicle exteriors and interiors. To tap this opportunity, we're reapplying our core technologies and reusing our manufacturing assets, to provide advantage glass that can make cars cleaner, safer and more connected. Our decades-long relationships with auto manufacturers have assisted in gaining collaboration on testing and development.","During 2016, we successfully formed a joint venture with Saint-Gobain. We've passed Government safety tests and have been engaged in many promising dialogues with customers. The concept car we introduced at CES that used Gorilla Glass in a myriad of ways was frequently cited as a top innovation at the show.","In our mobile consumer electronics market access platform, we seek to increase our revenue per phone and win placement on new devices. Our goal is to double our sales, despite flattening smartphone unit growth. We're pursuing that goal in a number of ways.","First, we continue to lead the market with best-in-class products. Gorilla Glass 5 is the best glass for drop performance in the market today and we're seeing that superior performance translate into a meaningful price premium, that increases our revenue per phone.","Second, we're selling more glass per device, given handset antenna requirements to support increasing data rates and the desire for wireless charging, glass is becoming a preferred material in more places on phones. Also, we have launched a glass specifically designed for screen protectors, for those who want added protection on their device.","Third, we're enabling more value per device by adding functionality which opens up new device categories. For example, our Vibrant product enables photo realistic images on handhelds and notebooks, while Gorilla Glass SR+ offers outstanding scratch performance on wearables, such as the Gear 3 from Samsung.","Fourth, we can add sales by focusing on markets where we can gain share. In all cases, our close relationships with our customers enable us to work jointly with them on compelling new mobile consumer products.","In summary, we believe the strategic and financial benefits of Corning's cohesive and focused portfolio are becoming even more apparent, as we enter the second year under our framework. Let me turn the call over to Tony, for a review of our results and details on our outlook for 2017. Tony?","Tony Tripeny","Thank you, Wendell and good morning. As we noted in today's release, our fourth quarter core results reflect the sequential and year-over-year improvement we expected and we're very pleased with our strong operating performance. Net income and earnings were both up significantly. Looking ahead, we see year-over-year growth in the first quarter in sales, net income and EPS.","Before I get into the details of our performance and results, I wanted to briefly note that the primary difference between our GAAP and core results for the fourth quarter is, again, a non-cash mark-to-market adjustment. As we have discussed previously, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation head contracts, settling in future periods, to be marked-to-market and recorded at their current value in the current quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter.","During the fourth quarter, the yen weakened which resulted in a GAAP gain of $1.1 billion, when we marked the contracts to market, as required by GAAP. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. We remain very pleased with the results of our hedging program and the economic certainty it delivers. Since its inception, we have received cash totaling $1.3 billion under our hedge contracts. These proceeds offset much of the yen-related decline in display's earnings. Hedging our earnings and cash flow through 2022 substantially mitigates risk from a weakening yen.","For the investors who have additional questions on the mechanics of the contracts, please refer to the tutorial on FX hedge accounting on the digital media disclosure section of our investor relations website. And as always, Ann and her team are available after the call.","Note that for the full year, marking those contracts to market resulted in a non-cash loss of $409 million. The more significant difference between GAAP and core results for the full year was the $2.7 billion benefit from the strategic realignment of Dow Corning, that was completed in the second quarter. As Wendell noted, this transaction provided tremendous value for our shareholders.","Turning to fourth quarter core results, sales grew 6% year over year and net income was $534 million, up 24% year-over-year. Adjusting for the former Dow Corning silicones business equity earnings which no longer contribute to our results, net income grew 36% year over year. Fourth quarter EPS was $0.50, up 47%.","These positive year-over-year results were primarily due to rapid adoption of Gorilla Glass 5 and record Gorilla Glass volume which produced higher sales and a profit boost from its premium price; sales growth and higher profitability in optical communications; and LCD glass volume growth and moderate pricing. We delivered a 43% gross margin, as expected which was up 140 basis points from last year.","SG&A was 14% of sales, at $350 million. RD&E was 7% of sales at $173 million, benefiting from the proceeds of a joint development agreement with a display customer. Total gross equity earnings were $112 million, driven primarily by our equity earnings from Hemlock which is seasonally strongest in Q4. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17%. Turning briefly to the balance sheet, adjusted operating cash flow for the year was $2.75 billion and we ended the year with $5.3 billion of cash, approximately 40% of which is in the U.S.","Now let's look at the detailed segment results and the outlook for each business, beginning with display technologies. The fourth quarter display market and our results were strong and in line with guidance. Sales were $904 million and net income was $276 million.","Industry dynamics played out, as we said they would, in October. The fourth quarter is the strongest season at retail. Based on preliminary data, premium retail area growth year over year was robust, particularly in North America and China. Our customers, the panel makers, kept their utilizations high to meet this demand.","Our fourth quarter glass volume tracked with the market and was up low teens year-over-year. Sequentially, our volume was down slightly. Supply chain inventory exited the year at a healthy level and panel makers' inventories remain lean. Fourth quarter LCD glass price declined moderately sequentially, in fact, more moderately than Q3.","For the full year, glass demand grew in the mid-single-digits. As we predicted, growth was driven primarily by average TV screen size which grew more than 1.5 inches. Our volume for the full year grew mid-single digits, in line with the glass market.","Now, looking into 2017, we expect the retail market, as measured in square feet of glass, to be up mid-single digits, driven primarily by demand for larger screen size TVs. Let me walk you through the details. First, TV units at retail are expected to be flat, or possibly up 1%. This has a small contribution to glass market area growth.","Second, TV screen size should grow about 1.5 inches, consistent with the trend of the last three years. This will contribute 4% to 5% to end market glass area growth in 2017.","Third, we think IT will be flat, with larger screen sizes offset by lower units. We do not expect IT and other smaller form factors to contribute to glass market growth.","And fourth, the value chain enters the year with healthy inventory levels and we think inventory will again be healthy at year-end 2017, expanding during the first half to prepare for a seasonally-strong second half, when inventory will contract. Taken together, we expect our demand to be up mid-single digits in 2017, in line with the overall market.","Specifically for the first quarter, we expect the glass market and our volume to be up mid-teens over last year's first quarter. This is down mid-single digits sequentially, driven by two fewer production days in the quarter and a reduction in panel maker capacity. As context, late in Q4, Korean panel makers began to take down some lines, to convert the flexible OLED manufacturing for smart phones.","New fabs are coming online over the course of 2017. Therefore, panel capacity will increase throughout the year. When one panel maker reduces production in one fab, other panel makers will need to produce more to meet retail demand. We expect to maintain our worldwide share position, due to our broad and diversified customer base.","We believe the full-year 2017 glass price declines will be more moderate than 2016. In fact, we may see the smallest declines in the last five years, as the profitability of our competitors remains low and supply\/demand remains in balance. At this point, we already have more than 90% of our 2017 volume under contract.","For Q1, we expect the sequential LCD glass price declines also to be moderate and very similar to the decline in the first quarter of 2016 which was the best for our first quarter in the past five years. Keep in mind, Q1 is typically the quarter with the largest decline for the year, as annual supply agreements are finalized.","Let's move to optical communications, where we're very pleased with the results, as fourth quarter sales rose 11% and NPAT rose 85% over last year. The increased sales of our solution products and improved manufacturing performance contributed to the higher year-over-year sales and profitability. North America carrier network business provided the fourth quarter growth highlight, as demand for our fiber-to-the-home solutions remained strong.","Turning to 2017, we're preparing to leverage the strong opportunities we see within the existing telecom market. These include fiber market demand exceeding market supply; key industry leaders in telecom investing in optical solutions, particularly as they look to the next generations of network capabilities; and, finally, industry consolidations that favor some of our strong business partners. These are organizations that have turned to Corning's optical communications business many times for help in solving their cost and network capacity challenges.","As a result, we expect low teens growth for full-year 2017 sales. The increase will largely be the result of a continuation of the growth trends we saw in the second half of 2016. In the first quarter, we expect year-over-year growth of at least 25%. As a reminder, a software implementation issue constrained sales in the first half of 2016.","In environmental, fourth quarter sales were down slightly, in line with our expectations. For this business, it's a tale of two end markets, in very different places. The light duty automotive market grew mid-single digits for the year. Our auto sales were a record, up 11% for the year, driven by winning additional business. The heavy duty diesel market is in a different place, particularly in North America, where truck builds were down 30% year on year and our sales were down.","Net income for the fourth quarter declined in line with our expectations. For the first quarter, we expect to report sales consistent to down slightly versus Q1 of last year.","For 2017 overall, we expect full-year sales to be consistent to up slightly from 2016. We expect continued sales growth in the auto market and lower heavy duty volume. In 2017, we're making select capacity and engineering investments for the new GPF business, to prepare us to support customer commitments and you will see both cost on our P&L and capital expenditures in the near term. As we've mentioned, we're excited about the GPF platform wins we have secured and expect sales to begin during the second half of the year.","Let's move to specialty materials, where we were very pleased with the performance. Fourth quarter sales rose 22% over last year, ahead of our expectations, led by record Gorilla Glass volume. Net income was up 48% year over year.","During the quarter, we saw rapid adoption of Gorilla Glass 5, as OEMs used it on more devices, a testament to our market leadership. As Wendell noted, our innovative products also can command a premium price. We began to feel the benefit of Gorilla Glass 5 pricing in the fourth quarter and expect it to positively impact our financial performance in 2017.","Our growth prospects remain strong in this market. The newly-introduced Gorilla Glass 5 and Gorilla Glass SR+ provide added value for consumers in terms of durability and we're working on even more innovations to increase our sales in the mobile consumer electronics market.","In the first quarter, we're expecting specialty materials sales to grow in the high teens year over year, as our OEM customers continue to use Gorilla Glass on more devices. Keep in mind, the supply chain in this market is driven by the timing of new product launches, not calendar years.","We're highly confident that our specialty materials business will grow in 2017. The only question is how big that growth will be which will depend on the timing and extent of customers employing Gorilla Glass 5 and other Corning innovations. We will certainly keep you posted as the year progresses.","In Life Sciences, fourth quarter sales were up year over year and net income growth outpaced that of sales. For full-year 2017 and the first quarter, we expect low single-digit growth year over year, ahead of forecasted market growth rates. As for our innovation program in pharmaceutical packaging, we continue to make progress and look forward to sharing milestones as we can.","Now, let's turn to a few more details on our first quarter outlook. As Wendell noted, for the first quarter, we expect year-over-year growth in sales, net income and EPS. We expect our first quarter gross margin will be in the range of 42% to 43% and SG&A and RD&E spending should be approximately 14% and 9% of sales respectively. We expect other income, other expense to be a net expense of approximately $40 million and we expect first quarter total gross equity earnings to be approximately $15 million.","Those details should help you understand our view of the first quarter, but we wanted to provide a few insights regarding the full year as well. First, we presently believe full-year equity earnings will be approximately $150 million, predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductors.","You may recall that we're receiving Hemlock's equity earnings on a pretax basis, since we closed the realignment of Dow Corning. We've put a schedule in the appendix to the slides for this call, that will walk you through the comparison. Further, we expect our effective tax rate for full-year 2017 and the first quarter will be approximately 17% to 18%.","Recall from our strategy and capital allocation framework that we plan on investing $10 billion from 2016 to 2019 in growth and sustained leadership which included capital spending. We said the pace of CapEx would be dependent on customer demand. We anticipate investing a total of about $1.5 billion in 2017 which is up from 2016.","This is driven by expansions related to four growth opportunities in our market access platforms. First, to support the double-digit growth of optical communications. Second, to support the success of our innovations in mobile consumer electronics.","Third, to continue work on the gen 10.5 glass manufacturing facility, adjacent to BOE and display. You may recall this project exceeds our target of obtaining $2 of every $3 from others, when we invest in new melting capacity. And, fourth, to add capacity for the new gas particulate filter business in automotive.","Now, finally, I wanted to comment on our plans to return at least $12.5 billion to shareholders under our strategy and capital allocation framework. Through year-end 2016, essentially the first year under the framework, we returned $6 billion.","In February 2016, the Board increased the cash dividend by 12.5%. Our repurchase activity included $2.5 billion spent on repurchases, to offset the EPS impact from the loss of the silicone's equity earnings from Dow Corning. In 2017, as we did in 2016, we planned to continue repurchasing opportunistically, reflecting our view that Corning remains undervalued.","For your modeling purposes, we anticipate spending approximately $2 billion over the course of the year for repurchases, or roughly what we spent in 2016, excluding the spending to offset the loss of the silicone's equity earnings. Of course, the timing and amount of repurchase activities always depends on a variety of factors. In addition, we expect the Board to approve an increase of at least 10% per share in the annual dividend rate, in line with the framework.","Let me close by saying that we're very pleased with the strong fourth quarter results and our positive momentum coming into 2017. Overall, we feel very good about our progress against our framework and the rich set of opportunities ahead of us. With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?","Ann Nicholson","Thank you, Tony. Operator, we'll now open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. First in line is Joseph Wolf with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joseph Wolf","So when does the car from CES go on sale? But more seriously, if we look into 2017, you gave a good overview of the display market, but I was hoping you could get us a little more color on the OLED market, in terms of both the large TV size and the smaller-sized handsets. There was a lot of OLED discussion at CES and the starting price point on one of their new TVs from LG actually doesn't seem to be that high for market adoption. If you could just review for us your view on OLED and Corning's position in these new developments?","Wendell Weeks","With regards to OLEDs, we continue to believe that OLEDs will not be a factor in large size TV of any significance, mainly because of their cost premium and the value that they create in performance is not large enough versus an ever-improving LCD technology. We do, however, believe that the most compelling use of OLED technology is in the conformable displays for small form factors, especially smartphones.","Although this is irrelevant a small part of the overall glass market, something less than 3%, the adoption of these type of displays will actually be a revenue enhancer for Corning, because we just developed a very special glass to be used, as the substrate for those poly unit displays, so our share is very high, as well as the glass utilization for one of these flexible OLEDs really is approximately the same as an ace high LCD today. I will expect that to improve over time, but that's where it's starting. So overall as we look at it from Corning's perspective, where we see OLED getting adopted ought to be a small but positive revenue event.","Operator","Our next question is from Jess Lubert from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Jess Lubert","Two questions, first for Wendell, you met with Trump yesterday, so I was hoping you could help us understand the key takeaways from Corning, to what extent fiber might fall under any infrastructure plans and how the border tax adjustment under Trump versus Ryan are different, if one or the other is more advantageous to Corning?","And a question on the optical business, I was hoping to understand how much of the Q4 strength was a function of business that slipped from last quarter coming back? And then it looks like you're expecting the business to see a nice acceleration this year. So I was hoping you could help us understand how that breaks down across carrier, data center and to what extent that's a function of market acceleration versus improved execution, following some of the difficulties we saw in 2016?","Tony Tripeny","Sure. Let me start on the optical question. We definitely had good growth in the fourth quarter. It was higher than what we expected. We did see the data center demand pick up in the fourth quarter. It was higher than Q3 and it was also higher than last year. I think what's important to remember about data center demand is it will be lumpy, because of the project nature of the business. But over time, we definitely expect this to be a strong driver of growth.","And as we look out into next year, for our full year, we think our growth will be in the mid-teens. A lot of that, of course, driven by fiber of the home and carriers. But we do expect some growth in the hyperscale data -- enterprise in general, including hyperscale data centers.","Now, for the first quarter, we said the growth would be greater than 25%. I think you can think about that, roughly half of that coming from the issues we had last year and half of it being the strong market that we have. Because overall, we think the market in the mid-teens gives you a sense that -- our growth in the mid-teens gives you the sense that the market, we expect to grow greater than 10%.","Jess Lubert","And Tony, are you supply constrained at all in the fiber business at the moment?","Tony Tripeny","Yes. I think that right now fiber supply is very tight.","Jess Lubert","And then Wendell?","Wendell Weeks","The purpose of the visit with Trump was, is that, this administration has formed a small group of leading manufacturing executives in the U.S., for him to be able to listen to ideas and exchange ideas on how to improve manufacturing in the U.S. and more specifically, how to significantly increase manufacturing employment in the U.S. Given that, the actual dialogue is confidential, at least from our side and it is up to the President to share what it is he sought to communicate to us and what he gained from that communication.","Operator","Our next question is from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Rod Hall","I've got a couple for you. I wanted to follow up, Tony, on your comment on hyperscale and try to get some idea of what the trajectory looks like through the year. Do you expect acceleration in the second half? Do you think it's just cost and growth all the way through the year? Can you give us any color on how you expect that to go and whether, I think you're alluding to Q1 bouncing back, but I think when we exited Q3, you had thought it might take until Q2, so is that a little bit earlier? So just trying to get a feeling on that.","Wendell, I wanted to go back to not really the Trump meeting content, but just onshore manufacturing. I know you have capacity here. Could you talk a little bit about your flexibility in manufacturing location? Do you feel like you have got enough capacity onshore if you needed to start doing more here? And just give me any color on what sort of flexibility you feel like you've got there.","And then the last thing I wanted to ask about was just the glass demand growth. You are talking about mid-single digits. I think most of the deviation from our model is the IT expectations.","Why do you expect those numbers to be potentially down? A lot of the PC manufacturers and so on are thinking maybe there's some growth this year. So just curious about your expectations, versus what I'm hearing back from manufacturers. Thank you.","Tony Tripeny","Why don't I start with the telecom question, Rod. I think from an overall standpoint, we did see the growth in the fourth quarter and that was on a year-over-year basis, also versus Q3. But I think one thing that we learned in the process of talking about hyperscale growth is, because of the lumpy nature of it and the timing. It just doesn't make sense to think about it on a quarter in, quarter out basis. I think it's more important to think about it on an annual basis and it's part of our mid-teens or low teens growth that we expect in 2017.","Wendell Weeks","As far as our ability to onshore flexibility of our supply. Today, only around 20% to 25% of our revenue is in the U.S., but 35% or more of our people are in the U.S. So we're set up fundamentally as a pretty strong exporter from the U.S.","That being said and our fundamental philosophy is that we make in the countries where our customers are. And this has always been our philosophy and we think it is just good business practice to be close to your customers, as well as responsible business practice. Really the only exception of that is to the U.S., where we're a strong exporter from this country, of product and we employ for people than we sell here.","So that being said, if we see some significant onshoring of our customers' production capabilities, we do have the capability to flexibly react to that, in really all of our businesses. So if that does become a trend, I think that would be fabulous for the country and it would be really good for us.","Tony Tripeny","And then, Rod, on your last question on IT and screen sizes, I think at the end of the day, we don't expect it to have a big impact on the market. We agree, I think, IT is stronger than it has been over the last couple of years. But we still think that, you know, the units themselves, relatively flat, screen size relatively flat. So we just don't see it as a big contributor.","Of course, we could be wrong about that. It may be a little bit of a positive contributor, but I think we would still end up in that range of mid-single digits in terms of the glass market.","Operator","And next we'll go to Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox","I was wondering if you could dig down or help us a little bit on next year's or this year's Gorilla Glass outlook. First off, could you give us a sense for how you exited the year in terms of your mix of Gorilla Glass 5? And then, secondly, in terms of just the Gorilla Glass business, you mentioned a couple times now other Corning innovations that could help specialty materials.","Can you give us some clues as to what track that could be on, whether it's the next generation of Gorilla Glass, or something totally different that we haven't heard about yet? And then I have a quick follow-up. Thanks.","Tony Tripeny","Clearly, Gorilla Glass 5 adoption was strong in the fourth quarter. I'm not going to give you the percentage of what it was, but it was strong in the fourth quarter and we expect it to continue to accelerate as we go into 2017 and that's positive, both in terms of the volume itself and of the premium price. And that premium price clearly had a positive impact on our profitability in Q4. And it will continue to have an impact on our profitability in 2017.","Wendell Weeks","To the second part of your question, that really the core of it comes to, what we said is, we expect incredibly strong growth in quarter one and that we expect growth for the overall year. But we're not yet comfortable saying how much. And so you're asking really for some of the levers as you take a look at that. I think it's a really good question.","What this comes down to is how much of our glass gets utilized per phone and how much of our innovations get utilized per phone. And this really depends on two things, how does a customer choose to use our innovations in their designs, as well as how do our innovations perform, relative to the requirements for that use case. And it's just a little too early for us to be certain how those decisions and launch dates will be impacting our revenues.","Over the sweep of time, we're very confident in our ability to see strong growth in Gorilla. In any given quarter or any given year, what the actual product launch is and then the supply chain that is associated with that can make the actual predictability problematic, from too early in the year. This will become quite obvious, what is going to happen to us in the relatively near term and we'll provide better and clearer guidance for you, as our understanding of the situation clarifies.","Steven Fox","And then just a quick clarification, when you were talking about type fiber, you're specifically talking about the raw fiber production? And when you say you're investing, are you investing in new fiber towers, or just to have towers production that's mothballed that you're bringing online? Can you just be a little more specific on the investments there? Thank you very much.","Wendell Weeks","At this point in time, we find ourselves in the situation where customers are requesting more of all of our products than we currently have the manufacturing platform in place to support over the long term.","So what you can expect from us in this year, as you heard from Tony's guidance, is you can expect us to have some capital expansions that we'll talk about in more detail at the appropriate time in optical communications, that we're going to need to put in place to support very strong customer commitments for long term acceleration in our revenue, in that business. So more to come as those agreements come into place and as our actual plans of our manufacturing footprint firm up.","Operator","Our next question is from Patrick Newton with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Patrick Newton","I guess digging a little bit more into the optical side, Tony, is there any way you can help us understand what the growth rate for the year would be, if you normalized for acquisitions? And then for the snapback for manufacturing? And then going a little bit more, you talked, I believe, about fiber-to-the-home being a little stronger than perhaps hyperscale. Is there any geographic spread you could give us, from where you're seeing outside strength?","Tony Tripeny","Sure. I think on the overall growth standpoint, it's always hard for us to know exactly the impact of the software implementation issue that we had. But I think if you were to adjust for that, you would still see growth in the double digits. And that same applies to acquisitions.","The bottom line here is that we think that our position in this market and where we play in this market and the part of the market that is most important to us is growing very rapidly and we think it's seen a double-digit growth. In terms to fiber-to-the-home, clearly North America is a place where we see lots of fiber to the home growth.","Patrick Newton","And then I think looking at the biggest delta to your earnings relative to my estimate came from R&D. You talked about benefiting from a joint development payment. Just given the magnitude of the downtick relative to expectations, could you quantify that payment and maybe walk us through any information you can provide on the payment?","Tony Tripeny","The payment was with a customer and I'm not going to disclose what development work we were doing with that customer. And I'm also not going to disclose how much it is. But I think, you think relative to what your expectations were and the difference that explains most of it.","Wendell Weeks","Yes. One of the things that I think you're going to continue to see as part of our focused portfolio and our engagements with our customers, given our capability set, is that sometimes when they want us to solve an especially challenging problem and that they want some form of relatively unique access on an accelerated basis to our capabilities, we're going to ask them to share in that cost up front and so you just saw that playing out in a relatively significant way in the quarter.","This has become a more standard practice for us. As it becomes more standard, I think it will be easier to model. But the core of it has to do with what we've been doing with our focus portfolio and our market access platforms.","Patrick Newton","And, Wendell, you just brought up the focus portfolio again. And as I think about your life sciences business, it wasn't really spoken about much in your prepared remarks. You've had some material progress coming from that business for a couple years now, but the growth really, since your Discovery Labware acquisition has been very low. So how does this business fit with your 3-4-5 core strategy?","Wendell Weeks","I think there's two elements to it. First of all, we continue to do better than all of our competition in that life science vessel market. So one of the key requirements to remaining in our portfolio is that management proves that being part of our portfolio allows us to lead that industry. So that part, I think that business unit and the way in which we have interacted with our capabilities, that has proven to be quite successful.","The second part, though, is to remain in our portfolio basically we have to be able to either use the market access platform that you have, or to use your asset and capability set to support our other capabilities, or our other business units. That moment is still ahead of us in Life Sciences. It needs to do both and we're hoping to see strong progress on that in this year.","You've heard us speak to what we're doing in a very vague way, to what we're doing in pharmaceutical packaging and that uses that platform. I think if that is very successful and we can basically reuse big hunks of that market access platform in life sciences, then we'll be delighted with what's in our portfolio. If not, we'll put that into our overall judgment of our portfolio as we do our normal reflection on what is the best way to maximize the value for our shareholders over the long term.","Operator","Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath","The question is on the auto glass business. Do you plan on reporting any additional metrics going forward, to help us better track and model progress in auto glass? And do we see auto glass as a major growth opportunity for the Company?","And also when can we see Gorilla Glass going down market into mainstream cars? Would it be next year? And then also thoughts on carving out auto glass as a separate business unit, given its own culture and then associated sales and marketing, R&D to help scale the business? Thanks.","Wendell Weeks","So to the core of your question is, when will key metrics be available to track our progress in the penetration into automotive glazing and interiors, so that this actually can become a more predictable -- or become a predictable growth driver for Corning. And then the second part of your question that I heard is if we break it into a different business unit.","So let's take the second part first. We plan on reusing our automotive market access platform to service this market and basically to repurpose elements of our manufacturing and engineering platform that are already in place as part of our portfolio to serve this market.","We'll develop market specialists, as well. But one of the things that reduces the cost of this innovation and increases the probability of success, is that ability to use our unique capability set to basically attack a market with existing resources. Augmented, of course, by specialists, right? And that's the way we're going to approach it.","As to the metrics, I think it's too early for us to lay out that as you look at these metrics, this will become in this way a predictable growth driver. I think we need more penetration before we get to the point of the S curve that we'll be able to segment the market in some useful way for you, so that we give you more signal, as opposed to noise.","What we look at internally is something very simple. It's winning customer platforms. To date, those platforms have been more in the high end of vehicles where they're trying to get the highest performance and are less cost sensitive. I think if it stays in that piece of the market, this will be a good but relatively small revenue opportunity. If, indeed, we can attack an every day car platform, as you are asking, this will become a very large growth platform for us. It's just too early to tell when that is going to happen. Do I think it's going to happen? Yes, sir. Do I know it's going to happen? Not yet, sir.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Clark with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Doug Clark","A two parter, first one is on the price declines in the display business. I think, Tony, you mentioned that 90% of volumes are contracted for all of 2017. Is that percentage higher than years in the past? And, secondly, related to that, the moderation versus 2016, does this imply a less than 10% year-over-year price decline for the full year? And then my second part question is also on the display business, but more so on the panel maker capacity fluctuations between LCD and OLED. It sounds like that's already factored into first quarter guidance and your expectations is that alleviates by the second half of the year. Is that the correct cadence that we should expect to see volumes pick back up, to the extent that there's any depressant are right now?","Tony Tripeny","So the answer to your second question is correct. That is the way that we expect it to play out. In terms of price declines and the amount of volume we have under contract, usually as we enter into the year, we have a high percentage under contract.","So 90%, I think, was important for everybody to remember, that's the way this business works. And then relative to price declines more moderate, somewhere in the 10% range is how that would work out.","Doug Clark","And then one quick follow-up additionally is on FX. I'm wondering if you can provide either an update on expected constant currency rate for 2018 or when we should look for that detail?","Tony Tripeny","I think that when we entered into our exchange contracts originally in 2014, we said they would be for three years and that we would stay at a constant rate of 99%. We have hedged about 70% of our exposure from 2016 to 2022 at about a $1.06 rate, but we're not ready to talk about the constant rate for 2018 yet, in part because we're looking at either other opportunities for us to hedge and we're also looking at different ways that we might hedge, as opposed to the FX contracts that we're using today. So I think when we made the FX rate change previously, we did it towards the end of the year. And I think that's probably the timing when you would expect us to talk about it again, or maybe even at the beginning of 2018.","Ann Nicholson","Thanks, Todd. And, John, I'm afraid we're out of time for questions. Wendell, any closing comments?","Wendell Weeks","Let me just close out the call by reiterating that we're very pleased with the progress on our strategy and capital allocation framework, since we announced it. We believe we're creating significant value for our shareholders and we look forward to updating you on our framework progress and results throughout 2017. Thanks to everyone for listening.","Ann Nicholson","Thanks, Wendell and thank you all for joining us today. Before I close, I wanted to let everyone know that today's slide deck has an appendix that recaps some of the full-year data that you might find useful.","Looking out to next month, we'll be meeting with investors at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference on February 14 and the Morgan Stanley TMT conference on February 28. Please let us know if you'll be attending.","Our annual Investor Day this year is scheduled for June 16 in New York City. We'll be sending out more details in the coming weeks. And, finally, a replay of today's call will be available on our site for one year starting later this morning. There's also a telephone replay available for the next two weeks and details are in today's news release.","Once again, thank you all for joining us. John, that concludes our call. Please disconnect all lines."],"5808":["Corning, Inc. (NYSE:GLW) Q1 2017 Earnings Call April 25, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Corning, Inc.","Wendell P.

It is my pleasure to turn the call over to Ann Nicholson, Division Vice President of Investor Relations.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Corning, Inc.","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Corning's first quarter conference call. With me today is Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.","Before we begin our formal comments, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These remarks involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.

It will also be available on our website for downloading.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Wendell.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Thank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. In January, we told you that we expected the momentum we built over the course of 2016 to continue into 2017, and it has. This morning, we reported another excellent quarter.","First quarter sales were up 14% over last year, with growth in all businesses. EPS was $0.39, up 39% year-over-year. For the second quarter, we expect to sustain our momentum with year-over-year sales and EPS growth once again. Tony will cover our financial performance and outlook in greater detail in a few minutes.","Our strong operating results and solid progress on value-creation initiatives put us on track to deliver on our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework goals. The Framework outlines our leadership priorities and articulates the opportunities we see across our businesses. As we've shared with you, we've designed the Framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength. We think that the strategic and financial benefits of our Framework are becoming even more apparent as we enter its second year.","As you know, under our Framework, we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion in cash through 2019, and plan to return more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We have made great progress against our goals.","Since October 2015, we have returned more than $6.5 billion. Repurchases have reduced outstanding shares by approximately 24%. We increased the dividend 14.8% in February, and 12.5% last year. Additionally, the Framework calls for increasing the dividend by at least 10% in 2018 and 2019.","Also, we plan to invest $10 billion to sustain our leadership and deliver growth over the long term. We are best in the world in three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms. We focus 80% of our resources on opportunities that use existing capabilities in at least two of these three categories.","We are investing in research and development, capital expansion, and acquisitions to advance our innovation initiatives, strengthen our leadership in low-cost positions, and ultimately outperform our competitors. By pursuing our focused strategy, we believe that our likelihood of success increases, that our cost of innovation decreases, and that we create higher and more sustainable competitive barriers.","Our focus in leadership also attracts some of the world's leading companies to collaborate with Corning because they see how our expertise and unique combination of capabilities can help them address some of their toughest challenges. Verizon's announcement last week is a great example. The agreement commits Verizon to purchase a minimum of $1 billion of our optical solutions over the next three years, as they reinvent their network to support 5G and new services. We will supply them with up to 20 million kilometers of optical fiber annually.","Stepping back, all of our customers have the opportunity to benefit from our unique set of capabilities in Optical Communications. We are engaged in deep dialogue with major telecom players across the globe as they anticipate transformations in communications, education, healthcare, transportation, and ultimately the way that we all live. Corning's Optical Communications market-access platform is central to realizing their vision because of our ability to economically expand capacity and deliver innovative solutions.","Consequently, we expect to grow significantly faster than the optical markets we serve, and we've seen just that over the last three quarters.","Another great example of how some of the world's largest companies come to us for solutions can be seen in our automotive market-access platform. We are leveraging our position in this market by adding a significant new business for gas particulate filters, or GPFs, as well as by building a gorilla-sized automotive glass business.","Consistent with OEM announcements, we believe the GPFs will be the preferred approach to meet new regulations for particulate emissions from gasoline direct injection engines. GDI engines offer both higher performance and better fuel economy; and, as a result, have grown to about a quarter of passenger car sales worldwide, with units growing in the high-teens annually. We have won the majority of GPF platforms awarded, including several new ones in the first quarter. So far, our filters will be used on 50 gas direct injection models from 20 automakers in Europe and China.","European Union 6c regulations introduced new real-world emissions tests starting in September of 2017. All new cars will need to comply with the rules starting in September of 2018. In December, China also finalized belated (9:04) regulations due to take effect in 2020.","We expect gas particulate filters to become a significant business for Corning. GPFs offer the potential to increase our sales opportunity per vehicle by a factor of three to four, with profitability similar to our current business. Our investment in GPF is ramping to support customer commitments, and you will start to see sales in the second half of the year.","We are also seeing progress towards commercialization of Gorilla Glass for Auto. Interest in interiors is accelerating, and we continue down the path to additional wins for exteriors. To tap this opportunity, we are reapplying our core technologies, and we're using our manufacturing assets to provide advantaged glass that can make cars cleaner, safer, and more connected. Our decades-long relationships with auto manufacturers have assisted in gaining collaboration of testing and development. The new relevance of our glass expertise reinforces Corning as a key innovation partner for auto OEMs. Looking ahead, we will showcase our full spectrum of automotive solutions at the Society of Information Displays spring show.","Turning to our mobile consumer electronics market-access platform. Our goal is to double sales despite flattening smartphone unit growth. Our approach here has three elements. First, we will capture more value per device by continuing to lead the market by providing our customers with best-in-class products. Gorilla Glass 5 leads the market for drop performance, and we are seeing that superior performance translate into meaningful price and share gains that increase our revenue and profit per phone.","Superior performance also enables us to sell more glass per device. Given handset antenna requirements and the desire for wireless charging, glass is becoming a preferred material for phone backs which, at least conceptually, doubles our addressable market. Since the start of the year, we have seen Gorilla Glass 5 highlighted on the flagship models of several top brands. The list includes several leading phones for the China market, plus the recently launched Samsung Galaxy S8, which uses Gorilla Glass 5 on both the front and the back.","And we're innovating to make glass even more attractive for glass backs. For example, our Vibrant technology puts photo-realistic images on the backs of devices for handhelds and notebooks. We've also launched a glass optimized for screen protectors for those who want added protection on their device.","Our second lever to double sales is to gain share in the value segment. In February, we announced a collaboration with Micromax, India's leading device manufacturer, to bring Gorilla Glass to their video smartphones that are designed for the value-segment customer. We're thrilled that Micromax opted to give their customers' phones the protection that Gorilla Glass offers.","Third, we can win in new device categories. For example, Gorilla Glass SR+ offers outstanding scratch performance and impact resistance on wearables, such as the Gear 3 from Samsung. In all cases, our close relationships with customers enable us to work jointly with them on compelling new mobile consumer products.","Our results for the first quarter, with sales up 32% year-over-year, demonstrate the traction that we are getting in this market-access platform. And, briefly, I wanted to highlight the very positive state of affairs in our Display business, where our long-term objective is to stabilize returns.","As Tony will elaborate, the glass price decline in the first quarter was moderate, and equal to the best first quarter decline we have seen in the past six years. We are seeing a more favorable LCD glass pricing environment today than we've seen in many years, and believe the full-year 2017 price decline should be less than last year. Specifically, we expect a price decline of about 10%, or possibly even better.","And the Display business offers excellent cash flow to Corning while also presenting us with the potential for additional revenue streams as we work with customers on innovations that help them advance state-of-the-art displays. These examples are also a great indication of how we're investing $10 billion to grow sales and sustain our industry leadership.","In summary, we are on track to deliver our 2017 objectives and overall Framework goals. As I noted, the strategic and financial benefits of Corning's cohesive and focused portfolio are becoming even more apparent as we enter the second year under our Framework.","Let me turn the call over to Tony for a review of our results and details on our outlook for 2017. Tony?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. As we noted in today's release, our first quarter core results reflect the strong year-over-year improvement we expected, and we are very pleased with our operating performance. First quarter sales and earnings per share were up significantly, and we expect both to rise again year-over-year in Q2.","Before I get into the details of our performance and results, I wanted to briefly note that the primary difference between our GAAP and core results for the first quarter is again a non-cash mark-to-market adjustment. As we have discussed previously, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be marked-to-market and recorded at their current value in the current quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter.","During the first quarter, the yen strengthened reducing the value of our hedge contracts, which resulted in a GAAP loss of $326 million when we marked the contracts to market as required by GAAP. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.","We remain very pleased with the results of our hedging program and the economic certainty it delivers. Since its inception, we have received cash totaling $1.4 billion under our hedge contracts. These proceeds offset much of the yen-related fluctuations in Display's earnings. Hedging our earnings and cash flows through 2022 substantially mitigates risks from a weakening yen.","And for investors who have additional questions on the mechanics of these contracts, please refer to the tutorial on FX hedge accounting on the Digital Media Disclosures section of our Investor Relations website. And as always, Ann and her team are available after the call.","Turning to first quarter core results, sales rose 14% year-over-year, reflecting growth across all businesses. Net income was $407 million, up 20% year-over-year. Adjusting for the silicones business equity earnings, which were included in our results prior to the Dow Corning realignment last June, net income would have grown 42% year-over-year. First quarter EPS was $0.39, up 39%. Of these positive year-over-year results were due primarily to sales growth and higher profitability in Optical Communications, continued rapid adoption of Gorilla Glass 5 coupled with strong Gorilla Glass volume, and strong LCD glass volume growth in a sustained moderate pricing environment.","Gross margins was 42.3%, in the range we expected, up 150 basis points from last year, driven by growth in Display, Optical and Specialty. SG&A was 13% of sales at $332 million. RD&E was 8% of sales at $200 million. Total gross equity earnings were $8 million. As a reminder, June 1, 2016 equity earnings included $58 million from Dow Corning silicones business. Adjusting for that, equity earnings would have been up on a year-over-year basis. And our effective tax rate for the quarter was 18%.","Turning briefly to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $4.9 billion of cash, approximately 35% of which is in the U.S. Adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter was $341 million, up from last year and on track to deliver to our four-year capital allocation plan.","Now, let's look at detailed segment results and outlook beginning with Display Technologies. The first quarter display market and our results were strong as we expected. Sales were $846 million and net income was $256 million. Volume and pricing were in line with expectations. The glass market and our volume were up mid-teens over last year's first quarter.","Sequential LCD glass price declined moderately, equaling the best first quarter decline of the past six years. Note that we believe supply chain inventory exited the quarter at a healthy level and panel maker inventories remained lean. We continue to expect that the full-year 2017 retail market as measured in square feet of glass will be up mid-single digits, driven primarily by demand for a larger screen size TVs.","For the year, we also expect our glass demand to be up mid-single digits, in line with the overall market. We continue to believe the full-year 2017 pricing environment will be favorable and better than last year with our glass prices declining about 10% or even possibly better. We believe this favorable pricing environment is driven by several factors.","First, we monitor utilization, value chain inventory and other market factors very closely, and we align capacity to market demand. Our current view is that glass supply is tight. If the situation changes, we will take steps necessary to align our capacity with market demand by reapplying tanks for other applications or by idling tanks.","Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. Therefore, we expect their price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable.","And third, glass price declines would need to moderate even further or perhaps flatten or even increase for glassmakers to generate returns on new investments, given the high cost of building and running new capacity.","For the second quarter, we expect the LCD glass market and Corning volume to be up low-single digits sequentially, which is the equivalent of up mid-single digits year-over-year. Sequential price declines should be substantially less than in the first quarter.","We continue to expect supply chain inventory at year-end 2017 will be similar to the lean level at the end of 2016. Over the course of Q2 and Q3, supply chain inventory should expand in preparation for fourth quarter retail demand which will then draw inventory down.","In summary, we are very pleased with the current dynamics in our Display business and our progress in stabilizing returns. We will continue to monitor and keep you posted.","Let's move to Optical Communications where the first quarter results were strong and sales rose 34%, and impact more than tripled over last year.","Even if we exclude the effect of the software implementation issue that constrained sales in last year's first quarter, sales grew mid-teens in both carrier and enterprise. In particular, we benefited from strong growth in the North America fiber-to-the-home market.","For the second quarter, we expect sales to increase approximately 10% year-over-year. We are well on our way to delivering low-teen sales growth for the year. We see spending by key industry leaders, among them Verizon, shifting more towards optical solutions. This is an important lever for us to realize our own goal of growing Optical Communications from $3 billion to $5 billion by 2020. To meet this growing demand, we are investing in additional capacity. These investments are factored into our full-year capital spending plan of $6 billion to $7 billion.","In Environmental, first quarter (25:24) sales increased 4% and net income was flat. First quarter automotive sales were again a record of 14% year-over-year, driven by light-duty substrates as auto demand worldwide was strong. The heavy-duty diesel market remained weak, particularly in North America. Our total diesel sales were down year-over-year. For the second quarter, we expect to report sales consistent with Q2 last year, as the auto market remains healthy globally and offsets heavy-duty weakness.","As we've previously noted, our platform wins in the emerging GPF market require select capacity and engineering investments. In the near term, you will see both costs on our P&L and capital expenditures. As Wendell mentioned, we are excited about the GPF platform wins we have secured and expect sales to begin during the second half of the year. For 2017 overall, we continue to expect sales to be consistent to up slightly from 2016.","Let's move to Specialty Materials where we also are very pleased with our performance. First quarter sales rose 32% over last year, ahead of our expectations, led by strong Gorilla Glass volume. Net income was up 50% year-over-year. We made progress on all three levers to grow in the mobile consumer market that Wendell described. In particular, we saw the benefit of Gorilla Glass 5's price and share gains in the fourth quarter, and those benefits continued in Q1. For example, a number of phones have adopted glass on the backs, including the Samsung Galaxy S8, the LG G6, and the Google Pixel. We expect a positive financial impact from Gorilla Glass 5 adoption throughout 2017.","Our growth prospects remain strong in mobile consumer electronics. As Wendell described, our innovative products provide added value for consumers, particularly in terms of durability, and create new opportunities for us to increase sales.","We expect sales growth in the second quarter to be in the high-teens year-over-year. Exactly how much we will see for the full year continues to be dependent on the timing and extent of customers deploying Gorilla Glass 5 and other Corning innovations.","As we move through the year, keep in mind that the supply chain in this market is driven by the timing of new product launches, which can result in significant fluctuations in year-over-year growth rates for individual quarters. And we will certainly keep you posted as the year progresses.","In Life Sciences, the first quarter sales and net income were up year-over-year, and a bit ahead of our expectations. For full-year 2017 and the second quarter, we continue to expect low-single-digit sales growth year-over-year. As for our innovation program in pharmaceutical packaging, we continue to make progress, and look forward to sharing milestones.","Now, shifting to a full company P&L, for the second quarter, we expect year-over-year growth in sales and EPS once again. We expect second quarter gross margin will be in the range of 42% to 43%. SG&A and RD&E spending should be approximately 14% and 8% of sales, respectively.","We expect other income\/other expense to be a net expense of approximately $25 million to $35 million. And second quarter total gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $10 million to $20 million. Please recall that the second quarter of 2016 also included the equity earnings from the silicones business. We will lap the strategic realignment of Dow Corning in June. Starting in Q3, year-over-year comparisons of equity earnings will be apples-to-apples.","We continue to believe full-year gross equity earnings will be approximately $150 million, predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductors. And we expect our effective tax rate for the second quarter and full-year 2017 to be approximately 17% to 18%, and CapEx to be approximately $1.5 billion for the year.","Finally, let me comment on our plan to return at least $12.5 billion to shareholders under our Framework. Through the end of the first quarter, we have returned more than $6.5 billion to shareholders. In 2016, our repurchase activity included $2.5 billion in repurchases to offset the EPS impact from the loss of the silicones equity earnings from Dow Corning. So far this year, we have returned $552 million. As you may recall, in February, the board increased the cash dividend per share by 14.8%.","For your modeling purposes, we still plan to repurchase a total of approximately $2 billion over the course of 2017. That's roughly what we repurchased in 2016, excluding the repurchase to offset the loss of silicones equity earnings.","Let me close by saying that we are very pleased with our continued positive momentum. We remain on track to deliver our 2017 objectives and the overall goals of our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework. We feel very good about the rich set of opportunities ahead of that.","With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?","Question-and-Answer Session","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Corning, Inc.","Thanks, Tony. Operator, we're ready for the first question, please.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our first question will come from Joseph Wolf with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. I wanted to just dig in a little bit deeper to the Verizon and the 5G opportunity. In the interview that I watched, there was a talk about a very large fiber count, a lot of millions of miles of fiber. And I'm wondering how this fits into \u2013 it feels like it's covered in your current CapEx, but how incremental is this to the revenue? And is the architecture that they're talking about with all those fibers, if you could just describe that, something that you'd think is going to be widely deployed by other telecom service providers?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Joseph. This is Wendell. I think, with the second part of your question, you are on the key strategic opportunity here. As to the modeling, let's deal with that first, this is inside of our strategy and capital allocation investment plan, the $0.25 billion we're investing in North Carolina to add to the world's lowest-cost, largest fiber optic facility.","I think what's important to note is, Verizon's predecessor companies were one of the very first companies to deploy fiber optic cable. And that, of course, became the significant business that you see. Then, they were the first to deploy, on a large scale, fiber-to-the-home, which is a primary driver in our current financials, as the rest of the world has followed that deployment.","What you saw with this announcement is a statement of their strong belief, a technology bet, and an architecture to deliver 5G and 4G densification that is largely dependent upon our capabilities. If indeed others follow this technology choice, it will be extremely significant for us over time. Does that answer your question?","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, I just wanted to get into some of the \u2013 I mean one of the things that came out was that, if you look at current \u2013 or if you looked at your FiOS build, there were 6 to 8 fibers per \u2013 I don't know if that's neighborhood or per link or in a metro node, or whatever you want to call the distribution point. And there was talk of, and I think I heard this correctly, a 1,700-fiber pair sort of installation. And that density just sounds very, very significant. I'm wondering how we should think about that in the context of, I guess, the relatively small rollout that's planned for the next two years.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","And so, I think the way to think about it is if you compare it to something like a fiber-to-the-home build, this particular architecture will utilize about two to six times more fiber than a fiber-to-the-home build. That range comes from what exact coverage you want, how exactly different neighborhoods are laid out. So, that's very significant. I think timing on the civil works and the way in which they'll roll out is a question best directed to the customer. But I think you are on, I think, the more significant question which is, is this architecture going to become the dominant architecture as major wireless companies seek to prepare for 5G through 4G densification? If it's the case, that would be a very bullish outlook for our capabilities.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And I'll just round it out, and let other people ask. Would that mean incremental CapEx and capacity requirements for the fiber business, if more than one vendor went here?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","So, I think the way you should remember how we work on innovation is \u2013 so we've been engaged for a number of years with Verizon on this innovation and strategic deployment, and they just chose to go public recently. But that deep engagement that we have through our Optical Communications market-access platform allows us to get technology insight as well as good insight as to how to plan for our capital allocation.","So, although every one of our different forecasts and planning cycles has different probability (37:25), by and large, you should think about this as being included in our $10 billion of investment in growth and sustained leadership.","It's possible that things could reflect a little more through a higher demand case than what we're currently planning on. But I think the best way to think about it is probabilistically and that is encaptured within our $10 billion.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Excellent. Thank you, Wendell.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead. And your line is open. Please check your mute key. Okay. Getting no response from that line, we'll move along. Next question will come from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a nice quarter. I also had a couple questions on the Optical business. And to start, maybe how come we shouldn't expect better than low-teens growth for the year given the outperformance in Q1? And I was hoping you could help us understand the OpEx component of your fiber expansion plans and to what extent the profitability of the Optical business might be impacted as you invest in more capacity this year.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Hey, yeah, this is Tony. Why don't I take those two questions? Some of that growth that we experienced in the first quarter, of course, was not repeating the software implementation issue that we had a year ago. But even in spite of that, we were up about 15%, and our guidance for the full year is low teens.","So, from our standpoint, that's very good significant growth. It's certainly better than what the industry average is, capital spending in the Optical arena, and it's well on track to get us to the $5 billion of sales which is our objective by 2020. So, I think overall, we feel very good about the Optical growth.","In terms of the capacity expansions, I mean the thing to remember the power of our Framework is that that we already have a lot of capacity in Optical Communications. And so, while we are adding some capacity there and it does have a negative impact in us on the short term, it's not significant. And you see it a little bit with slightly lower gross margins as we ramp up some of the production. But it's well within our guidance of 42% to 43% for the year. So, I don't think it's going have a big significant impact.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then, if I could just ask a quick follow-up on Verizon, I was just hoping you could confirm to what degree the contract will increase your run rate with the carrier or if this is just the continuation of the 2017 run rate into 2018, 2019 and 2020. Thanks.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.",". No. It's obviously a significant increase for this particular customer.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue that will come from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Sorry, another fiber question. But maybe just stepping back, Wendell, you mentioned that your engagements for a while with some of the service providers and there's different probability (40:52) to what they may need. But how does that influence the enterprise customers, especially some of the large data center players that you've been dealing with more recently? Could we see similar agreements there? And in general, how would you describe just the availability of your products and the industry's products into the second half of the year, given all of this?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","So, I think that your observation that there is also significant network architecture evolution going on on the enterprise side is quite accurate, Steve. And so, more to come in that space as our customers decide how open they want to be about that.","For many of them, they are not subject to the same degree of public filings that the major public carriers are. So, as a result, they tend to keep quite quiet their architectures because it's a \u2013 they view it as a key component of competitive advantage in these very large scale data centers, and it is indeed. So \u2013 but there is significant change going on there. Once again, it is a change in the direction of our capability set. So, more to come there, though we may not be able to be too public.","So, how do we view the demand for our products set? We view capacity to be quite short, and that's why you see the capacity expansion announcement that you have. Because of our superior cost position, we are able to economically expand our capacity where many others have not. And so, this sets up a very interesting strategic dynamic that should play itself out over the next number of years. And our Optical Communications team, I think, is generally on top of it, and will take the appropriate steps to both delight our customers and our shareholders with their set of notes (43:14).","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Great. That's very helpful. And then, if I could just sneak in a Gorilla Glass question. So, Gorilla Glass 5, you're indicating increases as a percentage of your shipments further throughout the year. Can you give us a sense for either how that helps profitability or where the mix ends in the year? I know the timing is tough to call, but if we went from here to end of calendar 2017, what's the general impact of Gorilla Glass 5? And where is it in terms of your mix? Thanks.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","I think from an overall standpoint, the adoption of Gorilla Glass 5 has been very rapid and continued to be rapid. And of course, we get a nice both price and share premium from that. It's had a positive impact on our financials the last couple of quarters. And you expect to see that same sort of impact continue the next couple of quarters.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question that will come from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Nicholas Rodney Hall - JPMorgan Securities Plc","Yeah, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I just have a couple. I guess I wanted to start with Optical. The seasonality there was a little bit different than we anticipated, so the Q2 guide is a little below what we were expecting. But then, Q1 was better. I wonder if you guys could comment on the seasonal movement there between Q1 and Q2. And also, just comment on whether you're supply or you're capacity constrained there in Q2. And then, second, I wanted to ask about Specialty. To what extent does the strong guidance in Q2 include unannounced products? Or are you just guiding for what you already know? And then, the third question is on Display. So, you commented, I think, Tony, you said positive pricing is even possible. I mean by when would we potentially see that? Is that possible this year you think? Or when might pricing actually move as a positive, as incredible as that might sound? Thanks.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Yeah, I think that the comment that I made there was in respect to the people who are going to be reinvesting in capacity. One of the challenges is the returns that are required from those reinvestments, and so that if you're going to see the necessity of reinvesting capacity, either price declines have to continue to moderate or maybe even go positive. But that wasn't a comment about this year. Relative to this year, we think pricing will be down about 10% or it could be a little bit better than that.","Back to Optical Communications, Rod, you have to remember these are big civil works projects that are hard to predict in any given quarter. We don't see anything unusual out there. We think for the full year we'll be up in the low teens, and our actuals in Q1 and our guidance in Q2 reflects that from a full-year standpoint. So, we don't think there's anything to read into that. And then, relative to Specialty Materials, I mean that...","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","We're not going to answer that question, Rod, but thank you for that valiant attempt.","Nicholas Rodney Hall - JPMorgan Securities Plc","Okay. Thanks, Wendell. On Optical, Tony, could you just confirm you're not \u2013 so, you're not capacity constrained? It's just the flow of projects and project (46:38) nature of the build that's...","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","No. I think what Wendell said to the earlier question, I mean things are very tight in Optical Communications right now.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","If we had more, we could sell more. If that answers your question.","Nicholas Rodney Hall - JPMorgan Securities Plc","Yes. That answers it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue that will come from Patrick Newton with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, good morning, Wendell and Tony. Another Optical question. The announcement provided a max fiber output and minimum revenue opportunity, and if you use those min and max variables, you can calculate an ASP per kilometer of about 1,750, which seems very low. So, I was wondering if you could help us understand the average ASP of fiber per kilometer in bulk purchases. And then, thinking about the max 60 million kilometer shipment, can you help us understand what the revenue upside could be? It would seem that you have the potential to maybe max out at least 60% higher from the announced $1.05 billion level.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","So, the way to think about that agreement is that the reason you see two very different numbers, right, is because they are different numbers. You can't take the revenue and divide it into the fiber volume. So, what our agreement with Verizon encompasses at the minimum level includes the full suite of our Optical Communications products set and all of our capabilities. Included in the agreement is the ability for Verizon to call on us for just pure fiber up to 20 million kilometers. The actual low timing and the actual low play (48:35) of which of our products gets deployed in what order, in what manner, is still to be fully determined. And because of the very close relationship, we're able \u2013 and our broad capability set \u2013 what we're able to offer our customers is the ability for them to know they can get the most critical componentry, but still fulfill their obligations to us across their entire purchase set. So, I think you read in part B of your question is that, if indeed there is that much fiber deployed, that that would represent a very significant revenue of potential for this customer alone, let alone others. I think that observation is analytically correct.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thank you, Wendell. And then, I guess for Tony on Gorilla Glass. Could you just comment whether Gorilla Glass's growth rate was above or below the reported 22% year-over-year Specialty Materials growth? And you did \u2013 to an earlier question on the contribution of Gorilla Glass 5 currently, didn't really give us many details. Could you help us just ballpark a generic range of where that sits as a percentage of total Gorilla Glass currently?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Yeah. And so, the first answer to your question is, I think Specialty Materials was actually up 32% year-over-year, and Gorilla Glass was the primary contributor to that. And then, in terms of the adoption rate, I mean it's been very significant. It's been better than what we've seen in other versions of Gorilla Glass that we've introduced, and we feel really good about it.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Worth a try. Thank you for taking my questions. Good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Next question will come from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, (50:47) question I get asked a lot from investors is on the competitive dynamics in Optical. Help us understand, who do you run into primarily in fiber cable and for the fiber itself here in the U.S.? And would the competition change by end market? For example, do you run into different sets of players in fiber-to-the-home versus cloud, data center, on and on? And then, also overseas, do you run into different sets of players in Europe and APAC versus here in the U.S.? Thanks.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","So, excellent question. So, let's take at the most macro first. So, I think what makes it a little challenging for you to describe our Optical Communications as if they are like this company or they are like that company, is that our particular set of capabilities and global footprint is unique in the world, okay. We're the only player who makes every component within a passive optical system, and that therefore has the ability to cross-innovate and co-innovate across the platform to create these very advantaged systems. And then, we play that out differently in our segments. Public network wireline, public network wireless. All the various forms of data centers, from small enterprise all the way up to hyperscale data centers. So, we're very unique. And in each of these segments, we have a different set of players who are strong or weak.","And then, on top of that, we have a global footprint where we're also the only one who spans the globe. And therefore, in these different regions, we will face different competitors of different strengths and different products.","I think perhaps the best way to answer this question would be, if you were to follow up with Ann subsequent to this, we would provide sort of a list for you to think about, depending on which dimension you are most interested in. Would that be helpful, Vijay?","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No. I think certainly it'd be very helpful. And then, quickly, fiber to cell towers, Wendell, do you see that as a bigger opportunity versus fiber-to-the-home, with over 90% of cell towers currently running on copper? Thanks.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","So, if indeed the description of the next technological node in wireless is as Verizon just described it to the world, then it is a very, very large opportunity. It still remains to be seen how that particular technology node will be adjudicated over time. We are deeply engaged on this topic, have been for a long time. And we will try to put ourselves in a position where we feel comfortable with some public statements, perhaps a little later on this year, to help you begin to think about this the way we think about it, as technologist (54:20) first, what's right for our customer, and that will give you some ability to think through different demand futures.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. Tony, I was wondering if you could give us an update on any additional hedges, given the volatility in the yen and any changes to the hedge levels you've alluded to previously through the next five years, or a proportion of LCD glass volume that's now hedged incrementally since the last time you gave us an update? And I will follow up.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Yeah. There hasn't been any changes in our hedging levels since the last update. We are still about 70% hedged from 2016 through 2022. You're right, there has been some volatility, and we continue to monitor that and think about \u2013 if we want to add anything onto that. But basically, we're in the same place we were before, Wamsi.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks, Tony. And then, just as a follow-up on LCD glass pricing. You guys sound very optimistic around Q2. When you think about supply coming on over the next few years, including your expansion in China, do you think there's a reasonable probability of glass pricing declines continuing to improve? And is there an element of a mix shift between the amount of EAGLE XG versus Lotus versus Willow and other formulations of glass that you are shipping? Or is this all supply-demand driven? Thank you.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","It'd be \u2013 it clearly is mix shift to other new glasses, although the vast majority is the traditional LCD glass. I think the reason that we believe in the pricing environment today and what we expect to see on a going forward basis, goes back to the three things that I talked about in the call. First, the current view is that glass supply is tight. We match our supply with demand. And if something were to change, we would change our capacity by reapplying tanks to other applications or by idling tanks.","And then, secondly, we've got the competitors that continue to face profitability challenges at their current pricing. And we think they'll continue to \u2013 their price declines will slow further as they continue to try to remain profitable. And then, the comment about any other capacity adds that might be made. In order for that to be economically justified, pricing either needs to flatten or even increase. So, when we think about it on those three dimensions, that's why we feel the pricing environment in 2017 will be about 10% on a year-over-year basis, if not better.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","I think Tony has nailed it very accurately here. But let's take this a year at a time before we try to look out two years from now, three years from now. We're feeling good about the current dynamics. Let's see how those dynamics evolve throughout this year, and then we'll be able to give you a thoughtful response on what happens next. Is that okay?","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Thank you, Wendell. Appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in queue that will come from Doug Clark with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking my question here. First one on the glass business, can you talk a little bit about any incremental changes in demand trends on the TV side for the traditional glass business? And worth a try here, but can you narrow down or at least give a little bit of quantitative guidance for what you expect Specialty Materials segment to be for the for the full-year 2017 in terms of growth rates?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Sure. On the overall glass demand, we don't really see any change in what we had originally talked about back in January. We think TVs themselves could be flat and may be up 1%. The growth again is going to be driven by the TV size, with greater than an inch and a half. From an overall glass market standpoint, that should be in the 4% to 6% range, and our volume will be in that same range, in the mid-single digits.","So, really no change, I mean \u2013 Doug, the thing to always keep in mind is it's only been one quarter and only a couple of months' worth of data. And what really drives a lot of this happens in the back half of the year. So, our outlook is essentially the same.","In terms of Specialty Materials, I mean I think it's important to understand that we firmly know that we're going to grow or believe we're going to grow on a year-over-year basis. And we've got a lot of great innovations such as Gorilla Glass 5, and how much that growth is going to be depending on the adoption of those innovations. And we feel good about what happened in Q1, that was very significant growth. We think Q2 growth is going to be in the high-teens. And we just need to see how those innovations continue to roll out and be adopted, keeping in mind that the supply chain there always takes products in advance of product launches. And so, it's hard to just take one quarter and draw a big conclusion from it. We obviously feel great about where we are in Specialty Materials.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. That makes sense. And then, I have a quick follow-up on Optical as well, kind of a two-part question. First, can you give us any detail on who that 10% customer is in that segment already? And then, secondly, I know you're more indexed to North America generally, but can you talk about kind of near-term trends going on in China to the extent that there's any type of pause or softness?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","So, in terms of the 10% customer, we're not going to disclose that.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","And on China, it has been relatively widely reported, concerns about a slowdown in China for many of the players. And we still find demand for our product to outpace our ability to serve our Chinese customers.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Corning, Inc.","Okay. We've got time for one quick question.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from Tejas Venkatesh with UBS. Please go ahead.","Tejas Venkatesh - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. A quick one. Any update on when you expect to see revenue from Gorilla Glass for Automotive? You mentioned traction with the interiors of cars. Are design cycles there any different from the exterior?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","So, with regards to auto, we'll start seeing revenues quickly, already have some, okay? So, the real question isn't will we penetrate that market, that has happened. The real question is, how big does it get? And I don't think we'll have deep insight on that until we get a little further through the relatively long design platform time cycles of the car companies. But there is no question that both our exterior product as well as our interior product is getting very strong pull. The question we've kind of asked is (01:02:03) does it primarily penetrate in the premium segment or does this become an everyday vehicle type of product?","We don't have the new deep insight on that question yet, that can sort of only be adjudicated by actual decisions by customers that they then in turn become public about. But we're not only \u2013 the reason we're so highly confident about revenues is we're getting them.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","And Tejas, just one housekeeping item is to keep in mind that revenues for Gorilla Glass 5 for Automotive show up in what we call our Other segment, not in the Specialty Materials segment.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Corning, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Wendell, any closing comments?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Thank you to everyone for joining us today. As we've said, we're very pleased with our continued positive momentum. We remain on track to deliver our 2017 objectives, and the overall goals of our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework.

Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Corning Incorporated Quarter One 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the conference over to our host, Division Vice President Investor Relations, Ms. Ann Nicholson. Please go ahead.","Ann Nicholson","Thank you, Tom. And good morning. Welcome to Corning's first quarter conference call. With me today is Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Flaws, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin our formal comments, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These remarks involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's 2013 10-K report. You should also note that this presentation contains a number of non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation can be found on our website.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Flaws","Thanks, Ann. Good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to begin today by looking back at what we said at our Annual Investor Meeting in February, regarding our plan for 2014. We said we wanted to continue the positive momentum in display, work to quickly integrate CPM in Korea in order to realize synergies, gain further cost advantages and increase our flexibility of glass supply.","We want to grow sales and profits and optical communication, especially environmental life sciences driven by the growth in their end markets and their operational improvements. ","And finally, we wanted to executive $2.5 billion of share repurchases. I am very pleased to say we\u2019re off to a great start in delivering this plan.","In the first quarter, we closed on a CPM acquisition and launched integration activities. There are some combinations with improved manufacturing efficiencies resulted in improved gross margin performance and the realization of synergies in display. We executed customer negotiations for lower priced declines on LCD glass for the second quarter. We grew the company's core sales with optical communications and environmental exceeding expectations. ","We continued our strong control of operational expenses. We grew our core NPAT and EPS by 7% year-over-year, and we executed $1.25 billion accelerated repurchase program and also repurchased shares in the open market to retire a total of nearly 99 million shares during the first quarter.","In summary, we had broad based contributions to our first quarter performance and we look forward to gaining momentum as the synergies from CPM bill and as acrylic grows, allowing us to get greater year-over-year gains.","Now let's delve in to the first quarter details. As a remainder, we\u2019re providing core performance results in order to exclude non-performance related items and increase the transparency of our operating results.","Core financial measures are non-GAAP financial measures and we continue to report our GAAP results. You\u2019ll find detailed reconciliations on our website, outlining the differences between these non-GAAP measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measure.","First quarter sales were $2.4 billion up 32% versus last year increase driven largely by the consolidation of CPM sales. Gross margin was 44% up year-over-year and sequentially, but slightly lower than our original expectation of almost 45%, this was due mainly to lower sequential volume growth of LCD glass versus our expectations. LCD glass volume was down mid-single digits sequentially, more than our original forecast due to a technical issue at one customer. We\u2019ll have more on that in a minute.","SG&A and R&D spending were higher year-over-year in absolute dollars driven by the consolidation of CPM, but lower as a percentage of sales. Gross equity earnings of 61 million were down 66% year-over-year driven by no longer having the equity earnings from a CP after completing the acquisition.","Dow Corning equity earnings were up 40% year-over-year and I\u2019ll walk through that in more detail shortly. Our effective tax rate was 20% which is now what we expect our rate to be for the full year. EPS was $0.31 up $0.02 over a year ago and $0.01 better than $0.02.","During the quarter, we completed our 2 billion share repurchase program than we had announced in April 2013 and started repurchasing under a new 2 billion share repurchase program associated with the CPM acquisition. As part of the new repurchase program we launched 1.25 billion accelerated stock repurchase program.","Since the announcement of the SEP transaction we repurchased enough shares to offset the impact on fully diluted EPS of the shares embedded in the convertible preferred stock issued to Samsung. ","Now let\u2019s look at the detailed segments results and I\u2019ll begin with display. Display sales were $1 billion in quarter one, a 55% increase versus last year driven by the additional sales from an now consolidated operations in Korea, Corning Precision Materials. Q1 price declines were higher than Q4 as we had expected, driven by a specific situation that we described in our January earnings call. ","Sequentially volume was down mid-single-digits a little softer than we had expected driven mainly by a technical issue at one customer in Korea. Our volume growth was lower in the quarter than the overall LCD glass market due to this issue, but we expect to reverse in Q2 as glass volumes returns to previous levels at this customer.","For the full year we expect our volume growth to be in line with the worldwide market growth and as we expect our worldwide share will remain stable, compared to last year on a full year basis. ","Gross equity earnings from our equity venture in Korea SCJ were immaterial. Gross margins improved in display driven by the CPM consolidation. Net income was down 4% year-over-year reflecting the impact of a larger price declines and the delayed volume due to the technical issue at a Korean customer.","On the supply chain front, we estimate the inventory into the quarter of approximately 17 weeks, and is spread fairly evenly along the supply chain. This is in a range we consider healthy and reasonable and I\u2019ll talk more about the industry in our outlook section shortly.","Now turning to optical communications, Q1 sales were 593 million, up 26% versus last year and better than we expected. Sales for carrier networks were stronger than expected in North America and EMEA. Sales of fiber-to-the-home and data center products were very strong in North America. All businesses and regions contributed to the year-over-year growth with the exception of fiber sales in China.","Net income was up 11%, a little lower than sales growth due to pricing mix and lower fiber production levels this quarter versus the quarter one of 2013. The environmental Q1 sales were $275 million up 21% versus last year and better than we had expected. New regulations in China and Europe as well as a pickup in U.S. order show strong heavy duty diesel sales. Light duty diesel and auto sales were also up versus last year.","Net income was up 59% on the higher volumes, our focus on manufacturing in past over the last few years allowed us to convert the sales volume into strong incremental profits. We are delighted with the strong financial performance in environmental. ","Special material sales for the quarter were up slightly year-over-year as expected while Gorilla Glass volume grew high single-digits year-over-year, we experienced larger than usual price declines in Q1, the order renew key annual supply agreements, maintaining our market position. Pricing is expected to return a moderate declines in Q2.","Net income in Q1 was down year-over-year by 18% driven by the year-over-year Gorilla Glass price declines and the lower production levels this year compared to quarter one of 2013. Recall on quarter one last year we were manufacturing in a high level to replenish inventory after the huge Q4 2012 sales. ","In life sciences, Q1 sales were up slightly year-over-year, net income was down 13% due to non-repeated favorable one-time items that occurred in Q1 of 2013. ","Now turning to Dow Corning, our core performance measures now include Hemlock Semiconductor operating results. We had excluded the operating results Hemlock Semiconductor in 2013 to remove potential impact of severe unpredictability and instability in the polysilicon market. We\u2019ve seen stabilization of the polysilicon market and very positive behavior by Hemlock\u2019s customers with respect to the long-term contracts. These facts combined with the rulings on trade disputes have led us to include Hemlock operating results and core equity earnings for 2014.","Hemlock equity earnings were positive in Q1, Hemlock's customers are purchasing further contractual obligations, drove increased sales and profits in both Q4 of last year and Q1. Now we do expect lumpy quarters this year due to likely timing of these customers taking their volume commitments more towards the end of the year and I\u2019ll walk through this in more detail in the outlook.","Gross equity earnings from the silicon segment were down slightly in Q1 versus last year. Sales and gross margin improved year-over-year, earnings there were impacted negatively by the net impact of one-time items and unfavorable exchange items.","Now moving to the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with 5.6 billion in cash and short term investments. We had strong operating cash flow in the quarter. Receipt of Corning share of the existing cash on CPMs balance sheet of approximately $1.5 billion drove this. Strong operating cash flow also resulted in strong free cash flow for the quarter of 1.5 billion. As a reminder free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure, and the reconciliation of GAAP can be found on our web site.","We ended the quarter with approximately 1.4 billion of cash in United States, capital spending for the quarter was 246 and we are on track to reach 1.5 billion for the full year. So now that we've entered 2014 and with the Japanese yen spending most of the quarter in the range of 101 to 103 compared to the U.S. dollar. Investors have been asking about our strategy for hedging the yen exposure in 2015 and beyond especially with the risk that the yen could weaken significantly in the future. ","Now as a reminder, we had hedged all our expected translations exposure for 2013 and 2014 back in February of last year. Those hedges only covered the 50% of SEP that we owned at that time. We added hedges for a portion of 2015 in later last year.","So we\u2019re approaching the end translation risk with two strategies; number one, we have a plan to execute hedges during any period of unit strengthening. It's always tempting to say that events will not bringing in below 100 it\u2019s very possible the situation could occur in the world and we will be ready to add to hedges to match any residual underlying exposure if we see such an opportunity. ","Our second strategy, we recognize there is some that the yen weakens further from the current trading range of 101 to 103. And we\u2019ve taken action to protect Corning from that potential adverse translation in fact. During the first quarter we entered into a series of additional average rate forwards at approximately JPY99 which will partially hedge the impact of the Japanese yen translation on our projected 2015, 2016 and 2017 net income. These forwards have no premium. You will find additional details on this on our Form 10-Q filing which should be filed at the end of the day today.","We have not yet made any decisions on the core reporting rate for 2015 and beyond. We have some of 2015 hedged at 93 and some at 99. We\u2019ll keep investors updated on our activities and thinking as the year unfolds. Obviously we\u2019d love an event that caused the yen strengthening even if short lived as we would step into hedge. ","And I\u2019ll turn to our outlook and I\u2019ll start with display. We have no change in store expectations for the overall LCD retail and glass markets for the year. To reiterate, we expect that retail market as measured in square feet of glass to be up in the mid to high single digits. We think LCD TV units will grow low to mid-single digits but area growth will likely be higher. We believe the trend of consumers buying larger televisions will continue. ","Many investors ask us about our expectations for ultra high definition televisions and it was 4K. While we still expect ultra high definition televisions to be a high-end category in 2014 and beyond, we believe ultra high def has the opportunity to be a major driver of the area of demand in the near future. We expect about 10 million sets to be shift in 2014 up from 1.5 in 2013. And all these ultra high def sets have a higher average screen size.","Now we expect to monitor desktop and notebook portions of the IT market to be flat, however we do expect very strong growth in tablets this year. We continue to feel good about the glass market, inventory levels which are healthy and glass supply seems aligned with demand. ","As I mentioned earlier, we did have a technical customer issue in the first quarter that led to some lower volume. But we expect to return to previous share levels of this customer in Q2 and also to offset the Q1 volume loss of this customer in the second half. So for the full year, we still expect stable share compared to last year.","We see the Q2 LCD glass market up mid-single digit sequentially reflecting normal seasonality. We expect our glass volume to be up high single digit sequentially, slightly higher than the market driven by the share recovery of the customer in Korea. We expect LCD glass price declines in Q2 to be significantly less than Q1. Recall from our January earnings call, we believe that a higher Q1 decline was driven by specific situation that would not be repeating in Q2. ","While the Q2 price declines are not quite as moderate as in most of the quarters of 2013, they are a significant step in the right direction. We expect further price decline moderation in the back half of 2014. We are off to a strong start on the integration of CPM and we expect additional synergies from CPM in Q2 driven by the relocation of production from Japan to these lower cost assets and other integration activities. Consolidated earning synergies and additional LCD glass volume are expected to drive higher profitability for Corning.","Now moving to optical communications, we expect Q2 sales to be up mid to high single digits versus Q2 of 2013. We expect strong growth in carrier networks and enterprise networks led again by the sales of fiber-to-the-home and datacenter products as well as strong sales of our wireless products. These to be partially offset by lower churn of fiber sales. ","Contributing slightly, revenue growth is also the consolidation of an equity affiliate and an acquisition in Brazil that occurred in mid Q2 of 2013. ","Environmental, we expect Q2 sales to be up in the low to mid-teens year over year driven by continued stronger heavy duty diesel sales for the new regulations in Europe and China. I\u2019d like to pause here after giving optical communications environmental guidance. We think each of these two segments is poised for a very strong year. ","In optical communications the market continues to move towards optical products, our strength. We\u2019re seeing strong fiber demand earlier than we expected, we\u2019re confident we can deliver on the 2x times the industry capital spending rate as our [indiscernible] discussed at our IR day. ","In environmental, we made significant improvements to our cost and capability position over the last three years. With the improved sales outlook and heavy duty diesel and continued strong car demand worldwide, we think environmental could have a very strong year. ","Now turning to specialty materials, we expect sales to be up 20-25% versus the first quarter driven mainly by higher Gorilla Glass volume of the seasonally slow start to the year. The supply chain\u2019s preparation for upcoming new product launches will be driving the volume growth of Gorilla Glass. ","I want to take a moment to discuss Gorilla volume relative to the end market and supply chain. We\u2019ve been working hard to improve our models at the Gorilla market. It is not as strong as our understanding of LCD, but it has improved. ","First at the level of shipments of devices into retail, we expect covered glass growth as measured in square feet to be up approximately 14%. We expect to grow Gorilla at a higher rate at this level. ","Second, at the level of Gorilla Glass going into finishers, we expect to see consumption volumes by 24% this year. Corning shipments of Gorilla will exceed this level because of the inventory work off last year. ","In life sciences, we expect sales to be consistent with last year\u2019s second quarter. We expect Dow Corning core equity earnings to grow 20-30%, 2014 driven by single digit silicone sales growth and improved margins in silicones and the addition of earnings from Hemlock. Hemlock sales are expected to grow 20% over 2015. ","We expect Q2 equity earnings from Dow Corning to be approximately $40 million. This is down Q1 driven by the lower sequential sales of polysilicon, we don\u2019t polysilicon sales to pick up until Q4 and customers to fill their annual contractual obligations. ","Now continuing with the rest of our Q2 forecast, we expect gross margin to be 46% driven by display. Display\u2019s gross margins improved versus last year due to the volume and consolidation of CPM. SG&A and R&D spending should be lower year over year as a percentage of sales. Our effective tax rate for 2014 is now expected to be approximately 20%. The projected rate is higher than 2013 driven by the addition of CMP\u2019s income which is taxed at the Korean tax rate of 24%. ","That concludes my opening comments, Ann.","","Ann Nicholson","Thank you, Jim. We\u2019ll now open the lines for questions, Tom?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you, (Operator Instructions) our first question today comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with FIG, please go ahead.","","Mehdi Hosseini - FIG","Yes, thanks for taking my question, going back to your commentary about the retail and the inventories, can you provide more qualitative or quantitative assessment where glass inventories are in Q1 compared to Q4 and how do you see the inventory changing in Q2, and I have a follow up.","","Jim Flaws","So the inventories versus the end of Q4 are about the same, at the panel makers, set makers also about the same and down at retail which is what we would normally expect. Relative to Q2 we expect overall inventory in supply chain to build slightly and that\u2019s normally what happens because Q2 is actually the lowest quarter of glass used at retail. But that normally happens is we see a slight uptick in Q2. What\u2019s your follow up?","","Mehdi Hosseini - FIG ","And the follow up has to do with, you talked about the hedging of strategy in longer term how you\u2019re dealing with it. What about the cash offshore, is there any update there?","Jim Flaws","","So our US cash which I talked about is 1.4 billion, we have some cash strategies to bring more back to the United States, which we believe it will happen now later on this year. But we haven\u2019t detailed the exact amount yet.","","Operator","","Next question today, comes from the line of Amitabh Passi representing UBS, please go ahead.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","","Hi, thank you. Jim, my first question for you is, I think there is a little bit of a confusion and some of us trying to back into what the LCD ASV declines were and I was wondering if you can give us a pro forma sales figure for last year relative to the 1.0 turn on billing you reported this year.","Jim Flaws","","No, we\u2019re not giving out pro forma for that number. ","Amitabh Passi - UBS","","You\u2019re not. Okay, are you able to give us some sense, I think the expectations maybe about 6% ASP decline sequentially. Are you able to give us any sense of whether it came in slightly higher.","Jim Flaws","","It was slightly higher than that level.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","","And then just a quick follow up, on the telecom segment, can you provide any clarity or greater insight in terms of the source of strength, I mean significantly above I think what many were forecasting and you cited strength in North America. Any incremental color would be helpful.","Jim Flaws","","You know I\u2019d love to, but I\u2019ll let Wen take that one.","Wendell Weeks","","Jim as you note, we were up 26% versus last year, what\u2019s behind that is a strong demand for fiber-to-the-home solutions in North America and EMEA and by continued strong growth in our data center products of course supporting data center builds. Those are the primary drivers. ","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Is the fiber-to-the-home from your Tier 1 customers, is it broader based in North America?","Wendell Weeks","All our customers are Tier 1 customers. Yes, we\u2019re positively surprised by both the breadth and depth of fiber-to-the-home demand. It\u2019s nice because Australia has been through some pits and starts and now we\u2019re seeing activity really across the base with major players committing more and more to fiber-to-the-home.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to the line of Mark Sue representing RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets","","Jim, the issue with the one Korean customer, I just the thought is that they'll return pretty quickly and you have to also recover the amount that they didn\u2019t purchase. Maybe if you could give us some additional color there? ","And then maybe on Gorilla your outlook is pointing to a reacceleration aided by some inventory fill this year. Yet if I look at the near-term growth rate, it's kind of slow to the high single-digits. Is there some accelerated pricing that should linger? And just conceptually, how are we now thinking about pricing of Gorilla, is it similar to market share? Is it by customer base? How should we think of the frame work for pricing for Gorilla Glass this year?","Jim Flaws","","I\u2019ll let Wendell talk about the technical problem of Korean customer and then I\u2019ll take the other one.","Wendell Weeks","So we had a specific technical issue, one customer began to shift its manufacturing process and it led to an interaction with our product that has led to this delayed volume. We\u2019re addressing the issue, we\u2019re already experiencing increased demand in Q2, we still have some more progress to make, but we\u2019re on it. And we\u2019re making that progress and we feel pretty good, we\u2019ll get this going.","Jim Flaws","Also relative to Gorilla, as the business has matured we have experienced more price declines than we did in the first few years. But the ones, and a few one related to ringing up our annual agreements, we don\u2019t expect that to carry over as you indicated in your question. More importantly for us we expect to see a significant volume increase in Q2, that will be both sequentially and year-over-year. Year-over-year we\u2019re beginning to get a benefit and now having to compare it to last year when we were not shipping as much because the supply chain was working off of inventory. Sequentially we get the benefit of both seasonality in Q2, one has always been the lowest for Gorilla, but also, as our customers prepare for new model launches. In this business new model launches have always driven some of the lumpiness, depending on the timing when customers do that. But we\u2019re expecting to see a very good Gorilla growth in Q2 and actually in Q3 and Q4.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets","","And just on the Gorilla application in terms of what might be better as we look into 2014 and \u201815. Would it be the touch notebooks, would it be the tablets or how would you kind of rank order relative to year ago where you\u2019ve seen more promise in Gorilla Glass applications?","Jim Flaws","We\u2019re expecting touch on notebooks to grow this year, it\u2019s obviously a small number but I think the growth of touch on notebooks will be 50% and we\u2019re gaining share in touch on notebooks this year. So that\u2019s important for us. Tablets continue to be an excellent market and obviously tablets are a whole lot bigger than smartphones. So we feel good about both of those.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Jim sounds like glass pricing is improving significantly here in 2Q, but not quite at the level where you wanted yet. Any color that you can share why that\u2019s the case? Is that a continuation of the pricing issue that you had highlighted last quarter or is it a different issue?","Jim Flaws","I would say there is -- it's not necessarily specific issue, we\u2019re delighted by the dramatic reduction that we got in Q2 from what we had in Q1. We\u2019re not quite yet at the level we define as moderate but there is no specific issue that\u2019s hanging on with that and we hope to get there. Wendell anything you\u2019d like to add?","Wendell Weeks","No I think you characterized it well, it\u2019s not an issue. It\u2019s improved a lot, just not as good as we would like and so we\u2019ll continue to try to optimize and do better.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","And Jim is the expectation for a CapEx for \u201914 still the same, and that you came in a little bit lower than what we thought in Q1?","Jim Flaws","Q1 CapEx is always our lowest quarter seasonally, so you know it annualizes to be 1 billion, our official forecast is 1.5, my guess is it will probably for the year come in slightly under that, but generally Q1 does not represent a full quarter\u2019s worth, it has to do with how capital close at year end. But I think we\u2019re forecasting 1.5 could come in a little under that.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks. And last one from me, was the technical issue at your Korean customer, was that related to Lotus or EAGLE XG if you could share that?","Jim Flaws","It\u2019s in our -- in the base ASI business, it\u2019s relatively typical that I mean if you were not the lead supplier in a given line that what can happen as a customer shifts its process, that they\u2019ll first optimize or whose ever lead on that given line and then the person who is not in the lead on that given line has to play catch up and that\u2019s where we are. So it\u2019s nothing dramatic it\u2019s sort of a pretty typical type of issue in ASI you\u2019re just not used to us talking about it because we\u2019re usually the primary supplier.","Operator","Our next question today comes from the line of Patrick Newton with Stifel. Please go ahead, sir.","Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus","Yes, thank you. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess just first on Gorilla Glass I want to make sure I understood this. I think entering the year you discussed volumes growing in excess of 30% year over year and during this call you put a finer point on that expectation, I wanted to make sure I got that right. I believe you said that volumes should increase about 24% year over year for the cover glass industry as a whole and that Gorilla Glass you grow faster than that. So if I understood that correctly, I\u2019m curious if we should see this as a moderation of prior guidance?","Jim Flaws","No, there is no moderation, the 24% that I was talking about is what\u2019s happening going into the finishers, but from our shipments, we\u2019re expecting to be over 30%.","Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, great. And then I guess just on the synergy side of CPM relative to your original guidance, can you give us an expectation or I guess some details on what was achieved in the quarter and then perhaps something to kind of quantify some of the synergies to give us a base line for analysis price utilization?","Jim Flaws","So the synergies from utilization are not really occurring because they are starting in quarter two. We are beginning to make the shift, we announced that we are going to be shutting down some Japanese capacity actually in Gorilla first and getting that. We continue -- we had tanks offline in Korea at SEP, it\u2019s really related to 2011 we lost a share at one of our customers in Korea and we are not bringing that capacity backup until it\u2019s needed. So we\u2019re beginning to see the utilization shifts and starting in Q2 that will be the first half under its Gorilla. Wendell would you like to add anything on?","Wendell Weeks","Sure. We\u2019re off to a great start on the integration. But as you would expect, we will be building momentum in the coming quarters. So that will be part of our strengthening of our earnings per share year over year as the year goes on as we gain more and more progress on our integration plans. But we\u2019re delighted with the start, this is going really well.","Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus","Great, and just one more, if I may. I just want to Jim take it but maybe in intermediate term look at gross margin as we think about maturation of the display business you have lower margin segments that are driving some of your fastest growth with the optical communications and also environmental you have benefits that are coming off from CPM and perhaps a margin tailwind from Gorilla Glass that's somewhat slowing as that business matures. How should we think about your gross margin profile over the intermediate term when weighing all those different variables?","Jim Flaws","Well as you know, our corporate gross margin is obviously the add up of mix of all those businesses. From display assuming that we get back to moderate price declines in the back half of the year which we believe we will, adding into next year also, you\u2019re going to see the benefit of the synergies well primarily in the gross margin with some in OpEx, so that\u2019s good news for displays margins. ","In Gorilla as you noted, Gorilla margins are actually higher than the corporate average today. As that business grows, that will help the corporate average. We expect a continued growth in Gorilla, obviously strong this year and again we believe for next year.","The good news in environmental right now is that actually gross margins are pretty strong. We\u2019ve done a great job in manufacturing there. We\u2019ve been waiting for a little wind at our back from the heavy duty market which is -- goes towards some fits and starts in the U.S. but now that we have heavy duty showing up in Europe and China with the new regulations, that should be a good contributor to our corporate gross margin. ","Telecom is the place where it\u2019s lower and obviously life science is lower. In life sciences we think it will creep up a little within that segment over the next couple of years. And telecom the good news is that even though it\u2019s lower than the corporate average, the fastest selling products fiber-to-the-home and enterprise, actually are higher gross margins within that segment than the overall corporate group.","So generally I believe that the corporate gross margin has the ability to go up because every segment has the ability to improve their gross margins. The ultimate number will be depending on the mix of the quarter, but we feel pretty good about it, gross margin outlook, obviously with the biggest watch out is as always is display prices.","Operator","And we will go to line of George Nader with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","George Nader - Jefferies","Hi, thanks very much guys. I wanted to ask about, the efficacy of your contracts that you put in place on pricing in the display business in Taiwan, obviously did that I think a little bit more than a year ago in -- now look at the 10-K pricing came in I think mid-teens in Taiwan and then obviously some more price erosion here in Q1 was pretty significant, can you kind of talk a little bit about, what the experience has been, have you been able to maintain share as laid out on those contracts. And certainly, you think in an oligopoly environment, your competitors would react to those types of contracts pretty well, but it seems like, again pricing is still coming down a bit more than may be you anticipated, I guess I am trying to understand your perspective if you\u2019re looking back on this contracts, a year later? Thanks.","Jim Flaws","So, we\u2019re delighted by the contracts, we're entered in them in quarter, I guess quarter four really month of October 2012, our customers renewed them, we believe that they are providing benefit to both us and our customer, for us it\u2019s led to stable share, which is what the contracts would focus on, stable share really helps us, because it allows us to own our manufacturing, very stable and when that occurs, we get good cost performance. What we talked about, which is what shows up when you view the comparison over the last 12 months with a Q1, see in Q1 we had the spike up where we talked about before, where we believe a competitor had to normalize pricing between a customer in Taiwan and what they had elsewhere. And that because of the contracts drilled back on us. But as you can see with our guidance for Q2 that situation is not repeating. So we feel very good about how those contracts have contributed. Relative to our competition, we\u2019ve obviously commented that we believe overtime that the lower margin competitors will drive to lower pricing, but that\u2019s obviously up to them, but we feel good about the contracts overall.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Thanks very much. This results of question on pricing, so I think you -- when you commented about gross margins coming in a little below your expectations, you had cited the lower glass volumes than expected, but since it looks like ASPs were down in the low double digits which I think was also worse than initially expected, was that an impact on your margins as well. And since those were loss of contractually, I was just curious what drove that delta versus the original pricing expectation?","Wendell Weeks","No, our pricing sequentially were not down double-digits, so for the year-over-year pricing was down double-digits but they were not down sequentially. The weakness in our performance from our perspective, because pricing we had talked about it being -- declines being greater in Q1, a disappointment for us was the volume that we didn\u2019t get due to the technical issue. If we had gotten the volume that we originally expected, we believe we would have seen year-over-year profitability increase in display.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then the second question was on the competitive environment in Gorilla Glass. It looks like from the volumes you\u2019re expecting that, you\u2019re certainly looking to gain some share there, but you also talked about having some price declines as you\u2019re walking up some of these contracts. So can you just give us a sense, a little bit of how the competitive environment looks like right now. And what type of price decline should we be thinking about for this year for Gorilla Glass? Is it something on the order of 20% or not quite that high?","Wendell Weeks","Well, I started the end and then worked my way up. So we would expect that Gorilla price declines to moderate very significantly as we go forward into Q2. Specifically on price, we a had much larger than normal price declines in Q1 and Gorilla due to us wrapping up full year contracts to maintain our market position. And what led to that really is just competitors being more aggressive on price than they have been, they\u2019ve always been pretty aggressive but they found a new level of aggression for this round. ","Now what\u2019s important to note is it our significant price premium versus the competition is continuing or actually it\u2019s even increasing, but they just made a big move. So even though our premiums in place, the baseline that it moves from, move downward, we would expect that type of premium for the performance segments anytime you have a product that you care about its performance to continue because we\u2019re going to launch a new Gorilla. The team embedded in our current Gorilla this year. So it feels good about that. ","I think the next area of opportunity and challenge is the ultra low performance segments, that we\u2019re seeing now emerge in China, another example is low but not ultra low a touch-on notebook, and for that, what we\u2019re looking to do is create a real soda-lime glass spider that can be really competitive with those offerings for the lower performance segment. More on that as the year goes on because of innovation in market work ahead of us to make that happen as well.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to line of Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Couple of questions, Jim. Could we just talk on Hemlock in having normalized a little bit? Hemlock, if I understand it correctly, was that in already in Q2, but was not in Q1 or is it only going to included going forward in -- I'm sorry was it included in Q1, but not included in Q4 or only is going to include in Q2 going forward?","Wendell Weeks","So, Hemlock was in none of our results last year, we included in Q1. If we had had it last year in Q1, it was just a tiny, tiny loss. So it really would have only made the numbers increasing a little slightly greater. But for the year, last year, the only time it had any incremental significance was in Q4 of last year and that\u2019s when the contracts were fulfilled a lot by our customers. So it\u2019s really not a big shift year-over-year.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","But on an absolute basis, can we know what the Hemlock contribution was to equity earnings in Q4 and Q1 and kind of where you\u2019re thinking about it in Q2? Just with normalization at least for a couple of quarters sequentially?","Wendell Weeks","Yes, I think that we could outline that to you we'll have and get that prepared for you if you want.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","That'll be awesome.","Wendell Weeks","It\u2019s not very much money. Don\u2019t get too excited by this.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","I\u2019m not. Just want to make sure that all the ideas are dotted. On the -- when I believe you\u2019ve mentioned that LCD pricing is -- can be significantly better in Q2 than it was in Q1, but not quite back to moderate levels, is that still related to the same issue that brought pricing down in Q1 or is that a different issue?","Wendell Weeks","I think that it\u2019s moderate, they\u2019re definitely moderate. It\u2019s just not as moderate as our favorite quarters from last year, right. So it\u2019s definitely no real issue. They moderated, but just like to do better by a point or two, that's all. So, we can\u2019t have any particular thing to point at. As you know very well, you\u2019ve all sorts of dynamics working out of the competitors, but we\u2019ve got not issue to point at, it\u2019s gotten a lot better in Q2 from Q1. We just like to do better still. That makes sense?","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","That\u2019s awesome. I wish you guys luck at that. As you go through the different generations of Gorilla, I\u2019m assuming that what could be growing a lot this year might be NBT? Does that change the margin profile or the pricing profile of Gorilla as you go through the different generations of Gorilla, specifically this year versus what you had in Q4 and Q1? And is it NBT that really will be providing a lot of this 30% plus growth?","Wendell Weeks","So, no, actually, NBT though it\u2019s growing fast as Jim pointed out. It\u2019s off a small number. So the primary drivers for us is that main line Gorilla product Gorilla Glass three and hopefully this year a new and improved version. So that will be the lion's share of the growth in those places where you\u2019re used to us being. We\u2019re after some of these lower performance areas not so much about this year in what it can do but because it overtime as touch technology now proliferates every price point, we need to make sure we\u2019ve got the right offering to go after those real-value segments and that\u2019s still a work in process.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Okay, I appreciate it. Lastly on the balance sheet 3.3 billion in debt, 5.6 billion in cash. I think you said 1.4 billion was in North America, what are your thoughts going forward with respect to continued -- where would you feel comfortable with that balance sheet? Could you get to a -- would you be comfortable with the net -- you generally have a lot of cash but would you be comfortable increasing the debt or lowering the cash to a point where you are sort of at net cash zero or do you like having basically a couple of billion in net cash, how do you look at that Jim?","Jim Flaws","First of all, we have 1.4 billion in the United States not 4 billion, if I miss heard you.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","But I meant 1.4, I\u2019m sorry.","Jim Flaws","Okay, all right, now. We are going to be doing substantial repurchasing on the -- we still have about $600 million left. So obviously that will come out of U.S. cash. We have metrics around cash greater than that, doesn\u2019t have to be as great as $2 billion. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re likely to add to the leverage of the company, but I think the Board has demonstrated they are prepared to commit to shareholder returns to dividends and repurchase, and I\u2019m sure that they will continue to focus on that after the current program ends. ","And just one another comment, just want to remind you, we do put numbers on Hemlock in our queue every quarter.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup"," ","Okay, I\u2019ll make sure to have that. Thank you.","Operator","","Next question today comes from the line of Brian White representing Cantor, please go ahead.","","Brian White - Cantor","Jim, I\u2019m wondering if you could talk a little bit about the weakness in China fiber, is that more a market situation, obviously 4G is benefiting base stations, but it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s benefiting fiber or is this a competitive situation. And also with the ramp of some of these Chinese panel makers I\u2019d be curious just how you feel Corning\u2019s position and what are some of the trends you\u2019re seeing with the specific Chinese panel makers. Thanks.","Jim Flaws","","So on China fiber, it is on the volume side, it\u2019s basically market driven. Because that market took a step down, we\u2019ve also seen in terms of competitive dynamic a lot more action around price. But from a volume standpoint this is largely a market based pace. As you pointed out, predicting the China markets, it\u2019s a much more a command driven rather than market driven play in telecom CapEx. It\u2019s a little hard to figure out, but as it becomes clearer as we go through the tenders for the year, you know I think our ability to predict is going to increase, all right.","","Jim Flaws","","So relative to the panel makers in China, we have a very strong position with one of the large Chinese panel makers, we don\u2019t have much position with the second largest but we think we\u2019re doing quite well with the Chinese panel makers and continue to have discussions with them as they think about new capacity. ","Wendell Weeks","","I think the way Ray, to think about China, is our position there is superior to our position even in Taiwan, so we really like our hand in China and we have a broad based play really across the industry with leading positions in most of the players, so we feel really good.","","Brian White - Cantor","","And just as a follow up, we\u2019re not seeing China based LCD glass makers yet, is that correct?","Wendell Weeks","","We do have LCD glass players who are China based. We just have a significant IP settlement with one of them, so we would anticipate like you always expect in China to have some local players enter as well, but so far they are struggling as everybody else who\u2019s tried to enter this business struggles. ","","Operator","Next we have a question from the line of Steven Fox representing Cross Research please go ahead.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Thanks good morning, just two questions from me, first of all on the yen, Jim is there a way to sort of sum up how much you\u2019ve hedged versus say 2015 yen based revenues at this point, and then secondly with regard to thinning your glass further, as it works in to the integration plan, either looking at the total business or just the Korea based assets versus the previously wholly owned assets, can you just sort of give us an update on where you are on that process, whether it could accelerate this year or what kind of timeline you are for improving the average amount of thin glass in production. Thanks.","","Jim Flaws","","So on 2015, we're approaching having it fully hedged, I think we have about 30% at 93 and the remainder probably at 99, and then we have significant portions for 2016 and 2017 now hedged at 99. On the thickness of the glass, you want to comment Wendell, or if you want me to. So we\u2019re continuing to work with customers to build thinner as I\u2019ve mentioned in the past, some customers are on their second or third round of going thinner on glass. In Korea in particular, we have seen our largest customer there who really has not done much at thin, beginning to convert some of their capacity to thin, so we expect to see more capacity additions to our sales benefit and obviously cost reductions as they choose to go thinner.","","Wendell Weeks","","Yes, we like thin and we\u2019d like to see it continue and we always do our best to try to enable that because what we -- if you look at us broadly, what we would like to do is use that to continue to drive our costs, lower our customers cost but also open up the opportunity for us to exploit new markets with assets that we\u2019ve created purely through our own productivity, it\u2019s just great for shareholders and great for our ability to develop new markets.","","Ann Nicholson","","Operator, we have time for one more person\u2019s question.","Operator","","Thank you, our final question today will come from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan, please go ahead sir.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan","","Hi, thanks for getting me in there, just a couple of questions, I wondered, Wendell could you comment on the linearity of that technical glass volume coming back on stream in Q2, like by, how does that flow over the quarter, is all of it back by the end of the quarter or the middle of the quarter, not sure if you qualify that in earlier comment and then, I don\u2019t know if you could, could you tell us whether that an SEP is not hedged, have you done anything with that yet or is that still an open issue that you're consider to do with, and then lastly bonus question, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll get Jim to comment on this or Wendell, but could you guys talk about the -- it just feels like there has not been a lot of capacity added to the industry and yet volume demand just kind of keeps creeping up, up and up and up, and I wonder if you can just talk a little bit about capacity utilization at this point in the industry? Thanks.","Jim Flaws","So on the SCP, on the hedge portion for 2014, there is really nothing that we have done and likely to be able to do anything of any significance so, that just is flowing through us and can walk you through the impact on it -- on our results, but it kind of falls outside of court. ","Relative capacity in the industry, we believe the industry is continuing to be relatively disciplined keeping capacity offline, obviously what is occurring is as you know that the market continues to grow as it does at retail and flows through the glassmakers and therefore capacity utilization has climbed a little. On the other hand, we\u2019re continuing, our competitors also see some benefit from thin, so there continues to be excess capacity, but we continue to see discipline by the entire industry of keeping that unneeded capacity offline, any comments in linearity?","Wendell Weeks","Sure, so, I wouldn\u2019t count on linearity. There\u2019s -- when you work in through one of these type of issues, then you get this complicated fishbone chart, both our product, what\u2019s going on in their process. So as a result, these things are notoriously difficult to schedule. I think you\u2019re right in that our expectation is that we\u2019re already feeling it come back in Q2 as we speak, but there is always room for the unknown as we work our way through these type of issues.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan","Wendell, are you pretty sure by Q3 you\u2019ve got all that volume on board or I mean pretty sure being greater than 80% or do you still feel like there is a quite bit of risk if there is still little bit chunk outstanding?","Wendell Weeks","I feel pretty sure. My ops guys and tech guys, they\u2019re really sharp. I think we\u2019ll get this behind us pretty quickly, so I\u2019m pretty sure.","Jim Flaws","Just a couple of wrap of comments. First of all from Investor Relations, we\u2019re going to be appearing at quite a few places in the month of May. We'll be at the Jefferies Conference on May 7th, the JPMorgan Conference on May 20th, the Bernstein Annual Strategic Decisions Conference on May 29th, and finally the Bank of America Conference at the beginning of June on June 3rd. Just to summarize the highlights of the call, we think we\u2019re entering 2014 with a very strong start. The integration of CPM is underway and delivering results and we look forward to achieving the synergies which would be part of the 350 million.","We expect an additional MPAT for the full year. We grew sales in every business in Q1 and are on track to deliver sales and earnings growth in every business for the full year. We think our optical communications environmental segments are poised for a very strong year. We continue to improve manufacturing efficiencies and control operating costs and we are going to continue to return cash to shareholders with our share repurchases.

Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Brad, and good morning. Welcome to Corning's Second Quarter Conference Call. With me today is Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Flaws, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Tony Tripeny, Corporate Controller.","Before we begin our formal comments, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share with you our second quarter results, but before I dive into earnings, I'd take a minute to highlight our July 21 organizational announcement. In case you missed it, I announced my retirement effective at the end of November. After 42 years with one of the world's most enduring and successful companies. And with the company in a very strong financial and operational position, I believe it's a good time to hand the reins over to the next generation of leaders.","I'm very pleased today to introduce you to Tony Tripeny, our current Corporate Controller, who many of you have met and who will become Corning's Chief Financial Officer in September. Tony has 30 years of finance experience at Corning, including playing a key role in numerous acquisitions. In the last 10 years as Corporate Controller, Tony has been integral in forming and executing their current strategic framework and most recently delivering more than two years of earnings growth.","Tony has worked very closely with me and more importantly, he and Wendell worked together for many years, including time in our telecom business. I'm delighted that Tony is succeeding me. I'll be taking some time to introduce Tony to our investors over the next few months. For today, Tony will be joining Wendell and me for the Q&A portion of the call.","So now let's turn to our performance. Our results clearly demonstrate we're executing to our 2015 plan, which we laid out for our investors in early February at our Investor Day. Our businesses are delivering strong results, our acquisitions are delivering synergies and opportunities for new growth, and we're returning even more cash to shareholders. So let's start with a quick look at our overall first half performance.","Core sales were up 2.3%, and without the impact of foreign exchange, that increase would have been 4.7%. We are delighted with this increase, especially knowing we are not counting on sales growth from the Display segment.","Our earnings and EPS growth were even more impressive over the first half. Earnings were up 10.5% and would have been up 13.4% without the impact of FX. And we leveraged those earnings growth into higher EPS growth through our share repurchase program. EPS was up 15.9%, and without the impact of FX, it was up 19%.","We're delighted by these strong performance numbers, particularly given this period of low economic growth, and we hope you are also.","Now I'd like to highlight some specifics. In our Optical Communications business, we've been strategically positioning ourselves over the last several years by focusing on product innovations and acquisitions to capture growing demand in optical networks. And we are winning. Customers are increasingly turning to our innovative solutions to solve their speed, capacity and cost challenges. And while the overall telecom CapEx market grows by 2%, the optical portion is more than double that at 5%, and we're growing faster than the optical portion, in particular with our advantage solutions in fiber-to-the-home data centers. We're growing at twice the pace in the optical portion of the telecom market. This strong performance began several years ago, and we think it will continue.","Now let's focus again on the first half of 2015 and compare it to the first half of 2013. Sales over this period are up 40%, and NPAT is up 72% over the last two years. We had strong results again in Q2 which I'll cover in more detail in a minute. I want to emphasize the strong performances driven by both organic and inorganic sales growth.","Before the impact of FX, our Q2 organic sales were up 10%. And we grew 21% before FX, including the sales from acquisitions. We expect this outperformance in our Optical Communications business to continue over the next several years, assuming continued adoption of both fiber-to-the-home and bigger more efficient data centers.","Now turning to Gorilla Glass, Gorilla Glass remains the cover glass of choice for branded devices and is gaining share. Additionally, we have new products that are gaining traction and even more in the pipeline.","First, Gorilla Glass 4 is now designed into 43 models as OEMs embrace its superior drop performance. Its penetration is the fastest yet of any of our new Gorilla Glass introductions. And even better, it has a price premium. Second, our sales of Gorilla Glass in China are up 45% year-to-date. And third, we just announced our first smart phone customer using Gorilla Antimicrobial Glass.","Finally, our overall efforts to drive volume, reduce cost and innovate with price premiums for the cover glass market have contributed to performance. Specialty Materials gross margin is up 170 basis points year-to-date.","Now turning to Display, the pricing environment for LCD glass continues to improve. Prices declined moderately in Q2 as expected. I spent some time on the April call explaining the difference between our overall price declines and what I called the heartbeat of glass price declines. As a reminder, we are in the midst of a significant move from thick to thin glass. Because we've incented customers with price to make the switch, it makes our overall price declines look larger. As a reminder, we did this incenting because our margin dollars on thin remain neutral to thick, and we gain free capacity.","The heartbeat price decline focuses on price decline without the thick to thin impact and without customer mix impact. We've been making very steady progress with the lower heartbeat declines as this graph shows. As we near the end of the big thick to thin conversion at some of our major customers, our overall price declines and the heartbeat decline should converge.","Prices for Q3 under most of our LCD glass contracts have now been set. I'm pleased to say we expect to see moderate price declines again in Q3. You may recall that some of these contracts contain price mechanisms that establish defined relationship between our prices and the average prices offered by comparable glass suppliers. Customer input to date indicates the average price for LCD glass will result in moderate price declines in Q3.","So when you look at the heartbeat of pricing under our contracts, without the impact of product mix, on this basis, declines have been in the 2%s for four consecutive quarters, and we expect this to continue in Q3.","Now during the quarter, we also reached an agreement with Gerresheimer AG to acquire their pharmaceutical glass tubing business that has operations in Vineland, New Jersey and Pisa, Italy. With this acquisition, we expect to accelerate our innovations for the pharmaceutical glass packaging market. As part of the transaction, the two companies will enter into a 10-year supply agreement for pharmaceutical glass tubing and also form an equity venture, 75% owned by Corning, focused on accelerating Corning's innovations for the pharmaceutical glass packaging market.","The transaction enables Corning to bring its revolutionary new technologies to the pharmaceutical glass packaging market with Gerresheimer, a long-standing leader in the industry. In addition, we've now formed a new internal division called Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies with the new assets and an equity venture to drive our innovations into the marketplace at a faster pace. It may take a while, but we believe the size of the prize here for Corning is $1 billion in sales.","So now let me turn to our second quarter details and as a reminder, these are core results. Second quarter sales, gross margin, operational expenses and equity earnings were all in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. The stronger dollar did reduce core sales in the second quarter by $61 million versus a year ago. Primary currency exposure here is the euro. Gross margin was 45%, up year-over-year, driven by gross margin improvements in Optical, Environmental, Specialty, and Life Sciences. SG&A and R&D spending were down in absolute dollars versus Q2 last year, driven by cost controls and the synergies from the CPM acquisition.","Now net income was up 7% versus last year, despite the impact of a strong dollar, which had an impact of $18 million on our profit. This impact versus Q2 results last year is approximately $0.01 per share, similar to what we outlined coming into the quarter. Earnings per share was $0.38, up $0.04, or 12%, versus last year and better than the Street consensus by $0.01. I'm delighted with these results.","Now let's go through the segments, starting with Display. Display sales were $963 million in Q2. Sequentially, price declines were moderate and volume was up in the low single digits, both as expected. Year-over-year volume was up nearly 10%. Gross margins in Display were consistent with last year, driven by the additional volume and synergies, offsetting price declines. Net income was down just slightly year-over-year. Our continued cost reductions, boosted by the CPM synergies, moderate pricing environment have positioned us to maintain stability in this business and continue with strong cash flow generation. We're delighted with the results.","Now looking at the supply chain, we estimate forward-looking weeks of inventory ended quarter two slightly better than Q1, which is a positive indicator. Our model indicates that forward-looking weeks of inventory will also shrink in the back half, and I'll discuss that more in the outlook segment.","Now turning to Optical Communications, Q2 sales were $800 million, up 17% versus last year and better than our forecast. Organic growth was 10% before the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions made up the balance. Fiber-to-the-home and data center sales in North America drove sales growth. Stronger dollar also impacted sales here by $27 million. Net income was up 44%. Now Optical Communications has some euro-denominated costs, so the FX impacted profitability here only slightly. Additional volume in all parts of the business and acquisitions drove the higher net income.","In Environmental, Q2 sales were $260 million, down 9% versus last year, and that was driven primarily by foreign exchange trimming sales by approximately $17 million. We have some euro-denominated costs, but the majority of costs in Environmental are dollar based. So the stronger dollar was a drag on year-over-year profitability and impacted net income by $6 million versus last year. But continued execution on costs helped the segment actually maintain net income year-over-year, delivering $46 million.","Now in Specialty Materials, Gorilla Glass volume was up mid-teens year-over-year. Versus last year, segment sales were down 9%, driven by the lower sales of advanced optic products, which is experiencing a cyclical downturn as part of the semiconductor industry and a strong dollar. Continued cost reductions, growth of the Gorilla Glass volume and the Gorilla Glass 4 price premium helped improve profitability. So the segment was able to maintain year-over-year net income despite the sales decline.","In Life Sciences, Q2 sales were down 5% year-over-year and net income was consistent. FX was the primary cause of the year-over-year decline. Net income would have increased 9% without the impact of foreign exchange rates. Equity earnings from Dow Corning were $63 million, in line with expectations. Stronger dollar impacted Dow Corning sales and earnings, and reduced Corning's equity earnings by $4 million versus last year. Earnings were helped by a one-time IP settlement which was embedded in our original guidance.","Now let's turn to the balance sheet. We delivered free cash flow of $380 million in the quarter. Our capital spending forecast remains at the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion for the full year. During the quarter, we increased the rate of our share repurchases by about 25% compared to Q1. We spent $626 million on share repurchases in the quarter. This increase reflects our view that the company's current \u2013 with the company's current performance and future prospects, our stock is undervalued. We expect the company's cash generation to remain strong and we want to put the cash to work for shareholders. As a result, the Board of Directors authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program on July 15. Since October 2011, the board has authorized $9 billion of share repurchases. Our balance sheet cash is healthy at $5.5 billion, and we ended the quarter with approximately $2 billion of cash in the United States.","Now I'd like to swing to the outlook. First of all, we expect the Q3 impact of foreign exchange rates to be similar to Q2, or approximately a negative $15 million of impact and $0.01 of EPS compared to quarter three a year ago. Let's start with Display. After analyzing demand at retail, talking with our customers and reviewing external research reports, we're updating our expectations for the LCD glass market. We now expect the worldwide LCD glass market at retail to grow approximately 6% to 7% year-over-year in square feet. This forecast is down from our April view as we've reduced demand outlook for IT applications and television units in certain geographic markets. This lowers our retail outlook by approximately 94 million square feet, or approximately 200 basis points.","With monthly data available through May year-to-date, worldwide television unit sell-through is now behind our expectations and we've revised our view to flat year-over-year unit growth. However, screen size growth is tracking better than our expectations and we're raising our forecast to the average size of televisions, which helps offset a portion of the weaker unit growth. We still expect television glass at retail to grow 8% and small format devices to grow 16% at retail this year.","I know small format devices may not excite you, but the 16% in this area is a 63 million square foot increase for the overall market for the year. We don't believe these minor adjustments in television demand reflect any fundamental change to the longer term drivers of TV demand, and continue to expect excellent long-term demand for televisions, driven by the replacement of older sets and technology innovations such as 4K television. We believe the supply chain will work down some inventory in the second half and will bring down weeks of inventory by approximately two weeks by year end. We view this drop as a mild inventory adjustment.","So then for the LCD glass industry in the third quarter, we expect LCD glass market to be up by low single digits sequentially, and our sales volume to also be up in line with the market growth. We expect our share to remain stable. We continue to see balanced supply\/demand for Corning's Display Glass. We're running our online capacity at full utilization and we're keeping some of our capacity idle to maintain good balance. We believe that other glass makers are also running their online capacity at full utilization, and they have publicly stated that they are keeping some capacity idle.","Now let me turn to pricing. As I mentioned, we expect to see moderate pricing declines again for our glass in Q3. I think the question on many people's minds is whether the interaction between the softening demand and the reduction of two weeks of inventory will cause more severe price drops in Q4. Our conclusion is no, for a variety of reasons which I'll outline in a minute.","First, though, let me outline our expectations on market volumes for Q3 and Q4. We're forecasting a low single digit percentage sequential increase for quarter three and a corresponding decrease in quarter four. These volumes, combined with the large normal seasonality of television retail demand in Q4, are enough to bring inventories down a couple weeks. And this calculation includes the softer television outlook that I mentioned earlier. We do not believe the sequence of volume shifts and inventory moves will trigger a more severe price event. The industry is in a much stronger position than during past inventory adjustments.","We believe price declines in our contracts will remain moderate for several reasons. Panel makers are profitable, and they're getting the benefit of the weaker yen. There's a balanced supply\/demand in the LCD glass industry. The operating margins of our competitors appear, based on publicly available information, to be such that they can't afford large price declines if they hope to remain profitable. And the rapid thick to thin conversions that we saw in recent quarters are nearing completion. So our future quarter-over-quarter ASP comparisons should no longer reflect as much those thin discounts associated with the conversions.","Corning has a variety of levers to pull to steer calmly through slight market weakness and inventory adjustments. These include idling capacity, especially at the time of normal tank repairs. We think industry conditions and those levers will help, and we believe other glass makers have similar options.","Now let me turn to Optical Communications. In Q3, we expect sales to be up mid-teens year-over-year, driven by the continued strength in fiber-to-the-home and data centers in North America. Also contributing to revenue growth will be the impact of our three previously announced acquisitions. Our sales have been better than expected in the first half, and our outlook for the back half is for more growth, so we have upgraded our full year outlook here. Expect Optical Communication sales will grow mid-teens for the full year.","In Environmental, we expect continued strength in the end market in Q3. Heavy-duty diesel and light-duty substrate sales are up versus last year, reflecting healthy end markets. However, we expect year-over-year Q3 sales for us to be down mid single digits due to the impact of the euro and other foreign exchange.","Now I'll turn to Specialty Materials. We expect Gorilla volume to be up high single digits sequentially but flat with last year's very strong Q3. The mix effect of Gorilla Glass 4 will help somewhat, but the continued weakness in the advanced optics market, driven by softness at our semiconductor customers, will more than offset this, leading us to Q3 sales versus last year to be down by high single digits.","In Life Sciences, we expect sales to be down slightly with last year's third quarter, driven by a weaker euro. Without the foreign exchange impact, sales would have been up the low single digits.","Continuing the rest of our Q3 forecast, we expect Q3 equity earnings from Dow Corning to be approximately $65 million. It's in line with Q2 in last year. Versus last year, sales are impacted by exchange rates there, but equity earnings are flat due to volume and cost benefits. We expect our gross margin to be approximately 44%, consistent with last year. SG&A and R&D spending will be 13% and 8% of sales, respectively, and consistent with 2014. Other income\/other expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $50 million. And our effective tax rate for 2015 is expected to be approximately 18%.","So summarize before we go to Q&A, we remain well-positioned in each our segments and are outperforming our competition. We're prepared to weather disruptions through our advanced products and lower cost position. We are the best in the world at specialty glass and ceramics and optical physics, and these capabilities are becoming more and more relevant to a broad range of industries. When you put it all together, it's clear our strategy is working. We're growing earnings today, we're leveraging our innovation for future growth and we're delivering significant value for investors.","Now before I proceed to Q&A, I'd just like to thank investors for the opportunity I've had to engage with you as being Corning's Chief Financial Officer. I've always enjoyed the opportunity to meet and discuss Corning with you.","Now I'll turn it over to Ann.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Jim. Brad, we'll open the lines for questions now, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question will come from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning, guys, and thank you for the question. Congratulations on retirement, Jim. Good working with you over these last few years. So congrats on that. And welcome, Tony, as well.","I wanted to start off with, I guess, Jim, a little bit of discussion on the trajectory of demand through H2. Clearly, you guys are reducing guidance for Q3 a little bit or at least missing our expectations a little bit as demand weakens here, but then the overall LCD glass demand picture you're painting actually causes us to think that our numbers are maybe a little low in Q4.","So I guess I'd like to get some commentary on how you see trajectory yourself. And maybe if you could tie into that a little bit of commentary on 4K. Panel pricing keeps dropping faster than we expected. Do you guys think that elasticity on 4K could be now more accentuated in Q4 if consumers hang in there and prices are a little bit lower? So just wanted to get a comment on that.","And then lastly, I guess, just some demand color. All of us are trying to figure out what's going on with global demand generally, so any further color you can give us on what you see regionally, how \u2013 are you seeing any signs of stabilization, et cetera? Sorry, a bunch of questions there, but thanks.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Rob. Well, I enjoyed working with you also, and I think you just set the record for six questions in one.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, sorry.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","So let me start with comments on the trajectory. Our July glass pulling from our customers, panel makers, is equal to what we've seen in June. We're not actually seeing any slowdown from our customers at this point in time. So I hope that helps on the trajectory. We believe, as I said in my outlook, that we will expect to see that there is some impact as customers recognize the inventory, the slowdown in the end market. And what we're showing is that we'll see a glass market demand go down in Q4 versus Q3. We could get that wrong a little. I mean it could be a little higher in Q3 and declines a little more in Q4. It's tough to tell. Right now, as I said, we haven't seen panel makers pull back.","Relative to ultra-high def, we clearly think it will be important in the coming years. As you know, our forecast of sell-in is 27 million units \u2013 our sell-through is 27 million. Our forecast of sell-in is higher than that. We are \u2013 we believe that pricing points are approaching the inflection point. We don't know if we'll get there in Q4. I suspect, given the overall weaker economic news, that maybe people will be driving that price premium down to the 1.5, in which case that should be very good for demand for us. I think I got most of your questions.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And if I could just add a little bit of color for you, Rod. I can see how you can get to your numbers. I do. And what makes it hard to do, just purely quantitatively is that you have some real behavioral dynamics here. What happened is in the first part of the year, the set makers were quite worried that they could get enough panels to be able to support the back half's demand. And so they were building inventory.","Panel makers' inventory levels are very healthy and they're profitable. So they can support continued price declines in panels and still may decide to run with higher utilization than is currently in our forecast for quarter three. So, therefore, you could run hotter in Q3 like you are anticipating. But then what we'd say if you're going to come back to the same total year, that would mean that quarter four would be less than what it is where we're coming to. So I can see how you can get your cycle. It's perfectly reasonable.","I think the key thing for us is that what's the dynamic in glass. In glass, we have inventory levels at the low end of healthy. And so that gives ourselves and our competitors really a lot of levers to adjust to whatever the quarter four is, assuming we're in the range of the total end market demand that we're discussing. Either we've got product development we can do, we've got glass tank repairs that we can pull ahead, right. So we have all the levers that we need to sort of keep demand and supply, whether your cycle's right or the one that we're currently basing our forecast is right. Does that make sense?","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, that's helpful, Wendell. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question will come from Amitabh Passi with UBS. Please go ahead.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning. I just had a couple of questions. Jim, I just wanted to clarify your comments on Gorilla Glass. I think you mentioned volumes flat year-over-year. I just wanted to confirm, how should we be thinking about ASP declines, and how should we be thinking about revenue trends for Gorilla Glass year-over-year?","And then just a quick question on LCD display. I think part of your assumption set assumes that the panel makers remain relatively healthy. I was just wondering, what happens if things were to deteriorate and if they were to become unprofitable in the back half of the year, how should we think about the potential ramifications for you guys, especially with respect to glass pricing?","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","So what I mentioned on Gorilla Glass in Q3 is the volume would be flat versus Q3 a year ago. Just as a reminder, Q3 a year ago was extremely high because of some of our customers big model launches. So we're actually delighted that we're holding it flat with that.","Price declines, we have price declines on Q3 and a price premium on Gorilla Glass 4. So as we see more Gorilla Glass 4 showing up in the mix, particularly as we head into Q4, you actually should be seeing a very stable price effect. And we're looking for a very good quarter four in Gorilla, also.","On panel makers, I just won't speculate. I mean, their profitability is much higher right now than it has ever been in any softening period or inventory correction. So it would take a fairly massive drop in panel prices, and we are not forecasting that. We're expecting panel prices to drop about 9% going forward, and they'll still remain profitable if we're right on that.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then if I just...","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Can I just add one quick thing for you on Gorilla just for fun, right. So for fun, through quarter two, we just passed cumulative $4 billion in revenue in Gorilla, and over 1 billion square feet of glass. And the nice thing about the price piece here is we anticipate overall for Specialty, CSM, take a double-digit profit growth here, including Gorilla, for the year. And that what Gorilla 4 is going to allow us to do is basically flatten price declines, and that's going to be terrific.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Securities LLC","And then I guess just a quick follow-up probably for you, Wendell, just on telecom. Can you just give us maybe some color on the demand? You've mentioned fiber-to-the-home in your commentary. Would love to get just kind of incremental insight in terms of the geographic trends you're seeing. And then just sequentially, you're guiding to sales kind of flattish. Just wondering, is that just seasonality or are you seeing some sort of maybe moderation in demand?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So for Optical, I think Jim used this, probably the most fun statistic, which is we normally say that our long-term goal in Optical is to grow at twice the rate of telecom CapEx. And what we've been seeing now for quite a while is actually, excluding acquisitions, we're growing at four times telecom CapEx, and including acquisitions, over 10 times telecom CapEx. And what's driving that is a combination of the right products, but also our strength in the right regions to get to your second question.","So we're seeing very strong North America, we're seeing very strong fiber-to-the-home, and we're seeing very strong data center work. And that combination of our strong position in data centers and our strong position in fiber-to-the-home is what's behind this really sort of powerful growth story.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Just one another comment, you mentioned sequential. Ordinarily, Q3 and Q2 sequentials are pretty flat. But we're delighted by the year-over-year in both of those quarters being up the mid single digits in sales. So generally, if you look at telecom's cycle, absent anything strange, low first quarter, higher second and third quarters, and then fourth quarter is where the most variability in history shows up.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Securities LLC","Again, thanks, guys, and, Jim, congrats.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Was just going to add, I think that that growth in the third quarter is in the mid-teens.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Securities LLC","Year-over-year, right?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's correct. Year-over-year.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, I was talking sequentially.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Cool. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Patrick Newton with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thank you for taking my questions, and Tony, congrats on the new position, and, Jim, congratulations on the retirement.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I guess, Jim, I want to focus on what you touched on with the move from thick to thin glass nearing completion. I think previously, you discussed thin as being 0.7 mm or less. And so I'm trying to help get some clarity on how thin can the industry actually go. When you make the comment that it's nearing completion, does that mean that we're nearing getting the industry below 0.7 mm, or are we approaching a lower thickness like 0.4 mm?","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","What I'm talking about is the move where we start from 0.7 mm and now I'm talking about getting to 0.5 mm. But clearly in some formats, we have some customers at 0.4 mm and smaller generations, but what I was talking about as the big move was what we started in 2008 when almost everybody was 0.7 mm and getting most people to 0.5 mm.","Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And if we think about that move in going to 0.5 mm and kind of the capacity that it naturally builds for you, are there any CapEx implications on the horizon, where kind of as this move to thin starts to near completion, that Corning will have to start investing in glass capacity?","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","No. I think we still think we have productivity increases coming. As some customers go below 0.5 mm, we're not expecting to offer price discount for that, but we still should get capacity from it. So the only CapEx that is on the horizon for us is the \u2013 as you have more glass, you have to finish it even though your melting capacity doesn't have to go up. And so we've been spending on some capital for finishing and then the only thing that will be on the horizon for glass capacity would be if someone were to build a Gen 10 operation in China, which we've talked about, I think, now for over a year. But we don't expect that to be on the horizon until late 2016, early 2017.","Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And just one cash question, Jim, since that's your favorite topic is you've announced that $2 billion buyback. I think that expires at the end of 2016. In that timeframe, I think you should pay out about $1 billion in dividends. So given that kind of $3 billion and returning capital to shareholders, I think you've mentioned you have $2 billion in cash in the U.S. So I'm curious if just cash from operations will allow you to fund the total $3 billion and return on value to shareholders, or is there a need to repatriate cash or find another way to finance those returns?","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Well, we're always looking for ways to bring cash back from offshore and as I think you've seen, we've been successful doing that. We did raise some debt in the second quarter. So we're very comfortable, our ability to continue to do this without giving you the exact specifics about repatriation.","Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good luck.","Operator","And our next question will come from Mark Sue from RBC. Please go ahead.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Thank you, Jim. It's been a pleasure, and welcome, Tony. I have a question on FX. Hedging will eventually roll off, so perhaps your thoughts on your plan of action, considering additional hedging at the moment seems cost prohibitive. So do we think about passing the increased costs down to your customers, or do we revisit U.S.-based pricing, which is in effect a price hike as well for your customers? So maybe you're thinking there.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","So I'll start. We're continuing to look for innovative ways to deal with what I'll remind everybody is in 2018, it's quite a ways away. And the possibility of is there something that we can do with a unique hedging structure that might allow us to not have the impact of the yen going from essentially \u00a599 to the low \u00a5120s right now. So we continue to evaluate that.","We also are evaluating whether we could return to U.S. dollar pricing and perhaps ways of doing that are pricing some of our new products in U.S. dollars. And fundamentally, we also think that the industry, the glass industry, will continue to reduce price declines to a lower and lower level and maybe could even flatten them out or raise them at some point in time. So we're hard at work at that but we're not panic-stricken, either as we go along. It's only the middle of 2015.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Sounds fair. Jim, a question on screen sizes. We are moving to larger screens and 4K will come initially in larger sizes. Are we getting to a point of diminishing marginal utility reaching optimal screen sizes? You're getting the benefit of size offsetting slowing units, so the question that we get is how long can that last?","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Well, we don't see it slowing down. I think you've heard me say that every year, I have a bet with our team that we're going to exceed their forecast and we just raised it again. The average screen size \u2013 I use the 30-inch and above metric because I think it's more useful \u2013 is growing very nicely again this year. And the thing that's really going to be helpful for us, I think, in the future is that as 4K becomes a bigger and bigger proportion of demand, that drives you to getting a bigger television. And right now, the average 4K television is over 50 inches. And if you think about that compared to the average television in the 30-inch and above category, which is really only 41 inches right now, so as that grows as part of demand, we think we'll continue to see average screen size grow.","The other thing I'll remind everybody is that televisions actually are getting average screen size up. Television itself doesn't have to grow as much because the manufacturers have continued to reduce the edge size or what we used to call the bezel, although many televisions don't really have one of those plastic things anymore. And so we continue to think this is going to help us for a number of years.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Helpful. Last thing, Wendell, if we took a look at telecom, how about your thoughts of accelerating M&A for telecom and Clark and his team. It is a segment growing very fast. Can we add velocity to deal-making, considering this positive outlook? How about a blank check for Clark?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No such thing as blank checks. But the core of your idea, which is that given the strength of our position and how much win there is in our category, we would like to accelerate that further with continued acquisitions. That's clearly our strong intent and it's just a matter of getting the ones that are the right fit at the right price.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. Thank you, and our pleasure, Jim.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","And our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Congrats, Tony; and Jim, we will miss you. My first question's on Display profitability expectations. Previously, you had expected that to be flat on a year-on-year basis. Now given the slowdown you've alluded to, can you talk about the magnitude of potential profit decline for the full year on Display? And I have a gross margin follow-up.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","So clearly with less volume, we would expect not to have the ability to hit the flatness that we were hoping for in Display. Probably, we'll have a little bit down. But I won't categorize how much that is at this point in time, but it could be slightly down. If you saw, it was slightly down in Q3 when our volume wasn't as strong as it had been in Q1. We continue to feel like we've got excellent cost reduction ideas and the Display team is working on how they can do even better in cost reduction in this period of slightly lower demand.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Jim. And then your gross margin guidance indicates a step down here from 45% to 44% in the third quarter, but you're guiding shipments up quarter-on-quarter for LCD glass. So should we conclude that your LCD utilization rate is going to be down quarter-on-quarter in 3Q? And in the fourth quarter, you're expecting the market to be down seasonally, so should we expect gross margins to also contract sequentially from Q3 to Q4?","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","No, I think that we have a little bit of an impact in Q3 from inventory changes, but that's just slight. But I'm not expecting our gross margin in Q4 to be materially different.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And last one from me if I could. Jim, you noted that the heartbeat pricing and true pricing to converge over time here, but can you help us with what the magnitude of the delta that exists now between the heartbeat of LCD glass pricing and true pricing over this quarter and maybe over the last couple of quarters? Thank you.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","I'll just give you a rough CFO math. We're in the 2%, and the overall pricing is in the 3%. But we definitely think we'll drive that overall pricing down and start to converge.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And this ties to an earlier question and an answer you heard from Jim. I want to make sure that we have portrayed this accurately for you. We believe the market will continue to move to thinner. Okay? We have requests from customers, of course, at 0.4 mm and all the way down to 0.3 mm. And we're developing glasses that, of course, that go to 0.1 mm or 0.2 mm. What's different about our approach is we're not going to sell those at a discount. That's our preferred strategy.","So that's what begins to bring this \u2013 the combination of the first set of moves to get down to thinner glass, sort of 0.5 mm area. As that comes to completion, that will naturally bring that sort of heartbeat or invoice pricing sort of in line with the mix level, which is the thinner versus thicker. But then the next step is that now, as we inevitably go thinner still, which competitively we love to do because our process is fundamentally better equipped to go thin than our competition's processes, that our strategy is to do that without a pricing decline. Now it remains to be seen how effective we'll be with that, but that is our plan and approach. Does that make sense?","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, it does. Thanks, Wendell.","Operator","And our next question will come from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks very much. And I wanted to add my congratulations to Jim and Tony as well. Wendell, if I can follow up on the point you just made there at the end. Were you saying that you no longer expect to be pricing at a discount starting with thicknesses of 0.4 mm and below? And I just wanted to understand the premise behind that. Is it that you don't expect your competitors to be able to achieve those kinds of thicknesses or maybe not at the same cost structure as Corning?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. The second is that while we would \u2013 0.4 mm is one level, 0.3 mm is another, right. We believe that competitively, it gets harder to do. And there isn't as much cost improvement as you begin to move to those thicknesses because of the relative difficulty of the way \u2013 of handling that much glass flow and doing it in a stable way. The way you have to think about as you go thinner, and it's why we get more square footage out when you do it, is the way you go thinner is you go faster. The faster you pull glass, the more unstable the sheet becomes when you're doing something like fusion.","And when you're doing something like float, you've got a fundamental problem of the relative weight in the physics of the glass on top of a tin bath. Those things combine, we think, to give us an opportunity to be able to differentiate ourselves on thin. 0.4 mm is more within the range of our competitor's capabilities than 0.3 mm is, easily. But what we believe is there's an opportunity here for us to try to change that pricing trajectory for thin and maybe even especially for stuff that we can only do uniquely, much like we did Gorilla Glass, to price in dollars.","We expect there to be competition in 0.4 mm; 0.3 mm we think it'll be harder still. But this is part of our plans to try to stabilize Display long term and, ultimately, we'd like it to turn the corner and start making \u2013 growing profitability wise. Like I said, remains to be seen. Can it happen? Right? Remains to be seen how all the competitive dynamic will play out. But that is the approach we'd like to take.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful and just maybe to bracket that a little bit in terms of kind of magnitude. How far away are we from the transition to 0.5 mm being done? Or maybe put another way, what percent of volume remains to be converted? And then maybe if there's any similar guidepost you can put around some of the other transitions you've talked about over the next two years or three years, that would be helpful.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","We don't give out specific numbers, but I would say over the past three quarters, you've been seeing very big moves in the average amount of glass going thick to thin, and these upcoming quarters, two quarters, it will be much smaller.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then, Jim, just one more near-term question for you, which is that you talked about channel inventories coming down for the industry in the second half of the year. But the guidance for the third quarter volumes to be up in the low single digits still would imply normal seasonal or even slightly above seasonal growth for the industry, which seems to put more of the onus for the correction on the fourth quarter. And I guess I was curious why you wouldn't expect that to happen earlier, most likely in the third quarter, especially given some of the guidance by the panel makers.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","So normally, we do see a slight increase in the absolute level of inventory in Q3. We are expecting a little bit of build in absolute square footage, that's based on what the panel makers are running right now. And then we always see a big downdraft in the absolute square footage in Q4 with the big seasonality of television. If we see a slight correction from panel makers in, for example, September, the last month of the quarter, that could be slightly different. But right now, what the panel makers are giving to us is not showing it that way.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would prefer your approach. I mean I would prefer you to be right, which is then to correct more in quarter three and make it even slighter in quarter four. But past behavior tells us it'll probably run the way it is, we've described earlier on the call. You heard Rod, it could even be a little hotter in quarter three.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Joseph Wolf with Barclays. Please go ahead. Joseph, your line is open.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Can you guys hear me?","Operator","We can.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Again, congratulations to Jim and Tony. Thanks a lot for all your help. I guess I wanted to focus on cash for a second. I don't think this was answered. Can you just give us where we are on the balance of the original share buyback? You mentioned the $623 million (sic) [$626 million] (51:42) in the quarter. How much is less than the $1.5 billion along with the $2 billion, and are there points at which you would think about accelerating? Is that share price driven or market driven?","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","So I think for Q1 and Q2, we were a little over $1.1 billion and obviously, we continued to buy in July, which isn't finished. We have not completed the $1.5 billion but we will complete it shortly, and then we'll be available to start spending on the $2 billion. That's our process to finish one and then open up the other one officially. And we, clearly, at these lower stock prices for Corning, which we think are below appropriate value, we buy more.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then a question on the telecom. I don't know if you've given out \u2013 give us a favor \u2013 you mentioned the different growth rates. Could you give us a split right now of the difference between the traditional telecom spend and the data center spend? And you mentioned focusing, I guess, on the acquisitions, will there be a focus to stay within that enterprise or the data center side of the business, or do you see opportunities across telecom right now?","R. Tony Tripeny - Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller, Principal Accounting Officer","I think from an M&A standpoint, we wouldn't be just in the data center spend, I mean we'd be across telecom. If you go back to Wendell's earlier answer to the question, we've seen a lot of growth in the fiber-to-the-home in the carrier area, and I think that that is certainly something that we're very strong at. It's easy to see where you could generate value in terms of synergies there in terms of different products or different geographies. So as we look at it, we look at it as telecom in total, not just data centers.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And can you give any directional on the sizes of this business? Is the data center business measurable right now? Is it 10% of the business, or is it still just a growing smaller business?","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","It's clearly greater than 10% of our business.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","We give enterprise total. Enterprise is running about 25% of all of our sales in Optical.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Ann.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Jim, congratulations. I'm looking forward to seeing the book that comes out of your retirement.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Steve. You'll be in it.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","I'll be talking about the Mets.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","I'm not sure if that's a good thing. So just in terms of looking at some of the new product development, I know you touched a lot on thinner glass and hopefully the positive impact there. Can you just sort of round out the status on some of the other innovations you're working on? So it sounds like we're still a little whiles away from seeing like 0.4 mm into the mix, but what about things like Lotus NXT and Project Phire and then especially the Iris product that you rolled out, how are those things factoring into the rest of the year or maybe where the timeline stands on those? Thanks.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. So NXT is out there now and beginning its qualification cycle. We look to that area as a spot where we'll be able to improve our profitability in high-performance displays over the coming quarters. Early returns are pretty good for customers. But our share traditionally in that piece of the market tends to be a little bit lower, and so we're replacing our competitor, and that's just going to take some cycle time. Most of those products go into these smaller mobile devices and so they're spec-ed all the way through by the brand, so you've got to go through two quals. But we're encouraged by our opportunity to improve profitability there.","On Phire, what we're doing now, our first products, we've got our first order on Phire, but it's going to be on \u2013 the first ones are going to start a little smaller, so it's going to be on wearables. More to come. This is a brand-new process as well as a brand-new product so its ramp cycle's going to be a little slower. What we like about it is it offers the opportunity to significantly increase our revenue and profit per device sold, as well as having scratch performance approaching sapphire, but the outstanding drop performance of Gorilla where sapphire has that weakness of not as good a drop performance.","Iris. Iris, which is adding the third piece of glass in a television for the backlight, what we've seen here is sort of split early on, just like you would normally expect. We've got a brand-new tech that's attacking an established plastic position. What we're seeing out of plastic is I'm introducing some new materials to try to get thinner to sort of fight off the glass attack. And right now, that's sort of running 50-50 in early debates for very early adopters. Some people are trying the new plastic set, some people are trying the new glass. It's going to take a little bit of time for us to sort out who wins what in that upcoming technology node. I think the good news is television's getting thinner, opens up that opportunity for us. Now we'll see who wins and who loses in that space.","The final one I'd touch on is \u2013 Jim didn't get a question on it, but he did talk about it through in the opening is you saw our announcement on Gerresheimer, the formation of Corning Pharmaceutical Technologies. What that is about is a significant innovation that we have been on for a number of years. This is an industry that moves slowly because it's highly regulated. That being said, we've got a really good product idea here that is sort of a Gorilla-size opportunity for us. It's going to take some time. It's going to take a lot of effort. But we feel like that one is going to be one that hopefully in a year or so we'll be talking about a lot more.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","Great. That's all very helpful, and good luck to everyone going forward.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Steve.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Steve. We have time for one more quick question.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead, sir.","Brian J. White - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hey, Jim, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about TV demand in China, what you're seeing there. And also, I see you made an announcement around a new Gen 0.5 LCD glass substrate finishing facility. So maybe talk a little bit about Corning's strategy in terms of fab in China.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","So the announcement was a finishing factory in China. I think it was Gen 8.5. (59:24).","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","(59:24).","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","And that is we have melting in China in Beijing. We have room to grow that bigger if we need to. And then we have \u2013 are capable of building finishing factories next to our customers and shipping glass to them. So that's been our strategies to date in China. Now your first question was on China demand?","Brian J. White - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","China demand.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","China demand has been mixed so far. The May holidays were weaker, and we're anxiously awaiting the June numbers. What we are seeing is that in China, where traditionally most \u2013 a lot of the demand was driven in these big holiday periods, Chinese New Year, May Day, National Day in October, is that there's now an increased number of online sales. And our initial tracking of that looks like that's more consistent during the year. And we think that June will actually be a very strong month for that. But that being said, we did lower our China unit forecast based on what we think is a slowing economy, slightly from what we'd seen before.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And glass capacity, I think, because people miss this sometimes on thin, and we sort of take it as everybody understands it, so therefore we're not that clear about it. But when we move to thin, you get more glass out of the melting side, but you still have to finish it by piece. So when you see us invest in additional finishing capacity, that is the small part of the overall capital spend, but we're still going to need to do that to be able to place the higher flow out of the melting tanks. In terms of melting tank type CapEx, that's going to move more with new Gen size and big regional moves like the ones that Jim's talking about the Gen 10 or Gen 10.5, and that's pretty early in the game there.","Brian J. White - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Great. It's been a pleasure, Jim. Congrats.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Brian.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Let me just wrap up quickly. Our first half results were outstanding. I think very importantly over the last four quarters, the heartbeat of price declines in our LCD business have been trending very favorably, and we expect this to continue in Q3 and Q4. And we think the industry conditions will prevent more severe price drops.","Our long-term demand for television remains strong driven by replacement rate and innovations such as 4K. I think our sales and earnings growth in Optical has been outstanding, and demand in the areas of fiber-to-the-home and enterprise solutions are strong. And we're capturing a disproportionate share of the market profits, thanks to our advantage products. And the acquisitions in Optical are really delivering synergies and creating more opportunities for growth.","And finally, very important, we're delivering our commitment to return cash to shareholders. We have a strong balance sheet and cash flow, and we continue \u2013 plan to continue to return excess free cash flow. So in summary, we had a great second quarter and feel our market positions remain strong. Ann?","Ann H. S.

They are also available on our website to download.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Wendell.","Wendell Weeks","Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported excellent sales and earnings growth for the third quarter, and we\u2019re increasing our full-year 2018 outlook.","In total, for the quarter, sales were $3 billion, up 16% year-over-year; net income was $476 million, up 18 year-over-year; and EPS was $0.51, up 28% year-over-year. We also delivered on our goal to improve gross margin to 42%, a significant increase over last year and the first half of 2018. All businesses delivered year-over-year sales and NPAT growth.","Highlights include Optical sales up 22% year-over-year; Environmental sales up 19% year-over-year; Specialty Materials sales up 23% year-over-year, better than expected, driven by strong pull for new innovations such as Gorilla Glass 6. In Display, as expected sales and net income grew year-over-year, and annual price decline continue to improve, reaching the important milestone of mid single digits.","As we said we would, we grew sales and profitability significantly by leveraging our recent phase of intense operating and capital investments to capture substantial benefits. Third quarter results demonstrate a step change in our earnings power. Underpinning our success are climbing production and efficiency rates at several of the largest expansion projects, plus strong customer adoption of our innovations.","Our annualized sales run rate now exceeds $12 billion. Growth is accelerating and our margins are expanding. Execution across the Company is outstanding. We expect to exceed $11.3 billion in full-year sales, up more than 10% year-over-year. And we expect to build on this strength as we address the rich set of opportunities ahead of us. So, we feel great about both the back half of 2018 and our future opportunities, as Tony will describe in just a few moments.","Now, let\u2019s turn to the strategy and capital allocation framework, which outlines our leadership priorities. Under the framework, we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion in cash through 2019; we plan to return more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends, and to $10 billion to extend our leadership and deliver growth. We continue to make great progress toward the framework goals we announced in October of 2015. Our cash generation is on target. And through the end of the third quarter, we have returned $11.4 billion to shareholders.","Dividends per share have increased 50% since the framework began. Investments in RD&E, capital expenditures and acquisitions also remain on track to our four-year plan, totaling $7.3 billion through September 30th.","As outlined in our framework, Corning is best in the world in three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market access platforms. Capabilities are interrelated and reinforcing.","We focus 80% of our resources on opportunities that use capabilities in at least two of these three categories. This increases our probability of success, reduces the cost of innovation and creates stronger competitive advantages, and delights our customers.","Now, turn to our progress in each of our market access platforms, starting with Optical Communications.","Our performance in Optical Communications continues to be outstanding. We remain the world leader in passive optical solutions and the only true end-to-end supplier of integrated solutions. First, I want to note the team\u2019s response to the September hurricane in North Carolina, home to most of our fiber and cable manufacturing. Our people pulled together and did an outstanding job, working through the challenges of Hurricane Florence. They showed the highest level of commitment to safety and to supporting each other. Despite this powerful storm, their efforts kept us on track with our expectation for high-teen sales growth this year.","Next, recognition of the value created by our solutions and our unique co-innovation approach continues to grow. We continue to secure contracts with industry leaders in the carrier and data center segments that will add significant sales in 2019 and beyond. These multiyear commitments support additional manufacturing capacity and drive profitable growth.","We continue to reach milestones that demonstrate our long track record of innovation and industry expertise. Less than a year ago we announced that we had sold over 1 billion kilometers of optical fiber. And in August, we announced that our pre-connectorized fiber-to-the home solutions have passed more than 45 million homes around the world. We\u2019re also proud to have reduced energy intensity in our fiber and cable plants by 50%, as part of our commitment to protecting the environment through continuous improvement to processes, products and services.","Stepping back, we positioned our Optical Communications market access platform to deliver advantaged optical fiber, cable and connectivity solutions for access networks, cloud, data centers, and the network densification necessary for 5G. This year, we\u2019ve ramped fiber and capacity in North Carolina. And during the quarter, we announced the opening of a manufacturing facility in Strykow, Poland. Our investments in innovation and capacity are clearly paying off in the second half of the year. We\u2019re excited about our excellent performance, our current growth, and especially our future opportunities.","Now, let\u2019s turn to mobile consumer electronics where we are the world leader in glass for smartphones, tablets and emerging categories like wearables and augmented reality devices. Our goal is to double mobile consumer electronic sales over the next several years. We continue to make significant progress in adding more sales dollars per device, through our innovations while also expanding our share developing regions and entering new product categories.","Corning Gorilla Glass has been designed into more than 6 billion devices worldwide, and it is increasingly being adopted for glass backs. We introduced Gorilla Glass 6 in the third quarter and have additional exciting innovations on the roadmap. So, much more to come.","We\u2019re also innovating in new device categories. Gorilla Glass continues to be the most widely used cover material on smart watches. And in July, we launched Gorilla Glass DX and Corning Gorilla Glass DX+ which offer enhanced antireflective optics and scratch resistance for wearables. As announced in August, you will find DX+ on the Samsung Galaxy Watch; in addition the Fitbit Charge 3 launched in August, featuring Gorilla Glass.","Corning also partners with leading consumer electronics makers on augmented reality devices and precise 3D sensing technology. The glass we supply, coupled with our laser processing and characterization tools, enables optimized image quality, compact form factors and more accurate facial recognition. Overall, we continue to be excited about bringing our innovations to market to drive our sales and profit growth and to enhance the way we all benefit from our personal devices.","Turning to the automotive market access platform. Our expertise focuses on helping customers build cleaner, safer and more connected vehicles. Our leadership in gasoline particulate filter technology puts us at the forefront of the next wave of emissions control. European regulations took full effect in September and GPF sales are ramping as we partner with most major automakers to equip their European vehicles with the technology necessary for compliance. China will be next to introduce GPFs with initial filter sales in 2019 as OEMs prepare for the first phase of China 6 regulations in mid-2020.","Last week, we announced that Changan Automobile selected Corning as its supplier for gasoline particulate filters. This agreement is based on our strong long-term partnership with one of the largest Chinese automakers. Once regulations are fully implemented in Europe and China, we expect gasoline particulate filters to add a $0.5 billion in annual sales for Corning.","Next, excitement about Gorilla Glass for auto continues to grow, industry trends for greater connectivity, economy, sharing and electrification are driving demand for technical glass; polls for collaboration from more than 20 leading OEMs is increasing; and we\u2019ve been awarded more than 50 platforms to date.","One customer, Porsche, describe the benefits of using Gorilla Glass as \u201cideal visual characteristics, low weight and very high strength\u201d. Another customer, Harley Davidson launched its 2019 line touring and trike motorcycle featuring infotainment system with Gorilla Glass. It uses our advanced surface treatment for exceptional visibility in bright sunlight.","Overall, we have several hundred million dollars in our auto glass business pipeline. These customer commitments require the creation of a dedicated factory for Gorilla Glass for auto interiors, which we announced in July. We expected it to be operational in 2019.","In our Life Sciences Vessels platform, we continue to make strong progress on the path to a new, long-term, multibillion dollar franchise. Valor Glass substantially reduces particle contamination, breaks and cracks while significantly increasing throughput. Valor helps protect patients and improve pharmaceutical manufacturing. Key customers are advancing toward the FDA certification required for the use of Valor. Our development partners, Merck and Pfizer are at the fore front. To support individual drug regulatory filings by our customers, we increased our shipments of Valor Glass by three fold versus this time last year, indicating growing progress toward certification across more pharmaceutical companies.","In parallel, we are supporting customers by scaling up production. We brought new capacity online in the third quarter and expanded our range of products. We\u2019re also progressing with the construction of the new high volume manufacturing facility in North Carolina that we announced in April. Finally, industry pull remains favorable.","In September, more than 40 leaders in the pharmaceutical industry visited Corning for the annual Drug and Pharmaceutical Packaging Committee meeting which we hosted. They learned about the patient safety and manufacturing benefits of Valor Glass.","We continue to believe Valor Glass has the potential to power Corning\u2019s growth for the next decade and beyond. And we remain closely engaged with the FDA and support its efforts to address this important public health issue. We look forward to being able to share additional update soon.","In Display, we\u2019re delivering stable returns. TV retail demand and screen size growth supported strong volume growth in the display glass market. Corning is exceeding this growth due to the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant in tandem with BOE\u2019s panel production, further expanding our global industry leadership. As the benefits of our investment in fleet optimization and Gen 10.5 take-hold, profitability is improving substantially in the second half, as we planned. ","In the third quarter, as expected, pricing continued to improve. We reached the important milestone of annual mid-single-digit percentage price decline, and expect the improvement trend to continue in the fourth quarter. We also expect our full-year 2019 price declines to further improve from 2018. So, we continue to make significant progress across all our market access platforms. Ultimately, we remain on track to fully achieve our strategy in capital allocation framework goals. We\u2019ve leveraged our investments to meet increased demand from our customers, grow sales and significantly improve profitability in the third quarter. We will continue to reap the benefits of those investments in the future, and are very well-positioned to deliver strong growth for the remainder of the year and beyond.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tony for a review of our results and outlook.","Tony Tripeny","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We had an outstanding quarter. Each one of our businesses delivered excellent results with year-over-year sales and profit growth across the board. We expect very strong performance again for the fourth quarter and full-year, and now expect to exceed $11.3 billion in sales for 2018. We have passed an inflection point. Our significant investments over the last few quarters are now delivering greater sales and profitability. We are gaining momentum and we plan to build on that going forward.","Before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the primary difference between our GAAP and core results is again a non-cash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts. As we discussed before, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contract settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of the each quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this resulted in an after tax GAAP gain of a $151 million for the third quarter. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.","Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher servicing for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We are very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We\u2019ve received $1.6 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since our inception, slightly over five years ago. That brings me to our results and outlook.","Third quarter sales increased 16% year-over-year; net income was up 18%; and EPS was $0.51 up 28%. As Wendell noted, this strong growth results from customers adopting our innovation and realizing the benefits from our capacity investments. As a reminder, our capacity expansion projects support strong and committed customer demand across all businesses. These investments include capacity expansions for optical fiber and cable, our Gen 10.5 display glass plant, capacity for gasoline particulate filters, and multiple development projects, including Gorilla Glass for mobile devices and for automotive.","As our new capacity continues to ramp towards full production levels, our sales run rate is climbing and our gross margin is going up. Gross margin in the third quarter expanded to 42%, and we expect to sustain that level in the fourth quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion of cash, and adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter was $956 million.","Now let\u2019s look at detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technologies, we\u2019re delivering stable returns. Third quarter sales were $852 million and net income was $218 million, both up sequentially and year-over-year. As we explained in July, the gross margin in our display business is improving because of two factors, the Gen 10.5 startup and fleet optimization. Our investments in successful capacity ramp are expanding our leadership and contributing significantly to the stable profits we\u2019re now seeing.","As expected, third quarter sequential price declines were very moderate, and we reached the important milestone of annual price declines improving to a mid-single-digit percentage. For the fourth quarter, we expect sequential price declines to be even more moderate than the third quarter. We expect our full-year 2019 price declines to further improve from 2018","Three factors drive our view that this favorable pricing environment will continue. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced or even tight. Our new Gen 10.5 plant supports the expected growth of large-sized TVs. It is co-located with and dedicated to our customer BOE. We pace and align capacity in tandem with BOE to ensure our Gen 10.5 glass supply is balanced to demand; the ramp is on schedule. We expect the glass supply demand balance below Gen 10.5 to tighten further because demand continues to grow while public information indicates there is little capacity growth planned in this segment by glass makers.","Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. Therefore, we expect their price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable.","And third, display glass manufacturing requires ongoing investments in current capacity to maintain operations. To generate acceptable returns on investments, glass pricing will need to improve even further. For Corning, we will only add capacity if we can get an attractive return for our shareholders.","Moving retail. TV demand has been strong year-to-date and we expect it to remain robust for the rest of the year. We continue to expect TV screen size to grow 1.5 inches this year. We also continue to expect display glass market volume growth in the mid single digits for the full year.","Third-quarter display glass market volume grew mid-single-digit sequentially and our volume grew faster as we ramp production in Gen 10.5 plant in line with our July guidance.","In the fourth quarter of 2018, we expect the display glass market volume to grow low single digit sequentially and our volume to grow faster as we continue ramping Gen 10.5 production in tandem with BOE\u2019s Gen 10.5 demand.","In summary, we remain very pleased with the current dynamics in our display business, our ability to capture higher productivity and margin through fleet optimization and the Gen 10.5 plant, and most importantly the fact that we are now delivering stable returns.","Let\u2019s move to this year\u2019s fastest growing segment, Optical Communications. Third quarter sales were up 22% year-over-year and exceeded $1 billion for the second quarter in a row. Sales growth was driven by both our data center and carrier customers, and sales from 3M\u2019s Communication Markets Division, which we acquired in June.","Net income was a $168 million, up 27% year-over-year. Our capital investments are yielding clear benefits. Fourth quarter sales are expected to remain strong and be up low single digit sequentially. Capacity continues to ramp, which will enable us to meet additional demand from large projects under way of multiple customers in both the carrier and data center businesses. On a year-over-year basis, sales growth is expected to exceed 22%. Overall, we are growing Optical Communications much faster than the market. Our growth is driven by preference for our advantaged solutions in the data center and carrier market, and enabled by increased fiber and cable output from our new capacity expansions.","We continue to expect high teens growth for the full-year with organic growth in the low teens. Our mid-year acquisitions of 3M\u2019s Communication Markets Division contribute to that $200 million of the 2018 sales growth. We are pleased with our progress on integrating this acquisition and continue to expect it to be accretive to EPS in 2019.","Environmental Technologies third quarter sales were $331 million, up 19% year-over-year. Third quarter net income grew faster than sales. Our results in this business benefit from volume growth in all product categories as well as strong performance in our manufacturing operations. The North America heavy-duty market continued to drive strong demand, resulting in year-over-year diesel sales growth of 30% for the third quarter. In auto, we are growing our sales faster than the market due to winning additional business and the shift to premium products. Sales were up 12% year-over-year. Additionally, gas articulate filters contributed to growth as OEMs ramp for full adoption of Euro 6 regulations, which began in September. We are making progress on capacity and engineering investments to support the ramp of the GPF business.","We expect growth to continue in the fourth quarter with sales up high single digits year-over-year. We expect our full-year sales to be at mid-teens year-over-year with continued strength in sales of all products, including ramping GPF sales.","In Specialty Materials, third-quarter performance was exceptionally strong with sales of $459 million, up 23% year-over-year and ahead of our expectations. This outstanding growth was driven by a strong pull for Gorilla Glass innovations to support second half new product releases. Net income was $116 million, up 35% year-over-year. The third quarter demonstrates our ability to innovate and deliver value-added products at a premium price. For example, the use of glass on the backs of phones has doubled over the past year. We delivered another breakthrough innovation in July with Gorilla Glass 6 and broadened our portfolio to capture more value in multiple applications. Innovations like these, increase the value of our glass, extend our differentiation, and support using more glass in more places.","For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to remain strong and be comparable with the fourth quarter of 2017, which was Specialty\u2019s highest sales quarter. For the full-year, we expect mid single digit sales growth, after an exceptionally strong year of 25% growth in 2017.","In Life Sciences, third quarter sales were $231 million, up 4% year-over-year. And net income grew 20%, driven by improved manufacturing performance. Fourth quarter sales are expected to grow by a low to mid single digit percentage year-over-year. We remain on track to deliver full-year sales growth of a mid to high single digit percentage over last year, which outpaces overall market growth.","So, for 2018, all of our businesses have positive momentum. We now expect full-year sales to exceed $11.3 billion, which is up slightly more than 10%.","Now, I\u2019ll share some additional outlook details. First, let\u2019s turn to gross margin. We delivered on our goal to expand our gross margins at 42%. As we said we would, we accomplished this goal by ramping the new capacity in Optical, ramping the new capacity in Display, and completing the display fleet optimization. We expect to sustain this gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter. This is a significant improvement over the first half and versus last year.","Annual operating expenses should remain consistent with last year as a percentage of sales. For the fourth quarter, SG&A is expected to be about 14% of sales and RD&E about 8%. We expect other income other expense in Q4 to remain at our third quarter run rate or about $55 million to $65 million. For the full-year, we expect the net expense of approximately $210 million to $220 million.","Full-year gross equity earnings are expected to be similar to 2017 at just over $200 million, predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor with fourth quarter at approximately $120 million, consistent with typical seasonality. Recall that the timing of contracts typically makes Hemlock\u2019s fourth quarter its strongest. In the third quarter, our year-to-date tax rate is 20.8%. We expect our effective tax rate in Q4 to remain at this level. The slides we posted give you additional modeling related details for the fourth quarter and the full-year. ","In 2018, we expect to spend slightly more than $2 billion on capital expenditures with programs in every market access platform.","Finally, I\u2019d like to make a couple of comments on China. First, as we said in July, we do not expect a material impact from the enacted tariffs. Second, we have incorporated conservative estimates for China end market demand for TVs and autos in our strong guidance and outlook for 2019. If Chinese demand is better, there is an opportunity for upside.","In closing, our very strong third quarter results underscores that we are well positioned and on track for the remainder of our full-year strategy and capital allocation framework. We met our goal to expand margins and now expect to exceed $11.3 billion in full-year sales. Strength is expected to continue across Optical Communications, Specialty Materials, Environmental Technologies, and Life Sciences, and we are delivering stable returns in Display.","Other progress on the framework included returning $542 million to shareholders in the third quarter 2018 for a total of $11.4 billion since the framework\u2019s introduction. Putting it all together, we have moved beyond the inflection point. We are now seeing our four-year, $10 billion investment drive growth and extend our leadership. We are rewarding investors by returning more than $12.5 billion, which compounds the benefit of our future growth for long-term shareholders.","With that, let\u2019s move to Q&A. Ann?","Ann Nicholson","Haley, we\u2019re ready for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And that will come from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead. ","Asiya Merchant","Great. Thank you, and congratulations on the strong quarter. If you can just humor me on China. I know it\u2019s a very conservative guidance that you guys have baked already in. But, if you can just talk about how you\u2019re thinking about the macro demand environment there? And not just as it relates to TV but as it relates to optical as well, I think that will diffuse a lot of investors who\u2019ve been very nervous about China demand elasticity and how that plays out for Corning, not just for this year but also into next year?","Wendell Weeks","So, as I said in my comments, I mean what we\u2019ve tried to do -- or what we have done is to incorporate conservative guidance for the China end markets. For example, on TVs. The TV demand unit has actually been strong this year. Retail has been up about 9% on year-over-year basis year-to-date. But, we\u2019re forecasting it to be up only 2% in the fourth quarter as a reflection of a slowdown in the end market. And very similar from a vehicle standpoint where the market has been up about 3% on a year-to-date basis and we\u2019re expecting it to actually be down 3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. From an optical standpoint, of course most of our biggest part of our business in optical is actually outside of China and in particularly in the North America market, and that market has been very strong, and you can see that in our optical results.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Wamsi Mohan","So, you\u2019ve completed almost 11.5 out of your at least $12.5 billion in capital return. And I was wondering if you can give us some sense on how willing you might be to take on incremental debt to continue to return cash to shareholders at a time when it seems like a lot of economic indicators are pointing towards somewhat of a peak in the near term. And how should people think about gross margins, heading into next year? You\u2019ve -- obviously exiting with a lot of momentum over here, 42%, as you had thought at the beginning of the year, you\u2019re delivering on that. And it seems as though that with all the growth records you have heading into 2019 that gross margin should commensurately see a pretty decent step up. Am I thinking about that right?","Tony Tripeny","I think from a gross margin standpoint, we\u2019re obviously pleased that all the investments we made in the first -- in over the last couple of years, are paying off, we\u2019re seeing the additional growth, and we\u2019ve expanded our margins to 42%. And although we\u2019re not giving gross margin guidance for next year, I would expect it to stay somewhere at this level. And that\u2019s what we expect in Q4, and that\u2019s roughly what I would expect in 2019. In terms of leveraging, what we said in the capital allocation framework that we would add $3 billion to $4 billion of debt. And we haven\u2019t added that much upto now. And so, we would expect to continue to be able to lever, because we have such strong operating cash flow, and that certainly we\u2019ll continue to look forward, doing over the next -- as we finish up the capital allocation framework.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Joseph Wolf with Barclays.","Joseph Wolf","Question on just optical and the carrier side of the equation. There\u2019s been some enthusiasm about 5G and how that would be related to optical. Verizon seems to have slowed momentarily. I\u2019m just wondering your sense of the 5G deployments and how that\u2019s -- whether we\u2019ve got momentum going into 2019, how you\u2019re looking at optical outside of the data center.","Wendell Weeks","I would characterize 5G as being in the beginning. We\u2019re just really at the early stages of the deployments of infrastructure needed to have a 5G service level. And some of the first ones you see at different carriers are some of the easier ones. You\u2019re really going to see the demand for our products get stronger and stronger as you have to support for mobility for 5G. That\u2019s also going to take phones being upgraded to 5G. So, we\u2019re just right in the beginning and long, long way to go get that much glass in the ground.","Joseph Wolf ","Thank you. And if could just ask a follow-up on Valor, and you gave a lot of details, which was helpful. Could you just help us understand how -- what these programs mean in terms of are you selling right now? None of this seems to be approved yet. So, what are the customers taking, are they buying? And have you targeted a specific volume of specific drug as you start these programming? I mean, will we see a first win which is pretty big if you get an FDA approval?","Wendell Weeks","Great question. The way this works is you keep going through stages, even before you file with the FDA. And because change is taken so seriously inside of pharmaceutical production unit, so we go through numbers of trials and then collect stability data and analyze what happened, to be active pharmaceutical ingredient after those trials. So, that\u2019s the stage that we have been in as we have sampled Valor across the industry. The phase we are entering into now will be that our customers will bring a full file with all the data that they\u2019ve collected to the FDA and state their intent to use this package when they produce this drug. At that point, they will began to take Valor really across that entire drug that they have submitted because one of the things that Valor does is enable you to increase throughput as well as guarantee patient safety. And so, what the pharmaceutical companies will want to do is get both of those benefits, every time someone is injected with that particular active pharmaceutical ingredient. Does that answer your question, Joseph?","Joseph Wolf","I guess, just from a selection perspective that\u2019s at the customers, are they targeting small things to see how this works or are they targeting a large kind of active ingredient where you could see a very large win early on with the early approval?","Wendell Weeks","You see different approaches from different pharmaceutical companies. Some people are aiming at their pipeline; other people are aiming at transferring all the current drugs. But, everyone is looking at doing it across their large scale of pharmaceutical product set, because the benefits are they want to accrue to their patients and their production facilities where they actually do volumes. So, very few are saying, let\u2019s just try a little. They -- that\u2019s part of the overall process but what they are really looking at is to take their mainline commercial production over to Valor.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.","James Faucette","I wanted to just ask a quick follow-up to a question that has already been asked. Tony, you said that you\u2019re taking a conservative view, particularly on Chinese demand. I\u2019m wondering, as you\u2019ve formulated your guidance and outlook for the December quarter, are the growth rates that you\u2019re looking for now -- have you reduced those from what maybe you have been looking for earlier in the year? And, are you actually seeing any change in demand that is causing you to be conservative, or are you just being conservative, given the headlines? And I guess, a similar follow-up question is, as we come to the end of the capital allocation program, is there a timeframe that we should be looking at for update as to what comes after that? And what are the kind of the key elements that we should be thinking about us to -- that you\u2019ll be weighing as you think about future capital allocation? ","Tony Tripeny","Sure, James. I think, first on the answer on China, we are being conservative based on headline that we see. And the demand has been strong in China, both in terms of our TV business and also the vehicle business upto now, but we see the headlines and that\u2019s why we\u2019re being conservative. And if that demand turns out to be better, there\u2019s opportunity there for upside.","In terms of the framework, I mean clearly, our focus remains on delivering the first four years of that framework. We have more than a year to go. And operationally, we like to deliver on what we say were going to do. And that\u2019s really continues to be our focus. So, at some point next year, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll talk about what\u2019s beyond 2019. I think, the things to keep in mind is that our businesses, especially display are generating very strong operating cash flow, and we expect that to continue and we expect to continue to have multiple large opportunities for growth in all of our market access platforms. And any cash that\u2019s in excess of that, we will continue with our practice of returning it to shareholders. But in terms of the specifics of that, that we\u2019ll cover sometime in 2019.","Operator","Thank you. We will go next to line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.","Samik Chatterjee","I just want to ask on display glass pricing where things have been improving on the lines of how you talked about it or guided to it. Just thinking about the upside risk and the downside risk here. Are you now of the scenario in 2019 where prices could eventually be there like flat year-over-year or even kind of increase year-over-year, and what are kind of the developments that could drive faster progress on that front? And then similarly, on the downside, is capacity additions by your competitors, the things that we need to watch out for as we track or monitor kind of the progress on this front?","Wendell Weeks","I think, in terms of the pricing, the important thing here is that we expect our 2019 price declines to further improve from 2018. Certainly, over a time period, we\u2019d like to see them to continue to improve even more than that. But the important thing here is and I think the news and something that\u2019s different than we said before is we do expect that to improve in 2019. In terms of the downside variables, and I explained why I don\u2019t think there is much risk there, and that has to do with glass supply and demand being balanced, the competitors\u2019 profitability challenges and the need to get returns on going investment. So, I think we feel pretty good about our pricing environment right now. It is the best environment in more than a decade.","Operator","Thank you. We will go next to line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath","Good morning, Wendell. Question for you, just bigger picture on the 3M asset, in my view, it\u2019s a strategic asset for optical business. How is it going in terms of topline, synergies and also on OpEx? And I have a follow-on for Tony.","Wendell Weeks","Thanks for the question. We\u2019re delighted with the acquisition and done even better on revenue synergies than we originally thought. It\u2019s still early on the operations integration. So, we\u2019ve got a lot of work ahead of us on that piece. But, we\u2019re really delighted with both the customer access and the product attributes that we\u2019ve been able to bring in to our overall market access platform. So, still early days, but so far so good.","Vijay Bhagavath","Thanks, Wendell. A quick follow-on for Tony on how should we think of gross margins, heading into next year? You have many manufacturing capacitates getting into the production lines. So, any products and how we should think of gross margins, very helpful.","Tony Tripeny","I think that we\u2019re very happy that we\u2019ve reached the 42% gross margins in the back half of this year. And while we\u2019re not giving 2019 guidance, to think about gross margins in that that range I think is appropriate.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox","Two questions for me. First, following up on that last question. Tony, can you just maybe give us a rough timeline of when some of these expansions sort hit optimal levels from of a utilization rate et cetera? It sounds like the fleet optimization is complete. But, what about the others? And then, secondly, Wendell, can you just talk about, maybe round up the fiber discussion and talk about the data center success a little bit more and maybe where your advancements are having the most impact with those customers?","Tony Tripeny","I think in terms of the capacity ramps, I mean obviously, we\u2019ve been ramping in the third and the fourth quarter, and we continue to expect that to ramp throughout next year. And the good news is that we have committed demand for those capacity ramps. So, we feel good about that.","Wendell Weeks","And on data center, the places where we\u2019re most excited at this moment tend to be as a more and more of the operators are adopting some very high fiber count systems. And then glass, much like the way you used to be thinking about it for the public networks is also breaking into the next layer of those data centers. So, to think about a little like when you went to the public networks, long-haul, to regional, to trail [ph] to home, following that line. We\u2019re seeing that same thing being to happen in these great big mesh networks that are getting built inside these data centers. So, more and more of that architecture is flowing to glass. And the amount of glass required is also going up in terms of fiber account as people try to separate storage from the different processing techniques. And so, you end-up with these big meshes built. And that tends to be really good for glass demand. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. To make that happen, we need a lot of innovations in our connectivity products and how do we manage all that glass. And that\u2019s when we really excited about our product roadmap going forward.","Steven Fox","And just to be clear, Wendell, that\u2019s -- what you just described is sort of in the here and now happening into next year, you are benefiting from those trends?","Wendell Weeks","Yes, we are. The roadmaps that still is part of that we\u2019re going to have to develop to handle this on growing trend to make it even more cost efficient as optics gets closer and closer to those ASICs that are driving the processing, we\u2019re going to have to activate something like our glass knowledge, our ability to handle the optical physics of that and the thermal challenges of that. That\u2019s out in the future. What we\u2019re dealing with right now is the main line of how do we connect that at the current levels that the architectures that are going to.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to line of Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs.","Rod Hall","I\u2019ve got couple of questions. I wanted to start with Specialty Materials. If I look at the second half of the year, the numbers are pretty much in line with what we were modeling, but the seasonality is a lot different than what we were modeling, a lot more weighted back into Q3 than Q4. So, I just wanted to see if you could comment on whether that seasonality is what you would expected back earlier in the year, is a little bit different? How that flowed versus what you\u2019ve been expecting earlier in the year? If it\u2019s just our model is not quite being on track with what actually was going to happen? And then, my second question is, on Chinese automotive glass plant, I know you said it will be operational in 2019. Do you have any idea, when and if you can give us an idea on whether that\u2019s earlier, later in the year? And do you anticipate any tariff impact for the product coming out of that plan? Thanks.","Tony Tripeny","So, in terms of the Specialty Materials, we\u2019re very happy with the results in the third quarter. We said, for the full year, we were going to grow after a very strong 2017 where we were up 25%, and how much that growth was going to be dependent on the adoption of our innovations. And I think it\u2019s very clear now that that adoption has been incredibly strong. The issue always is, is the timing of that adoptions is up to our customers. And it\u2019s hard for us to know at the beginning of the year, how much those adoptions are going to have, and what quarter they are going to happen. So, from a full-year standpoint, we\u2019re in line with what we expected at the beginning of the year. And from a quarterly standpoint, it just always depends on where the customer orders.","Wendell Weeks","So much like you, we have a hard time getting the seasonality right as well. On the automotive interiors piece, that production is in the midst of getting built right now. That ramp is going -- we will start putting production through that in 2019. I don\u2019t want to call exactly the timing at this point in time because it\u2019s a pretty complicated project, and we also are managing as well as supply chain beyond the factory that we\u2019re building. So, if you just give us a little more time and we start making that public of commercial production to that facility, we will be back to you. On tariffs, the products that we\u2019re making and that our customers will incorporate, at this time are not on any tariff list. So, we don\u2019t anticipate that being an issue, if the trade arrangements continue as we understand them at this time.","Operator","Thank you. We will go next to line of Tejas Venkatesh of UBS.","Tejas Venkatesh","Given the panel oversupply, there is some concern out there that some of your customers could convert or perhaps shut down older plans. How should investors think about the impact of this penal supply on Corning?","Wendell Weeks","I think at the end of the day, what really drives our demand is the market and how many people -- how many TVs are sold and what size those TVs are. And as we look at this year, we thought we would be up mid single digits, given both in terms of where the TV unit growth is but most importantly screen size growth. And as we look forward that screen size growth has continued for a number of years and we expect that to continue going forward. So, I think the way people should think about our demand is really driven by the TV market.","Ann Nicholson","We\u2019ve got time for one more question. ","Operator","Thank you. And that will come from the line of Rob Cihra with Guggenheim Partners. ","Rob Cihra","Thanks very much for squeezing me in. Just a question on CapEx model from here with this year trucking slightly more than $2 billion, that\u2019s driven by a lot of unit capacity expansion, which is great, because it\u2019s driven by demand. I mean, any -- I guess you probably don\u2019t want to give an outlook for 2019 budget yet. But, I mean what are you thinking in terms of the puts and takes, and is that $2 billion kind of a new baseline or the demand dependent, just anything you can give us for 2019 as a model? Thanks.","Tony Tripeny","You are right. We don\u2019t want to give guidance for 2019. But recall that our strategy and capital allocation framework said that we would spend between 6 and $7 billion over the full-year period and we still expect to be in that range. ","Ann Nicholson","Thanks, Rob. And thank you all for joining us. Before we close today, I wanted to let everyone know that we will be at the Credit Suisse Technology Media and Telecom Conference on November 27th, and the Barclays Global Technology and Media and Telecommunications Conference on December 6th. We\u2019ll be posting some virtual presentations and webcasts on business topics through the quarter.

It is my pleasure to turn the call over to Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Ann Nicholson","Thank you, Shawn. And good morning, everyone. And welcome to Corning\u2019s third quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.","I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company\u2019s financial reports.","You should also note that we will be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments related to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com.","You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast, we encourage you to follow along. They\u2019re also available on our website for downloading.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Wendell.","Wendell Weeks","Thank you, Ann. And good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported results in line with the early update we released in September. Sales were $3 billion. Net income was $397 million and EPS was $0.44. While challenges unfolded throughout the quarter, our results and expectations are consistent with our September update.","We are not immune to the types of challenges facing us and many other companies this earning season. But I think we are more resilient than at any other time in our history and we are taking actions on the things within our control.","We\u2019re adjusting our cost and capacity, while at the same time maintaining focus on key growth initiatives. We continue to invest in technology and innovate with industry leaders across our markets as we pursue the rich set of opportunities outlined in our 2020 to 2023 Strategy & Growth Framework.","I\u2019d like to share a few other important notes on the quarter. The favorable pricing environment in the display market continued, as third quarter glass prices in Display Technologies were consistent with the second quarter.","Environmental Technologies grew sales 20% year-over-year as the company's gasoline particulate filter solution propelled sales well above the underlying auto industry growth rate.","Specialty Materials and Life Sciences also grew faster than their underlying markets as adoption of Corning's new technology continued.","Of course, we're living in uncertain times. We see it in the headlines about trade disputes, political unrest and China's economy. Amid this uncertainty, you may be wondering why we continue to be confident that we will grow over the next four years. Part of our confidence stems from the relevance of our technology leadership and the tangible customer commitments that support our build projects.","We\u2019re also confident, because we\u2019re not just counting on everybody buying more stuff. Instead, we\u2019re putting more Corning into the products that people already buy. This provides a mechanism for us to grow even when spending in the end market category is down.","There is no clearer example than in automotive. In the third quarter, we grew sales in Environmental 20%, in a market that is expected to be down 3% this year. Our growth is driven by increasing sales of our proprietary gasoline particulate filters, which traps fine particulate and which track fine particulates and help reduce harmful engine emissions. From a financial perspective, GPS increased Corning's opportunity per car by $30.","These types of content place create a path for growth even when underlying unit demand is flat or declining, as our environmental results are demonstrating. We expect to double our sales to the auto industry by 2023. By adding AutoGrade grade interior glass solutions to GPS, we increased our opportunity per car by another $25 to about $70 in total. That\u2019s up almost a factor of five versus just two years ago and additional products will further increase our opportunity.","So we\u2019re not counting on more cars being sold, we\u2019re driving more Corning into each car. In short, a big part of Corning's story over the next four years is a content story. We see it playing out in Mobile, Consumer Electronics, Display, Optical Communications and Life Sciences Vessels, as well as Automotive. Because we\u2019re capturing significant technology substitutions, we have sales drivers beyond just end market growth.","Let\u2019s look at how we advanced our strategy in each market access platform in the third quarter. In Optical Communications, we continue to be impacted by capital spending reductions in both the carrier and enterprise markets. Despite this near term weakness, we are confident in our ability to outperform the passive optical market over time.","As you\u2019ve seen with fiber-to-the-home and corporate data centers, Corning is the unquestioned technology and market leader. We delivered on those opportunities and we are well positioned for the next waves of growth as 5G and hyperscale data centers drive the optical signal closure to the edge.","Our near term goals in Optical Communications are to align cost with demand and to continue advancing our product portfolio through co-innovation. We made progress in both areas during the quarter.","Verizon and Corning are co-innovating and are manufacturing a technology center in Hickory, North Carolina. Engineers from both companies are using Verizon\u2019s 5G ultra-wideband service and Corning's optical fiber and cable innovations to explore the capabilities of 5G in a manufacturing environment.","Our work will demonstrate 5G's ability to revolutionize the way, goods and services are produced, as the technology enhances capabilities like machine learning, augmented reality and virtual reality.","Corning is also co-innovating on the 5G with Intel. We\u2019re making future 5G in building networks scalable and easy to install. Our innovations will allow for faster adoption of 5G features as they are standardized.","Shifting to hyperscale. Corning and Facebook are demonstrating how to meet ever increasing bandwidth demand through Space Division Multiplexing or SDM. Internet content providers like Google and Facebook are making SDM their primary strategy for increasing capacity between their data centers across the globe. In short, this technology boosts the number of fibers in submarine cable and multiplies Corning's opportunity per cable by up to four times.","In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we\u2019re well on our way to doubling sales despite a maturing smartphone market. Apple announced that it is awarding $250 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to Corning. This builds on the $200 million we received from Apple's fund in 2017. Both investments support Corning's state-of-the-art glass processes equipment and materials integral to the delivery of next-generation consumer devices.","In the third quarter we continued to lead the industry as our innovations were adopted on more and more devices. Apple announced phones with the toughest glass ever used on a smartphone and we saw the launch of multiple laptops, convertibles and tablets with Gorilla Glass. Corning continues to win in new device categories with nine wearable launches in quarter three, four featuring Gorilla Glass DX and DX+.","Gorilla Glass DX delivers improved optics while DX+ improved optics while DX+ also provides scratch resistant approaching the finest watches. Both maintained the superior drop performance of Gorilla Glass.","Moving to the automotive market. As I already noted, our goal is to double sales by 2023. In the third quarter, we continued ramping production capacity in Hefei, China to meet committed demand for both our Auto Glass Solutions and our gasoline particulate filter products. We're making great progress, building a $500 million plus GPF business, and we expect over $200 million in 2019 sales.","Our Auto Glass Solutions business continues to build its order book. At next month's Guangzhou Auto Show, the industry's first shaped dual-display module with a single covered glass part will be on display in the GAC Aion LX, an electric vehicle. The module's cover glass is produced using Corning's 3D ColdForm Technology.","In Life Sciences vessels, we have some very exciting news. The FDA has approved Corning Valor Glass for use as a primary packaging for an already marketed drug produced by a leading pharmaceutical company.","This approval makes Valor Glass, the first and only fundamentally new glass composition to be approved by the FDA since the advent of borosilicate glass more than 100 years ago.","This approval also marks a major milestone in our strategy to build a long-term multi-billion dollar franchise and the success provides another step on our journey to create a new higher standard in pharmaceutical glass packaging.","Overall, we continue making good progress with our development partners and interest and engagement with other major pharmaceutical manufacturers continues to grow as well.","In Display, our goal is to stabilize returns. In the near-term, retail demand continues to track to our expectations with TV viewing area growing year-to-date through August. Set makers are purchasing panels more conservatively; apparently due to a macro uncertainty, which drove panel maker utilization reductions in the third quarter. This caused the panel makers to purchase less glass in the third quarter.","We expect this supply chain adjustment to be temporary and for panel maker utilization to increase in the first half of 2020. We remain confident in our long-term strategy, because our growth driver is large-sized TVs, which are most efficiently produced by our customers on Gen 10.5 fabs. Our leadership in Gen 10.5 glass supports medium and longer term volume growth, despite temporary supply chain adjustments.","And we have great news about pricing. We now expect full year glass price declines of a low single-digit percentage compared with our previous guidance of a low to mid-single digit percentage.","You can see that across our markets, OUR strategic investments are well-aligned with major trends and our relationships with industry-leading customers are creating new opportunities. Of course, we understand our current environment and we'll continue to navigate thoughtfully through any headwinds that may arise.","Now let me turn the call over to Tony for more details.","Tony Tripeny","Thank you, Wendell and good morning. In the third quarter, Corning took steps to offset recent market headwinds. In Display Technologies we aligned capacity to demand.","In Optical Communication, we idled capacity and reduced capital spending to reflect our customers near-term infrastructure investment plans. And across the company, we reduced operating expenses to align with near-term sales projections.","While we experienced these headwinds and took steps to offset them, it is important to note that even in these challenging markets we grew sales year-over-year and faster than the underlying markets in Environmental Technologies, Life Sciences and Specialty Materials.","It is also important to note that while we were taking these steps, we continue to advance our long-term growth initiatives, investing in technology and innovating with customers to capture future commercial opportunities.","Now before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the largest difference between our GAAP and core results come from charges related to capacity realignment in Display Technologies and Optical Communications.","Other differences between our GAAP and core results come from a non-cash, mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts and a change in our tax reserves.","With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debts settling in future periods to be marked-to-market and recorded a current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this impacted GAAP earnings in the quarter and quarter three by $72 million.","Now to be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth in our future shareholder distributions.","Our non-GAAP or core results provided additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions.","We\u2019re very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than five years ago.","That brings me to our results and outlook. For the third quarter, sales were $3 billion. Net income was $397 million and EPS was $0.44. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $864 million. As we said in July, we built working capital in the second half. We also said, we expected to reduce working capital in the second half.","Sorry, as I said in July, we built working capital in the first half. We also said we expected to reduce working capital in the second half and we did reduce working capital in Q3 and expect to further reduce it in Q4.","Now let\u2019s look at the detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technologies, third quarter sales were $793 million and net income was $185 million. Net income was down year-over-year, primarily driven by the lower volume. Third quarter volume was down high single-digit sequentially and prices were consistent with the second quarter, both as expected.","Now there is no change in our outlook in terms of volume. Retail demand is tracking to our expectations with TV viewing area growing year-to-date through August and preliminary data for September is also encouraging. The industry, however, remains conservative on inventory and panel maker utilization is expected to stay at current levels in the fourth quarter.","Consequently, we expect our fourth quarter glass volume to be down mid-single digits sequentially. That said, we expect this current supply chain adjustment to be temporary. We expect panel maker utilization to increase in the first half of 2020 over the second half of 2019.","Glass pricing in the fourth quarter continues to be positive. We expect prices to decline only slightly sequentially, which is equivalent to down low-single-digits year-over-year.","For the full year, our volume outlook remains consistent with our September 16th update. We expect our volume to be up slightly year-over-year, which is higher than the glass market driven by the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in Hefei.","In terms of price, our outlook is more favorable than our previous guidance. We are revising our full year price guidance to low single-digit declines from prior expectations of low- to mid-single digit declines and we expect that the favorable pricing environment will continue into 2020.","Now three factors drive our view. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced to demand or even tight. For Corning, we are aligning our capacity with demand. We are also pacing our Gen 10.5 capital projects to align with panel maker's schedules.","Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Glass prices must support acceptable returns on those investments.","In summary, we are experiencing a temporary supply chain correction. However, retail TV viewing area is growing and expected to create more demand for display glass, especially at Gen 10.5. As the leader in Gen 10.5, we expect to capture most of the growth and we expect the favorable pricing environment to continue.","Results in Optical Communications were consistent with our September update. In the third quarter sales were $1 billion and net income was $127 million. Our third quarter sales and net income were down versus last year. These results reflect overall market weakness including the spending decisions of several major carrier customers.","For the full year, we continue to expect sales to decline in the 3% to 5% range as previously guided. We have taken actions to align our cost to our current sales reality including idling capacity, pacing capital projects and reducing operating expenses to align with near term sales projections.","At the same time, we continue to innovate to improve network speed, cost and capacity and to secure long-term agreements with major industry players, sustaining our confidence and our ability to outperform and deliver long-term growth.","In Environmental Technologies, third quarter sales were $397 million up 20% year-over-year and ahead of expectations driven by continued adoption of gasoline particulate filters and strong demand in the heavy duty diesel market. Net income grew 32%, driven by strong operational performance and successful ramping of additional GPS capacity in China.","We are well on our way to building a greater than $500 million gasoline particulate filters business. With a market-leading product, we continue to earn a majority position globally as automakers award platforms to make Euro 6 and China 6 regulations. Sales are accelerating as Euro 6 regulations are in full effect and automakers are preparing for China 6 implementation in 2020.","Our Hefei plant start-up is ahead of schedule and has been key to delivering incremental sales and net income. As a result we continue to expect GPF sales to exceed $200 million in 2019 and to grow robustly thereafter.","Our strong performance is expected to extend into the fourth quarter with sales growth up by a low teen percentage year-over-year.","Given a strong second half we now expect full year sales to be up by a mid-teen percentage compared to our previous guidance of a low teen percentage. In Specialty Materials third quarter sales were $463 million and net income was $92 million. We were pleased with strong sales from our new innovations as Wendell noted.","However, our overall sales growth was muted because our Gorilla Glass shipments in China were lower due to the current trade environment and Advanced Optic sales were down on semiconductor market weakness.","From a profitability standpoint some of our newer innovations start initially at lower margins and could not offset the loss of higher margin Gorilla Glass and AO products. We anticipate these issues will improve over time as the trade situation is resolved the semiconductor market returns to growth and we reduce cost on newer innovations as we come up the learning curve.","For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be approximately flat year-over-year. We expect full year sales growth again despite a smartphone market that is down year-over-year. This growth is driven by adoption of new innovations, including premium cover glass innovative parts products including DX Plus for wearables.","Life Sciences third quarter sales were $256 million up 11% year-over-year. Net income was $41 million, up 37%. For both the fourth quarter and the full year, we expect sales to be at mid-single digits Year-over-year.","In summary, our third quarter performance was impacted by changes in the display and optical markets and we took actions to lower our cost to align with those lower sales. We now expect the full year price decline in display to improve to a low single-digit percentage.","We grew sales in Environmental, Specialty Materials, and Life Sciences year-over-year and faster than their underlying markets and we delivered strategic milestones with Apple's investment and FDA approval of Valor Glass.","Now, let\u2019s turn to the consolidated P&L. Gross margin in the third quarter was 39% as expected. Last quarter we talked about the Gen 10.5 facility and I'd like to give you an update. We continue to make progress coming up the learning curve and improving our low cost in our Gen 10.5 plant which should lead to further improvement in 2020.","We are excited about our Gen 10.5 projects because they enable us to capture the majority of the market growth and will growth and will ultimately provide the step-change in glass manufacturing. For the rest of our P&L, there has been no change in our guidance.","Gross margin is expected to be approximately 39% in the back half. SG&A and RD&E are expected to be just under 14% and approximately 8.5% of sales respectively for the year. And capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $2 billion.","Moving to additional outlook details, we expect other income, other expense to be approximately $260 for the full year. Full year gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $230 million, predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor and we expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 20%.","In closing, we acted quickly in the third quarter to address changing market conditions. We met our revised targets. We continued our actions to advance our long-term growth plans and we remain confident in our strategy.","We are operating on the strong foundation that we built over the last four years and we're making progress in key areas as evidenced by our ongoing customer announcements. This makes us confident in our ability to achieve the objectives we laid out in our 2020 to2023 Strategy & Growth Framework.","With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?","Ann Nicholson","Thanks, Tony. Okay Sean, we\u2019re ready for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Asiya Merchant [ph] Pleases go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning, everyone and congratulations on a well-executed quarter given the macro environment. I just have a quick - two quick questions for both Wendell and Tony. The multiple growth drivers that you talk about, obviously they are coming into play as we talk about Valor and auto interior glass, et cetera. When should we expect Corning to demonstrate like growth margin leverage from these initiatives in your P&L?","And then secondly, just given the macro environment as well and the expect - the revised expectations for 2019 as you announced in September, I mean, should we expect revenue growth for 2020 to sort of come towards your strategic outlook, which was around 6% to 8% revenue growth CAGR? Thank you.","Wendell Weeks","So I think from our gross margins standpoint I mean, clearly, what\u2019s happened to us in gross margin is really all about volume. We have lower volume in the back half than what we were expected and it\u2019s going to take greater volume for us to recover that gross margin. But once that volume occurs then our gross margin is going to increase.","And in terms of these innovations, specifically it depends on when those innovations come, but when they do come, they will come with incremental gross margin favorable gross margin for us.","Tony Tripeny","We could all be on the - it's a really good question and it will be the interaction of - we invest usually with very strong customer commitment and we need to put it in place ahead of the time when the demand comes on stream, and in almost all of our cases we're building bespoke proprietary equipment. So as those plants fill and as we work our way through those learning curves, we\u2019ll see that leverage.","We'll add as we go through the year, next year, put more information for folks that are trying to model all those to try to be helpful on how do we think about these new innovations as they become a bigger and bigger part of our revenue growth story over time. It\u2019s a fair request.","Wendell Weeks","And then in terms of 2020 obviously, we\u2019re not giving guidance for that. But the reason we chose compounded annual growth rates in our Strategy & Growth Framework is that we knew there would be times of economic headwinds like we\u2019re experiencing now when we not likely to have that level of sales growth and there will be times when there's either really great adoption of our technology or economic tailwinds where that will be greater. So you really should think about those objectives just as we intended them to be which is over a four-year period.","Ann Nicholson","Thanks, Asiya. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Peter Zdebski from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Peter Zdebski","Hello. This is Peter on for Tim Long. I wanted to ask about Environmental and the outperformance there. Obviously, GPF [ph] has been doing very well. How should we think about going into 2020 though, the more conventional parts of that business, the heavy duty diesel for example? And then I have a follow-up.","Wendell Weeks","We\u2019re not giving guidance on 2020 on today\u2019s call. But clearly there have been macroeconomic headwinds that have impacted both the automotive market and appeared to beginning to impact the heavy-duty diesel market in North America.","Of course at the same time in China there are new regulations that are going effect on heavy-duty diesel. So you have to factor that in an addition plus the adoption on the GPF continues to grow into 2020 because that\u2019s actually when the regulations become in effect in China.","Peter Zdebski","That's helpful. Thanks. And then just to touch on Optical. It looks like the performance was a little bit better than the low teens that you had guided for. Is that \u2013 are you seeing any kind of nascent strength in the service spend there or you factored that you would point to?","Wendell Weeks","Let me address both optical and then also use it as a bit of an example of the more general forecasting approach. So as you noted in your earlier question, we tend to grow much faster than our underlying markets as customers adopt more of our innovations in their in their products. And this has been true in the Opt Co, Life Sciences, Gorilla and Auto over the last four years where our growth rate has been significantly higher than that of the underlying markets we serve. And that's a good thing.","But it also means that from a forecasting perspective, we need to be right about both the underlying market and the rate of adoption of specific technologies at specific customers in a specific time frame. This can be difficult.","During quarter three, we heard from some key customers that they plan to reduce their spending on our products below their existing run rates and our expectations. We in turn lowered our expectations across those industries and we initiated actions to adjust our cost and capacity accordingly.","Now as we finish the quarter, some customers exceed that assumed take rate and we performed better. That being said, our approach for the remainder of the year is the same and we\u2019re reaffirming our guidance at this time. Is that helpful to you, sir?","Peter Zdebski","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Brian Yun from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Yun","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the Automotive Gorilla Glass opportunity. I saw a recent product announcement kind of highlighting Gorilla Glass Windshield as an option on the new Ford F-150. It sounds like there's going to be multiple new product announcements sort of inline with commercial trucks.","So, my question is, are you seeing an uptick in the exterior glass interest. And if you could just update us on the broader interior automotive glass opportunity, that would be helpful.","Wendell Weeks","Thank you for the question. So the answer is yes. We're continuing to see a momentum building on XT. However, at the same time, the very strong positive upside has been demanding for our new technologies in interior and we\u2019ve been shifting more of our resources because the key to innovation is, you have to go really towards those positive surprises, towards interior.","And we continue to build both our order book and momentum there. We were especially excited about being able to demonstrate our proprietary ColdForm Technology in a commercial offering that I talked about for GAC and we expect to have more momentum there as well. So right now, we're beginning to scale our plant that we just put in place in Hefei, China and we're really excited about our opportunities.","That being said, much like you point out on exterior. The way the car industry works is we will get a nomination well before the sales actually begin. And s sometimes, when you're watching the press, there can be some time delay and delayed gratification in seeing what the customers says, or when we say we\u2019re building our order book, and the time period when that revenue shows up. Did I get to the core of your question?","Brian Yun","Yeah. Absolutely, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question it will come from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Meta Marshall","This is Meta Marshall for James Faucette. James, are you on? Just a question on - it's going to expand upon - you mentioned changing timing to the pacing of additional glass facilities. I just wanted to know if there is anything formal around kind of some of the change in timing there. And then second on the impact of Valor Glass. Just any timing or additional milestones we should expect there?","Wendell Weeks","So I think in terms of the pacing of the Gen 10.5 facilities you really need to go to each of the customers on what they are planning to do, but the important thing is we\u2019re lockstep with them, and we're adjusting dollar pacing and consistent with what they're doing.","Tony Tripeny","And on Valor I would expect us to continue to build momentum we are. The nature of that industry is one where confidentiality agreements abound. And so when we announce it is largely dependent on how on our customers want to handle that topic. They're interesting position because what we have on offer here is a superior packing, from both the patient safety and productivity standpoint, yet at the same time, for a long period of time this new ascendant technology will live side by side with the older technology.","So what our customers have to work through as they manage through their change process in the customers, they don't want to be in a position of sort of which customers get the new technology, which can't be old and how all that works out.","So everyone is better served until such time as we build up enough momentum that we build up enough capacity in a thoughtful way, we're working with regulators and our customers that this can be talked about in a more easy fashion.","Meta Marshall","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from the line of Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is RK on behalf of Rod. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on display. I know you're not giving guidance for 2020, but given this slowness in the second half, can we expect glass volume growth better than the mid-single digit growth you talked about in the past?","And should we think about this recent draw down in inventory as a reset to appropriate levels or our panel markers and that maker's being overly cautious if retail demand continues to hold?","Tony Tripeny","So you\u2019re right. We're not going to give 2020 guidance, but I think the way that you should think about what happens is what\u2019s really happening from a retail demand standpoint, because at the end of the day that\u2019s what's going to drive this market. It's going to drive what's going to drive panel maker utilizations and it's not only just a number of TV sets that are being sold, but the size of those TV sets, and as both Wendell and I said, I mean, we haven't really changed our perspective on the market for the rest of the year for the full year. And in fact, things are coming a little bit better than what we originally expected. But equally maybe even more important than that is what's happening with TV sizes. 65-inch TVs are growing greater than 40% on a year-over-year basis and 75-inch TVs are growing greater than 60% on a year-over-year basis.","So we believe in the fundamental drivers of what's happening in this business and what's really happening right now is caution with the panel makers in the supply chain with the set makers in the supply chain because of all the trade uncertainties and we think that gets itself work through the rest of this year and in the first half of next year volume's going to be better than the back half of this year.","Wendell Weeks","Correct. I think the core of your question is really good in that if you haven\u2019t changed your long-term end market view, as Tony just went through, then as you take a look at supply chain corrections where you grow in some periods, the supply chain grows faster than that end market and some period slower.","So really, you're sort of asking exactly when does that correct and when does that growth rate accelerate. And I think in Tony's answer, you see that we do expect in the first half of 2020 right that to be above that in the back half of 2019.","That being said, sort of the core of what we do is not to try to call sort of specific quarters and specific time periods around supply chain. It is a worthy exercise, but we tend to be focused more on that long-term market and to get our capacity in the appropriate spot to be able to serve our customers.","Unidentified Analyst","That's super helpful. Thanks for that. Could you also comment on visibility in the Optical segment? Any color on thing you expect spending to resume?","Wendell Weeks","Yes. In Optical, here's one of those that's a good example of having grown so much faster than the underlying market. As we entered this year, we would see a number of signals that the end market would be going down. And then - but at the same time, we saw adoption of our new technologies at some specific customers more than offsetting them sort of underlying heartbeat.","And I think this probably led us to being able to believe as long as that continued, we could ride out this temporary dip in the end market for Optical without having much impact on us. That turned out not to be true as some specific customers who are adopting this strong tech changed some of their timing and capital plans.","That being said, though it\u2019s very hard to recall the exact timing by quarter or even by year, we remain more confident than ever that the fundamental drivers for the demand of our technology will become increasingly ascended. IG is going to take the wireless network for being a fiber poor network to a very fiber rich network. Our innovations in hyperscale are going to push that optical signal closer to the edge and use more of our product.","So over the long-term, we see a set of demand that is higher for glass, because densification of networks is occurring that will lead to glassification. And if we do our job well, we will capture our unfair share of that.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes. Thank you. I want to ask a clarification on Display. In your press release you talked about aligning capacity in display to demand. When you - are you primarily just shifting the timing of maintenance of class tanks here.","And if that is the case, wouldn't that automatically mean that as you sort of complete the maintenance and bring those tanks up, you should start to see margins start to recover perhaps as quickly as late this year or early next year?","Wendell Weeks","So let\u2019s separate the two sort of questions. First is what we\u2019re going to do around our capacity matching to demand both in macro and regionally. You are right that our tanks are modular and we always have available to us, that ability to manage the timing of when we bring up tanks. We have other tools that we frame to bear on managing our capacity as well to better match to particular customer demand in particular regions and we will do that.","Overlaying all that though is just sort of the simple driver which is right now the gross margin pressures primarily being driven by volume, right? And as volume comes back as we look to the supply, we should see gross margins also come back and those are interrelated between capacity and demand right, because they just help you on how much leverage you have on that particular number.","But the core of the piece here is I think if you come to a point of view on when you expect the supply chain correction to be done and when we expect volume to come back you will have a good idea of the timing of the improvement in gross margins sir.","Wamsi Mohan","Wendell, just a follow-up on that. Would you say that are there any dynamics now I mean, you've just spoken about this in the past about how Chinese New Year for instance has changed the seasonality. Anything that you see that changes the seasonality this year going from 4Q to 1Q if we just exclude the supply chain-related disruption?","Wendell Weeks","Not really, Wamsi. I mean, I think that from an overall standpoint there is a little bit of standpoint as you go throughout the year. But to build for Chinese New Year's a lot of that building has to happen in the fourth quarter. And so I think it's really \u2013 there is nothing really different I think this year with respect to kind of the end retail market. What is different is - what's happening in the supply chain and obviously going through a temporary supply chain correction in the back half of this year.","Wamsi Mohan","Okay. Thanks, Tony.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question line of Steven Fox of Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox","Thanks. Good morning. Two questions, please. First, Tony on the gross margins. So if I understand correctly the difference between originally doing 40% and then doing 39% in the quarter is volumes, but then when we think ahead to Q4 can you just sort of explain the puts and takes to the flat 39%? I think you still had some quarter-over-quarter volume pressures. Pricing is a little bit better on LCD and then the impact of capacity shifts. And then I have a follow-up.","Tony Tripeny","Steve, you got it exactly. I mean I think it's those things and - we think that the back half gross margin is going to be around 39% and I think you hit on the things that are trade-offs in that calculation.","Steven Fox","And next is in net neutral or help - or how does that play out?","Tony Tripeny","It always - it's essentially a net neutral. I mean, essentially what you are looking at is since we are taking actions and each of the businesses have their own dynamics as it comes to the sales numbers, but fundamentally we think we're in the same place where we were on September 16 which is the back half of 39%.","Steven Fox","Okay. Thanks. And then Wendell just on the Optical. You just made a comment that it's hard to call the timing by quarter even by year. Understanding, obviously, that the construct for more demand is there.","Is there any kind of green shoots or anything you would point to that would give us confidence that maybe you've seen the worst of the cuts for optical and that we could sort of build our models over what we're seeing in the second half or is it still that early and too hard to call? Thanks.","Wendell Weeks","That's an excellent question, Mr. Fox. I think, we're still early. I'd like to work our way through a little more time here and work through some of the changes that we're making to improve our ability to get better acuity on these items. Certainly, we see a lot of green shoots. If green shoots are taking in the form of incredibly strong interest in what it is, we can do in 5G and what it is we can do with hyperscale.","That being said, we also see this as an industry different particular customer, sort of, working their way through their broad strategy their broad financial management challenges because at the core here is an investment strategy that are pretty significant decisions for them. So I\u2019d like to get a little more time before we update you on that point of view if you don't mind, sir.","Steven Fox","No. Appreciate the all the color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from the line of Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Samik Chatterjee","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask relative to the 2020-2023 plan. And you mentioned you're feeling comfortable still about the 6% to 8% revenue growth target that you issued at that Investor Day. Just wanted to ask more relative to the investment plans outlined during -- in the plan of like $10 to $12 billion of investments in growth as well as the $8 billion to $10 billion of returns.","Should we now think of those being a bit more back-end loaded in terms of that time horizon? Or are you still feeling very comfortable in terms of the CapEx trajectory, for example of $6 billion to $8 billion or should we think of them being towards the lower end of that horizon of that time - of that guidance.","And then, if I can just follow-up on the cash flow as well. Can we get some visibility into the cash flow for the fourth quarter given that looks like for the first nine months you\u2019re lower on the operating cash flow by $900 million from last year, and then some offsets here on the lower CapEx? But how should we think about kind of free cash flow outlook for the year?","Tony Tripeny","Okay. In terms of the cash flow, let me start with that question. As I talked about in the July call, our operating cash flow is seasonal. I mean it is lower in the first half of the year and a stronger in the back half of the year.","And what we talked about was the working capital build that we did in the first half of the year and the expectations that both operating cash flow would improve in the third quarter and inventory would come down or working capital would come down.","And that's exactly what happened and that caused us to be positive from a free cash flow standpoint in the third quarter. And we expect that improvement to continue into the fourth quarter as we have further improvements in working capital. So, I think from a full year standpoint, we expect to be positive from a free cash flow standpoint.","In terms of the investments and the way to think about that over a period of time, of course, a lot of those investments is, Jeff described on IR day, really depend on the customer commitments and the timing from a customer commitment standpoint.","But that being said, we're not giving guidance on 2020, but I think given the environment we're in today, capital spending probably isn't going to be as high in 2020. But as you go out over time, it really is driven a lot by what happens from a customer commitment standpoint.","Samik Chatterjee","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from the line of George Notter from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","George Notter","Hi. Thanks, guys. I wanted to ask about the FDA approval with Valor Glass. I guess I'm curious about when you think that might start to generate revenues for you. And then, certainly,","I'm curious about how many other drugs or manufacturers you guys have in the pipeline marching towards FDA approval at this point. So, any color there would be great. Thanks.","Wendell Weeks","So as exciting as this approval is and as necessary. We are still in the beginning of an industry that moves very thoughtfully for very good reason. So, I would say we should keep our expectations low and for the near term not having any significant impact on us. It is very confirmatory for our long-term revenue opportunities and our ability to really bring life-changing innovation to market.","But from a financial modeling standpoint, I will continue to caution and say exercise greater strength at such time as we believe it becomes important to start modelling this end, we will articulate that.","Ann Nicholson","Shawn, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Then our final question is going to come from the line of Tejas Venkatesh from UBS. Please go ahead.","Tejas Venkatesh","Thank you. This is Tejas Venkatesh. Can you talk to the hyperscale spending trends you're seeing? The enterprise portion of Optical, which includes hyperscale, appears to decelerate after growing 30% plus in the first half. So just curious, what you're seeing in the second half? Thank you.","Wendell Weeks","I think we're seeing consistent with some of those external, the various external benchmarks that you're looking at. Our particular dynamics all depend on what you compare to, right.","So if I look, delta to last year, right, we can have a different sort of answer than the total market different because we grew so much faster than the total market, right. So, we can have dynamics that in the near-term, at any given quarter can be a little different than that market.","But over the sweep of time, I think the right way to think about it is, those signals in the external market that you're looking at, they impact us too. And over the sweep of time, we should do better than the overall markets, just to the ascendancy of our technology. Does that answer your question, sir?","Tejas Venkatesh","It does. Thank you so much, Wendell.","Ann Nicholson","Thank you, Tejas and thank you everybody for joining us today. Before we close, I wanted to let you know that, we'll be at the Barclays Global Technology Media and Telecommunications Conference, on December 12 and the Citi 2020 Global Technology and Media and Telecommunications West Coast Conference - West Conference on January 8.","Finally a replay of today's call will be available on our site, starting later this morning. Once again, thank you for joining us. And Shawn, that concludes our call. Please disconnect all lines.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude the conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"5821":["Corning, Inc. (NYSE:GLW) Q3 2015 Earnings Call October 27, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Ann H. S.

Please go ahead.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Roxanne. Good morning. Welcome to Corning's Third Quarter Conference Call. With me today is Wendell Weeks, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.","Before we begin our formal comments, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These remarks involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports.

A reconciliation can be found on our website.","We have slides posting live on her webcast that are accompanying our formal comments, and they will be available on our website later this morning.","Now, I will turn the call over to Wendell.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. I would like to begin by welcoming Tony Tripeny, our new CFO, and Jeff Evenson, our new Chief Strategy Officer. Welcome, Tony and Jeff.","As we reported in this morning's press release, macroeconomic headwinds are affecting our performance in the near term. Our businesses were slowed by the weakening global economy, the unexpected devaluation of the Chinese currency, and the softening in the television and IT retail markets. Consequently, our third quarter results were lower than implied by our first half performance. We expect these headwinds to continue into the fourth quarter.","Now despite these temporary challenges, we like our long-term opportunities. Consumers want bigger screens and more bandwidth and touch everywhere. The demand for cleaner air is accelerated, and our innovation portfolio is rich with opportunities. Given that, I would like to use my time with you today to introduce our new strategy and capital allocation framework. We believe that the framework provides clearer guidelines to define our portfolio and our commitment to excellent capital stewardship. Tony will then review our third quarter results and we'll conclude by taking your questions.","First, it's useful to review our current position. We have delivered outstanding industrial performance. Over the past decade, we've grown sales, NPAT, EPS and operating cash flow at double-digit rates. We've beaten the competition on growth in each of our segments. We've innovated to achieve the lowest cost position in key businesses, and we've created new-to-the-world product categories such as Gorilla Glass, our heavy-duty diesel substrates and filters, and our customized fiber-to-the-home solutions. And as we look forward, our innovation pipeline is full. Taken as a whole, our performance gives us a foundation for sustained cash flow and a tremendous opportunity set.","Our leadership priorities for the next four years are simple. We will focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We expect to deploy more than $20 billion through 2019. We plan to distribute at least $10 billion to our shareholders, which is roughly half our current market cap. We will also invest $10 billion in growth in sustained leadership.","Today, we are announcing the first steps to deliver our plan. Our Board of Directors has increased our share repurchase authorization by $4 billion. We will execute a $1.25 billion accelerated share repurchase program, and we intend to increase our dividend per share by at least 10% annually through 2019.","Now let's turn to how we will focus our portfolio to deliver strong financial performance and capital stewardship. Our framework focuses our portfolio on a set of reinforcing capabilities with strong interconnections. The core of what we do is invent, make, and sell. We create value by inventing category-defining products, using transformative manufacturing platforms and building strong, trust-based relationships with the world's leading customers. That process has served us well not only for the last decade of outstanding industrial performance but for more than 160 years. With our new framework, we're seeking to augment that value creation to a more focused and cohesive portfolio that increases our return on innovation.","A moment ago, I said that we have tremendous opportunities. From a shareholder value perspective, the challenge is to select the right opportunities. We applied both financial and strategic criteria to making our selections. Our financial hurdles include market size, return on invested capital, and sustainability of margins.","Our strategic criteria are about increasing our probability of success and reducing the cost of innovation. We are the best in the world in three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market access platforms. Our probability of success increases as we apply more of these best-in-the-world capabilities. Our cost of innovation declines as we reapply our talent and repurpose our assets. Additionally, by combining multiple capabilities, we create higher and more sustainable competitive barriers.","Focusing our portfolio means that 80% or more of our resources go to opportunities that use at least two of these three columns. Our framework allows us to direct up to 20% of our resources at opportunities that leverage a single capability. But when we do that, the potential payoff must be dramatically higher because we know the chance of success will be lower.","The framework also means that we will consider removing assets falling outside our core capabilities. While we operate these assets well and they return more than their cost of capital, we recognize that others may find them more synergistic, and we will consider transactions that create value for our shareholders. For example, Dow Corning is a great company that lies outside our core focus and we are currently in discussions with Dow regarding a potential transaction.","One of the ways that we maximize our return on innovation is by reapplying our talent and repurposing our manufacturing and market access platforms. Gorilla Glass is a great example. When we developed Gorilla, we reapplied our world-class experts in glass science and optical physics to deliver a new-to-the-world product faster and at lower cost than anyone else in the world could have done.","To manufacture Gorilla, we repurposed fusion assets built for our Display business. That saved us about $800 million in capital, greatly enhancing Gorilla's ROIC. We were able to reuse technology and manufacturing capabilities. However, at the time Gorilla started, we didn't have a mobile consumer electronics market access platform. Our confidence in our ability to win with Gorilla convinced us to build that platform. It was a smart decision. And in the future, we can apply other capabilities, such as precision forming or vapor deposition, to products like Project Phire and 3D shapes that leverage our mobile consumer electronics market access. This gives us the opportunity to further increase our returns on innovation.","Our approach to leveraging our Optical Communications market access platforms demonstrates how combining multiple capabilities creates bigger and more sustainable competitive advantages. Using glass science and optical physics, we have reinvented optical fiber multiple times, dramatically increasing its performance and lowering its cost.","Ceramic science has helped us improve connectors, a critical point of signal loss in communication systems. We use vapor deposition to make fiber, extrusion to make cabling, and precision forming to make connectors. And we are also exploring the use of fusion to make key components for next generation switches and routers. As a result, our Optical Communications customers benefit from all three of our core technologies and all four of our manufacturing and engineering platforms.","Ultimately, we want all of our customers to experience all of our capabilities. Now why is that important? Few competitors can match our expertise in any of our individual focus capabilities. When our products derive value from combinations of capabilities, we build dramatically higher barriers to competition. As a result, we can enjoy market-leading positions and margins.","Over the next several months, we'll be out with investors to share and discuss more examples of how we will apply this framework to Corning's next set of category-defining products. But for now, let's turn to our 2016 to 2019 capital allocation model.","Our plan is to generate more than $20 billion with the majority produced by our growing operating cash flow. We will invest $10 billion of the cash in RD&E, CapEx, and acquisitions. We will distribute at least $10 billion to shareholders. We are committed to annually increase the dividend at a double-digit rate, and we will continue to be opportunistic on share repurchases. As I mentioned earlier, potential transactions may provide upside to shareholder distributions.","So that's our new framework. It reflects the financial and industrial strengths of Corning and our ongoing commitment to create value for shareholders through thoughtful capital stewardship. We deliver value by creating life-changing innovations. We are augmenting our value creation by focusing our portfolio and managing it more cohesively. Along the way, we seek to reward our shareholders with significant and consistent cash distributions.","I'll now turn the call over to Tony, who will review the third quarter and provide guidance.","R. Tony Tripeny - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. I like to begin by highlighting my role in executing our framework over the next four years. As you might expect, my emphasis will be on financial discipline, returns, and ensuring we are good stewards of capital. Specifically, I look for us to deliver strong financial results and investment of returns to manage an efficient balance sheet and to lower our cost of capital over time.","Currently, we use several metrics to evaluate investment returns, including net present value, internal rate of return, and payback period as well as return on invested capital measured after commercialization. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation and focused on lowest cost have enabled our businesses to have excellent ROIC metrics against their respective industries and well above their cost of capital. Going forward, I will continue to emphasize returns, and I expect us to improve our corporate ROIC over the next four years. I look forward to keeping you updated on our financial strength and focus.","Now let's talk about the quarter. As Wendell said, weakening economies, particularly in China, and the stronger dollar impacted our businesses. For example, TV demand is weaker. TV growth in China has slowed. TV demand in Europe, Latin America, and Middle East Africa is softer due to the effect of the stronger dollar on retail prices and continued economic uncertainty. We expect worldwide TV unit sell-through to be down slightly versus last year.","IT and mobile demand is weaker, driven by lack of replacement drivers, the strong dollar, and continued economic uncertainty. We expect the worldwide IT market to be down 10% this year and smartphone sales in China to be flat versus last year.","China's auto and heavy-duty truck production has slowed through the year. China's auto production is now expected to be flat year-over-year, and heavy-duty truck production is down 34% year to date. Finally, the growth rate of China fiber-optic market is half of what it was last year.","Despite these macroeconomic headwinds, we are encouraged by several trends that support our long-term success. We are pleased with the improving pricing environment in Display. The market for cover glass is expected to be up 10% this year, and we are gaining share in China and touch notebooks. We expect to extend our long-term supply agreement with one of our largest LCD customers through 2025, and Optical Communications is expected to deliver another year of double-digit sales growth.","Now let's get into third quarter financials. As a reminder, these are core results. In total, sales in the quarter were $2.5 billion, down 5% versus last year. As expected, the stronger dollar reduced sales in the third quarter by $57 million versus a year ago. Without this impact, core sales would have been down 3%. Sales in the quarter were lower than expected due to lower volume of LCD glass, lower sales of environmental products in China, and lower sales in Optical Communications.","Corporate gross margin was 42%, which is lower than we expected, driven by the sales components I just described. Most of our businesses have a relatively high fixed cost structure. Therefore, decreased sales lower our gross margin as a percent of sales. I will cover the specifics when I talk about each segment.","S&A and RD&E were down versus last quarter and last year in absolute dollars, driven by a compensation accrual adjustment. Net income was down 15% versus last year. One-third of the decline was driven by foreign exchange rates, including the devaluation of the RMB. EPS was $0.34, down 8% versus last year.","Now let's look at the detailed segment results, beginning with Display Technologies. Display sales were $936 million in Q3, down 11% versus last year. Sequentially, third quarter price declines were moderate as expected. We are very pleased that the LCD glass pricing environment has been improving for more than a year.","We expected panel makers to adjust utilizations in the second half in response to the softer end market I already mentioned. But we weren't sure how much would be in Q3 versus Q4. Sell-through data indicates TV and IT demand in many regions was weaker than our expectations entering the quarter. Panel price declines accelerated during the quarter, and panel makers adjusted utilizations, especially small gen sizes, where prices hit cash cost. Therefore, the glass market was flat sequentially in Q3.","At Corning, our volume was down slightly sequentially because of temporary share loss at one of our largest customers due to a contract dispute. The good news is that we have resolved the dispute amicably and expect to extend our long-term supply agreement to 2025 and for our share levels to be in line with the first half of 2015. We also expect to make up the missed volume in the fourth quarter.","Net income was down 15% year-over-year and reflects that the expected year-over-year price declines were only partially offset by volume growth, cost reductions, and synergies from CPM.","Now for Optical Communications. Sales were up 7% versus last year, driven by acquisitions and moderate growth in North America fiber-to-the-home and data centers. Even though we saw growth in carrier sales, it was less than expected in Canada and Asia due to timing delays of certain fiber-to-the-home projects. In addition, we had an enterprise customer adjust inventory.","Net income was up only 1% versus last year, which is lower than we would normally realize with 7% sales growth. We expected more sales in higher margin fiber-to-the-home solutions and maintained cost structures in place to service that demand. In addition to the cost impact, a lower mix of high margin fiber-to-the-home meant a higher percentage of our sales growth came from lower margin businesses, like our newly acquired Korean operation.","In Environmental, Q3 sales were $257 million, down 9% or $25 million versus last year. Foreign exchange drove $14 million of the decline. Soft demand in China drove the remaining decline and the miss versus expectations.","In North America and Europe, we saw solid growth for our light-duty substrates and continued strong demand for heavy-duty diesel products. Profitability was down more than sales, driven mostly by the softer demand in China for both light-duty and heavy-duty products. We recently built capacity for growth in China, which has added extra cost that was not covered during the quarter by demand.","Moving on to Specialty Materials, we are pleased with our Gorilla Glass business. The market for cover glass is expected to be up 10% this year, and we are gaining share in China and touch notebooks. Gorilla Glass volume was up sequentially and consistent with last year's strong Q3, driven by demand at customers ahead of new product launches. We are pleased with the fast adoption rate of Gorilla Glass 4 by our customers and its favorable impact on our average selling price.","Overall segment sales were down 12% versus last year. Advanced Optics year-over-year sales remained weak, driven by softness at our semiconductor customers. Year-to-date, AO sales are down almost 20%. Segment net income was down 17% mainly due to the lower sales in Advanced Optics.","In Life Sciences, Q3 sales were $211 million. Both sales and net income were down slightly year-over-year driven by foreign exchange. Net income would have increased mid-teens without the impact of the exchange rates.","Equity earnings from Dow Corning were $53 million. This is down 22% versus last year due to the absence of a one-time tax benefit recorded in Q3 2014 and the impact of the slowing Chinese economy.","Let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We delivered free cash flow in the quarter of $566 million. Our pace of capital spending was down in Q3, and we now expect to spend approximately $1.3 billion for the full year.","During the quarter, we spent $827 million on share repurchases. This sequential 32% increase reflects our view that given the company's current performance and future outlook, Corning shares are a very attractive investment opportunity.","As Wendell mentioned, the board has increased our share repurchase authorization by $4 billion as part of our plan to return greater than $10 billion to shareholders over the next four years. We will be in the market repurchasing shares both programmatically and opportunistically over this time period. We will execute on a $1.25 billion accelerated share repurchase program during the quarter. We ended the quarter with $5 billion of cash, with approximately $2 billion in United States.","Now for the outlook. We expect the global economic headwinds to persist in the fourth quarter and impact most of our businesses year-over-year.","Let's begin our business outlook with the Display market. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we see continued softness in both TV and IT markets. This impacts full year retail growth and supply chain inventory. Given the lower end market and the level of inventory at set makers, we expect panel makers to further reduce utilization rates in Q4 and likely into Q1. Our timing on how quickly panel makers reduce utilization could be off and depends on how rapidly panel prices decline. Lower utilization will help drive down absolute inventory during the stronger retail season.","Now for the LCD glass industry in the fourth quarter, we expect glass market volume to be down low single digits sequentially and our sales volume to be down only slightly, because we believe we will make up the Q3 share loss at one of our largest customers due to favorable resolution of the contract dispute.","In July, we told investors we had levers to control our capacity to demand. We are keeping our capacity offline to match supply to demand by leaving tanks down after repairs and by allocating capacity for development trials. With the lower panel maker utilizations in Q4 likely to continue into Q1, we will manage the startup of tanks down for scheduled repairs to match Q1 supply to demand. We expect glass market supply and demand to remain balanced as we will continue to control our capacity to our demand. Other glass suppliers have said publicly that they have levers to take similar actions.","And finally, I will outline our expectations for LCD glass prices. We expect price declines to further moderate in the fourth quarter. This expectation is based on the customer input we have already received about the prices offered by other suppliers for this quarter.","Recall that under some of our contracts, our price movement at the customer depends on price movements that were made by comparable suppliers at that customer. These price movements by these suppliers at these customers define the price movement for a substantial portion of our sales. For Q4, because we've already been told how these other suppliers' prices moved, we are confident that our overall price decline will be even less in Q4 than it was in Q3. Additionally, we do not expect that our Q4 pricing will be affected by customers moving from thick to thin.","We do not expect our pricing to be significantly affected by the weaker than anticipated glass demand. Glass price declines have been below historic levels for the last 12 months. As we have previously explained, we expect this more favorable pricing environment to continue and maybe even improve for several reasons.","First, the financial situation at our competitors indicate that they cannot continue historical price declines and remain profitable. Second, the significant weakening of the Japanese yen has in itself given our customers a significant economic benefit without any decline in the yen price of our glass. And third, as we said before, we believe that glass supply and demand will remain balanced throughout this recent weakening in panel demand. For these and other reasons, we continue to believe that our quarter-over-quarter price comparison will be better for us going forward than they have been in the past. However, as we explained, our glass price movements depend in large part on what is decided between some of our customers and our competitors.","So to summarize Display, we expect our volume in Q4 and likely into Q1 2016 to reflect the weaker retail market and we will manage our supply to demand. We expect the improved pricing environment to continue. We do not believe that the current economic environment reflects any fundamental change to the longer-term drivers of TV demand. We continue to expect excellent long-term demand, driven by the replacement of older sets and technology innovations such as 4K TV.","Moving to Optical Communications, for the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be up low to mid-single digits versus last year as certain project delays continue. We expect projects to be on track next year. Looking at the full year 2015, we expect another strong growth year with sales up 10% or low teens if you exclude the impact of the stronger dollar. These results are further confirmation of our fundamental growth outlook for our Optical Communications business over the next several years.","Turning to Environmental, we expect sales to be down mid-single digits year-over-year, driven by the weaker euro and continued softness in China. In Specialty Materials, we expect Gorilla Glass volume to be down about 10% sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting the differences in new product launch timing and supply chain builds at major brands versus last year. We expect Gorilla Glass 4 to be a significant portion of glass volume in the quarter. We are pleased with the performance of Gorilla Glass and expect double-digit profit growth this year.","While Advanced Optics sales are improving sequentially, we expect continued weakness on a year-over-year basis. Overall, we expect total segment sales to be down low teens year-over-year.","In Life Sciences, we expect sales to be down mid-single digits versus last year, driven by the weaker euro. Without the foreign exchange impact, sales are expected to be consistent with Q4 of last year.","Now continuing with the rest of fourth quarter forecast. We expect Q4 equity earnings from Dow Corning to be approximately $80 million. This is up from Q3 due to polysilicon customers meeting annual contract obligations. We expect gross margin to be approximately 42%, consistent with last quarter. This is approximately 1.5 points lower than Q4 last year. As a reminder, corporate gross margin is really an average of five separate businesses.","In Q4, Display is lower as a percent of the total company, which will impact the corporate average gross margin, but Display's business percent gross margin is consistent with last year's Q4.","Other drivers of the decline are in Optical and Environmental where we have cost structures in place for expected growth. And as I just said, softness in demand is continuing in Q4. We do expect these businesses to grow in 2016, and if they don't, we have levers to adjust costs. SG&A and RD&E spending will be approximately 14% and 8% of sales, respectively. We expect other income other expense to be a net expense of approximately $50 million, and we expect our effective tax rate for 2015 to be in the range of 16% to 17%.","That concludes our outlook for the fourth quarter. Now I will hand the call over to Wendell to summarize before we go to Q&A.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Tony. To sum up, economic headwinds are impacting our business, but our strong opportunity set, the more stable LCD pricing environment, and our ability to generate cash even in a challenging economy provide a foundation for continued outstanding industrial performance. As we focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength, we expect to build on our best-in-the-world capability to deliver growth and significant sustained cash distributions to our shareholders. Our framework, intent to increase the dividend at a double-digit rate and accelerated share repurchase program, are important steps in our four-year plan. Over the next several months, we will be out with investors to share more details, and we really look forward to the dialogue. Ann?","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Tony and Wendell. Operator, we will now open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to kick off with a question about the capital program and specifically the $10 billion beyond the capital returns, so the $10 billion that you're going to invest in the business. Wendell, I know you lined out the three core technologies for manufacturing engineering platforms by market access platforms that you're going to be investing in, but can give us any more detail on how that $10 billion or maybe a little less than $10 billion will be deployed against what strategic initiatives? And then any other sort of background on this strategic thinking change and how it developed and so on would be helpful. Thanks. And I have one follow-up.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thanks for the question, Rod. I will deal with the first one first, second, second. As far as sharing how we'll deploy the $10 billion that we are going to invest in our growth and sustained leadership, we will be sharing more in the future about how we think about that allocation towards which of the various platforms we're going to be leaning. But we'd like to do that as we engage with folks like you and our investors over the coming months. There will be pieces of it which are still in stealth that we won't be able to share, but we will be able to give you a pretty good idea of where you can expect to see us place our emphasis.","Now to why now really is your question. So really it's three things that are leading us to discuss this at this point in time. The first is, as you know, we have a pretty strong engineering and scientific culture here. And what that means is that we have hypothesis and we test them with control. So the core of the hypothesis here is that we can increase our return on innovation through focus on our three, four, five plan. We have been running experiments to prove that hypothesis. And that also takes a control. And so we have been looking side by side. We've analyzed the data. And what we are able to conclude is that we do see a much higher return on innovation when we use the portfolio as we just described. That increasing productivity of the portfolio helps get at the next two items.","The second reason that we're talking about it today is that we had to be confident that we could sustain our cash flows even in a time when the economy wasn't going our way. And we're really confident that we can do that, Rod.","And then, finally and perhaps most importantly, when you focus a portfolio, you have to be really sure that there is enough opportunity sets in that portfolio to generate a lot of growth. And where we are right now is very confident in that. The amount of pull from our customer base that makes use of our three, four, five capability sets is quite high. So really, those are the three reasons you are hearing from us today. We've run the experiments, the data's in, the probability of success goes up, cost of innovation goes down, and our competitive advantages go up when we apply it. We're confident we can sustain our cash flow even in times of economic uncertainty, and our opportunity set is big enough that we can benefit from focusing.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Wendell. And then my follow-up was on Display, I mean, a little more short term. Those numbers were actually better than we expected, maybe we were too pessimistic. But I wanted to just see if internally the Display results in Q3 were better than you guys were anticipating. And also if you could comment on how 4K demand is going at this stage, I would appreciate that. Thanks.","R. Tony Tripeny - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","All right. So, Rod, no, these numbers actually were a little bit worse than what we had expected. When we began the quarter, we thought volumes would be up sequentially, and they weren't. Now some of that, of course, was the contract dispute that I talked about. But the rest of it was panel maker utilization went down a little bit more than we expected, and the reason it did was our expectations for the end market came down during the quarter. And those expectations came down as evidence came in that TV demand was going to be lower for the full year than we thought it was going to be, and that was also true from an IT demand standpoint. I think in the call last time we talked about how we could be wrong on this and it could come down further in Q3, and that's actually what happened than what we originally anticipated.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And 4K?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","So 4K continues to track in a way that we like. And now, actually where we're starting to turn a hunk of our focus is what version of 4K can create the most compelling package for our customers. And that is with the add of quantum dot technology as well. But we're really liking the way these sets are looking, the improvements in them from a performance standpoint. It's still too early to call the bend in the curve, right, where it's going to drive replacement cycles. And we've got an awful lot of noise in the marketplace with the really strong dollar, sort of the economic headwinds. So the data just isn't screaming at us yet that we've got that driving replacement cycle feature. But, gosh, you can't help but look at these things technically and really like what you're seeing.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. And thank you for the focus on shareholders being stewards of capital. When I look at the step function jump in cash returns in a tougher macro environment, is part of the framework to get that returns on innovation potentially consolidating cash generating businesses and focusing on higher improved ROIC? For example, if I look at what Corning has done in Display glass, going after both maintaining share and then seeing a lift in industry profits, is that the framework we should see in the other segments such as Telecom and diesel, for example? That will be helpful.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","I think the short version is, yes, you're going to see us use that type of tool. Especially in Telecom, we think we have a lot of potential leverage that looks just like that. So that is one of the things we are going to do as we deploy that $10 billion.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. And when we consider potential asset sales, how should we frame the tax implications considering the JV, I think, began before most of us were born? Is there a large capital gains tax that we should consider? And would there be major depreciation recapture involved as well? So maybe the framework as you potentially divest some assets that began a long time ago.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","So, Mark, first, thank you for not making me feel old today. Usually I feel a little bit old, but you're right, we've got some stuff that we started before I was born, which is like nice. All I do is work with young people these days. So I normally feel old. But anyway, I digress.","So as far as Dow Corning goes, we're not going to discuss any further than that we have a potential transaction under discussion with our good friends at Dow.","Shifting gears and talking about transactions in general, and what happens to our out-of-focus assets. So our out-of-focus assets, as I said, we're running them pretty well and they're generating higher than their cost of capital in terms of returns, but we think that some of these assets may offer more synergy to others. If we can realize that synergy, including any friction costs that may be involved one way or the other for our shareholders, those are the transactions we're willing to consider. As you take a look at the overall framework of being able to deploy $20 billion, right, and investing in our growth and back to our shareholders, any transactions in any of the areas we're talking about represent upside to that deployment. So thanks, Mark, for making me feel younger.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. One last question. If we look at the cost of debt, which is at low levels at the moment, any thoughts on the framework for adding more debt to the balance sheet considering that you'd still want to maintain your credit rating?","R. Tony Tripeny - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So clearly, I think over the next three or four years, we will be adding debt to the balance sheet. We're not prepared now to talk about what the timing of that is in terms of when we need to do it. Right now, we have good cash balances, $5 billion including $2 billion offshore. And so we're currently working to try to determine what that is. But keep in mind that our objective is to have debt balances of 2x our EBITDA, and over the next few years we will be putting debt on to do that.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. Thank you and good luck.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, thanks. Good morning. A bigger picture question for you, Wendell, which is what gets you impatient about the business? Are there any areas or parts of the business that you'd like to see progress quicker or in a different way than you're seeing now? It would be very helpful to hear your points. And then a quick follow-on for Tony.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well, the short answer to your first question is, yes, there are many things that make me feel impatient, right, about making progress. But in general, I think the most significant source of frustration these days is that as we use our three, four, five plan, right, and we apply our core technology sets in our manufacturing and engineering platforms and our market access platforms, when we try to introduce a new product to a customer who knows us well in other areas, sometimes we forget that different industries move at different speeds. So not everything moves like tech, not everything moves like consumer electronics and mobile consumer electronics. Matter of fact, few things do. So for instance, it is frustrating how long it's taking us to get widespread adoption of lightweight glazing in automotive. It's a heck of a good idea, good for consumers, it's good for the environment, it's good for safety, it's good for almost everything. But the industry, even when you're a highly-valued supplier, as we are, it just takes time. So I think the degree of speed with which our innovation can make a difference to our top line's a little frustrating.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, excellent. And then a quick follow-on for Tony. Give us kind of your view on where do you see the acquisition strategy trending? Any particular product areas, technologies, market transitions? Thanks.","R. Tony Tripeny - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Thanks, Vijay. I think Wendell said before that we feel like there's big opportunities in the Optical Communications business, both with our internal growth opportunities and applying our three, four, five strategy, but also from an acquisition standpoint. And I would expect that most of our focus, as we go forward the next couple of years from M&A, would be looking in the Optical Communications area. We think we can generate good synergies there. We've got a big powerhouse machine that's there today with $3 billion of sales.","And I think it gives us really good opportunities to bring in companies and make them better. We've done three acquisitions this year. And in those acquisitions, we're really happy with our results. And we've been able to prove out, I think, our ability to really drive value with those acquisitions. So I'd expect more of the same.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Doug Clark with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Douglas Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to touch on LCD glass pricing a little bit. I understand kind of the three key points that you make about why glass prices could remain stable. On the other side of that and what isn't addressed is kind of the panel maker dynamic, especially as their profit margins continue to erode. Do you see that as a possible area of pressure on your glass pricing going forward to the extent that demand doesn't firm up and remain soft?","R. Tony Tripeny - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","For sure, we think that that's always a possibility and that that could put pricing pressure on us. But I think what we really expect to see is as those panel makers go closer to cash costs that they will cut back their utilizations. We saw that in the third quarter in the small gen sizes, and we think we'll see that over the next couple quarters in the larger gen sizes.","And so the reason that we're confident are the three things that I talked about relative to the financial situation with our competitors, the benefit that has happened with the significant weakening of the Japanese yen, and then our ability to keep glass supply and demand balanced by taking capacity offline.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","But it's an excellent question, Doug. I mean, as our display maker customers hit the \u2013 they never make a lot of money. But as they hit pain, I mean, they will increase the pressure. And then the question's going to be what do our competitors choose to do and do the factors that Tony's laid out, which is as they're basically approaching breakeven in one of them and the others profit is greatly reduced, how do they react to that pressure given that the display makers are on the opposite side of the yen, too, and have gotten that tremendous benefit.","So you're on the right question, how that dynamic plays out in the coming quarters is important. I think the good news is, what you heard from Tony was, in this next quarter, we expect our Display pricing to moderate further than it did in quarter three. And the profitability problem is already upon the display makers. So that's encouraging data, Doug, encouraging data.","Douglas Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Right. No, that makes a lot of sense. That's very helpful. Thanks. One follow-up to that, more on the volume side. I think last quarter you talked about inventories coming down by about two weeks by the end of the year. Wondering if you can give us an update on where supply chain inventories are. And to the extent that panel makers cut utilizations between 4Q and 1Q, do you think it will be skewed more towards one or the other quarter?","R. Tony Tripeny - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So, right now, our expectations is that there will be some decline in Q4, but it's \u2013 we expect that softness is likely to continue into Q1. Part of that is, is that we do know that some panel makers are bringing on capacity in China and we think that that has an impact. Of course, we don't know for sure. We were wrong in our last quarter conference call on how much was going to be in Q3 versus Q4. And, of course, we could be wrong here.","We do think that that is what is going to be necessary to get the supply chain inventories at a healthy level. Clearly, since demand is less than what we thought last quarter, even though inventories are going to go down in the fourth quarter, that inventory level at the end of the fourth quarter is a little bit higher than what we would have projected last quarter. And we expect that to bleed off in the first quarter.","Douglas Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Joseph Wolf with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. I just wanted to start \u2013 you've given a lot of detail on the capital deployment, but I'm \u2013 and you mentioned investor input. I'm wondering if you're having some sort of internal, I don't know if we call it a contest with the engineers that you mentioned to go after that capital for projects that they're looking at. And also any pace of the deployment that you're thinking about in terms of over the entire four years or could we wake up one morning and that you've decided to spend half of that on one very specific and targeted project with a lot of growth opportunity?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Great questions, Joseph. So I think you should think of the deployment as fitting our culture, which is \u2013 and the way our innovation model works. When you do materials science, when you dig stuff out of the ground or take gases and end up converting them into highly engineered components, that takes time. Since that takes time, the bad news is, is that things don't turn overnight your way. The good news is that things tend not to sneak up on you. So I think you can expect some pretty steady behavior on us. And as we go out and talk to investors, we will give clear indications on here's where our tendency is going to be as far as where we're going to invest that $10 billion and we'll give you a good feel for rough ideas of timing and how that plays.","The big thing that we're picking up here with this focused portfolio is increased productivity. And that increased productivity is what's behind our ability to give more to shareholders. So if you were to take a look out over the last 10 years, right, about 30% of the funds we had available we were able to give to shareholders either in the form of dividend or share repurchase. As we look forward over this next four years, because of that increased productivity, we're looking at an ability to do about 50% over that time period. And that will be a steady effort, and that's the way you should expect us to behave. Did that answer your question?","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. No, that was very helpful. Just a follow-up on the Environmental business. If you think about \u2013 if you had a view \u2013 maybe if I had a view or one had a view on the trucking business globally, how would you expect the business to go in terms of the way trucks are moving? Could they be more negative than you based on that viewpoint? Or is there growth in the Environmental business independent of growth in trucks, especially the heavy-duty or long haul trucking?","R. Tony Tripeny - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I think growth in the Environmental business in total, of course, is going to be driven by both what happens with trucks and light-duty vehicles. And on a global basis, as long as total production for light-duty vehicles increase, you'll see some growth in the Environmental business. And, of course, pollution regulations make a big impact on that business, too. I think from the heavy-duty diesel standpoint, we've seen strong growth in North America over the last couple of years, some of it economically driven, some of it regulation driven. In Europe, the regulations in particular caused nice growth in 2014.","I think what we are faced with right now in 2015 in China is just that the truck production is down significantly compared to what it had run at actually over the last six years, and down about 34% on a year-to-date basis. In that, from a very specific to China impact is \u2013 impacting us both from a revenue standpoint but also from a cost standpoint because we obviously put cost in place to be able to manufacture to meet that demand. And until those sales turn around, along with the improving regulatory environment there, I mean, that's really what we're looking for in 2016. We think there'll be some improvement in 2016, but we're still waiting to see. We certainly don't think that'll improve much in Q4.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","From the most macro standpoint, it's not the amount of trucks that are bought in the world. That we don't need to grow. What we need is more compliant trucks. And then same thing with cars, even though cars continue to expand and grow very nicely, right? For our automotive \u2013 our Environmental business, it is driven by compliance. So the tighter air requirements get, the more of our components get used and as new countries come onboard to clean up their air, that's what adds the big sort of swaths of demand. But it's really excellent question.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Operator, we've got time for maybe one or two more calls.","Operator","All right. So the next question then is from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just the first question on the new plan. I guess, when I think about sort of the three, four, five that you laid out, I guess, the three and the four have typically outperformed historically for Corning, but the five has been the one where timing the products to market, et cetera, has been problematic. Under the new focus, can you just discuss how maybe getting products to market or matching your customers or end market needs gets better and timing more predictable? And then I had a quick follow-up.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think in a way, we tend to be \u2013 the timing piece for us, by and large, it's possible to miss timing on both ends, right? But where we tend to miss timing is we're ready earlier than our customers which, I guess, beats the heck out of the other (1:01:05), right? So that can lead us to have capacity out ahead of demand. That can lead us to have innovations ready before our customers need to pull them. And it's been one of the lovely things about mobile consumer electronics is it's almost impossible to be faster than those guys.","So we continue to work on how do we get better at picking these inflection points, and actually I commented that Jeff Evenson, our new Chief Strategic Officer, is here today. A big part of his new role is to work on exactly that and how do we get a little better at understanding not only the timing basis for our innovation sets, but also when our potential inflection points in our market sets and how should that impact the timing of our capacity decisions. I think you're quite right to note it is an area where we can improve. Hopefully more to come on that topic.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks. And then just a very quick follow-up. So if we think about the out-of-focus portfolio, is it safe to assume, then, that it is roughly maybe 20% of your profits today? Or is that a level of detail?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","I wouldn't make assumptions or speculate today on that matter, though I do understand why you are trying to.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks. Thanks for your understanding.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Okay. One last question, Roxanne.","Operator","And that last question comes from Patrick Newton with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, Wendell, Tony, Jeff and Ann. Thanks for sneaking me in here. I guess, on the shareholder return or capital allocation framework that you've talked about, one clarification and one question. On the clarification and I think, Wendell, you alluded to this, but is any potential transaction with Dow Corning baked into this current outlook through 2019 or would it be additive to the current outlook? And then, I guess, for Tony, on the global cash use being reduced to about $2 billion, is that going to be focused on acquisition efforts for international targets? Or is it a repatriation part of your strategy? And then I have a follow-up.","R. Tony Tripeny - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No. I think on the first question, any potential transactions, we're not going to talk any more about Dow Corning, but any potential transactions are additive to that number. I mean, what we have very clearly stated is, is that we believe we can deliver more than $10 billion back to shareholders based on our current plans. And anything on top of that from a transaction standpoint would be additive to that. And our bias right now based on what we know would be to have those transactions be additive. But the bottom line is it's additive.","In terms of the cash amount on the $2 billion, I mean, I think, clearly, it's our belief that $2 billion is an adequate amount to have from a company standpoint given our cash flow generations. And as a reminder, our goal is to have 2x EBITDA in debt. And our plan is to have that $2 billion reduce that cash over the next couple of years. In terms of where that cash is actually located, it will depend a lot depending on where our taxing policy is in the United States as we can always add the debt in the United States and keep the cash offshore, if that makes sense.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","No, that's helpful. I guess, as a follow-up, I really want to dive into gross margin given some of your commentary. I think in the near term, you're talking about fixed cost absorption as what is pressuring the metric in the September quarter results and then in the December quarter guidance. But if I step back and I look at your gross profit since 2010 and arguably when Display started to mature, it's been on a negative trajectory. It increased in 2014 due to the consolidation of SCP. And now as you're lapping that on a \u2013 it seems to be redecelerating. I guess, is this \u2013 structurally, how should we think about your gross margin profile perhaps over the next five years or during your capital allocation framework time period, from this 42% level, do you anticipate it will have positive trajectory or will it be sustainable or further pressure?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yes. We do think we're going to have a positive trajectory. I mean, where we are right now, as I explained before, is driven really by a few things. The first item is in our Display business. In the third quarter, our volume was a little bit less than what we expected, and that negatively impacted our cost. But we can take cost out and reduce capacity to meet market demand. We are doing that. And in the fourth quarter, our gross margins are actually consistent in the fourth quarter of 2015 as they were in the fourth quarter of 2014.","So the real issues are in Environmental and Optical Communications. And in both those businesses, we put capacity in place for new businesses that isn't showing up today. We expect those businesses to show up in 2016. For some reason they don't show up, we certainly will take the cost down. But the whole purpose of this framework and the integration of this is partly to drive us to the lowest cost producer, and that definitely helps us from a gross margin standpoint. So I think over time, right now, we're certainly having seen some gross margin compression as our sales are going down. But as our sales return, we'd expect gross margins to expand.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Good luck.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Patrick, and thank you, everyone. Just as a reminder, the slides are posted on our IR webpage for your reference.

Please go ahead.","Ann Nicholson","Thank you, Tom and good morning. Welcome to Corning's second quarter conference call. With me today is Jim Flaws, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin our formal comments, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These remarks involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's SEC report. You should also note that this presentation contains a number of non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation can be found on our Web site.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Flaws","Thanks Ann and good morning everyone.","We are at the halfway mark for the year and as I think about where we have been and what lies ahead of us, I\u2019ll note that we have accomplished a great deal already and we are poised to deliver a full year of strong earnings growth.","I'm delighted with our core performance results and the momentum we have created entering the second half. We told you in February that we had four key items in our formula for success in 2014. They were number one, to continue the positive momentum in display technologies; number two to integrate Corning precision materials and execute on our synergy plan. Number three, the gross sales and profits of other segments and number four, to return cash to shareholders. Reflecting on these now, we are mostly on track and even where we are not, there are some improving trends.","In Display, the end market retail is on track and we are seeing excellent volume in cost performance. We are recovering from the product issue that we had and most importantly pricing is moderating after the speed bump in Q1.","Our CPM integration is going well and we think the synergies will come earlier than our plan that we shared with you last October. And in our other segments, we are seeing excellent growth in environmental optical communications actually stronger than our plan. Our only disappointment is the slower growth in the cover glass market and I will speak in more detail on this in our outlook. And finally, we are executing on the cash to shareholder goal through our repurchase program.","So now, let's get to the second quarter results. In the second quarter, we had our seventh consecutive quarter of core earnings growth with earnings per share up 16% versus last year. Also in the quarter, we attained more moderate price declines for LCD glass in the upcoming third quarter, actually returning to the rates we had experienced for most of 2013.","We also grew the company's core sales with optical communications environmental exceeding expectations and maintain strong control of operating expense and we continued repurchasing shares totaling approximately $200 million during the quarter.","So let's delve into the second quarter details. As a remainder, we are providing core performance results in order to exclude non-performance related items and increase the transparency of our operating results. Our financial measures are non-GAAP and we continue to report our GAAP results. You can find detailed reconciliations on our Web site, outlining the differences between these non-GAAP measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measure.","Second quarter sales were $2.6 billion up 28% versus last year a new record driven largely by the consolidation of CPM sales. Gross margin was 45%; it was up year-over-year and sequentially, but slightly lower than our original expectation of 46%. This was mainly due to lower Gorilla Glass sales versus our expectations.","SG&A and R&D spending were higher year-over-year in absolute dollars driven primarily by the consolidation of CPM, but lower as a percentage of sales. Gross equity earnings of $58 million were down 66% year-over-year, but that's primarily driven by eliminating the equity earnings of SEP following the acquisition. Dow Corning equity earnings are up 17% year-over-year and we'll have some more detail on that in a minute.","Our effective tax rate was 17% lower than quarter one driven by the mix of sales by country and their deferring effective tax rates. Earnings per share were $0.37 up $0.05 over a year ago and essentially in line with expectations.","During the quarter, we completed the announced $1.25 billion accelerated stock repurchase and also bought approximately $200 million of shares on the open market. We have approximately $400 million remaining on our current program and expect to continue share repurchases in Q3.","Now, let's look at the detailed segment results and I will begin with Display. Display sales were $1.1 billion in Q2, a 62% increase versus last year driven by the additional sales from our now consolidated operations in Korea, Corning Precision Materials.","Q2 price declines were less than Q1 as we had expected. The LCD glass market was up in the high single digit sequentially exceeding our expectations for the quarter driven by better expected sales for the World Cup. Now, we believe this demand may have pulled in some television units from the back half of the year, so we have not made any changes to our TV unit sales forecast for the full year at this time. However, we are raising our TV screen size forecast.","Our volume in the second quarter edged up into the low teens sequentially. Volume growth outpaced market growth as we recovered share at the one customer in Korea. We call our Q1 volume growth was softer than the market growth driven mainly by the technical issue with our product at one customer in Korea. We have significantly improved performance in Q2 and have begun to recover share at this account. Additionally share growth is expected at this account in Q3. We continue to expect our full year volume growth to be inline with market growth and our worldwide share remains stable year-over-year.","Gross equity earnings from the equity venture in Korea, SCG were immaterial. Gross margins improved in display driven by the CPM consolidation. Net income was up 9% year-over-year reflecting the impact of the additional sales and earnings from CPM.","We believe the supply chain inventory is healthy, Q2 we saw supply chain inventory increase by approximately 1 week sequentially as the industry begins the pipeline built for second half sales. On a forward looking basis weeks of inventory exiting Q2 of 2014 are at the same level as Q2 of 2013.","Additionally, panel prices continue to be stable or increasing. The strong indicator that supply chain inventory is healthy. As we exit Q3, we would expect inventory decline to less than 17 weeks on a forward looking basis.","In our optical communication segment, Q2 sales were $686 million up 14% versus last year and better than we had expected. Sales for fiber-to-home solutions were stronger than expected in North America and EMEA, all businesses and regions contributed year-over-year, the sequential growth with the exception of fiber sales in China. Net income was up 5% versus last year lower than sales growth primarily due to year-over-year price declines.","In Environmental, Q2 sales were $285 million up 25% versus last year and better than expected. Total diesel sales were up 38% as new regulations in China and Europe as well as strong truck builds in North America drove strong heavy duty diesel sales. Light duty diesel in auto sales were up also versus last year.","Net income in this segment was up 42%, strong volumes in auto and heavy duty diesel as well as manufacturing efficiencies led to record profits in environmental. In Specialty Materials, sales for the quarter were up 14% sequentially but lower than our expectations entering the quarter. We believe our Gorilla Glass sales reflect what happened in the smartphone and tablet markets in the first half of the year.","In Q2, we see in evidence a disappointing sale-through which we believe contributed to our weaker sales into the supply chain. In addition, we had a change in our expected ramp up timing for some second half model launches. We expect to recover some of those sales in Q3 and I will provide more detail in our outlook section.","Net income was up \u2013 Q2 was up 38% sequentially, but down year-over-year 17%. A lower year-over-year product sales price which had occurred in Q1 plus the non-repeat of our internal inventory replenishment from quarter two of 2013 impacted the segments profitability. Recalling the first half last year, we replenished the inventory that have been depleted in quarter four of 2012. While this year, our manufacturing volume is more closely aligned with the shipments in the quarter.","In Life Sciences, Q2 sales met our expectations for the quarter, they were up slightly and profit was consistent with last year.","Equity earnings for Dow Corning were $49 million including the earnings from Hemlock; earnings were up 17% versus Q2 of 2013. This improvement is partially driven by the tax rate in the inclusion of Hemlock this year. If we have had Hemlock in last year, the year over change in equity earnings would have been minor.","Now, moving to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $5.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. We had a very strong operating cash flow in the quarter. Strong operating cash flow also resulted in strong free cash flow in the quarter of about $600 million. As a reminder, free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure; you can find reconciliation to GAAP on our Web site.","We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion of cash in United States. Cash spending for the quarter was $232 million. We are revising our capital spending forecast down for 2014 from $1.5 billion to about $1.3 billion. The lower forecast is due to lower spending at both CPM and our (indiscernible).","Turning to foreign exchange exposures, we have taken some additional actions. First, given our increased exposure to the Korean won with the SEP acquisition, we entered into a series of zero cost collars during the quarter to hedge against movements in the U.S. dollar to won exchange rate for 2014 and 2015. Now, report the won in a constant rate of 1100 in our core earnings, so investors can clearly see our operational results. These costs did not have a material impact to our GAAP results for the quarter.","Second, during the second quarter of 2014, we entered into a series of additional hedges with no associated premium which will partially hedge the impact of the Japanese yen translation on a projected 2015, 2016 and 2017 net income. The blended rate of these new average rate forward contracts is 99 yen per U.S. dollar. We have not made any decisions yet in the quarter reporting rate for 2015 and beyond. We have some of 2015 hedged at 93 and now some at 99. To keep investors updated in our activities and thinking on foreign exchange as the year unfolds.","Now, going to the outlook, I will start with Display. We have no changes to our expectations for LCD retail and glass markets for the year. To reiterate, we expect the retail market as measured in square feet of glass to be up mid to high single digits. We think LCD TV units will grow lower to mid single digits with area growth likely higher.","Trend of consumers buying larger televisions has continued. We expect average screen size to increase 3% through 2015 driven primarily by increased affordability. Moreover, we believe screen size growth will be robust beyond 2015 driven by ultra high definition television penetration which favors large sized television.","And in the current year, we raised our screen size forecast significantly in the above 30 inch group for televisions. As I said earlier, we continue to feel good about the glass market this year inventory levels appear healthy and glass supplies seems in line with demand.","We expect the LCD glass market to be up low single digits in Q3 versus Q2. Corning's glass volume is expected to be up mid single digits driven by the continued share recovery at the one customer in Korea. Now, we expect LCD glass price declines in Q3 to further moderate and to be at the rates that we experienced for most of 2013. We are delighted by this return to the moderate levels.","In the first quarter, we closed on the acquisition of SEP, now CPM and began integration activities. These activities are proceeding very well, realized about $15 million pretax and synergies during the second quarter and are track for $30 million in the third quarter and $90 million in synergies for the full year.","As promised, we are also updating our synergy forecast for the out years. And now, believe we can attain the $170 million in synergies in 2016 which had been in 2017 and ultimately attain a $210 million run rate in 2017.","And moving to optical communications, we expect Q3 sales to be up in the mid single digits versus Q3 of 2013 driven by continued strong sales of fiber-to-home and wireless. Given the strong start to the year especially in Q2 and our current outlook, we now expect full year sales to be up in the high single digits due to growth in fiber-to-home datacenters and wireless optical connectivity.","Environmental, we expect Q3 sales to be up 20% to 25% year-over-year driven by the continued stronger heavy duty sales in the United States and due to new regulations in Europe and China.","Now turning to Specialty Materials, we expect segment sales to be up about 10% versus the second quarter driven mainly by higher Gorilla Glass volume. We expect an increase in Gorilla Glass volumes driven by new model launches leading to sequential sales in gross margin growth.","We are making some significant reductions to our forecast of the cover glass markets for the year. These changes are most significant in the tablet area and on touch notebooks. The touch notebook market is not developing at the pace we expected and our share remains similar to last year.","The change to our outlook for tablets is having a largest impact on our forecast. Now, we estimate the overall media tablet market only growing approximately 8% to 10%, nowhere near the pace we had expected entering 2014. And this growth was occurring only in unbranded media tablets.","We have not lost any share with branded media tablets, but because our share of unbranded tablets is lower, our overall share will slip slightly this year compared to last. We have not made any significant change to our smartphone forecast at this time, but the second half ramp of new models is important to us. Of course one remainder, smartphones are much smaller than tablets, so the square foot impact of phone is much smaller. And again, our share of forecast in phones remains similar to our original expectations.","Overall, we now expect the cover glass market in volume to grow 14% at a supply chain consumption level we should be up 10%. We expect our shipment level volume to grow 20% year-over-year due to the impact of inventory correction last year. Overall, the 20% growth is down from our original expectations for the year and is a disappointment.","In Life Sciences, we expect sales to be up slightly from last year's third quarter. Continuing on with rest of our third quarter forecast, we expect third quarter equity earnings from Dow Corning to be approximately $40 million to $45 million, down slightly versus Q2 driven by the return to a normal tax rate.","We expect core equity earnings for Dow Corning to be approximately $225 million for the full year driven by the single digit silicon sales growth improved margins in silicon and 20% sales growth at Hemlock. As a reminder, we expect customers to meet their polysilicon obligations in the contracts in Q4 which will drive equity earnings up over Q3.","Our total equity earnings for Q3 are expected to be $45 million to $50 million. We expect gross margin to be 46% driven by display in Gorilla Glass. Display's gross margin improves versus last year due to the consolidation of CPM. SG&A and RD&E spending should be about 13% and 8% of sales respectively consistent with Q2.","Now, finally for your modeling purposes, I would like to focus on three items to make sure you have our latest thinking. These three are other income and other expense, our tax rate and the number of shares outstanding. First, our other income, other expense line in the P&L as several moving parts. So I thought for your modeling purposes I'd run through this line item. Investor should recall that we no longer have the royalty income from SEP following its consolidation.","The expenses in other income, other expense are very steady, main component is interest expense which runs approximately $30 million per quarter. Miscellaneous other items are also smaller and run approximately at $20 million quarterly expense. Unfortunately, interest income in our cash is pretty small with low interest rates and as a reminder we invest our cash very short-term.","So for Q3, we expect other income, other expense to be a net expense of $45 million to $50 million. We occasionally get some positive area that we will mention for example intellectual property settlement.","Second, our effective tax rate for 2014 overall is expected to be approximately 19% projected rate is higher than 2013 driven by the addition of CPMs income which is taxed at the Korean tax rate of 24%. Finally, I know our share count has confused some investors with the full impact of the Samsung-owned convertible preferred shares on our fully diluted share count.","Please remember that Q2 saw the full impact of the security, Q1 did not have the full impact. Also please remember that our fully diluted earnings per share are done on an average basis for the quarter. Our quarter fully diluted share count for Q2 was 1.43 billion, our current forecast for the average fully diluted share count for Q3 is just under $1.42 billion obviously depending on the stock price in our Q3 purchasing activities and the number may vary slightly.","That concludes my opening comments. Ann?","Ann Nicholson","Thanks Jim. Okay, Tom, we will now open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question today comes from the line of Rod Hall representing CIP Morning [JPMorgan]. Please go ahead.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan","Also representing JPMorgan.","Jim Flaws","I\u2019m glad you didn't change jobs?","Rod Hall - JPMorgan","Yes. No. We haven't changed the firm name either. So I had two quick questions for you Jim. One, that I wondered, I mean it sounds like the Gorilla, the weaker Gorilla guidance really all comes down to tablet demand and not really smartphones, so I just wanted to make sure that I would like you to comment on \u2013 color on alternative materials that have been discussed for smartphones and whether there is any impact at all from that that you see in Q3 and beyond at least this year anyway.","I also wanted, we were kind of surprised the display guidance was a little bit weaker, we thought that 4K demand probably would start to pick-up in the back end of the year, so I would be curious to hear your commentary around 4K demand and how you see that playing out this year, are you still as optimistic about it as maybe you were at the beginning of the year? Thanks.","Jim Flaws","So on Display, I'm disappointed that you're disappointed because Display is doing fine. Just a reminder, Q2 was stronger so it makes a sequential outlook as they are going into Q3. But, we think the Display market is behaving nicely and in line with our general expectations. Relative to the 4K televisions, we never expected very much of that this year, we just don't think the price points are at the level, we could be surprised obviously with the holiday season maybe some people lowering more than we are expecting. But, we really think 4K or ultrahigh def is really a 2015 and 2016 phenomenon. But we feel very good about the display market, the television market, World Cup was very good. So we feel overall very good about the market.","On Gorilla, you are correct, I mean the \u2013 if you look at our expectations and our forecast by type of product, it is tablets that is the big change statement. We just got that really wrong about what was happening in the tablet market. And we have adjusted down our forecast for that dramatically compared to our original expectation that is overwhelming the impact in reduction of what we expected for growth for Gorilla this year.","In terms of smartphones, I will comment on specific customers and materials, but we continue to believe that Gorilla is going to be the material of choice for branded smartphones and I remind you that we are launching Gorilla 4 late this year. And we already won models with that product.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan","Okay. And Jim, can I have one follow-up which is on the yen hedge, I wonder if you could \u2013 you are waiting for their commentary there, can you give us any \u2013 I'm not sure I caught what you are thinking we should therefore be modeling in terms of the hedge rate, I know that that continue to come up every quarter. And you kind of been differing on what the \u2013 what the average hedge rate ought to look like in 2015. But any further, can you just clarify your commentary around that and help us understand maybe \u2013 if you were us what you would be modeling there?","Jim Flaws","So for this year, I would \u2013 we are not going to change the rate 2014. What we have had you should continue model that. I think to help investors right now, I would model next year at the same rate and then mostly likely at the end of third quarter, we will give you the rate for next year. Our reported results next year will \u2013 we will restate 2014 to whatever the new rate is.","Obviously, we are not hiding from investors the fact that the yen going forward is lower and we have given you the amount of money that net income is. But, I would continue to model at the 93 rate for the remainder of this year and to help investors so you can understand the volume growth and other things I would just use 93 right now for 2015. And then when we announce our Q3 results we are going to give you a rate for the next year.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan","Okay. Thanks a lot, Jim.","Operator","Our next question today comes from the line of Mark Sue representing RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Yes. Thank you. This is Amit calling on behalf of Mark Sue. How should we think about sort of the annual pricing contracts for LCD glass along with them, believe they are set to be renewed in 3Q any preliminary thoughts there would be helpful?","And you are lowering your CapEx expectations for the year, just going forward how should we think about CapEx as a metric maybe a percentage of sales or something?","Jim Flaws","So on the ladder on CapEx, we don't think about it as percentage of sales because the company as a level of maintenance, which probably is around $800 million and then rest is for expansion and that can vary depending on the pace of projects. We haven't updated our outlook for 2015 on CapEx yet I will do that in the quarter three call. But, I would not expect that the fact we lowered this year it means that we are pushing projects to next year.","Relative to the pricing contracts, the contracts remain in place; many of them have automatic renewals unless somebody chooses to exit and so we have contracts that go into next year already. And we think that they are continuing to do what we expect and we think our customers are quite pleased with it.","Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you. And good luck folks.","Jim Flaws","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Yes, thank you. Jim on Gorilla, could you just clarify in the press release you know that's one of the reasons for the weaker 2Q as lower than expected sales for plan new models. Is that impact also related primarily to tablets from a dollar basis or is there some smartphone also in there?","Jim Flaws","That's primarily smartphones on new models.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you. And then your gross margin of 45% was slightly below your expectations, can you reconcile that with the statement that the synergies are actually coming in earlier than planned. And then can you talk about what's driving the higher synergies in the outer years for CPM? Thanks.","Jim Flaws","So the gross margin impact versus our originally expectations was due to the shortfall in Gorilla sales, you may recall Gorilla glass itself not parts is the highest gross margin product the company has. So that's why we missed our expectation. Display is doing fine and gross margin improved quarter two over quarter one.","I would say that the primary reason that the synergies are coming in faster is we are having an incredibly effective integration. The management of CPM has embraced working with our display team led by Jim Clappin. And we are delighted with the progress we have made. We are finding more opportunities. I think the biggest we are finding is we can move faster than we originally thought. So we are delighted with the pace of integration. And you always a little apprehensive when you do something of this size, but it's going terrific and I think our team both our CPM employees and our Display employees are doing a great job.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks Jim. And just one final clarification on the Gorilla, when you mentioned the short-fall related to smartphone, the new products, is the timing driven for you or is it sort of demand driven and is it broad based or fairly narrow in terms of customer scope? Thank you.","Jim Flaws","I won't comment on customer scope. We think its timing based. It's always been difficult for us when people have new models to know exactly when they are going to be pulling. The difficulty for us is because of the length of the supply chain. And so we generally know the models. And we have a forecast but exactly how the supply chain pulls, it's very difficult for us to forecast.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, Jim.","Operator","And we will go to the line of Amitabh Passi with UBS. Please go ahead.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Hi, good morning everybody. Jim, I was wondering on the Display gross margin improvement from 1Q to 2Q. Can you give us some sense of the magnitude; was it a couple of hundred basis points or greater, lower?","Jim Flaws","I think I don't have every number memorized, but it was I think about 1.5 points.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then given the fact that you are seeing some recovery in Gorilla glass sales going to the calendar 3Q, should we expect company gross margin and to trend maybe closer back to the 46% you have expected in 2Q or any help in terms of thinking about GM?","Jim Flaws","Yes. That is our expectation 46%.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Okay. Got it. And I guess, my final question for you is, just any help on the telecom strength, you cited fiber-to-the-home in North America and Europe, is this Tier-1, is it broader based across Tier-2, Tier-3 as well, any comment inside that would be appreciated.","Jim Flaws","It's very exciting for us. We are talking about yesterday that it's a very broad based. We are seeing good growth from our -- Tier-1 customers are very large customers. In fact even some who we thought had finished up more are continuing to buy. We unfortunately can't name all our customers here but it is very broad based.","And I think it's really vindicating what we basically said a decade ago, which was fiber-to-the-home, it's going to be a very powerful force in the market and the fact that it's so broad based, we are very excited by that.","And just one last comment on that. We actually saw a little bit of an uptick in the NBN project which has been undergone some changes with change of government down there. But, there was good demand on that in the most recent quarter.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Okay. Thank you. I will step back in queue.","Operator","We have a question from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Thank you. I just had a couple of my follow ups on Gorilla glass. Just the first one, whether the \u2013 it sounded like you expected some delay on Gorilla 4, and I just wanted to understand if that was impacting your out quarter guidance. And also that will still coming out in time to capture some of the major products that you are expecting to be in the second half?","Jim Flaws","Yes. Our new version of Gorilla is not being delayed. We are in production we are already shipping some product in Q3. We have one model. So there is no delay relative to that.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then it sounded like you did not change your expectations for smartphone cover glass demand for the market as a whole for this year but you seem to be embedding some slowdown in product sales for the second half within the smartphone category. So is that a function of what you expect for your own products into some of your customers or for some of your customer sales?","Jim Flaws","So we believe that it has a little bit \u2013 smartphones had a little bit of an impact on our sales in \u2013 our sales in Q2 because some customer sales were not as strong as what they had originally expected. But overall, we are not changing the market for the year for smartphones.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","And then just lastly you mentioned your expectations for higher TV sizes now than previously, can you just quantify that?","Jim Flaws","Sim, I think you have seen me carry around the special chart that I have that I do for just myself on greater than 30 inches television than versus where we came into the year. We moved up, just a little less than about half an inch on that one. So which delighted me because I think that's the most important metric.","I'm actually quite surprised with smaller cell televisions for the first time we were negative. They grew this past quarter. But, as you know the most important one for me is the average about 30.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we have a question from Mehdi Hosseini with FIG. Please go ahead.","Mehdi Hosseini - FIG","Thank you. Jim, sorry to going back to Gorilla, but just have a clarification. Do we have a sense of what Chinese handset OEMs are using for cover glass; do you think that your market share there is comparable to other regions?","Jim Flaws","We do have numbers there on market share is less but our market share is improving there first now of luminous silica glass which is what we call family of Gorilla glasses or specialty glasses is moving up as a percentage of overall phones there in our share of luminous silica improved also.","Mehdi Hosseini - FIG","Okay. So it is really documented that the big Korean OEM didn't lose market share in Q2, their results were disappointing and that to large extent explains what happened to your Gorilla sales in Q2. Is that a fair assessment like Korea OEM versus Chinese OEMs?","Jim Flaws","I will not comment on any specific customers.","Mehdi Hosseini - FIG","Okay. And then moving on to the operating margin, if you could just remind me again, did you say that Gorilla revenue will be up 20% in calendar 2014, or did I misunderstand you?","Jim Flaws","Gorilla volume is up 20% more.","Mehdi Hosseini - FIG","20%. Okay. So if your operating margin was 17% for specialty material in 2013, how should we think about a margin expansion here with volume up 12%?","Jim Flaws","We have priced down significantly which we talked about in Q1. So you are not going to see the operating margin expansion.","Mehdi Hosseini - FIG","Okay. So even with volume up 20% margins you suggest margins is going to be just flattish?","Jim Flaws","Yes.","Mehdi Hosseini - FIG","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Joseph Wolf with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays","Thanks. Just -- first question is an elaboration on the last one, if you think about the lower end then you talked about your strategies there and telling us a little bit more about that. Have you increased or sped up the timetable for addressing some of that lower end of the cover glass market given the market dynamics. And with that involved any new kinds of spending?","Jim Flaws","We really haven't made a final decision about something we talked earlier in the year about whether we should have a different version of strength in glass to go after the low end of the market in China. We still are evaluating that. We are spending quite a bit on new cover glass materials. But I don't think that would materially change our operating expense, which we chose to pursue that.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays","Okay. And then just on the cash side, you brought down the CapEx and said probably we won't get added to next year, could you talk about areas of focus things that you have pulled back and where the reduction in your CapEx forecast comes from. And then if you circle back to the cash buyback, can we look for an increase in that $400 million as you move to the second half of the year given the strength of the free cash flow?","Jim Flaws","So the reduction in CapEx occurred because we after going through all the plans at CPM, we determine that some other projects did not need to proceed. And then the other area was in what we call \u2013 our [TAS] (ph) capital where projects \u2013 we are going to spend a little bit less on that.","Relative to shareholder purchases there is no change in the shareholder purchase on our existing program as I said we have approximately $400 million. And our plan is to spend that money this year and anything beyond that would take the Board of Directors putting together new program and historically the way to we finish the program before they start a new one.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays","Okay. Great. Thanks Jim.","Operator","And we will go to the line of Patrick Newton with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Patrick Newton - Stifel","Thank you for taking my questions. Good morning, Jim. Two different questions, one on pricing, I guess one on optical communications. On the pricing side, you talked about panel pricing trends in the quarter remaining relatively healthy. I'm curious as your thoughts on whether the tie capacity trends are somewhat sustainable in the intermediate term or whether you think it's due to perhaps some temporary drivers in the quarter which should be the World Cup strength that you alluded to or maybe some benefits from the IP refresh due to the end of life of Windows XP?","Jim Flaws","So what our display commercial team believes and what they are hearing from customers that the type and this is going to continue into the fourth quarter, I'm noting some of the panel makers who have been announcing in the last couple of days making similar comments. So we have to take that as a word that they are continuing to run at a strong level and they are giving us indications they are going to do that into the fourth quarter.","We think that IT thing has been a pleasant surprise basically all year along we think it's more than just the Windows thing. We know that corporations have extended, they refreshed cycles but that can't go on forever. And some of our IT customer contacts actually flag this to us earlier back in the spring that they thought \u2013 that the IT portion of the market was going to be stronger and actually tight.","So we feel generally overall quite good about the panel utilization the tightness that leading to firm panel prices and that continuing.","Patrick Newton - Stifel","And any concern that this tight utilization could led to some capacity builds?","Jim Flaws","I won't comment on our customers building panel fabs, as you know there are number under construction in China. But, suddenly someone making a sudden decision to build a panel fab is not \u2013 you are talking about that showing up in a year and a half later. So I would tap out to be the case. I think there is no real plans of expansion in China, frankly that's the only place there is any panel expansion really at this point in time.","Patrick Newton - Stifel","All right, thank you. And then just shifting gears to communications, can you help us understand the contribution that you are seeing from datacenters or your visibility in the datacenter builds or upgrades. And then you mentioned NBN kicking in a little bit in the current quarter. Could you remind us where you stand on the project as far as the duration remaining and the percentage of completion from a Corning perspective?","Jim Flaws","The duration still is quite long. But they are still evaluating whether they are going to take the pure fiber-to-the-home technology all the way that they originally planned. I mean we have had some favorable comments that maybe that they will do better than more than what they had said last October. But, I don't have any percentage of completion. I don't have the data center numbers with me. That's been good this year, but I don't have any specific numbers but I know enterprise was up in, I think about 10% in quarter two.","Patrick Newton - Stifel","All right, thank you. Good luck.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Hey, guys. Good morning, thank you. Appreciate Jim. Couple of questions, just on enterprising and LCD and Gorilla for a second. In calculation the low teens volume growth is it right to assume that pricing in LCD was down around 6% to 7%?","Jim Flaws","That is too high.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Okay. So low teens is barely, barely, barely low teens.","Jim Flaws","That's too much.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Okay. I just wonder\u2026","Jim Flaws","That said hedged into.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Right. I heard that but just want to make sure it wasn't hedge \u2013 but that makes a lot more sense. And then your expectations for Q4 given that you managed to get your pricing contracts for Q3 back in the moderate range of 2013. Should we essentially be expecting that to continue into Q4, or there are reasons you would not be comfortable taking that far ahead?","Jim Flaws","I'm thinking that far ahead and we think all of those things that are going on in the industry would lead us to have the confidence that we will be able to have another moderate quarter in Q4.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Okay. That's helpful. Going back to previous question on Gorilla and your comments of delays in variability and some product launches, were you implying or talking about launches in Q2 they are not getting pushed out into second half, some customers are you talking about launch that you expected for Q3, they are getting pushed out later in Q3 or into Q4?","Jim Flaws","I was talking about launches in the second half of the year that we \u2013 because of the length of supply chain. We some time knew we would be getting all in product shipping in the May, June timeframe and that has been was less then what we had expected against our forecast in the month of July which are obviously almost finished. We are seeing pull on that front.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Okay. And with LCD inventory weeks, I believe you said around 17 weeks right now, can you give us a sense as to what Gorilla inventory weeks look like in the channel from your shipment on through?","Jim Flaws","Like I said, LCD was at 18 weeks.","Ehud Gelblum \u2013 Citigroup","Okay.","Jim Flaws","In Q2 and I don't have any information on Gorilla in the supply chain. It is very difficult to get information on the number of weeks.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Do you think it's contracting or is it staying roughly where it is, I assume that's higher than 18?","Jim Flaws","I just said I don't have information on the supply chain for Gorilla, so I can't give you the number of weeks.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Okay. I appreciate that. Last thing, I want to just explore a little bit was Hemlock, it sound obviously back in the equity earnings as of Q1. From the guidance it looks like you expected it to be relatively flat and then up in Q4. Can you give us just a little overview on the trends going on there, how should we be modeling that going forward?","Jim Flaws","We actually disclosed in our Q1, the Hemlock numbers were last year, so on quarter two last year we made some money, so but in quarter three we didn't make any money last year in Hemlock. So it's very uneven \u2013 unevenness comes about by how the customers who are on the contracts pull their product.","But in general our experience last year was Q4 is very strong because that's \u2013 it must meet their contractual demand, they can delay for a couple of quarters. But they have to take it. I mean overall, I think we see very positive trends right now in probably silicon market spot prices have moved up quite a bit from where we were. But downside would be that we just had announcement on Friday by the U.S. Government about more anti-damping regulations, so we don't know how that will impact the growth of the market. But fundamentally, we are not really shipping into China today so it doesn't really affect Hemlock very much.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Thanks. Good morning. First question, just going back on the CPM synergies, so Jim if you are pulling forward some of this synergy expected in 2017 and 2016 and we look at the $90 million for the full year this year. Is it a straight line in terms of how we should think about synergies for 2015 more back end loaded and any color you can provide there would be helpful? Then I have a follow-up.","Jim Flaws","I don't have the synergies handy broken quarter-by-quarter, so I doubt that there is a lot of variabilities that goes through. But, I just don't have that level of precision.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Okay. And then just secondly, just getting back to the \u2013 unbranded cover market \u2013 cover glass market, given the growth opportunity there, I don't know if there is any more color you can provide in terms of where you are actually getting some of the growth from. And I know you addressed some of this in some earlier comments. But, just trying to understand anything you could do to maybe accelerate your penetration, if not by the end of this year, but into 2015 and what that opportunity looks like? Thanks.","Jim Flaws","I'm not sure what you mean by unbranded Steve, could you help me with it?","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Yes, I'm sorry. On that unbranded tablet market where you are selling cover glass, right now, you mentioned that the only growth you are seeing from tablets right now is unbranded OEM?","Jim Flaws","We have shared. We do quite well with that. It's just that we don't have the same shares what we have in some branded ones that you are very familiar with in the United States. And we are always trying to demonstrate that our Gorilla products, our better quality product and provide damage resistance. So I think that's really our approach. And combined with marketing which we do small amount of and tend to continue to do that. We shifted more of our marketing spend to Asia going forward. So I think those are the things we could do.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question today comes from the line of Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Yes. I'm wondering, if you could talk a little bit about pricing for Gorilla glass. So given the slowdown, what has happened to pricing in the quarter and as you look forward into the September quarter?","Jim Flaws","So the sequential price declines Q2 to Q1 were almost immaterial I would say and we have the big step down that we talked about in Q1 but really nothing of any significance in Q2 maybe I think we have a minor amount in Q3 in one of our contracts. I think the next big change statement would likely be because most of these contracts are annual will be Q1 of next year. And frankly it's a little earlier for me to know what that would be. But, I don't think you expect price to be a big play for the remainder of this year.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. And Jim in the December quarter, we should expect the Gorilla glass to grow sequentially given some of these delays, we should see a little bit of growth in the December quarter or not?","Jim Flaws","It's really hard for me to judge right now. I think it would be \u2013 my general feeling is that it might be flattish volume Q3 versus Q4 a lot will depend on the fall of these models. But, the big step up from where we have been running of course in Q3 in terms of volume.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. And just finally, if you could just give us a general direction how important the tablet market is to Gorilla. I mean is it 20%, 30% some ballpark range would be great.","Jim Flaws","So the tablet market is about 40% of our demand.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Great. Thank you.","Jim Flaws","We obviously expected it to be more in that originally in the year.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay, fantastic. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Andrew Abrams with JG Capital. Please go ahead.","Andrew Abrams - JG Capital","Hi. Just a quick question on the TV market, you mentioned about some pull-in from the World Cup, would you expect that to have a material impact on what you would have expected for third quarter in terms of TV demand or is it insignificant enough not to make a difference?","Jim Flaws","I think it falls into the insignificance. We were just delighted by \u2013 some times we get people overly focused on sporting events but for example in Europe in the month of May televisions were up 13% whereas four months prior to that up or down in the single digits. And in South America in the month of April up 25%, 64% in the month of May but really it's not going to change our numbers overall.","Andrew Abrams - JG Capital","Got it. Okay. And lastly just one, your plans for the assets from SEP, I know you are doing some conversions in Korea toward Gorilla glass based on your outlook for Gorilla glass on a general basis, are those plans going to change or is that more locational than volume wise?","Jim Flaws","Well, obviously, we don't have need as much Gorilla right now. But our plans still remains as plants in Japan reached the end of their life on Gorilla. They will go down permanently and then we will shift that demand over to Korea. Pace maybe slightly slower but I know that we have a couple of tanks that were throwing the light on Gorilla at the end of the quarter three heading into quarter four.","Andrew Abrams - JG Capital","Got it. Thanks very much.","Ann Nicholson","Tom, we got time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today will come from the line of Alberto Moel with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alberto Moel - Sanford Bernstein","Hi. Good morning, Jim. Just a question on the downstream Gorilla business as you sell blanks to the customers and then they finish them, but I understand that there is some work that you have been doing in downstream. You bought laser company for laser cutting, and so and forth if you have some update on where that fitting and where that business is heading, curious to know if you have any color on that. Thanks.","Jim Flaws","On the downstream business, the parts the business has quite a bit of variability to it quarter-by-quarter, so I don't have much of an update. The laser business is going quite well. I think shipments will be quite strong in quarter three. I don't have the list of the customers. So I can't really help you on that. But, parts business varies up and down in the quarter. But, in the mainstream for us in Gorilla is selling glass.","Alberto Moel - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you.","Jim Flaws","Okay. So we will wrap up. I have got one IR announcement. We will be appearing at the Citi Conference on September 3rd in New York City. I will just remind you a couple of highlights. Our most recent quarter was our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth. We are absolutely delighted by the LCD glass price declines. In the third quarter they moderated further and I think very important to us is we are back to the rates that we saw for most of 2013.","The integration of Corning Precision materials is going very well, delivering results and will be better than original plan trying to achieve that $90 million synergies this year part of our additional $350 million impact for the year. I think optical communications environmental segments are having fabulous years particularly environmental we are delighted by that. And we think we are on track to deliver sales and earnings growth in every business for the full year.","Feel really good about our first half results and are confident that we can deliver on the plan. Ann?","Ann Nicholson","Thank you, Jim. And thank you all for joining us today. Playback of this call is available beginning at 11 AM Eastern today and will run until 5 PM Eastern Tuesday August 12th.

This morning, we reported very strong finish to excellent 2018. For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.1 million, up 15% year-over-year; net income was $539 million, up 18% year-over-year; and EPS was $0.59, up 28% year-over-year. For the full year, sales were $11.4 billion and EPS was $1.78, both up 11% from 2017. We also delivered on our goal to improve gross margin to 42% in second half, a significant increase over last year and first half of 2018. All of our businesses produced year-over-year sales growth in 2018.","Highlights include Optical Communications sales up 18% for the second consecutive year; Environmental sales up 17% as the adoption of gasoline particulate filters accelerated; Specialty Materials sales up 5% following an exceptional 2017 growth of 25%; Display sales, up 4% as we ramp our new Gen 10.5 facility and the annual price declines reached the important milestone of mid single-digits in the second half and full year pricing was the best in more than a decade; Life Science sales, up 8% as we continue to outpace market growth.","For the past 3 years, we have invested for growth through our strategy in capital allocation framework. The significant benefits of these investments are evident in our financial performance. In 2018, we have built new capacity, launched new products, grew sales by more than $1 billion and extended our leadership position in all businesses. We exited the year with strong execution, expanded margins and great momentum. We expect our momentum to continue into 2019 and beyond. We expect strong year-over-year growth in the first quarter and additional growth in subsequent quarters. In total, we anticipate another strong year for Corning. We also feel confident that we are well positioned for long-term growth. Important trends such as 5G, smart cards, connected homes and augmented reality are converging around Corning\u2019s unique capabilities. These interconnected ecosystems require technologies that have been our fundamental strengths for decades. Our proprietary manufacturing processes and deep expertise in glass, ceramics and optical physics are more relevant than ever. Overall, we are excited about 2019 and our future opportunities as Tony will describe in more detail in just a few minutes.","Now let\u2019s turn to the strategy and capital allocation framework, under the framework we targeted generating $26 billion to $30 billion in cash through 2019. We plan to return more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends and to invest $10 billion to extend our leadership and deliver growth. As we have discussed with you numerous times, we have continued to make great progress towards the framework goals we announced in October 2015. As we enter the final year of our plan, we expect to meet our stated goals. Our cash generation is on target and through the end of 2018 we have returned $11.8 billion to shareholders. We increased dividends per share by 50% since the framework began. Investments in RD&E, capital expenditures and acquisitions also remain on-track to our 4-year plan, total $8.2 billion through the end of 2018. As outlined in our framework Corning is best in the world in three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms and five market access platforms. Our capabilities are inter-related and reinforcing. We focused 80% of our resources on opportunities that use capabilities in at least two of these three categories. This increases our probability of success, reduces the cost of innovation, creates stronger competitive advantages and most importantly delights our customers.","Now, I will turn to progress in each of our market access platforms starting with Optical Communications. Our performance in Optical Communications continues to be outstanding and we expect to surpass our goal of $5 billion in 2020 sales with further growth beyond. We remain the world leader in passive optical solutions and the only true end to end supplier of integrated solutions. 2018 was an excellent year for our Optical Communications business. Recognition of the value created by our solutions and co-iteration approach continues to grow. We secured additional multi-year contracts with industry leaders in the carrier and datacenter segments which will add significant sales and profits in 2019 and beyond. This committed demand supports our additional investments in manufacturing capacity. Another highlight of the year was completing the acquisition of 3M\u2019s Communications Markets division. In addition to bringing us a talented group of employees, it extends our market reach and access to global customers while expanding our portfolio in rapidly growing our optical solutions markets.","Next, we achieved product milestones. We demonstrate our long track record of innovation and industry expertise. Our pre-connectorized fiber-to-the-home solutions have passed more than 45 million homes around the world. We introduced products of 2018 such as extreme density cable tailored for next generation hyperscale datacenter architectures as well as a fiber that offers significant advantages for higher throughput transmission. All products continue to reduce network cost and increase the speed of installations and we earned industry accolades in multiple customer segments, including datacenters and access networks.","Interestingly, beyond the hardware solutions, we have also developed software tools that speed up installation. For example, FiberPass helps to accelerate typical installations from weeks to just days. Bruce Furlong, Bell\u2019s Vice President of Deployment and Access described the benefits this way, \u201cthe efficiency and accuracy of the FiberPass solution has contributed to the rapid expansion of Bell\u2019s broadband network in our fast growing 5 TV and internet services.\u201d Our investments in capacity clearly paid off in the second half of 2018 with strong sales growth and even greater growth in profitability. As we turn to 2019, committed demand supports additional investments and will lead to additional growth. Overall, we expect to continue to grow more than twice as fast as the communications infrastructure market.","Now, let\u2019s turn to mobile consumer electronics, where we are the world leader in glass for smartphones, tablets and emerging categories like [indiscernible] in augmented reality devices. Our goal has been to double mobile consumer electronic sales over the next several years despite a maturing smartphone market. And we have been making significant progress toward that goal. First, we are capturing more value per device. We expanded our leadership in the carbon glass market with the launch of Gorilla Glass 6 in July. Leading OEMs are continuing to design our premium glasses into their devices. We expect more than 10 new models with Gorilla Glass 6 to launch throughout this year. We are not only benefiting from adoption of our premium glasses, but also from more glass on each phone. Glass backed penetration on smartphones doubled from 15% in 2017 to 30% in 2018 and we expect continued growth in 2019.","We are also significantly expanding our presence in the aftermarket. As announced this month, we will collaborate with OtterBox, the number one selling smartphone case brand in the U.S. to introduce the Amplify line of glass screen protectors. This will offer extra protection for consumers and add a third piece of our glass to devices. Second, we are winning in new and emerging device categories. We launched Corning Gorilla Glass DX and DX+ in July, which provides enhanced anti-reflective optics and scratch resistance for wearables. These new glass composites are continuing to gain traction in the wearable market with several launches slated during the first half. We are also partnering with leading consumer electronics makers on augmented reality devices and precise 3D sensing technology. For example, at CES, we announced an agreement with WaveOptics to help enable sleek augmented reality wearables. The ultra-flat high-index glass that Corning supplies coupled with our proprietary laser processing and characterization tools enable optimize image quality and sleek device form factors. So overall, we are off to a great start to meet our goal to double sales in mobile consumer electronics. A quick fun fact, since 2016, smartphone unit sales have been relatively flat. We however grew our sales in this space 30% due to our innovations. We will continue to innovate for our customers and you will continue to see more Corning in your devices.","Turning to automotive market access platforms, our materials expertise is helping to propel the auto industry into a new era of clear cost with enhanced cockpit functionality, connectivity and design. Our objectives are to build on our base business with the gasoline particulate filter opportunity and to launch on automotive glass business. 2018 was an exciting year for both objectives. Our gasoline particulate filter technology mix caused significantly cleaner. We exceeded $50 million in GPF sales in 2018 as European regulations took effect and we expect more than $150 million in 2019 GPF sales. China will be the next to introduce GPFs with initial filter sales this year as OEMs prepare for the first phase of China 6 regulations in mid-2020. We are ramping dedicated capacity in China to support our robust pipeline of business resulting from upcoming Chinese regulations.","Next, we experienced strong pull for Gorilla Glass for automotive in 2018. We are capitalizing on long-term industry trends that are driving demand for technical glass. At CES automakers confirmed the trend towards larger, longer, shaped and more integrated displays. We also saw strong pull for Corning\u2019s industry first auto grade glass solutions for automotive interiors, launched exclusively with customers at CES. These new solutions are making it easier and more affordable for automakers to bring curved and flat displays to market. In total, we have been awarded more than 55 platforms to-date globally, demand is materializing faster than we expected and we are accelerating our investments accordingly.","In our Life Sciences Vessels platform we continue to make strong progress on the path to a new long-term multi-billion dollar franchise. Valor Glass substantially reduces particle contamination breaks and cracks while significantly increasingly throughput. Valor helps protect patients and improve pharmaceutical manufacturing. Key customers are advancing towards the FDA certification required for the use of Valor. We continue to make progress with our development partners Merck and Pfizer and shipments are increasing to other major pharmaceutical manufacturers to supporting their individual drug regulatory filings. Total shipments of Valor Glass increased four fold compared to 2017 indicating growing progress towards certification across more pharmaceutical companies. In parallel, we are supporting customers by scaling up our production capabilities on pace with market adoption. We brought new capacity online in 2018 and expanded our range of products. We are also progressing with the construction of the new high volume manufacturing facility in North Carolina that we announced in April.","Finally, industry pull remains favorable, regulatory concerns about the need for improved glass packaging were highlighted in the lead story of the January PDA letter, reinforcing the need for new solutions such as Valor Glass. In addition, Valor Glass was named one of the top six pharmaceutical and medical packaging developments in 2018 by Packaging Digest. We continue to believe Valor has the potential to power Corning\u2019s growth for the next decade and beyond. We remain closely engaged with the SPS and support its efforts to address this important public health issue. We look forward to being able to share additional updates soon.","In Display, we\u2019re delivering stable returns. During 2018, we extended our global leadership by successfully ramping the world\u2019s first Gen 10.5 glass plant. This accomplishment allowed us to grow volume faster than the overall market. Also, the Display Glass pricing environment continues to improve. We reached the important milestone of mid-single-digit year-over-year price declines in the second half of 2018. In fact, 2018 was the best pricing environment in more than a decade. We expect the pricing environment to improve further in 2019 and reach mid-single-digit declines for the full-year. We\u2019re off to a great start with first quarter price declines expected to be significantly better than quarter one 2018 and the best quarter one in a decade. Display will continue to execute its proven strategy to deliver stable returns. So, we continue to make significant progress across all our market access platforms, ultimately, we remain on track to fully achieve our strategy and capital allocation framework goals.","In 2018, we leveraged our investments to meet increased demand from our customers, grow sales, and significantly improve profitability in the second half just as we said we would. Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustained performance. We have multiple businesses driving our growth. Our capabilities are becoming increasingly vital to important trends. Our relationships with industry-leading customers are opening new opportunities and our strategic investments are paying off. We\u2019re not only succeeding in building a bigger company, we\u2019re building a stronger more resilient one. We look forward to outlining the next pace of our strategic framework in the coming months.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tony for a review of our results and outlook.","Tony Tripeny","Thank you, Wendell and good morning. We had another outstanding quarter and our full-year results exceeded our expectations. In 2018, we did what we said we were going to do, which was to expand our manufacturing capacity in the first half and begin leveraging those growth investments in the second half. In 2019, we expect to build on this momentum and keep growing across all of our businesses.","Before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the primary difference between our GAAP and core results is again a non-cash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts. As we discussed before, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to beat mark-to-market and recorded a card value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us this resulted in an after-tax GAAP loss of $180 million for the fourth quarter. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We are very pleased with our hedging program and the economic uncertainty it provides. We have received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception slightly over 5 years ago.","Now, that brings me to our results and outlook. For the fourth quarter, sales were up 15% year-over-year to $3.1 billion, net income rose 18% to $539 million, and EPS was $0.59, up 28%. For the full year, sales were $11.4 billion and EPS was $1.78, both up 11%. As Wendell noted, this strong growth resulted from customers adopting our innovation and from us capturing the benefits of our capacity investments. As a reminder, our capacity expansion projects in 2018 supported strong committed customer demand across all businesses. These investments include capacity expansion for optical fiber and cable, Gen 10.5 Display Glass, gasoline particulate filters and multiple development projects such as Gorilla Glass for mobile devices and automotive. 2018 capital spending totaled $2.2 billion. As our new capacity ramp towards full production levels, our sales run-rate climbed and our gross margin expanded by 42% in the second half of the year.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of cash. Adjusted operating cash flow for the year was $3.2 billion and on track for the cumulative target in the full year capital allocation plan. Now, let\u2019s look at the detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technologies, we are delivering stable returns. Our full year sales were $3.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Fourth quarter performance was in line with our expectations. Sales were $899 million and net income was $240 million. 2018 was the best pricing environment in more than a decade. As expected, fourth quarter price declines were very moderate and in mid single-digit percentage year-over-year and even more moderate than Q3. With over 90% of our volume under contract, we expect our full year 2019 price declines to improve further to a mid single-digit percentage and to be even better than they were in 2018. For the first quarter of 2019, we expect sequential price declines to be significantly better than the first quarter of 2018 and be the most favorable first quarter price change in over a decade.","Now, three factors continue to drive our view that this favorable pricing environment will continue. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced or even tight. Our new Gen 10.5 plant supports the expected growth of large size TVs. It is co-located with and dedicated to our customer BOE. We pay for the line capacity in tandem with BOE to ensure our Gen 10.5 glass supply is balanced to demand. The ramp is on schedule. We expect the glass supply demand balance below Gen 10.5 to continue to be tight. As public information indicates, there is low capacity growth planned in the segment. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. Therefore, we expect their price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable. And third, Display Glass manufacturing requires ongoing investment in current capacity to maintain operations. To generate acceptable returns on investments, glass pricing will need to improve even further. For cloning, we will only add capacity if we can get an attractive return for our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, display glass market volumes were low single-digit sequentially and our volume grew faster as expected due to the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant. For the full year, the display glass market volume increased mid single-digits as expected driven by growth in TV screen size. We expect mid single-digit growth again in 2019 also driven by growth in TV screen size. We also expect our volume to grow more than the market once again resulting from the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant during that 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, we expect the display glass market to be up mid single-digits year-over-year and our volume to be up significantly more. Sequentially, we expect the market and our volume to decline by a mid single-digit percentage consistent with normal seasonality. In summary, we remain very pleased with the current dynamics in our display business including our ability to capture higher productivity and margin through fleet optimization and the Gen 10.5 ramp and most importantly the fact that we are now delivering stable returns.","Let\u2019s move to our fastest growing segment Optical Communications. Full year sales were $4.2 billion, up 18% for the second consecutive year. The business is on track to surpass its goal of $5 billion in 2020 sales. Net income was up 26% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter sales exceeded $1 billion for the third consecutive quarter and we were up 26% over 2017. Net income for the quarter was up 60% year-over-year. Sales growth for the year and the quarter were driven by multi-year data center and carrier projects, availability of new manufacturing capacity as well as sales from the recently acquired 3M Communications Markets division. As planned we are leveraging our capacity investments to drive higher volume and earnings.","Our mid-year acquisition of 3M\u2019s Communications Markets division contributed about $200 million to 2018 sales. We are pleased with our progress on integrating this acquisition and continue to expect it to be accretive to EPS in 2019. Looking forward, we expect first quarter sales to be up in the low-20% range year-over-year. We expect another year of growth with full year 2019 sales up low-teens. Key growth drivers include customer projects and the full year of sales from the 3M acquisition. Our customers, the world\u2019s leading network and cloud operators, continue to deploy Corning\u2019s optical solutions to densify their 4G, 5G and data center networks. We continue to be very excited about the growth ahead of us.","Environmental Technologies, 2018 sales were $1.3 billion, up 17% year-over-year, driven by growth in all product categories and accelerated by emerging sales of GPF. Net income grew faster than sales at 26% year-over-year. 2018 GPF sales were more than $50 million as demand ramped strongly in the second half of the year primarily in Europe. We are now starting to sell into China with early adoption of China 6 regulations. Dedicated capacity and engineering investments support the ramp of this business. Fourth quarter environmental sales grew 10% year-over-year. Looking to 2019, we expect first quarter sales growth of mid single-digits and the full year sales to be up high single-digits year-over-year. We expect $150 million of GPS sales in 2019 and we continue to add capacity to meet the additional demand.","In Specialty Materials, 2018 results were strong after an exceptional year of 25% sales growth in 2017. Full year sales rose 5% as OEMs adopted our portfolio of premium glass products and the use of glass backs doubled to about 30% of smartphones in 2018. Fourth quarter sales were $399 million in line with our expectations and up 2% versus a very strong fourth quarter in 2017 when customers built aggressively to support launch cycles.","Overall, we are pleased with our performance in Specialty Materials. Our results demonstrate the value of our premium glasses, the strength of our innovation portfolio, and the continued adoption of glass smartphone backs. For the first quarter, we expect sales to grow mid-to-high single-digits year-over-year. We also expect to grow again for the full-year despite a mature market, exactly how much will depend on the adoption rate of our innovations. In Life Sciences, 2018\u2019s sales were $946 million, up 8% year-over-year, with strong fourth quarter sales as we continue to outpace market growth.","Net income was up 23% year-over-year, driven by higher sales volume and manufacturing efficiencies. We expect sales growth to be a low to mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year for the first quarter and full-year. In summary, 2018 was a terrific year. All of our businesses had strong momentum and we expect another year of sales, gross margin, net income, and EPS growth in 2019. We expect 2019 gross margin dollars and percent to expand due to the manufacturing capacity that came online in 2018, our improved utilization of that capacity and the strength of our sales growth. The percentage increase will be somewhat muted due to our continuing investments in 2019 to meet committed demand for optical communications, GPF, and automotive glass. We expect to see the sales and margin benefit of these additional investments starting Q2 and build throughout the remainder of the year. In the first quarter, we expect double-digit year-over-year sales, gross margin dollars, and net income growth. We expect gross margin percent to improve slightly from Q1, 2018.","Sequentially, we expect Q1 gross margin dollars and percent to be down due to seasonality in Display and Specialty as is typical. We expect both to improve in Q2 and to continue climbing throughout the year. Annual operating expenses should remain consistent with last year as a percentage of sales. For the full-year, SG&A is expected to be about 14% of sales and RD&E between 8% and 8.5%. We expect other income, other operating expenses to be approximately $250 million for the year.","Full year gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $210 million predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor, with the first quarter add approximately $20 million consistent with typical seasonality. Fourth quarter 2018 gross equity earnings were $152 million. Our tax rate should be between 21% and 22% for the year and for the quarter. The slide we posted gives you additional modeling details for the first quarter and the full-year. In 2019, we expect to spend just over $2 billion on capital expenditures with programs in every market access platform. How much more will depend on how quickly we ramp some of our investments. We\u2019ll provide more detail as the year progresses.","Finally, I would like to make a couple of comments on the economic environment, in particular, China. First, as we said previously, we do not expect the material impact from the enacted tariffs. Second, we incorporated conservative estimates for China end-market demand for TVs and autos and our strong guidance and outlook for 2019. If Chinese demand is better, there is an opportunity for upside. In closing, 2018 demonstrates that we are delivering on our priorities to grow and extend our leadership. Results were outstanding with 11% sales growth and second half margin expansion. Our strong guidance reflects the rich set of opportunities ahead of us in 2019 and beyond as we continue to grow faster than the market across all of our businesses. We are also rewarding investors by returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders, which compounds the benefit of our future growth for long-term shareholders.","With that, let\u2019s move to Q&A. Ann?","Ann Nicholson","Thanks, Tony. Tanya, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox","Thanks. Good morning and congratulations on the results. Wendell, bit of an open-ended question for you on optical, so you obviously are growing a lot faster than market. So I was curious if you could maybe one, talk about some of the key end-markets you are serving and what you are expecting in terms of spending there? And then one of the key innovations that are driving the out-growth in say like datacenter, broadband and wireless? Thanks.","Wendell Weeks","Thanks for the question, Steve. So, the primary reason we are growing faster in the market really has sort of two layers to it. First of all, in just seeing new networks being put in place that used to be fiber-poor and because of the requirements in our innovations are going to be fiber-rich. So in a way for us you can think about it as it\u2019s not just more networks right, but basically it\u2019s more us in the network and that\u2019s why you start to see us begin to differentiate for the industry growth. Take something like wireless as everybody has heard a lot about 4G densification or 5G, wireless today is a relatively fiber lean architecture. As you move to the wireless of the future, you end up adding a lot of glass, so as they talk about wireless networks densifying what that really means is they are glassifying. And so if you compare us to others who already in the wireless market, we were pretty small, but now we are getting pretty big, because of our innovations in the requirements for what it is, how you need fiber optics expertise offer. You see a similar dynamic happening in datacenters with the continued strong growth really at the percent of the load that\u2019s cloud based, which then allows when you do things like public cloud into very large private cloud. You would concentrate much more processing power, right, that is shared across many, that then makes it more economical, which we have that bandwidth all in one place, so start using fiber where you used to use copper, so once again, a substitution effect. Now, all of these things are furthered by the dynamic that we have a set of unique innovations in all of those areas that give us some additional advantage versus other players. So that\u2019s why you tend to see the difference. Now, then you asked another question which is where do we expect to see the growth here in the coming years. We expect to see it being driven by in access networks, especially with an accent on wireless densification. And then we do expect to see a hyperscale datacenter business to continue to grow strongly and has now a new concept of sort of what edge compute and where edge cloud is that also opening up some opportunities for us. So, sorry for the long answer, Steve and does that get at the core of what you are talking about.","Steven Fox","Yes, it does. Just one other clarification on the hyperscale builds, can you just sort of talk about how that plays out. It tends to be lumpy in general. Did these new contracts actually smooth out the business for you and like what\u2019s involved in them if you can expand \u2013 to the extent you expand on that?","Wendell Weeks","That\u2019s a really good question. So you rise if they tend to be pretty big construction projects to the little like our access network builds, which are also big civil works projects. They can be kind of lumpy. I think what the new contracts do here not so much has changed the civil works of reality of putting in these large facilities. As it does is it increases both the size of our business and the number of different areas that we are doing, the number of different customers that we are doing it with and the number of different locations we are building at. So by increasing the number of projects in a way it becomes a little smoother, not because the individual projects aren\u2019t lumpy, they are, but that they end up being in slightly different stages at different times. But I am quite sure at some point we will hit a time where things look a little lumpier because the number of the projects go together.","Steven Fox","Great. It\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Wendell Weeks","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini. Please go ahead.","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Tony, you are displaying net income margin average 25% for 2018 and it was in the 28% range for \u201817, you are talking about continued improvement, should I assume that it\u2019s going to take couple of years to get back to that 28% margin or is there any other metric that you can provide so that we could better see how the margin improvement, especially for display going to track? And then for Wendell, specialty material, you have been investing in diversifying outside of the smartphone, it\u2019s great to know that you have higher content in the smartphone, but can you provide us an update on diversification out of the smartphone and into other end markets? Thank you.","Wendell Weeks","Sure, Mehdi. Let me take the display question first. I mean, clearly what happened to us in display in the first half of the year is that we saw our \u2013 some margin contraction and that was driven both by our investment in Gen 10.5, but then was also driven by our fleet optimization. And what we saw in the second half of the year was the benefit of those things to occur. And you saw it in the fourth quarter results where our profits were up more than our \u2013 the sales were I mean year-over-year basis. And so when we have always talked about stabilization, what we have talked about is getting to a certain profit level and continuing that on a going forward basis. And we think that we feel good about the stabilization we saw in the second half, in fact the fact that we grew profits in the second half and we think that\u2019s evidence of the strategy that we have been working on for a number of years really starting to pay off. And then to the content piece and wearables going outside of smartphone, we of course expect smartphones for the foreseeable future to be people\u2019s primary device. But where we are making really strong progress is in the areas like wearables, notebooks and augmented realty, right. And so in wearables and notebooks what we have done in both of those areas is introduced using our vapor deposition technologies new composite materials that take our value on something like a wearable and in notebook up like a factor of five. And so either outside smartphones you can see us playing the same basic approach which is getting our new innovations adopted in those areas that also allows to add value. Then you have entirely new device categories like augmented reality where you are seeing the potential start to take shape for really significant innovation and the vast new device category, but it\u2019s soon, it\u2019s too soon to get too excited about it. This is the time for all the positioning innovations and that\u2019s something that years from now will offer a larger opportunity for us than what it is smartphones do today. But that\u2019s going to take a while to develop.","Mehdi Hosseini","Can I have a follow-up here if I may? It seems to me in the specialty material and environmental technology you are executing and able to increase content either for smartphone or for other applications, as to end market diversification is maybe a couple of years away, is that the best way to summarize this?","Wendell Weeks","Yes. It\u2019s really interesting what you have noted, because we think it\u2019s one of the things it\u2019s making us more resilient from an economic standpoint is you have noted that in those two areas we are not necessarily talking about more devices, you\u2019re talking about more Corning. And if you\u2019re listening when I answered Steven question of why are we growing faster in communications than everybody, the communications infrastructure. Once again, it\u2019s an answer of more of our content. It\u2019s more us necessarily we had more networks. In Automotive, which you\u2019ve heard Tony talk about is, we\u2019re not counting on more cars, what we\u2019re counting on is more content from us with Gas Particulate Filters, our Auto Glass Solutions. So, you\u2019re right, you\u2019re not seeing us diversify out of our core market access platforms are 5 [ph], instead you\u2019re seeing us get more product opportunities within it. We believe this is going to reduce our degree of economic sensitivity and increase the resilience of our growth, that\u2019s really observing. Thank you for asking that.","Mehdi Hosseini","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Tony, can you address sort of the overall gross margins in 2019, pretty easy compares from Q1 of last year when you are ramping your Gen 10, but you\u2019re talking about only a marginal uplift here in Q1 of this year and you noted some investments. So, could you just give us some sense on sort of the magnitude of these investments and the overall magnitude of gross margin improvement like as 50 basis points or 100 basis points in 2019? And a quick follow-up to your comment about China end market assumptions being conservative. Can you maybe quantify those? Are you talking about auto production down 10% like what is smartphone assumptions, what TV unit assumptions, that would be helpful? Thank you.","Tony Tripeny","Sure. Wamsi, overall, we\u2019re really pleased with our gross margin performance. We said at the beginning of 2018 that we\u2019re investing intensely and that would lead to significant growth and margin expansion in the back half and that\u2019s exactly what happened. Our sales were up 16% in back half over the first half and our gross margins expanded about 150 basis points. And we expect going forward continued strong margin performance both in dollars and percentages but does get somewhat muted by investments that we\u2019re making. And the good news is, those investments are for committed growth in Optical Communications, GPF, and then Auto Glass, and we\u2019re going to start seeing those investments starting in Q2, the benefits of those investments and it\u2019s going to expand from there. Now in any given quarter things are going to be impacted by seasonality of our businesses like it is in the first quarter by the various mixes that we have in the businesses, but we\u2019re happy with our \u2013 each of our businesses\u2019 performances, they are the best in the industries and also just like the total impact of these investments. So, in Q1 you see some of these investments impacting us, but the main reason why Q1 is down versus Q4 is really the seasonality not the investments. In terms of China, we were happy with the approach we took in the third and the fourth quarter. It turned out that we were exactly right on both in terms of where the auto production ended up in China and also from a TV standpoint. So, we feel good about that and as we go forward into next year, we\u2019re assuming the declines in both of those markets and the strong guidance that I gave you for the year.","Ann Nicholson","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Rod Hall","Yes, hi guys, thanks for fitting me in. I just had a real quick question on the full-year guidance, maybe a two-parter actually. So, the guidance is better than we expected. The most bullish point of it is Display. And I wondered if within Display you could talk about the interplay of your share assumptions versus unit growth assumptions. So, any color you can give us on which of those \u2013 how much share you expect to gain for example would be interesting? And then on Specialty, is all of the weakness or the slowdown in Specialty China or are there other macro issues that you see or demand issues, just any further color on that would also be helpful in that full year guide? Thanks.","Tony Tripeny","Sure. Let me start with the Display guidance. Fundamentally, what drives our, the Glass market and Display, of course, is screen size. And in 2018, the screen size drove the market growth to the mid single-digits and that\u2019s what we expect to happen again. Now, we also were benefited a little bit in 2018, where the number of TV units went up, but that\u2019s still \u2013 what really matters here is the screen size growth. As we go into 2019 we again think the market is going to grow about the mid single-digits and what\u2019s driving that is the screen size growth. Now, most people looking at the market think that TV units themselves are going to be flat to down a little bit, a lot of that being driven in China and we have factored that into our projections. But what really drives the market is the screen size growth and we expect it once again to be in about the mid single-digits. Now we will grow faster than that because of the Gen 10.5 ramp. But generally speaking, it\u2019s about the mid single-digits. Relative to Specialty Materials, again what really drives the growth there is the technology adoption of our products, which as Wendell would say, having more Corning in those products. Last year, I think most people believe smartphones were down a little bit. That\u2019s what they are projecting again for this year, lot of that being driven in China, but the reason that we are confident that we can be up is because of the adoption of the technologies. How much were going to be up will depend on the actual timing of that adoption, but we feel pretty good about that.","Rod Hall","Okay.","Wendell Weeks","Just briefly on your share question, we cannot think about it so much as share as what\u2019s happening is with this constant move to larger-sized TVs and these new Gen 10.5 plants that are getting built. When those happen, we co-locate and build a Gen 10.5 glass plant with a customer. And since those plants have a much lower cost platform for our overall large television panels, what we expect is that category of Gen 10.5 to take more and more of the market and it just so happens that because of our lead technically right, that ends up being more us than in the below 10 Gen \u2013 than the below 10.5. So, that\u2019s another dynamic. This is what\u2019s leading to the more us than Tony\u2019s comments of the overall market growth. Did that answer your question, Rod?","Rod Hall","Yes, thanks Wendell. It\u2019s very helpful. Appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Asiya Merchant. Please go ahead.","Asiya Merchant","Thank you and congratulations as well on the strong quarter. Quick question on Optical, you guys have been posting strong net income margin growth in that segment. Obviously, as you scale, it\u2019s still obviously below Display. How should we think about the improvement in utilization helping to kind of bridge that gap? Are we ever going to get to margin, not net income, but even on the gross margin line getting to corporate average given the additional investments you are going to be making in 2019? Thank you.","Tony Tripeny","Yes. We are really thrilled with our performance in our Optical Communications business. I mean, we have both been growing sales significantly and we have been growing our profitability even greater than that. And that\u2019s what the real focus is on any given business unit at Corning. I mean, that\u2019s how we measure the business unit success and we are having great success in Optical Communications. We have had some margin expansion in that business and I would expect to continue to have some margin expansion in that business. And I think that\u2019s the way to model. We don\u2019t spend a lot of time comparing business to business, because each of them have different economics and different levels of investment, but I mean we feel great about the Optical Communications performance.","Asiya Merchant","Great. And just if I may given that you are annualizing the 3M acquisition in 2019, the core organic, is that still growing at low-teens or is there any downshift in expectations there?","Tony Tripeny","No, we feel great about our organic growth and in fact if you look at the Q1 numbers, the organic growth is almost about 20% on a year-over-year basis. So we feel really good about organic growth.","Asiya Merchant","Great. Thank you.","Ann Nicholson","We have time for one more question we can squeeze in.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath. Please go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath","Yes. Hey, thanks. Hey, Wendell, I must say solid results here. My question is not on Optical this time it\u2019s on Auto Glass, continue to hear lot of news flow around AutoGrade Glass you\u2019re getting into Automotive Interiors, talk to us about how the demand \u2013 how that business kind of unravels heading into rest of the year? Thanks.","Wendell Weeks","Thanks for noticing what everything that our customers are saying about us. As I shared last quarter basically our AutoGrade Interior opportunity has come a lot faster than we were ready for operationally. And so we\u2019re investing in a dedicated plant that uses our unique vapor deposition technologies and a part-making capability to be able to set up to start to serve that really strong committed demand that we\u2019re getting. I think this year is going to be that year where you\u2019re seeing the real breakthrough and you\u2019ll start to see the revenues really start to flow. Getting it exactly right of where on the adoption curve we are, we\u2019re still a little early, right, to be able to accurately call while I think the rate of adoption is going to be excellent, revenue growth is going to be, why, we\u2019re still a little bit early to be able to call it, but the great news is, is that\u2019s going to be a real business and it\u2019s going to have real revenues and we\u2019re investing against it and ultimately, we think it\u2019s going to be a real big business. If we\u2019re right on our innovations and this product is as cool as we think it is, we\u2019ll go and like this.","Vijay Bhagavath","Excellent. Thank you, again.","Ann Nicholson","Thanks, Vijay. And I shall close by saying thank you all for joining us. I also want to let you know that we\u2019ll be at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference on February 12, and we\u2019ll be hosting an Investor Day in New York City on June 14. We\u2019ll also be hosting some virtual presentations and webcasts on business topics throughout the year. Finally, the web replay of today\u2019s call will be available on our site starting later this morning. Once again, thank you all for joining us. Tony, that concludes our call.

[Operator instructions.] I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Division Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Ann Nicholson. Please go ahead. ","Ann Nicholson","Thank you, operator, and good morning. Welcome to Corning's fourth quarter conference call. With me today is Jim Flaws, vice chairman and chief financial officer. Before we begin our formal comments, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These remarks involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's SEC reports.","You should also note that this presentation contains a number of non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation can be found on our website. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim.","James Flaws ","Thanks, Ann. Good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to begin today by looking back at what we said one year ago. In our January 2013 earnings call, we announced record sales for the fourth quarter 2012 and also for the full year of 2012. But far more importantly, we had reported our quarter four 2012 earnings per share were up year over year.","This was significant, as it marked the first of what has now become five consecutive quarters of year over year earnings growth. Coming into 2013, we told investors we made progress against our goal to [form bottom and march up], but still had work ahead of us. Specifically, our goal was to stabilize display earnings through LCD glass price decline moderation and drive earnings growth with our optical communications, specialty, environmental, and life science segments.","Now, as we look at our 2013 results, we can declare that we achieved our goal. We have formed bottom, and we\u2019ve begun our march up. For the full year, we grew core sales 5%, we improved core gross margin, we reduced operating expense in dollars and as a percentage of sales, we grew our core NPAT at 13%. We retained our strong balance sheet while also returning more cash to shareholders in the form of an 11% dividend increase and execution of $1.5 billion in share repurchases. And aided by those share repurchases, we grew EPS 16%. ","We also announced and have now just closed on a fantastic transaction with Samsung for the full ownership of our equity venture SCP. We believe the numerous strategic and financial benefits will strengthen the LCD business, broaden our relationship with Samsung, and provide outstanding returns to shareholders. I\u2019ll be providing some more information on the consolidated NE for your modeling purposes in my outlook section.","I\u2019d like to turn to our quarter four results, beginning with some highlights. Now, as a reminder, we provide core performance results in order to exclude nonperformance related items and increase the transparency of our operating results. ","Core financial measures are a non-GAAP financial measure, and we continue to report our GAAP results. You\u2019ll find detailed reconciliations on our website, outlining the differences between these non-GAAP measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measures. ","We had a solid quarter that was better than we originally expected. With volume up almost 5% year over year and 2% sequentially, display set a new quarterly record for sales volume. LCD glass price declines were again moderate. LCD glass demand continues to be good, and we believe this is driven by good retail demand in Q4 for larger televisions and expectations for Q1, specifically the Chinese New Year.","In this morning\u2019s press release, we announced that we expect higher price declines in quarter one of 2014 than in previous quarters. I want to be clear here that we believe this is a one-quarter phenomenon that we do not expect to repeat. And I\u2019ll cover this in more detail in the display outlook section.","Optical communications, life sciences, and environmental all performed better for the quarter than we expected, and I\u2019ll get to those details in a minute. Our one miss for the quarter was specialty materials. Gorilla Glass volume was lower than expected by approximately 10% and, along with product mix, reduced specialty materials profitability sequentially. On the other hand, specialty materials full year profits were only down slightly, despite the 13% decrease in year over year sales. ","So let\u2019s go to the fourth quarter. Our sales were $2 billion, down slightly versus last year. Gross margin was 40%, lower than our expectation of 42%. Two main factors drove the decreased gross margin. First, lower than expected volume for Gorilla Glass impacted gross margin versus forecast, and second, the additional sales in optical communications were in lower-margin products. And I\u2019ll cover each of these in detail shortly.","SG&A spending was higher year over year, driven mainly by the increased accrual for performance-based compensation. RD&E was down versus a year ago, reflecting our cost control efforts. Other income included a payment for the settlement of a dispute over the use of fusion technology in China. Details can be found on our November 15, 2013 filing.","Gross equity earnings of $121 million were down about 20% year over year, driven by SEP\u2019s year over year price declines on relatively consistent glass volume. And finally, our EPS was $0.29, up $0.01 versus a year ago.","On October 31, we announced a $1 billion accelerated stock repurchase plan, which retired 47 million shares. We also repurchased $75 million of shares under our open market repurchase program during the quarter. So in 2013, in total, we used $1.5 billion of the $2 billion program that we had announced in April. We ended 2013 with 1.401 billion outstanding common shares. ","For the year, sales were $7.95 billion, or almost $8 billion, up 5% over 2012. Corporate gross margin was up half a percentage point, driven by improved manufacturing efficiencies in optical communications, specialty materials, and environmental. Additionally LCD glass gross margins were down only slightly, driven by cost reduction programs.","We lowered S&A and R&D for the year in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales, reflecting our cost control measures. Moving down the income statement, gross equity earnings were down 17%, reflecting the year over year price declines at SEP. Our effective tax rate for the year was 17%.","EPS for the year was $1.23, up 16%. This year over year improvement is the result of our ability to manage spending, improve profitability through manufacturing cost reductions and other programs, and maintain moderate price declines for LCD glass.","Now I\u2019d like to turn to the detailed segment results, and I\u2019ll start with display. Display sales were $665 million in Q4, a 5% decrease versus last year. Sequentially, Corning and SEP\u2019s combined volume was up slightly. Overall, our market share remained stable and LCD glass price declines were moderate.","Gross equity earnings from our equity venture in Korea, SEP, were $85 million in Q4, a decrease of 24% versus last year. In addition to year over year price declines and slightly lower volume, SEP had had a high level sales back to Corning\u2019s base display in Q4 of 2012 that did not repeat in Q4 of 2013. You may recall that our base display and Gorilla businesses were quite full in quarter four of 2012.","Now, for your modeling purposes, display equity affiliates fourth quarter display glass sales were about $522 million, a decrease of 19% from the prior year. As a reminder, this represents SEP\u2019s LCD sales only. Our public filings will report display equity affiliates total sales, which include other products.","Net income was down 1%, reflecting the impact of price declines offsetting higher volume, and year over year cost reductions helped maintain these stable profits. For the year, our wholly owned display segment sales were $2.7 billion, up 7%. Higher volumes more than offset price declines. Net income was up slightly.","Display manufacturing efficiencies were impacted in the first half of the year by air freight costs, but for the full year, manufacturing cost per square foot decreased. The customer agreements that stabilized our share have helped the manufacturing organization manage capacity to demand, and we look forward to the renewed agreements maintaining that stability in 2014.","Now turning to the industry, we estimate the glass market at retail for 2013 was almost 4 billion square feet, up about 10%. Our preliminary estimates of TV sell in indicate year over year unit sales were up slightly. All regions except Europe and Japan grew unit sales year over year. Average TV screen size increased again in 2013, and drove glass market growth. We estimate TV area growth was up more than 10%, and 50 inch televisions grew 90% in 2013.","On the supply chain front, we estimate inventory ended the year at about 17 weeks, and is spread fairly evenly along the supply chain. This is in the range we would consider healthy and reasonable for entering 2014. I\u2019ll talk more about the industry in our outlook shortly.","Now, we\u2019ve renamed our telecommunications segment optical communications. For those of you not familiar with this 40-year-young business, we invented the world\u2019s first low loss optical fiber in 1970. Over the last 40 years, in addition to manufacturing optical fiber and cable, we have increasingly moved into providing optical solutions that include hardware and equipment. ","Today, we are a comprehensive provider of industry moving optical solutions across the broader communications industry. The new name better reflects the major communications groups that we serve, carrier, or public, networks, and enterprise, or private, networks. This segment will be classified in those two main categories, carrier networks and enterprise networks, and we\u2019ll be providing more details in the upcoming 10-K. ","In optical communications, Q4 sales were $605 million, up 12% versus last year and better than we had expected. Carrier sales in North America drove the increase versus expectations. Net income, however, was down 18%. The primary driver of the decline was product mix, with higher sales volume of lower margin products than in Q4 of 2013. Also contributing to the year over year earnings decline were price declines and our decision to scale back optical fiber production.","For the full year, sales were $2.3 billion, up 9%. Sales in all regions were up year over year. Carrier, including wireless and enterprise sales were both up, offsetting fiber weaknesses in China. We\u2019re very pleased with these results. Optical communications annual net income in 2013 was up 43%. The additional sales volume and manufacturing efficiencies drove the improvement, offsetting the year over year price declines of certain products and the unfavorable mix.","Now in our environmental segment, Q4 sales were $238 million, up 9% versus last year, and better than we had expected. We saw positive indicators in the U.S. heavy duty truck market and European demand for light duty diesel products bounced back a little in the fourth quarter. Net income was up 124% versus a weak fourth quarter last year, driven by volume gains in diesel and auto.","For the full year, environmental sales were down 5%, driven primarily by lower sales of diesel products due to weak demand for diesel cars in Europe and lower class A truck production in North America. Now, despite these lower sales, environmental expanded their gross margins and grew net income by 9% in 2013, due to significant manufacturing efficiency improvements and reductions in operating expense.","We were delighted by the performance in environmental, and believe the business is now well-positioned with its improved margin structure and growth coming from the heavy duty market in China and Europe.","Specialty materials sales for the quarter were down 29% year over year and below our expectations. As you\u2019ll recall, Gorilla Glass sales in Q4 of 2012 were very strong, as device manufacturers prepared for 2013. As 2013 unfolded, it became apparent that some of the 2012 Q4 strength created an inventory overhang that was with us through most of last year. ","The softness versus our original expectations down 20% was due primarily to lower volume of Gorilla Glass for touch notebooks. Advanced optics sales were up year over year, driven by a recovery in the semiconductor industry. ","Net income in Q4 was down year over year, driven by the volume decline of Gorilla Glass and year over year expected price declines. For the full year, specialty sales were down 13%. The decline was mainly driven by the supply chain overbuild I just described, and also by much lower sales of large cover glass for televisions, which had been about $40 million in 2012, as well as some yield improvements in the supply chain.","We believe consumption of cover glass was up about 27% in 2013, and will be up again in 2014. We expect to see volume growth of Gorilla Glass more in line with consumption in 2014, and we\u2019ll be providing more details at our annual investor meeting on February 7. Advanced optics full year sales were consistent in 2012. ","Net income for the full year is a very good story. Gorilla Glass had another year of manufacturing efficiency improvements that led to segment gross margin improvement of 13%. Net income was down only $5 million, or 2%, on 13% sales decline.","Now turning to life sciences, Q4 sales were up year over year due to additional sales from our acquisition, which closed on October 31 of 2012. Net income was up 31% on the additional sales. For the year, life sciences sales were $851 million, up 30%, primarily driven by the Discovery Labware acquisition. Net income was up 92%, driven by the increased volume from the acquisition and very tight control on S&A and RD&E costs.","We were also delighted by life science performance in 2013, with the excellent integration of the acquisition delivering incremental profits, and we accomplished this despite the reduced market due to lower NIH funding.","At Dow Corning, gross equity earnings from the silicone segment were up slightly in Q4, driven by the higher volume and lower taxes. Price and FX partially offset these gains. In 2013, Dow Corning sales were down slightly, driven by price and volume declines, particularly in Europe and China, but their net income and our equity earnings were up slightly for the year, as a result of restructuring actions we took in 2012.","Now, on the balance sheet we ended the fourth quarter with $5.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. We had strong free cash flow for the quarter of about $500 million, despite spending $337 million in capital spending, and also the cash payment made to the minority shareholders for their share of SEP. We were able to complete the buyout of the minority holders in December. The purchase of Samsung shares of SEP occurred in January.","During the quarter, we also issued $250 million of senior unsecured notes. As a reminder, free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found on our website. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion of cash in the United States. ","Capital spending for the year turned out to be only $1 billion and below our forecast. Some expansion projects slowed their pace of spending to meet the expected demand level during the back half of 2013.","So now I\u2019ll go to the outlook, and I\u2019ll start with display. Since we\u2019ll be consolidating SEP, which has now been renamed to be Corning Precision Materials, or CPM, let me begin by how to estimate the impact on the display segment sales and earnings. ","We expect approximately $2 billion in additional sales in the display segment this year and next from consolidating 100% of CPM\u2019s LCD glass sales. You should calculate cost of goods sold based on your sales assumption, including depreciation, to get to gross margin. I urge you to remember that CPM did have lower performance in the back half of 2013, so please think about that performance level.","You must add their operating expense to SG&A and R&D. You\u2019ll need to make an estimate of the impact of synergies to both cost of sales and SG&A. Now, we\u2019re just completing the close in Q1, so the synergies in this quarter will be low. We expect them to ramp up rapidly in Q2 and through the remainder of the year. And finally, please remember that CPM will not have the benefit of interest income anymore, due to the dividend strip. ","This obviously gets you to net profit before taxes for the display segment. Corning\u2019s overall tax rate will change. Corning\u2019s taxes will now include the taxes paid by CPM in Korea. Expect our total effective tax rate to move from 17% in 2013 to approximately 22% in 2014. We will have amortization of intangibles and goodwill from the acquisition. As with other deals, we record these outside core earnings. ","Another area the consolidation impacts is our balance sheet. These changes are pretty straightforward. You need to subtract CPM from our investment balance and add the entity into assets and liabilities.","Finally, there are cash flows. In this case, you need to remember the $98 million cash dividend payment to Samsung, but remember, Corning will also no longer be getting cash dividends from CPM. However, we expect an additional $400 million to $500 million in free cash flow from CPM\u2019s operations.","We\u2019ll be providing detailed pro forma financial statements in March for investors to update their models with this information. Ann and Steven will be happy to answer any modeling questions you have as well.","Now turning to the industry, we feel good about the glass market as we enter 2014. Inventory levels appear healthy, glass supply seems aligned with demand, and we expect another year of glass volume growth at retail. Key contracts we entered into in late 2012 were renewed and extended into 2014. We expect our share to be stable in Q1 and throughout 2014.","Now, for the end market in 2014, we expect the retail market, as measured in square feet of glass, will be up mid to high single-digits. For reference, 2013 was nearly 4 billion square feet. We think LCD television units grow in the low to mid-single digits with area growth likely higher. We believe the trend of consumers to buy large televisions will continue.","We believe there will be PC market growth. We\u2019re expecting 7% to 12% year over year unit growth, with nearly all of it attributable to tablets. Monitor and notebook units are expected to be flat.","As we near the end of January, we see the Q1 LCD glass market declining low single digits sequentially. This reflects normal seasonality and of course the fewer shipping days in February compared to Q4. We expect our glass volume to be down in line with this market. ","Recall Q2 is the slowest retail season, so the supply chain should moderate in Q1 to manage inventory. You should note the LCD glass market and our volumes in Q1 are up year over year, reflecting our overall larger market. ","Now, we expect price declines in Q1 to be higher than the previous quarters. Recall that we first announced the new contracts in late 2012. They have mechanisms to adjust Corning\u2019s customers in accordance with competitive pricing at that customer. The higher Q1 decline is driven by the price mechanisms in these contracts. We don\u2019t know why the competition did the larger move. We suspect it may be related to compressing price differences among their customers.","We anticipate our price declines will return to more moderate levels after Q1 for several reasons. First, as I mentioned, we suspect the larger decline was related to competitors compressing price differences among their customers. ","Second, we believe that if prices were to continue to decline like they are in Q1, our competition would soon be incurring losses. Publicly available information shows our competitors are already operating their businesses with thin margins. Prices can only go down so much further before these competitors will be at or below breakeven. ","At those prices, though, Corning\u2019s business would be still quite profitable. Our analysis shows our costs are already lower than our competitors by a substantial percentage, and we anticipate this big cost advantage will only get bigger as we integrate the manufacturing assets of CPM. So even if our competitors were to drop price to where they\u2019d be at or below breakeven, we would still be generating a very healthy profit. ","Now, as for our glass capacity, I want to reiterate we intend to diligently manage our capacity to supply. Our new Korean entity, CPM, provides access to low-cost capacity, enabling us to optimize our manufacturing footprint and preserve profitability.","Moving to optical communications, we expect Q1 sales to be up in the mid-teens versus Q1 of 2013. You may recall Q1 of 2013 was a slow start to last year, particularly in North America, Europe, and China, and did not have the sales from consolidation of an equity affiliated acquisition. We expect higher year over year sales in carrier and enterprise in all regions, except China. ","In environmental, we expect Q1 sales to be up mid-single digits year over year, driven by the pickup in heavy duty diesel sales due to new regulations in Europe and China. We\u2019re pleased to see this demand from the new regulations, and expect it to drive our growth in heavy duty sales and profitability in 2014. Of course, we\u2019ll have more detail on this segment at our IR day next week. ","We expect specialty materials sales to be consistent year over year in Q1. For comparative purposes, specialty materials sales have always been weakest in the first quarter, as you can see in this chart. We do believe Gorilla Glass volume will be up significantly for the year, and better aligned with cover glass consumption. We expect moderate price declines in 2014, similar to 2013.","Although 2013 was not what we expected in terms of sales, we remain excited by what lies ahead for Gorilla Glass. Those of you who went to the Consumer Electronics Show saw firsthand our new product introductions. Our legendary Gorilla Glass is now thinner. It is now available as the world\u2019s first antimicrobial cover glass. It can be antireflective, and also manufactured in 3D shapes is extending in new markets. We will share more details at our investor meeting next week.","In life sciences, we expect sales to be consistent with last year\u2019s first quarter. Equity earnings from Dow Corning should be up for the total year. However, Q1 will be down versus a year ago, because some one-time favorable items that occurred a year ago don\u2019t repeat.","We expect gross margin to be almost 45%, driven by environmental\u2019s additional volume and display. Display gross margins improved versus last year, due to having no air freight costs and of course the consolidation of CPM.","SG&A and R&D will be lower year over year as a percentage of sales. Modeling total equity earnings in Q1 and going forward will be predominantly from Dow Corning equity earnings. Our other equity ventures are relatively small, and do not materially add to our results.","Our effective tax rate for 2014 should be approximately 22%. The projected rate is higher than 2013, driven by the addition of CPM\u2019s income, which is taxed at the Korean tax rate of 24%.","That concludes my opening comments. Ann?","Ann Nicholson","Thank you, Jim. Operator, we\u2019ll now open the lines for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question today comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Jim, you noted that this weaker pricing in Q1 could be temporary, but let\u2019s say that there is irrational behavior in the market and it persists for a little bit longer in the year. Given your comments around what the retail square footage growth is, is it reasonable to assume a base case that display revenue would actually contract in 2014?","James Flaws ","It obviously depends on whether the higher price declines continue all year long. So you can do the math as well as I can. I mean, you can make that case, but I emphasize again we believe that price declines will return to more moderate levels in Q2 and beyond.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","But given the fact that the retail square footage is going to expand in the mid to high single digits, even if we go to traditional price declines of high single digit, we\u2019re talking about roughly flattish. Is that right?","James Flaws ","It\u2019s very possible that\u2019s how the math would work.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And as a quick follow up, can you address the weaker performance in specialty? Do you think the issue is anything unrelated to inventory? Can you maybe answer that in light of your competitive glass in sapphires and alternative materials?","James Flaws ","We believe that specialty materials results, first in Q4 were weaker than our original expectations, because of touch on notebook missed our goal. Everything else was in line with what we expected. We believe we\u2019ve been dealing with this supply chain issue that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012 all year long. We think we\u2019re done with that. ","We do not feel we are losing market share to other aluminosilicate high performance glasses in any material amount. We do at lower end, items compete with soda lime, and we have yet to see any evidence of sapphire on any devices. So again, the performance last year we attribute to this carryover of a large amount of square feet in the supply chain and then second, the fact that touch on notebooks did not grow against our expectations. ","Operator","The next question today comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. ","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group","Jim, just a clarification. Did you say that on square foot, the TV application grew 10%, and this year it\u2019s going to grow by 5%? Did I hear that right?","James Flaws ","I said that TV area growth grew 10% last year, and that area growth this year could approach that number.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group ","And then for just overall glass consumption, how is the TV mix in \u201913 going to look in \u201914?","James Flaws ","Televisions are in the low 60% range of total glass used.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group ","But no change from \u201913 to \u201914?","James Flaws ","Nothing significant.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group ","And then one last question on the specialty material. Can you help me understand the mix of Gorilla as a percentage of overall specialty material, and how is that mix going to change in \u201914?","James Flaws ","I don\u2019t have the number handy, but Gorilla Glass will grow as a percentage of overall specialty materials. And you can check in with Ann later if you want. She can get you the exact number.  ","Operator","The next question will come from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. ","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets ","The working presumption when the pricing was adjusted for market share about a year ago was that the rational behavior should prevail. Yet when we see these pricing mechanisms kick in as competitors compress price, just wondering, recognizing that Corning\u2019s [fiduciary] is to shareholders and your commitments to profitability and margins, you\u2019re also competing with companies who seem more focused on employment and just kind of running the business, as opposed to profit. So is there any further thought that they will revert back to what is more normal in terms of pricing?","James Flaws ","I want to be careful about commenting too much on our competitors, but I will draw your attention to the fact that after we put these agreements in, we announced them in October of 2012, we had a period of time where moderate price declines happened quarter after quarter. ","We obviously can never know for sure what our competitors are doing and why, but as I outlined in my prepared comments, we suspect that they may have had a compression issue that they had to deal with between some of their customers, and that may have led them to make this larger decline in this quarter. ","I can\u2019t comment beyond that on our competitors\u2019 motivations and what they\u2019re intending to do. I can only point you to the fact that basically in the four quarters prior, of 2013, we had moderate price declines. ","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets ","And then maybe on capex, you underspent in capex in 2013. How should we recalibrate your assumptions for 2014? And along those lines, as we look for growth opportunities ahead, can you just talk about maybe what would be the new thing we should be looking for? Maybe touch notebooks? Automobile applications such as the BMW i8? What do you see kind of percolating for higher demand in the next few years?","James Flaws ","Let me talk about capex. We had previously given guidance for 2014 of $1.3 billion. The lower spending in 2013 will not add to that. So the only thing that would add to it is CPM, which I think we\u2019ve told you before would be about $200 million. So our guidance is $1.5 billion for 2014. There\u2019s no carryover that\u2019s going to affect and drive the number up, because we underspent last year.","As far as growth prospects going forward, I\u2019d like to just reserve on that, because in about 10 days\u2019 time, you\u2019ll have an opportunity to see what we\u2019re talking about in terms of growth. And actually, the whole theme of our investor relations day is about growing the company. ","We, as I said in my opening remarks, feel like we\u2019ve achieved our primary objective over the past year, which was to stop going down and start growing up. We\u2019ve done that. But the key to us growing further is going to grow sales, and that will be a theme of the day, and we hope you\u2019ll be able to attend. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Amitabh Passi with UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS ","A couple from me. Jim, I wanted to clarify the gross margin guidance of 45%, was that for the full year, or just the first calendar quarter?","James Flaws ","That was for the first calendar quarter.","Amitabh Passi - UBS ","And then any help in terms of how we should be thinking about your synergy expectations and how they flow through the year? I know you put out a schedule when you did the transaction. Are those numbers still reasonably accurate? Or can you give us any guidance in terms of the quarter to quarter progression on the synergy front? ","James Flaws ","The numbers overall are pretty accurate. And you\u2019re not going to get much of it in Q1. I would say you take the amount we gave you and then divide it by three quarters. Q2 would probably be a little less than that, and then Q3 and Q4 will be in full bloom on that. And the CFO of the display sector yesterday that he\u2019s prepared to report out on synergies to investors as we go along, he\u2019s so confident. So we\u2019ll be able to do that for you.","Amitabh Passi - UBS ","And then just finally, assuming glass revenues for the display segment are relatively consistent this year, in 2013, given your commentary on synergies, is there still the potential to drive net income higher in 2014, given that we assume a flat to moderately really down sales scenario? ","James Flaws ","Sure, we\u2019re still backing what we said in October, that we believe we can drive the fully diluted EPS for the company up 20% this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian White from Cantor Fitzgerald. ","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","I\u2019m wondering if you could talk a little bit about 4K TVs, curved TVs, kind of what you think it means to the TV market over the next couple of years. And also, some of the antimicrobial glass, what does that mean to Gorilla in terms of margins, upgrades, so on and so forth? Because I think there\u2019s obviously big demand for that type of product.","James Flaws ","On antimicrobial, we believe it enhances the results of Gorilla. We have not detailed yet the pricing of it, and the impact, but we believe it will enhance it. The key for us is obviously getting our first customer on a mobile device. We have our first customer, as we showed at CES, already, which is Steelcase, which are using it on their little LCD panels they have for offices. But we need to get a cell phone. But we believe it will be an enhancer over time, and we\u2019re quite delighted by that.","Relative to television demand, we think ultra high definition will be a driver of replacement rate, but the pace of it we\u2019re a little unsure of right now. We think it\u2019s important. Curved TVs, it\u2019s perhaps a little bit in the eye of the beholder. For some people, I think that that will be a reason that they would want to purchase a new television. For us, it doesn\u2019t make any difference. The glass in the curved large televisions is the same as our normal glass. But again, at our IR day, we\u2019re going to talk about how we see the replacement rate and the impact on the growth in televisions going forward.","I would say that our observation is, ultra high definition is going to ultimately be a big driver of replacement rate, but the pace at which it happens is a little unclear to us now.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Patrick Newton with Stifel.","Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus ","I guess my first one for Jim, you discussed Gorilla Glass and its expectations, almost entirely due to touch on notebook in 4q. And touch on notebook largely disappointed as we moved through 2014. So I\u2019m curious if you could comment on why touch on notebook missed expectations. Is it lack of penetration in touch SKUs relative to what you were hoping for? Is it sell through that was soft? Is it overall consumers actually have a preference towards tablets rather than touch on notebook? What is that dynamic? And they how do you expect that to change as we move into 2014?","James Flaws ","I guess it\u2019s a lot of all of the above. Touch on notebooks has not grown as rapidly as we had hoped, and I think as the industry hopes. The detachables clearly have not turned out to be a very big part of the market. So that\u2019s been a disappointment. Our own forecasts are that it will grow this upcoming year. ","And then the other thing that we\u2019re experiencing, particular to us, on particularly low-end clamshell notebooks, is we\u2019re having to compete with soda lime. This is not with other aluminosilicate glasses. And that\u2019s clearly a challenge for us, and we\u2019re working on a solution to it. But I think overall the biggest thrust of this has been the disappointing take rate of touch on notebooks by consumers. ","Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus ","And then a few quarters ago you discussed LG10 and talked about perhaps the second tank being a 2014 event, and that you did not see them as a significant supplier in the industry. And I was just wondering if you could update us as to your expectations on a review of LG10 as a competitor, especially as we move through 2014.","James Flaws ","We do not feel LG10 is a significant competitor at all. Our observation, obviously based on publicly available data and looking from outside the gate, is that the second tank is not lit and is likely to be a year later than they originally planned. ","Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus ","And just one clarification on your tax rate. If I look at your corporate tax rate for 2013, and we incorporate the SEP 24% tax rate, to get to that 22% tax rate guidance, it would either imply that your core tax rate is increasing somewhat substantially year over year, or that SEP earnings are going to accelerate. Are one of those two a fair assumption?","James Flaws ","There\u2019s always things going on in our tax rate that we get some benefits, some things that may not repeat the next year, but I\u2019m going to be addressing the tax rate in more detail at the IR event, so I\u2019ll try to answer it more specifically then.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven Fox - Cross Research ","Just a couple of questions on Gorilla Glass for me. First, I know you want to save some stuff for the analyst day, but relative to the types of consumption growth of 27% that you talked about, what kind of growth are you looking for 2014? And without putting a number on it, can you talk qualitatively where you think things are better or worse?","And then secondly, where are we at with potential further improvements in Gorilla Glass margins? Have you optimized those exiting the year? And then lastly, just one minor detail, is Gorilla Glass going to remain as part of specialty materials going forward? Or would there be a reorg coming with the SEP deal? ","James Flaws ","There\u2019s no reorganization coming. Gorilla remains in specialty materials, which remains part of our Corning Glass Technologies Group, which is led by Jim [Clapton]. So no change on reorganization.","I expect our Gorilla Glass shipments, in terms of volume, to be up at least 30%, maybe a little bit higher than that, this upcoming year. And I didn\u2019t quite catch your second question on gross margin?","Steven Fox - Cross Research ","I know margins on Gorilla Glass have been improving during the year. Is there still more room to improve margins off of that type of volume? Or how optimized are Gorilla Glass margins at this point?","James Flaws ","There\u2019s fundamentally more opportunity to improve the gross margin. One of the most exciting things I think about the acquisition of CPM is that we have traditionally made some of our Gorilla Glass on some of our older tanks, and as you know, CPM had some low-cost tanks that were available, so Gorilla can be made there. So we clearly think we can improve margins on Gorilla going forward.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup ","First of all, a clarification. There was a $338 million other income in the P&L, much larger than last quarter. And you\u2019d mentioned something about a settlement in China that I missed. Are they related? And can you just go over again what that settlement from China was, and was that what drove that $338 million?","James Flaws ","The $338 million you\u2019re referring to is our GAAP numbers. That\u2019s where the FX hedge has to be. Remember, what we did with core earnings is we do it flat at the 93.5 yen exchange rate. Our hedge really, because the yen has moved up so much, we actually have a big gain on the hedge that we have to mark to market. You\u2019ll see fluctuations on that. We do that in the GAAP. So that\u2019s what\u2019s in the GAAP numbers. You\u2019ve got to look at the other income and expense under core.","But in core, we actually had some other income, other expense, as we call that line. We did have some favorable items in that this quarter. Principally, it was a settlement that we reached on an intellectual property dispute in China, and I think we outlined some of the details of that back in November.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup ","Do we have a size on how large that was?","James Flaws ","I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve disclosed that yet.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup ","Back to the price declines in Q1, competitive, what is the mechanism for you to learn of this? Do your customers, because you have these contracts with all your customers, is it that on November 30, one of them comes to you and says, hey, this is the price I\u2019m getting, you need to match it? Do they all come to you? At what point did you learn about this? And can you give us a sense as to, magnitude-wise, how much larger than the normal moderate price declines should we expect Q1 to be?","James Flaws ","First, we don\u2019t have these contracts at all our customers. We only have them at several. The way the contracts work, which is what we talked about back in the fall of 2012, is that at the end of the quarter, and I really mean the end of the quarter, our customers who have these contracts are required to tell us what the price that they got from competitors, through a mechanism at that customer. When they do that, then that becomes potentially our price under this contract. And we have chosen to operate that way with these contracts and renew them. So that\u2019s how it happens. So it happens literally at the end of the quarter. Relative to the level that we\u2019re seeing this upcoming quarter, I would say it\u2019s probably about double what we\u2019ve been seeing. ","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup ","And remind me again, if customer A comes to you and tells you that they got a price lower than what you\u2019ve been giving them, the contract implies that you must match that at that customer. Do you then have to take that to customers B, C, and D that are under these same contracts, and offer that same price, even if they hadn\u2019t been offered that by your competitor?","James Flaws ","No, it\u2019s very specific. The price at the customers who have this contract, it is set by this relationship at that customer.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup ","And can we infer, then, that therefore this price reset that is causing the lower price only happened at several customers and not at all customers that had the contract?","James Flaws ","I\u2019m not going to say anything further about where it occurred.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup ","[NEG] seems to be adding capacity in China and opening up a new plant there. Is that something that you\u2019re factoring into your numbers? And finally, I have a final question on notebooks and [NBT].","James Flaws ","Relative to NEG, the announcement on Friday of them building melting capacity, it\u2019s our understanding from the public statements as well as what we\u2019ve seen in analyst\u2019s reports, that they\u2019re going to be adding capacity, which is similar in size to what they added in Korea. The public statements and also what has been reported by analysts is similar to what they did in Korea, that they\u2019ll be taking Japanese capacity offline and transferring equipment. ","We don\u2019t believe this new capacity, based on what we\u2019ve seen, shows up in China for I think 2015 and 2016. And we think it\u2019s similar in size, as I said, to Korea. So we\u2019re not anticipating much impact of this short term. We believe that NEG would have been supplying China from their Japanese capacity and then as this new capacity comes up, obviously with transferred equipment, that some of the Japanese capacity goes down. ","It\u2019s pretty obvious to us that NEG, over the last few years, has moved from being an all-Japan model to having dispersed their capacity closer to their customers and perhaps away from earthquake zones. So it seems rational to us. ","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup ","And then finally, on touch notebooks, a target that you had several times during the year, and I think you were going to exit the year at 10% - not that you would exit the year 10%, but that 10% of notebooks would be touch exiting the year - it sounds like now you think that was a lower number. How much lower do you think it was? And do you have some sort of a target that you\u2019re looking for in 2014? ","And you mentioned soda lime. As we go into Best Buy and you see pretty much almost all notebooks seem to have touch now, maybe they have soda lime. It\u2019s hard to tell. But how does your [NBT], that was basically supposed to compete with soda lime and the price point, how is that competing. Just trying to differentiate the market versus your competitive offering. ","James Flaws ","I don\u2019t have much information right now about NBT. If you come to the investor day, you can talk to Jim Steiner. He can give you an update on how it\u2019s going. I think overall the year, touch on notebook was 11%. I think in the fourth quarter we estimated it was at 13%.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs ","Just one more question on the pricing. What is the incentive for competitors to lower the price when you\u2019re contractually locked into a certain market share? Or is that just a play to try to take share between the three suppliers? And I just want to clarify the pricing reset was just at one customer, or several? ","James Flaws ","We have not commented on the number of customers. It occurred at the customers we have the contracts with. In terms of the incentive, I can\u2019t really comment on motivations by our competitors. The one that you talk about is obviously something that could have occurred, but I can\u2019t know for sure what our competitors are doing and why.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs ","And then I just wanted to ask a little bit about your assumptions for the markets for this year. It sounded like you\u2019re assuming flat PC growth outside of tablets, and given that PCs have been declining, I was just curious why you\u2019d think that that improved this year. And then on the TV side, what are you seeing in the supply chain as we approach the World Cup? And is that historically the kind of event that has any impact on TV demand?","James Flaws ","I\u2019ll deal with the latter first. Sporting events do provide some increase in the television markets. We have seen that historically with World Cups, as well as Summer Olympics. One issue that we see is that often the impact on television consumption is higher, but less than what investors want it to be. We expect to see a similar phenomenon for the World Cup that occurs in the middle of this year.","I don\u2019t have the PC demand with me, but we think tablets are providing, I think, most of the growth for this year, and that we\u2019ve got, I think the notebooks, we have relatively flat.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs ","Right, that was my question. PCs have actually been declining, so just curious why you think it will be flat this year. Is there just something specific you\u2019re seeing? Or how high is your confidence on that forecast?","James Flaws ","My confidence is medium about the IT, but I would hope you come to the IR day, and you can talk to the guys running the business. They\u2019ll explain why they came up with the number.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Joseph Wolf with Barclays.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays ","Just two questions. One on the glass inventory, you mentioned it\u2019s 17 weeks, and thinking that that\u2019s stable. Is that the right number given the high number of different panel sizes, screen sizes, across the different devices? Or do you think that that moves seasonally like it did in 2013?","James Flaws ","","If you go back a couple of years, we would have said 17 weeks was high. But we believe the comment that you\u2019re making about the number of additional panel sizes has led people to carry more. So what we\u2019ve developed is, over the past year, we think 17 is acceptable.","In terms of the cycle of the weeks, remember, the weeks the way we do it is forward-looking, always. So as we get to the square footage of glass and look at quarter two, at the end of quarter one, the number will climb, simply because Q2 goes lower. So you always have to look at the two things in combination, the absolute inventory and the weeks, based on the forward-looking. But we feel pretty good about the inventory levels right now.","Operator","Our final question today will come from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan "," ","I guess I\u2019m going to have to go back to the pricing commentary. It sounds like you\u2019re saying that the competitors converged toward some lower price point that was in the market. At least that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking. What I don\u2019t understand is, and usually you have a good reason for saying things like this, why you have confidence that after Q1 that will rebound. Is there some dynamic we should be thinking about that would cause that pricing to come back in Q2? ","And then just a really quick second question. The Chinese fusion agreement, did you manage to stop them from using fusion technology altogether? Beyond the money, can you just tell us what else transpired in that deal that might be helpful to you?","James Flaws ","On the latter, there are limitations on their ability to use the fusion technology. And that\u2019s all I\u2019ll discuss at this point in time.  ","","On pricing, obviously this is a forecast. It is based on what we think happened, and therefore we were right on why it happened. We think there would be no reason for it to repeat in quarter two. I can\u2019t guarantee that, but we believe that what was happening with this compression and adjustment that had to be made by competitors among their customers ended up affecting us through this contractual arrangement. And we don\u2019t think that has to repeat, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re confident right now that Q2 will come back to more moderate price declines.","Okay, so we have a couple of IR announcements as a wrap up. First of all, as we mentioned several times today, we\u2019ll be holding our annual investor day in New York City, February 7, at the same location, Cipriani\u2019s, hopefully with no snow. We will have numerous hands-on demonstrations at our business exhibits, and as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ll be giving an overview of our growth expectations for 2014.","So in addition to myself, we will have our chief executive officer, Wendell Weeks, our new chief technology officer, and three business group leaders, who will be speaking to you about their plans to continue the march up of our earnings growth. It\u2019s going to be very informative, hands on, and I hope you will consider attending in person.","To summarize the results of the call, we finished 2013 with a very solid quarter, and achieved our goal of [forming the bottom, marching up], with the year over year earnings growth in every quarter this past year. We completed a major acquisition that we think brings the company and our shareholders numerous benefits, including media accretion and additional cash flows.","We\u2019ve continued to improve manufacturing efficiencies and control operating costs in most of our businesses, and ultimately, we grew earnings per share 16% year over year in 2013. Finally, we returned cash to shareholders with our share buyback program and 11% dividend increase.","We\u2019re coming into 2014 with expectations for continued growth in sales and even more in earnings. We intend to maintain stable display earnings with moderate price declines, very diligent management of our glass capacity, and continued cost reductions. And the prospects for growth in optical communications, especially materials, environmental and life sciences, are strong. ","So stay tuned for more details at our IR meeting next week. Ann? ","Ann Nicholson","Thank you, Jim, and thank you all for joining us today.

Welcome to the Corning Incorporated Quarter One 2015 Earnings Results.","It's my pleasure to turn the call over to Ann Nicholson, Division Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, John, and good morning. Welcome to Corning's first quarter conference call. With me today is Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Flaws, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin our formal comments, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These remarks involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. You should also note that this presentation contains a number of non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation can be found on our website.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jim.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Ann. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin today by looking back at what we said at our annual investor meeting in February regarding our plan for 2015. We said we'll have positive momentum in all our businesses and we expect this momentum to continue. We're leveraging our innovation engine to drive growth in today's businesses while also creating entirely new ones. We expect to grow sales and earnings this year, and we are executing on a commitment to return cash to shareholders.","So we're now three months into the year, and I am very pleased to say we're off to a great start towards these goals, exceeding our plan and consensus for quarter one. In the first quarter, we grew the company's core sales with Optical Communications exceeding expectations and Gorilla Glass volume up more than 20%.","We enjoyed moderate sequential price declines for LCD glass in the first quarter, and we now expect prices to decline even less in the second quarter. We closed three acquisitions in Optical Communications, which will extend our leadership in this segment. We grew our core NPAT by 14% year over year, and EPS by 21%. And we executed $502 million in share repurchases to retire a total of 21 million shares during the quarter. In summary, we had broad-based contributions to our first quarter results, and we look forward to this momentum continuing through Q2 and delivering a full year of strong performance.","Now, the euro weakening is affecting us somewhat, as it is many companies. The Q1 year-over-year impact for us was approximately $50 million in sales and $10 million of net income, or about 2% on each line. However, its impact did not prevent us from delivering excellent results. With the euro exchange rate now approximately 20% lower versus 2014, it is offsetting the growth in some of our businesses. So I'll walk through some additional detail on this impact as I walk through our results and outlook.","Now, one other note on FX, for those who are looking at our comparison against sales consensus, FX was the only reason that we missed sales consensus.","So let's delve into the first quarter details. As a reminder, these are core results. First quarter sales were $2.4 billion, up 4% versus last year, driven largely by Optical Communications, with help from Specialty's Gorilla Glass and Environmental. Excluding the impact of a weaker euro exchange rate, sales would have been up an additional $49 million or 7% versus Q1 of 2014.","Our gross margin was 44%, up year over year and better than we had expected. Gross margins improved in every business except Life Science. Improved manufacturing efficiency in Gorilla Glass was a big help.","SG&A spending was flat year over year, RD&E spending was lower year over year, driven by lower project spending compared to quarter one of 2014. Our gross equity earnings of $53 million were down 13% year over year and lower than we had expected, driven by lower equity earnings from Dow Corning.","Net income was up 14% versus last year, despite the impact of the weaker euro, which was a negative $10 million. The weaker euro impacted our Q1 results versus last year by approximately $0.01 a share. EPS was $0.35, up $0.06 or 21% versus last year, and better than Street consensus by $0.01. I'm delighted with this strong start to the year.","So now let's look at our detailed segment results, and we'll begin with Display. Display sales were $1 billion, slightly better than last year. Sequentially, quarter one price declines were moderate, and volume was down slightly, both as expected. However, versus quarter one of 2014, volume was up in the high teens.","Gross margins in Display were up versus last year, driven by the additional volume and synergies, offsetting price declines. Net income was up 4% year over year. There's no question that cost reduction efforts boosted by the CPM synergies and the moderate pricing environment have enabled us to maintain profitability in this business. We are very pleased with these results.","Now, looking at the supply chain, we estimate forward-looking weeks of inventory ended quarter one at about 18.5 weeks. While this is at the high end of the range we consider healthy, this was not unexpected since we are entering the lowest quarter for retail sales. Our model indicates this level will be the same at the end of Q2.","Now, let me turn to Optical Communications where sales were $697 million, up 18% versus last year and much better than our forecast. Sales for carrier networks were stronger than expected in North America. Both carrier and enterprise networks and the acquisition of TRM contributed to the year-over-year growth. Now the impact of the weaker euro lowered sales in this segment by $22 million. Net income in the segment was up 85%.","Now, Optical Communications has some euro-denominated costs, so the weaker euro impacted profitability only slightly. The additional volume in all parts of the business and the acquisition of TRM drove the higher net income. Our commercial and manufacturing organizations are the driving force behind these strong year-over-year results.","Now turning to Environmental. Q1 sales were $282 million, up 3% versus last year despite the weaker euro trimming sales by $16 million. Environmental sales were slightly better than expected, with strong heavy-duty sales in the United States driving growth. While we have some manufacturing in Europe, the majority of our cost in this segment are dollar based. So the weaker euro was a drag on year-over-year profitability in this segment and impacted net income in the segment by $6 million versus last year. Net income was still up $5 million, or 12%, mainly due to the higher volume of heavy-duty products and manufacturing efficiencies.","Now, in Specialty Materials, sales for the quarter were up 4% year over year. Gorilla Glass is off to a terrific start this year, with our volume growing more than 20% compared to last year. Gorilla Glass core sales are growing very well, as its value is being embraced by our OEM customers. Segment profitability improved sequentially and year over year, driven by gross margin improvements in Gorilla Glass.","Unfortunately, our Advanced Optics business sales declined versus last year, and that's the reason we missed our original segment sales forecast. We felt the impact of weaker demand at our semiconductor customers and the weaker euro also decreased sales by approximately $4 million. Nevertheless, net income in Q1 was up year over year by 44%, driven by Gorilla's higher volumes and improved manufacturing efficiencies. The impact of the Advanced Optics lower sales on net income is small, because its margins are lower than Gorilla Glass.","Now, Life Sciences Q1 sales were down 6% year over year. Net income was down 10%. Foreign exchange was the primary cause of the year-over-year weakness in both sales and profits. Equity earnings from Dow Corning were $51 million and short of our expectations, driven by the lower than expected sales of polysilicon. Recall Hemlock sales of polysilicon to solar customers exceeded our expectations in Q4 of 2014. We believe customers have pulled some demand into Q4 in order to meet contractual obligations. Sales fell off more than expected in Q1. Stronger dollar also impacted Dow Corning's sales and earnings and reduced Corning's equity earnings by about $4 million versus last year.","So now turning to the balance sheet, we delivered strong operational cash flow in the quarter of $600 million. Our capital spending forecast remains at the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion for the full year. During the quarter, we spent $531 million on four acquisitions and $502 million on share repurchases, leaves our balance sheet cash at a very healthy $5.1 billion, and we ended the quarter with approximately $2 billion of cash in the United States.","So my last Q1 update is regarding our FX hedges. During the first quarter, we further reduced our risk to the weaker yen in 2016 and 2017. Investors may recall we previously had protected approximately 80% of our 2016 profits and about 70% of 2017. I'm now pleased to say we've mitigated almost 100% of our estimated exposure through 2016 and 80% of 2017's exposure. As a reminder, our core rate on the yen is JPY 99.","Our yen translation hedges protect our earnings from fluctuation exchange rates and allow us to do constant currency, better known as core performance, on sales and NPAT for Display and some of Specialty Materials.","Now also during the quarter, we hedged against further euro weakness in 2015 and 2016. With these hedges, we've protected the majority of our estimated euro NPAT exposure for Environmental\/Life Sciences for this year and next. We don't do constant currency for the euro, so you'll see sales reflect the impact of the translation. The new euro hedge contract gains are recorded in other income\/other expense and obviously protect NPAT.","And now for our outlook. We expect the Q2 impact of the euro to be roughly the same amount as Q1 or approximately a negative $12 million of NPAT, or $0.01 of EPS compared to a year ago. We expect a similar impact in the back half of 2015 as well, if the euro stays at its current level.","Now let's begin with the Display outlook for business. We have no changes to our expectations for LCD retail and glass markets for the year. We expect the retail market as measured in square feet of glass to be up in the high single digits. We think LCD television units will grow mid single digits with area growth higher, driven by increasing screen sizes. We believe the trend of consumers buying larger televisions will continue. We are monitoring the effect of currency devaluations to the dollar on TV prices and TV market demand.","Historically, currency depreciation has not had a significant impact on television demand. While we only have two months of data for the year, TV's area sell-through is in fact ahead of our expectation. Many investors asked us about our expectations for ultra-high definition televisions, 4K. We believe ultra-high def has the opportunity to be a major driver of area demand in the near future. We're expecting approximately 25 million sets to be shipped in 2015, up from 10 million sets in 2014, and these ultra-high def sets have higher average screen sizes. So we continue to feel good about the retail market.","Inventory levels are high at the end of our estimate of the healthy range and reached this level a quarter earlier than recent history. But our supply actually remains quite tight to demand, especially in large-Gen sizes. Corning is running its online capacity at full utilization while keeping some capacity idle in order to maintain the right balance between supply and demand. Other major glass makers have publicly stated that they're keeping some capacity idle as well, and we believe they're also running their online capacity at full utilization.","Like many investors, we watch key indicators in the supply chain. One key indicator of supply chain health is the direction of panel prices. Another is the level of supply chain inventory. As I pointed out earlier, supply chain inventory has moved to the upper end of healthy range as retail enters its slow quarter. So it is not a surprise to see moderate declines in panel prices at this point in the year. We have not seen a negative impact from these indicators yet, but obviously remain very alert.","We expect the Q2 LCD glass market to be up low single digits sequentially, expect our glass volume to be up in line with market. Now, we expect LCD glass prices to decline even less than in Q1. When we look at the heartbeat of pricing without the impact of thick to thin conversions, we feel very good about the level of declines and especially the decline trend over the last four quarters, as the decline rate has moderated in each consecutive quarter.","We believe we can maintain moderate quarterly price declines for LCD glass in the back half as well for several reasons. Retail demand is expected to grow, helping to keep inventories from veering into unhealthy levels. Panel makers are profitable, and they're getting the benefit of the weaker yen. LCD glass industry supply is balanced to demand, and the operating margins of our competitors are such they can't afford large price declines if they hope to remain profitable.","Now, moving to Optical Communications, we expect Q2 sales to be up mid-teens versus Q2 of 2014. Fiber-to-the-home and data center sales in North America remain strong. Also contributing to growth will be the impact of the three previously announced acquisitions: TRM, Samsung fiber and cable, and iBwave.","In Environmental, we expect continued strength in the end market in Q2 and for our sales volume to be consistent with a strong Q2 of 2014. However, year-over-year Q2 sales are expected to be down mid single digits due to the impact of the weaker euro. We've made significant improvements to our cost and capability position in Environmental, and we expect to maintain these operational efficiencies in Q2.","So now turning to Specialty Materials, we expect another quarter of double-digit volume growth of Gorilla Glass versus last year. Offsetting this growth is continued weakness in our Advanced Optics business driven by continued softness at our semiconductor customers and a weak euro. So we expect total sales in the segment to be down mid single digits versus last year.","Now, we expect to win more models with Gorilla Glass 4 during the quarter and are on track for another year of volume growth for this business. Expect the market for cover glass to be up mid teens in volume terms, driven by smartphones and touch-enabled notebooks. We are expecting fewer tablets to be sold this year, which does impact our Gorilla Glass business. But this is mitigated by larger smartphone screen sizes and new handheld devices, including some with Gorilla on the back and continued share gains at Chinese OEM's.","In Life Sciences, we expect sales to be down slightly with last year's second quarter, driven by the weaker euro.","Continuing in the rest of our Q2 forecast, we expect Q2 equity earnings from Dow Corning to be approximately $60 million. This is up from Q1 in last year, driven by operational performance of Silicones business. Versus last year, sales for silicones are consistent and sales for polysilicon are down.","We expect gross margin to be approximately 45%, up 1 percentage point over last year, driven mainly by the additional volume in Optical Communications and improved Gorilla Glass margins. SG&A and R&D spending will be 13% and 8% of sales respectively and consistent with 2014. Other income\/other expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $40 million. Our effective tax rate for the full year of 2015 is expected to be approximately 18%.","So in summary, we're coming off a strong quarter and that momentum is expected to deliver growth again this quarter.","That concludes my opening comments. Ann?","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Jim. I will open the lines for questions. John?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operation Instructions] And first on the line of a Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Jim, I guess I wanted to dig into the euro exposure a little bit more. I mean, we've got some pretty good regional disclosure from you guys, but I guess I had two questions for you. One is by segment, are you able to let us know what the euro revenue exposure is, so that we can mark-to-market over time if the exchange rates continue to fluctuate? And then secondly, or alternatively, I guess, could you also let us know what the effective euro change was that you're using to calculate these euro impacts in the revenues that you called out to us?","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","I think we can give you some help on that, Rod. I'm not prepared to do it on the phone call, but I'm sure we can work with Ann and give you some help on that.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then the other thing I wanted to ask you, Jim, was on \u2013 just on 4K elasticity, I know I keep asking this question every quarter, but what are you guys absorbing on price elasticity and where do you think we are on pricing right now? I know that you've thought that pricing will continue to come down pretty significantly through the year, but just wonder if you could give us a little bit of an update on that.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","I don't have a lot of new information on 4K pricing. I mean, we did see good promotions during the period of time at \u2013 obviously at Christmas and for Super Bowl, but we continue to feel that the pricing is coming down. And a lot of set makers have just announced their new models. You've probably been seeing a lot of announcements, and they'll be available at retail starting late May, I believe.","We continue to believe it's approaching the level that will drive demand there. We talked before about hitting the 1.5 comparison to a good quality regular high-def set. We think we're making progress on that. I think you know that we've been feeling that 2016 is going to be the breakthrough year for ultra-high def. We think 2015 will be a good year. There are some people who think we're being a little conservative on that, and then we'll find out in the back half of the year.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think one thing I'd add for you, Rod, too is really intriguing what's happening, is that on top of the 2K\/4K, now we're seeing the introduction of a higher-end version with quantum dot technology, which they look terrific, by the way, and once again helps make OLED TV a more distant future possibility. But what I think to your question that offers up is you have now a new entry at the highest end, and they'll also carry pure ultra underneath, which ought to give them some good flex on being able to have ultra get closer and closer to standard def \u2013 standard high def.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Great. Thanks, Wendell.","Operator","Our next question's from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. And good morning. Gentlemen, if I look at the sequential growth in Display, are we starting to see some diminishing marginal utility for larger TVs? How long can we see this upgrade cycle for larger TVs before we see the 4K cycle start later this year? And as it relates to pricing, the price decline is definitely less than you had expected with this current supply-demand balance and rational behavior likely to continue, can pricing actually go up or maybe not go down?","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","I'll let Wendell take the price question.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Obviously, in our dreams pricing goes up, but the first step is for it to continue to diminish. And we've been delighted, as I said in the call, to have this happen four quarters in a row. So we think we've got good momentum there.","In terms of large sizes, we don't see a change statement coming in the continued growth of large-sized televisions. In fact every year for the last three years, we've, midyear, raised our size estimates, and that's continuing in the first couple months of retail that we've had and we have so far this year, it's continuing to grow. So we don't think we've come to the end of that cycle on standard high def, and clearly, ultra-high def will make it be even better, because those are sold in larger sizes, primarily, and also look much better in larger size.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And on price, as you heard Jim comment in his opening comments, we have a number of elements aligning that are helping us reduce the level of price decline quarter over quarter, and we really like the trend. And we expect those factors to continue to be in place. However, at this time, we're not anticipating being able to raise prices. That would be a fabulous problem to have in total. However, what we are looking very closely at is in the move to ultra-thin televisions and ultra-thin glass, there may be the opportunity there for us to introduce that product, there's a price premium. We're doing that currently. Whether or not that can sustain will really depend on both our competitors' capabilities and their mindset.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. And Wendell, can I ask a broader question? You have balance across business segments, four out of the five growing. Some of the business segments are at various life cycles, Display mature and generating cash, Optical seeing a resurgence in growth. Any inclination to think about separating business units or potentially splitting out segments, considering the different business segments that you have?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the way we think about our portfolio is that to continue to be in our portfolio, you have to do three things as a business unit. First, you have to be able to beat your competition. In other words, you have to grow sales and earnings faster than all your competition in your industry and overall. That's a very harsh metric, right? That's very hard to do. All of our segments are doing it.","Second, that as a segment, you have to have a set of assets that can potentially help other segments. Or three, you have to have a market access point that we can use the assets from our other segments or the corporation to create entirely new businesses.","So a great example of that would be our Environmental business. So Environmental is basically an automotive-driven business. We have significant assets, which is of course our R&D, as well as significant glass assets that we use to make LCD and Gorilla. What we're using that position in in Environmental to do and those strong customer relationships is to introduce Gorilla Glass to the automotive segment and be able to do it through the front end that we have in that segment. And we have a number of those examples.","So we're seeing a lot of that interaction with Glass, with Environmental, with Specialty of course, and in Opto as well, with being able to take into consumer electronics some of our Opto capabilities.","Life Sciences is the one where we have yet to prove that we can bring a significant new innovation to fundamentally turn that business into a stronger grower that makes use of our R&D investment. We anticipate to be able to answer that question shortly. If the answer ends up being no, then that's a candidate. But we think the answer is going to end up being yes.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Was that helpful or was that too much?","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. That's never enough.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to Amitabh Passi with UBS. Please go ahead.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning. Jim, I guess my first question for you is just on the Display segment. Seems like the first calendar quarter, volumes came in maybe slightly below expectations, down 5% sequentially. And then also the fact that inventories are now at 18.5 weeks, I mean they seem to be up quite a bit from 3Q 2014 at 15.5 weeks, and I think even last year you were around 17 weeks in 1Q and 16.5 weeks in 2Q. So just wanted to understand the inventory trends in the supply chain.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think the volume sequentially was in line with what we were thinking about. So I don't think it was something that was different from what we expected. Inventory is something we're very alert to. The last few years, the peak that we have \u2013 we see in the supply chain has been about 18.5 weeks. The fact that we're at that at the end of Q1 as opposed to the end of Q2 is something we're very alert to. But we are still within what we regard as a healthy range on inventory.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, your gross margin appears to be trending about 100 bps higher than last year. I mean is that trend you expect to sustain through the rest of the year?","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. We feel quite good about our gross margin trends. As you know, I often answer this by saying it depends somewhat on the mix of our businesses. But in four of our five segments, gross margin percent is going up in each one of them. And so the absolute balance of them has an impact, because obviously some segments had a lower gross margin. For example, Optical is lower. But we're improving gross margins in almost all of our businesses; especially delighted by the performance in Gorilla. So I would say it's sustainable as long as the markets remain at the level of volume we're seeing today.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Excellent. I'll jump back in queue. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Brian J. White - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hey, Jim, I'm wondering if you could just take us around the world and highlight what you're seeing in the TV market in terms of Europe, Asia and U.S. And maybe just compare \u2013 PC markets softened, so I'd be curious on what's happening in the TV market. Thanks.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","We don't have a tremendous amount of detail yet. I don't have full March results, unfortunately. But we've seen very good demand in North America. China, when you combine the first two months of the year, because remember the movement of the lunar holiday was January last year and this year it was in February has been good, large sizes have been good. The place where we're expecting some weakness at retail is around the comparisons on the World Cup last year, which will affect Europe and Latin America primarily.","I'd say the one place that we might be seeing slight weakness is Europe so far this year, and that's a slight disappointment to us, but clearly the economies over there have seen some turbulence. So good in the United States, good in China through the lunar holiday, weak in Europe and average size continuing to grow.","Brian J. White - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","And, Jim, just on the Gorilla Glass, I just want to be clear, you're targeting what volume growth? I heard a 15% number. Is that for Gorilla or the market or both?","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","That was for the market. We didn't give out a number for our own growth. As you know, it somewhat depends on the launch of models and also what the supply chain is doing. But we are expecting the market to grow in the mid double digits. We expect the markets' use of our glass to be higher than that, as we're gaining share. And we are obviously growing nicely with larger sizes. But our absolute number will be, in the end, dependent on what the ending inventory is in the supply chain. And that will be dependent on what people's outlooks are as they head into the next year.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And if I could build on that a little. So when we talk about the market growth, what we're really talking about is sort of the sell-in to the retail piece from our big OEM brands. And as Jim laid out, as the market growth outlook, that's the level we're looking at.","Brian J. White - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Got it. Thank you.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","If you take a look at that same level on Gorilla, we would expect Gorilla to grow faster, because we're building on an already very strong position. We're actually gaining ground both on the high end and the low end. And then what Jim's talking about that then depends on launches. Now, as you step back to how much glass we ship in any given quarter, that gets impacted by how our brand customers decide to build their supply chains.","There is one thing they never want to do, which is run out of glass at the beginning of their launches. So you can get big supply chain builds, and then you can get correction. So that makes that little hard to call in any given year in total where our shipments end up being. However, what we know is as long as our end market position continues to grow and continues to be strong, that's just a question of what quarter we get the demand in. So that's the real sort of heartbeat that we look at for demand.","Brian J. White - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go to Joseph Wolf with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. I wanted to just follow up briefly on the inventory. If you could give us a little bit more granularity? Is there are a percentage breakdown or a way we could look at the difference between inventory geared towards the television market and inventory geared towards the IT panel market?","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","I do not have that level of granularity. I can tell you where the inventory is high is at the set assembly level. It's not at retail. It's not at panel makers. But I do not have the granularity on the television versus IT.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then I guess there've been a couple of announcements, including the OLED lighting development with the Willow Glass. I'm wondering, is there any volumes we can start to think of over there, and how that impacts your overall supply-demand in glass, volumes and margins?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So on Willow Glass, we have now a number of significant near-term opportunities, and that we would hope are going to turn into significant revenues in the near future. It's too early to sort of spike the ball, but we are now working on three or four significant opportunities that have the opportunity to take Willow from being a commercially available product to a product that we start to make some good revenues on. So we're right at the beginning of that. More to come. More to come.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just finally, you mentioned this just briefly about the advances at the low end of the market in Gorilla Glass in China. Could you talk about how that market is developing? How the strategy is developing for Corning and where you're seeing the most success?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there are two areas for the low end that we tend to look at are in Chinese OEMs, the Chinese brands, as well as touch on notebook. And in both of those areas, we're seeing growing share for us. Part of it has to do with changes in our strategy. Part of it has to do with some excellent execution by our people on the ground.","Also, part of it has to do with \u2013 in the competition in China, what we're seeing is the emergence of players who want to use the highest quality components, and that is also helping us. So I'd like to attribute it all to changes in our strategy and better execution, and that's part of the story, but also part of the story is that the Chinese brands are trying to lift themselves up to world-class levels of quality and performance, and we're one of their first stops on that journey.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. A couple of things. First of all, Jim, a couple of clarifications on some larger questions. Just making sure on the P&L, you didn't give a core R&D number. I'm assuming that was equal to the GAAP R&D number of $189 million. I just wanted to confirm that. And if you can also give us a sense as to how large the acquisitions -TRM, Samsung, et cetera, were this quarter. Just so we have a \u2013 kind of peg the model, that would be helpful.","On Gorilla, is my larger question. Certainly doing very well on the volume side. Can you give us a sense in terms of pricing? Last year obviously this time, there was a big price step down. Can you give us some sort of sense as to what the pricing did this quarter?","And you mentioned that the margin in Advanced Optics is much lower than in Gorilla. Can you give us a sense, is it half of the margin in Gorilla? Is it a third? Some way that we can kind of correlate between the two, because the two seem to be going in opposite directions right now. Thanks.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","So on the latter question, I think Optical in the Specialty Materials margin \u2013 gross margins are about half. In terms of Optical, TRM, we're not giving out exact numbers, but for the quarter, organic growth was greater than half of our increase. So that will help you at least get a line on it.","I think R&D at core, I think we \u2013 it is the same.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","The same.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Same.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","And then, Wendell, do you want to talk about Gorilla pricing?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Of course in terms of year over year, we're lapping the decreases from last year. So those are going to be embedded. As we with think right now about Gorilla price, and then I'll switch to margin, what we're seeing is more and more moderation. Part of that is helped by the fact that we've introduced Gorilla Glass 4 as a price-premium product to Gorilla Glass 3, and Gorilla Glass 4's take-up has been outstanding. People really want it, and they're willing to pay up for it.","So Gorilla Glass 4 compared to Gorilla Glass 3 is a margin enhancer for us overall, even though it cost us a little bit more, the pricing is more than overcoming that increase in cost. That, put together with our continued improvements in productivity and efficiency is what creates the type of net income up that you saw in this quarter. So we continue to be feeling quite positively about Gorilla gross margin enhancement as we work our way through this year.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. When Phire comes into play, you announced it earlier this year, do you expect that to come in later this year or next year? And does that sort of eat in a little bit to Gorilla? Should we look at Phire and Gorilla combined? And when Phire comes in, does it have its own manufacturing issues that we'll have to deal with at that point, lower gross margin until that manufacturing cycle proves in? Or when Phire comes in, will it come in at the new Gorilla margins that you're creating now?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So great questions. First, on Phire, let's do timing. Phire is still relatively early in its creation cycle. And there are some products that would have the potential to launch this year in smaller volume. That would be our desire, to allow us to work through exactly the manufacturing question that you raised. However, we're getting very strong pull on Phire. So it could be that we will get at least requests to go earlier than what we would like. How to close the delta between desire and reality is one of life's great problems. So we're still in the midst of trying to figure that one out.","Now, as far as business model goes, it is our intent that we will make more money when we introduce Phire as opposed to less money. Now, how that plays out on gross margin percent versus do we get other types of income flows from this will all depend on the business models that we ultimately set up with our customers.","Like I said, this is still a product that is in its elementary school time. So we don't exactly have the business model agreed to with our customers. What we do have is a strong desire expressed for what the product does. So more to come. I'm sorry I don't have a little more right now. Maybe ask me again next time I'm online, and I should be able to have more information for you, sir.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I will. I appreciate it. If I could sneak one last in about the price declines in Q2 that, Jim, you're saying are going to be better than Q1. What is that based on? Is it based on a move to larger screen sizes where you naturally charge more because the glass is thicker? Or are there some other dynamics giving you the confidence? Thank you.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","It's based on the fact that we've closed almost all of our Q2 pricing, so we know we're going to have it.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Right. But what was that based on, \u2013 was that \u2013 that allowed you to do that?","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","It's not based on generation size anymore. So it's based on just what we've concluded with our customers compared to what Q1 pricing was.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I appreciate the time. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Avi Silver with CLSA.","Avi Silver - CLSA Americas LLC","Yes. Hi. Thank you. A couple of questions on Display. So first of all, Jim, at what rate did you hedge the remaining 20% of volumes? Is it also at JPY 99 compared to the core for 2016? And then on Display pricing, the press release says that the volume grew high teens year on year. If I were to assume 18%, that would imply a 4% ASP decline.","I think on the call you said it was down slightly. In that case, ASP would have been more than the 2% to 3% decline. So I just want to understand whether the ASP \u2013 not like-for-like pricing was within the 2% to 3% band in the March quarter, or was it maybe slightly below that band? And then I have a follow-up.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","So we don't give you out specific price numbers. I can tell you that the price declines in quarter one were less than the price declines in quarter four. So we're not going to give exact numbers. What we're focused on is the trend. The only thing have you to keep remembering when you look at our total numbers is the thick-to-thin conversion. Remember, that's why I talked in the script about my \u2013 the heartbeat when you take that out.","Remember we do give more of a lower price on thin to our customers, so as they go from a higher percent on thick to a higher percent on thin, it makes our price declines look greater. But remember from a cost point of view, that's a benefit to us and also gives us more ability to sell more glass. So just by doing it on the total business, you sometimes get a misleading answer. But the heartbeat is definitely going down when you take out that thinness difference. Was there another question?","Avi Silver - CLSA Americas LLC","Well, just on the hedge, the remaining 20% that you hedged on 2016, was that also at JPY 99? And then I have a follow-up.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","No. It was slightly higher than JPY 99, but we're not giving out the exact number. We're going to continue to report the core at JPY 99, and then in GAAP, you'll see the difference between the actual hedges and the core rate. But we did \u2013 we think we did quite well.","Avi Silver - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Great. And then a follow-up question for Wendell, it's kind of a longer term question on TVs. Can you talk about the potential for experiences to \u2013 on TVs to improve? So, you're making a replacement cycle argument on the aging installed base, but the flip side of that is consumers are spending more time staring at smaller screens and less time staring at larger screens anecdotally. So I'm wondering whether there's something on the Software services side that you see over the next couple years that can change experience and ultimately stimulate long-term demand for LCD TV. Thank you.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that's a great question, and it's something that I've worked on with other opinion leaders and innovators in the space a lot. I'd say that we see really, really encouraging work exactly in the area that you are discussing. And I think that the key blocker to bringing some of this to market is that access to the living room, and some way to integrate the physical devices like the TVs as well as your small screens with the software capability to be able to start to do some really interesting things, especially on cloud-based services, to really enhance the experience a lot.","And we're starting to see really strong progress and really new entrants to that space that you see the beginning of when you see these additions of the boxes or the sticks or things like that to your physical device. That is the foot in the door that's going to create, I think, better experiences going forward. Because the one thing the small screen can't do is allow us to have a shared experience, which is really important to just human behavior. And the best innovations I'm seeing in this space on software end-use are all about that piece. It's not just about making a bigger screen. It's not just about having a more dramatic experience. It's about how do I enhance the shared nature of that larger screen. And there's some encouraging things happening, but you need to see some business models really slide into place before it happens.","Avi Silver - CLSA Americas LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Patrick Newton with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, Jim and Wendell. First, a clarification. Wendell, I think when you were talking about the low end of cover glass, especially in China, did I understand you correctly that recent share gains were more a function of the market coming to you? Or has Corning shifted its strategy or product portfolio to better address the low end of the market?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Both. Both. We have yet to introduce a true low-end product. We have them on the shelf. We're still just working through is it worth that market confusion or not. So we're going to measure twice, cut once. But we did shift our strategy in other ways. What it is we actually \u2013 how do we work with those Chinese brands? What do we sell them? Do we sell them parts versus pure glass into the supply chain, as well as how do we work the actual Gorilla brand in China?","So that is part of the story. But the other part of the story is, yes, the market's coming towards us as well. I don't know how to split which is our changed strategy, our improved execution and what's that the market is moving towards us. I don't know how to split those two in effect. But together what they're playing out in is climbing share for us.","Q \u2013 [061H0T-E Patrick Newton]>: Great. Thank you for the details. And then I guess, Jim, you talked about supply-demand in the LCD market for Corning with your capacity running at near full utilization and some idle capacity. Could you help us understand the relative size of the idle capacity perhaps compared to a year ago, or to when you brought SCP in-house? Or perhaps asked in a different way, in what timeframe should we expect LCD-related CapEx to increase from the current maintenance levels?","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","So relative to CapEx, LCD CapEx is up this year versus last year, but it's driven by this heavy cycle of tank repairs. And we are completing two tanks that we had never turned on. There's a little bit of capital in that. But in terms of a big cycle for LCD capital, I don't anticipate that. In fact, after the heavy rebuild schedule this year, I expect it to go down.","I think our utilization is up compared to when we did the CPM deal. We don't give out absolute percentages, and remember, we did shut down some of our older Japanese capacity as part of this from a cost move. But we still have some capacity offline that we'll bring up at the appropriate time.","Q \u2013 [061H0T-E Patrick Newton]>: And so you said CapEx down next year, and then should we think of 2017 as potentially a year of increased LCD CapEx?","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","It's a little early for me to comment on 2017 capital, but relative to our basic footprint, I'm not expecting big surges in capital for the generations of 8.5 and below. But, ask me again in July, and I'll give you an update on 2017.","Q \u2013 [061H0T-E Patrick Newton]>: Great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","And next we'll go to Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just one question from me, one more on Gorilla Glass. I think you said in the press release that your volumes were up about 20%. And if I look back at the 10-K, you guys were up 23% in Gorilla Glass for all of last year. So my understanding is this year's Q1 was an easier comp, and the comps get harder as the year goes on. Can you just sort of talk about how those year-over-year growth rates could compare to Q1 going forward? And whether there's any cannibalization we have to think about in sort of your good, better, best product strategy for the year? Thanks a lot.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Good, better, best.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, let me start on it, and then Jim will try to pick up some numbers to help. So I think first we've got to establish which level are we at. So in sort of sell-in, what our brands sell into retail, that tends to have a seasonal cycle to it that carries through the smartphone market and to their launches. And that we expect to have strong growth in for the market and to have strong or even stronger Gorilla growth into that market.","Then, Steven, we go down to the what our shipments are level in any given quarter. For that, it gets much harder to predict because now we're at the beginning end of a pretty large supply chain, and the behavior we see out of our big brands is they will build a lot in a quarter. We had some of that happen late last year for an undisclosed customer, building a lot for a launch. And they want to make sure they've got enough glass to be able to make the phones or tablets that they want.","When they do that, we can have shipments that are much higher than the sell-in level. Vice versa, what we can also have is that as we get into a cycle where they will do a correction and reduce that in any given quarter, I think that we can anticipate that to continue and that will impact our performance on any given quarter and any given year over year for our shipment level.","But in the end, it doesn't matter so much, do we get it in one quarter or the next quarter. As long as the sell-in continues to be strong and our position continues to strengthen there, all we're really talking about is whether we get it in the next couple quarters or the couple quarters after that, assuming we continue to win other platforms as they turn over. Does that make sense?","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","Yeah. It does. And then within that context, though, Wendell, would we expect cannibalization or are you able to shift down enough Gorilla Glass street volume into some of these other markets that it wouldn't be noticeable to us?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So we're not seeing a lot of cannibalization right now. We're seeing the sort of two-product strategy that we have done to be basically in the direction of switching the GG 4. But what we're saying to our customers is, hey, if you want a real price competitive product or closer in price competitive product, then here is GG 3. And if you want the superior performance of GG 4, this is the price you choose. And we're having customers actually choose a mix.","But for now at least, the penetration rate of GG 4 is higher than what we expected. We originally expected it to only flow in on their highest end, and they stay with GG 3 on some of their lower end. Right now, and this could change, right now, we're seeing a shift towards GG4. And then, of course, Fire when that comes is going to add yet another layer of complication to this. But overall, I think it's all good.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","Yeah. That makes sense. Thank you very much.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Jim, did you have anything to add?","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","No. Just a reminder. We did say our volume growth was up 20% in quarter one; year-over-year, it's going to be up in the mid-teens is what our guidance is. But when you look at consumption of our glass going into sell-in, the percent is very similar in each quarter.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","Great. Thanks.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Great, thanks. So we've got time for one more question, John.","Operator","And that will be from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thank you. I just had a clarification first and then a couple of questions. On the clarification, I think you maintained your full year demand expectation, but data points in PCs have been a little weaker in Q1. I was just curious if you factor that in and if you see an offset on the TV side or something else.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","So we did factor it in, but television size has been a little bit better. And also for us, as customers make our product, they're using a little bit more glass per end device, which helps us out their own efficiencies, particularly as they make ultra-high def. So we did factor in the lower IT into our forecast but other factors allowed us to maintain it.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then two longer term questions. One of them is we're seeing a bit of a shift of panel demand into China. Can you just comment on how you expect that transition to affect Corning, especially with some of your competitors moving some of their manufacturing base to China?","And then the second question is if you can update us on the Iris opportunity into year-end and in particular if there are any TVs at this point that you've been designed in to beyond those announced at CES? And just maybe if you can guesstimate what percent of high-end volumes you think will be able to adopt Iris.","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","So I'll start with China and then let Wendell chime in. Just a reminder, you're seeing our competitors make announcements, we are already on the ground with glass melting in China and have the capability of supplying from that as well as shipping in from Taiwan and Korea. So we think we're well positioned to meet the demand from new China facilities. Anything you want to add to that, Wendell?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well I'd just build on Jim's answer of earlier too, in our Gen 8.5 and below platform, our existing platforms, we feel really good about where we stand for the amount of capacity we have. We may add finishing lines here and there in China, as you point out. But those tend not to have a big build to it.","I think that the only regional play that is worth, as always, keeping an eye on is do we see any significant new generations come in China. And if that were to happen, we would of course be anybody's first port of call on the very large size pieces, and we'd have to work our way through to find, do we have an advantaged way to do that that would be good for our shareholders.","Now, to Iris, I think you portrayed it very well. This is a high-end ultra-thin to start as a business. It's still, once again, very early days for this product. We're engaged across all the brands. There is interest in using glass in that function of a light-guide plate, but it is still too early to call penetration. And then how does the battle play out between glass and the two alternative materials that we're battling against. They have different pros and cons but we're just in the middle of that fight, actually in the beginning steps of that fight, so it's too early to call at what round we win at.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Jim?","James B. Flaws - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Ann. Just a couple of investor announcements.

Please go ahead.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Cynthia, and good morning. Welcome to Corning's second quarter conference call. With me today is Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.","Before we begin our formal comments, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These remarks involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports.","You should also note that we will be discussing our results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at Corning. We have slides posting live on our webcast to accompany our formal comments, and they will be available on our website later this morning.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Wendell.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone.","As you saw on this morning's press release, second quarter results exceeded our expectations, with core EPS up 32% sequentially to $0.37. We told you coming into this year that we expected the first quarter to be the weakest and that momentum would build throughout the year. We still expect that to be the case. We're very encouraged by our second quarter improvement and we are confident that we will see both sequential and year-over-year growth in sales and EPS in the third quarter.","Tony will discuss our results in detail, but before he does, I want to offer some color on the great progress we're making against the strategy and capital allocation framework we announced last October. You'll recall that our priorities are to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength to grow, return cash to our shareholders and create significant value. No doubt, a highlight of our second quarter progress was closing the realignment of our interest in Dow Corning. In that transaction we exchanged Corning's 50% interest in Dow Corning Corporation for 100% of a subsidiary that holds an equity interest in Hemlock and approximately $4.8 billion in cash. The $4.8 billion is approximately 30 times the equity earnings from Dow Corning's silicones business, unlocking tremendous value for our shareholders.","Our continued ownership interest in Hemlock allows us to catch a potential upside from a rebound in the solar market, while also providing market insight and access for our semiconductor innovation programs. Notably, the realignment was a significant milestone in delivering on our strategy to focus 80% of our resources on our three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market access platforms.","We are also making steady progress on other aspects of our focused portfolio strategy. Let's take a look at a few examples. We continue to leverage our competitive advantages and strong customer relationships in Display to stabilize returns and deliver new innovations that increase our revenue per display. In May, our Iris Glass earned a Display Component of the Year award at SID for enabling thinner displays with lower color shift. This technology replaces plastic light guide plates, adding a third piece of glass to large edge-lit TVs. And I'm very pleased with the additional commercial transaction that we're gaining on this product.","In the automotive space, we are reapplying our core technologies and reusing our manufacturing assets to assist manufacturers looking toward connected cars and tighter regulations. Gorilla Glass for Auto is a great example. It is 30% lighter than traditional auto glass, offers important safety advantages, and provides a superior surface for head-up displays. In April we presented a joint paper at SAE with Ford that demonstrated Gorilla Glass for Auto is two times to three times stronger in rock strikes with reduced spalling hazards, versus soda lime glass. I'm very much looking forward to reporting more on this topic in the future.","Our efforts to lead in gas particulate filters also advanced during the quarter. Remember that if adopted, this technology increases our revenue by three times to four times for gasoline direct injection engines. The exciting news for us is that both Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz announced that they will equip vehicles with gas particulate filters beginning as early as 2017. And we won several new GPF platforms in quarter two.","In mobile consumer electronics, we just announced a new member of the Corning Gorilla Glass family, Gorilla Glass 5. It has up to 1.8 times better damage resistance than Gorilla Glass 4, and delivers up to four times improvement in drop height to failure versus competitive glass designs. We expect this superior drop performance to translate into a meaningful price premium versus Gorilla Glass 4, and to expand the use of Gorilla. Given that drop performance is the number one want from consumers, it's not surprising that traction at our customers has been strong. We should be hearing announcements from them in the near future.","In the growing Optical Communications market, we closed on the acquisition of Alliance Fiber Optic Products, bolstering our presence in the high-growth cloud data center market. This acquisition supports our optical market access platform by accelerating our co-innovation strategy and adding new products. We see it strengthening our ability to deliver high-value optical solutions in network operations worldwide. We also announced a separate investment in a small company, Versalume, to commercialize our Fibrance light-diffusing fiber. Fibrance combines Corning's strengths in glass, optical physics, and fiber manufacturing, but its benefits extend beyond Corning's current market focus.","Versalume will enable Fibrance technology to quickly get into the hands of designers and customers in architecture, auto lighting, medical devices, athletic apparel, aerospace, and other industries seeking to solve difficult lighting challenges.","Versalume demonstrates one way that we can keep our focus on the core 3, 4, 5 portfolio while still extending the impact of Corning innovation to new markets. Those projects illustrate just some of the ways that we will invest $10 billion under the strategy and capital allocation framework. We believe the investments will produce significant sales growth by extending our leadership in existing markets and positioning us to win in new markets.","Let's turn to the second part of our strategy and capital allocation framework, utilizing our financial strength. We updated the framework in June to recognize significant progress across multiple fronts, including the closing of the Dow Corning transaction. We now expect to generate and deploy more than $26 billion through 2019, up from our previous plan to deploy more than $22 billion. Notably, we raised the lower bound of our commitment to shareholder returns to $12.5 billion through 2019, up from $10 billion.","Cumulatively, since October, we've already returned $3 billion under the framework, including $810 million in share repurchases during the second quarter. Today, we are announcing our intention to execute a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase, which will approximately offset the EPS impact from the loss of Dow Corning's silicones earnings.","So to summarize, we are making solid progress delivering on our new framework, which is designed to deliver secular growth while consistently returning significant sums to our shareholders. We are utilizing our financial strength to invest in our focused portfolio and drive that growth.","We have raised our planned cash distributions to shareholders to more than $12.5 billion, which is equivalent to about half of Corning's current market capitalization. We look forward to launching our new $2 billion ASR tomorrow.","Now I'll turn the call over to Tony, who will review our second quarter results and third quarter outlook. Tony?","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning.","As we noted in today's press release, our Q2 core results reflect the sequential improvement we expected across most of our businesses and building momentum for a strong second half. We were particularly pleased with our strong operating results, including the strong sequential sales and profit growth in Optical Communications and Display's moderate price declines and strong sequential volume growth.","In Optical Communications, cable production levels recovered during the second quarter from the first quarter software implementation issue. Combined with strong demand, the recovery resulted in sequential sales growth for Optical, up 28%, which was even better than the guidance we provided in April. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the further sequential and year-over-year growth we see in the third quarter.","Now before I get into the details of our core performance and outlook, I want to briefly point to the two primary drivers between our GAAP and core results for this quarter. First, our GAAP net income includes a $2.7 billion non-taxable gain on the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning. Second, similar to the first quarter, this quarter's GAAP results were affected by a $791 million non-cash mark-to-market loss that reflects the required accounting treatment for our currency hedge contracts. I'd like to provide a bit of context.","As you know, we sell LCD glass in yen, and a one-point move in the exchange rate affects our net income and cash flow translation by about $23 million annually at the current exchange rate. As you also know, we have currency hedge contracts, predominantly in yen, to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flow. By hedging, we increase the predictability of our results and our confidence that we can achieve our financial goals.","We are very pleased with the results of our hedging program and the economic certainty it delivers. Since the inception of this strategy, we have settled hedge contracts and received cash totaling $1.1 billion that offset much of the decline in displaced earnings due specifically to the weaker yen.","In January we increased our hedge coverage, which further reduced our risk and increased our confidence in achieving our financial goals. We have hedged approximately 70% of our projected yen exposure through 2022 at a blended rate of approximately 106 yen per dollar. For any investor who was worried that a weakening yen could negatively impact our business, hedging earnings and cash flow through 2022 substantially mitigates that concern.","Now let's move from the economic impact of our hedging program to GAAP accounting. As we discussed in detail last quarter, GAAP requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be marked to market and recorded at their current value in the current quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. In other words, under GAAP accounting, each quarter we are required to revalue all of our existing contracts at the current quarter end forward rate and record the difference in value from the prior quarter end through the P&L as an unrealized gain or loss. This requirement results in significant GAAP earnings volatility if the exchange rate changes from quarter to quarter. Given the size of our hedge portfolio, these adjustments can be large.","For example, in Q3 and Q4 of 2014, we had large unrealized non-cash gains of $431 million and $410 million respectively, primarily due to the weakening yen. In the first quarter this year, the yen sharply strengthened, driving a $599 million unrealized non-cash mark-to-market loss.","Macroeconomic factors, including concern around Brexit, caused further fluctuation in the yen exchange rate, and overall it strengthened again over the second quarter, which was the primary factor in the $791 million mark-to-market loss. Our GAAP results will continue to see this volatility when the yen rate moves.","To be clear, this GAAP accounting has no impact on our cash flow in the quarter. Actual cash flow in any quarter is determined by the amount of hedge contracts we settle in any given quarter.","Our contracts are designed so that the cash received or paid on the contracts substantially offset the change in Display's translated yen earnings and cash flow in that quarter. Our core reporting convention is designed to convey this matching and to simplify comparisons of underlying business trends.","For investors who have additional questions, there is a tutorial on FX hedge accounting on the Digital Media Disclosures section of our Investor Relations website. And as always, Ann and her team are available after the call.","Now let's turn to the results for the second quarter. As a reminder, these are core performance metrics. Sales in the quarter were $2.4 billion, up sequentially from $2.2 billion in Q1, and exceeding our expectations, driven by Optical Communications.","Corporate gross margin was 43%, up more than 200 basis points sequentially and better than our guidance. The uptick reflected the added volume in Optical Communications.","SG&A was 14% of sales at $342 million, as expected. RD&E costs were flat sequentially and versus last year at $192 million.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%, as guided. Net income was $434 million, up almost $100 million from Q1, and EPS was $0.37 and above expectations.","Now let's look at the detailed segment results, beginning with Display Technologies. In the second quarter, the display market and our performance tracked with our observations in April. You may recall that in the first quarter, panel makers lowered utilization, which allowed the supply chain to reduce inventory. Glass demand was down sequentially and year over year. We expected panel makers to increase utilization in Q2 to meet demand for the second half retail season and for glass demand to grow, and that's what we saw in industry dynamics in recent months.","At retail, sell-through data through May showed demand tracking to our overall expectations for glass area growth of 8% to 10% in 2016. Panel prices across most TV sizes increased, and panel makers turned up utilization rates to meet demand for the second quarter. Weeks of inventory in the supply chain ended the quarter at a healthy level. Glass supply and demand remains balanced and our share is stable. As a result of these and other factors, our volume returned to year-over-year growth and was up high single digits sequentially. Price declines were moderate, as expected.","These dynamics inform our belief that we will see year-over-year volume growth continue in the second half, and that moderate pricing environment we've experienced over the last eight quarters will continue or even improve, which is good for Corning. Second quarter sales and net income in Display were up 6% sequentially, driven by the stronger volume.","Let's move to Optical Communications. Results snapped back from the first quarter due to strong demand and the return to full production in our cabling facilities towards the end of the quarter. Q2 sales were $782 million, up 28% sequentially and better than we expected. Net income at $86 million was more than triple the first quarter. We are very pleased to be at full production and continue to work hard to meet our commitments to customers.","In Environmental, Q2 sales were consistent with last year and in line with expectations. Sales of light-duty products for auto were up year over year, driven by continued strong demand. This strength was offset by the continued weakness in North America and China for heavy-duty diesel products. Truck production in North America is down this year, and China's production is also expected to be down for the second consecutive year, driven by the weakness in their economy. Net income was consistent with Q1, and in line with our expectations.","Let's move to Specialty Materials. For the quarter, sales were up 17% sequentially and net income was up 50% on the higher volume. The premium on Gorilla Glass 4 drove a 9% increase in year-over-year net income. That said, more broadly, the market for smart phones, tablets, and laptop computers is lower than we expected.","Worldwide macroeconomic conditions are slowing demand in emerging markets. Additionally, there had been fewer major product launches to drive demand, and the replacement cycle appears to be longer. Our customers are responding to this lower demand environment. As a result, Gorilla Glass volume and Specialty Material sales did not meet expectations in Q2; segment sales were down 2% versus last year.","We anticipate this weaker handheld and IT end market environment will persist through the second half, and we now expect full-year sales in Specialty Materials to be consistent with or down slightly from 2015, driven primarily by our performance in Q1. We do expect sequential growth in each quarter.","Although we expect the overall market to be flat, we are extending our leadership in the cover glass market. First, we are gaining even more share in the aluminum silicate cover glass, and second, our ability to innovate and deliver value-add products at a premium price is playing out as we expected. And as Wendell said, we are attacking again with our recent launch of Gorilla Glass 5. We look for innovations like this to drive revenue and income growth, even in a maturing market.","In Life Sciences, Q2 sales were $215 million, and met our expectations for low single-digit growth. Net income was $21 million, consistent with last year and higher than Q1 on higher sales.","Now, let's turn to equity earnings. As Wendell said, the close of the Dow Corning realignment in June was a significant milestone for Corning. The transaction adds $4.8 billion in cash to our balance sheet, or about 30 times Dow Corning's annual silicones equity earnings, and was essentially tax-free. The freedom to deploy that capital is a tremendous value driver for our shareholders.","Because of the timing of the transaction, the equity earning line in our second quarter financial statements reflect only two months of Dow Corning's silicones equity earnings, plus a full quarter of Hemlock's equity earnings. For your models, the way we will report Hemlock's equity earnings in our income statement going forward is changing. Prior to restructuring, equity earnings in Hemlock was reported in equity earnings on an after-tax basis.","Going forward, it will be reported on a pre-tax basis, and the taxes will be reported as part of Corning's total tax expenses. As you can see from this example on the slide, the contributions to our net income does not change. If you have any questions on this, of course, Ann and her team are happy to help.","Let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $7.1 billion of cash, up $3.5 billion in cash at March 31, including approximately $5 billion in the United States. Adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter was up significantly over Q1, as expected, at $595 million. The comparison to 2015 is challenging, because this year, we did not receive dividends from Dow Corning, in light of the realignment in June; we paid a onetime legal settlement; and net income was lower.","We expect operating cash flow to be up even more in the second half. Historically, most of our operating cash flow is generated in the back half of the year. Major drivers of the increase include higher net income, a reduction in working capital, and a non-repeat of front half-loaded cash expenses. During the quarter, we repurchased $810 million worth of common shares outstanding.","Now for the outlook. Let's begin with Display and the display market. For the full year, our view of end market and glass market growth is unchanged. While there are puts and takes by region, we continue to expect worldwide TV unit growth of 2%, and screen size to increase by more than 1.5 inches.","As I already mentioned, the outlook for handheld and IT market is lower than our prior expectations, but those segments are a relatively small part of the overall display glass market. Therefore, in total for the year, we still expect the overall retail market in square feet to be up 8 to 10%, and we continue to expect the overall glass market, in terms of area, to be up in the mid-single digits. The first quarter supply chain inventory drawdown accounts for the difference.","Turning to our third quarter, we're seeing healthy supply chain inventory. Panel makers' inventory is lean, and they are further increasing utilization to meet increased demands from set makers. As a result, we expect the glass market and our volume to be up mid-single digits sequentially in the third quarter. We also expect our LCD glass prices to decline moderately sequentially, consistent with Q2.","As we have previously explained, we will maintain our stable share strategy and align our operating capacity with market demand, and we continue to expect the more favorable pricing environment will continue or possibly improve for two reasons. First, we monitor utilization, end market demand, and other market factors very closely, and all indicate that glass supply should remain tight for the balance of the year, especially in the large gen sizes, as a result of strong TV demand.","Second, our competitors' profitability is low. Even though price declines had been moderate for two years now, their profitability has declined during that period. Therefore, we expect that their price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable. For these and other reasons, we continue to believe that sequential pricing will be better for us going forward.","Moving to Optical Communications. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be up approximately 10% versus last year, driven by growth in fiber-to-the-home and data centers.","Turning to Environmental. We see continued strength in the auto market, but expect weakness in the heavy duty truck markets in North America and China to continue. We expect third quarter Environmental sales to be down slightly year-over-year, driven by foreign exchange.","In Specialty Materials, we expect sales to be consistent with Q3 last year. This is an 8% up sequentially, driven mainly by volume growth in Gorilla Glass in preparation for new product launches later this year. And for the full year, as I said earlier, the handheld and IT retail market for 2016 has weakened, which impact sales of Gorilla Glass. As a result, we now expect that sales in Specialty Materials will be consistent or down slightly from last year, but will be up sequentially each quarter.","In Life Sciences we expect Q3 sales to be up low single-digits versus last year, despite a drag from our foreign exchange.","Turning to the consolidated outlook. We expect the gross margin to be approximately 43% and consistent with Q2. Gross margins expand versus last year with growing volume in Display and higher sales in Optical Communications. SG&A and RD&E spending will be approximately 14% and 7% of sales, respectively. And we expect other income\/other expense to be a net expense of approximately $60 million. We expect Q3 total gross equity earnings to be approximately $15 million. As a reminder, we no longer have silicones equity earnings. We expect our effective tax rate for 2016 to be in the 15 to 16% range. Now, that concludes our outlook for the third quarter.","Let me close by saying that we are pleased with the strong sequential growth in sales and the earnings in the second quarter. We are confident that Corning's performance will continue to improve with year-over-year sales and EPS growth in both the third and fourth quarters, and we look forward to delivering on our long-term commitments to create strong value.","We expect to generate more than $26 billion through 2019. We will invest $10 billion to grow and sustain our leadership. We also plan to distribute more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders. We are focusing our portfolio to increase our probability of success, reduce the cost of innovation, and increase the barriers to entry for our competition, and we have a rich set of growth opportunities.","Thank you. Ann?","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Tony. I will open the lines now for questions. Cynthia?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question will come from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is...","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Thanks for taking my question. Going to your comment about pricing trend in the glass segment, you're talking about price decline moderating. Can you help us understand the magnitude? Is moderation a reference to, like, down low single digit or down 3% to 5%? Any additional color would be great, and I have a follow-up.","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. It is low single digits, and it's similar to what we experienced in Q2.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Okay. And then on the Gorilla side, I'm surprised that you're down-ticking again. Even if I were to look at the revised smartphone unit shipment, it still shows up 3% to 5% on a year-over-year basis, and the display size is actually growing. So, why that you're down ticking? And I'm asking you in the context of, if there's any ASP pressure here?","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, this is all about volume, and I think the piece that you're missing, Mehdi, is what's happening on the tablet market. And, of course, from a glass standpoint, tablets are bigger, so that has an outsized impact. And I think both the outlook for smartphones and on tablets have come down in the second quarter, and that's the primary reason that we now believe that that market's going to be consistent to down slightly as opposed to that we thought it would grow in the past.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Patrick Newton with Stifel. Your line is open.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, Wendell, Tony, and Jeff. I guess, Tony, a clarification on the guidance for the equity earnings of $15 million in the quarter. I believe you said that will now exclude Hemlock Semiconductor, which is going to move up the P&L and I'm curious if you could help us understand what the contribution from Hemlock will be in the quarter?","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'm sorry. I maybe didn't explain that very well. It will be on the equity earnings line still, and that $15 million is mostly from Hemlock. The difference is, is that previously Hemlock was reported on an after-tax basis, because the taxes were taken care of at the Dow Corning level, and now taxes are taken care of at the Corning level. So, there's a slight change in the geography, but it's not off the equity earnings line.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Wonderful, thanks for the clarification. And then I guess just dovetailing off the prior Gorilla Glass question. What are the volumes forecasted to be from a growth perspective in 2016 and then longer term? Can you walk us through what will return Gorilla Glass to growth, post a multi-year stagnation?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So for us in Gorilla, I think as Tony said, when we came into the year, we felt the market was going to grow, albeit at a slower rate. And now, pretty widely reported that the expectations are for the market to be pretty flattish. So, now then you start \u2013 where do our strategies begin to impact our revenue realization in that slower growth market as well as what will be the next uptick in the market one way or the other. So let's deal with the second first.","Uptick in the market, for us it really does get driven by how exciting a product our customers come out with and its impact on consumers. So I can't give much insight into that for you, but we do believe that we see some pretty exciting products coming that should help on the total market growth.","Now then let's take a look at us in a more micro way. We would normally expect that we're going to grow faster than the market. And that is because of our superior product, we should be always in a share gaining mode, as well as that as we introduce higher value-add products, we'll get higher revenue per device.","I think this year we have an interesting dynamic in that customer mix can really make an impact. We have some customers where we do virtually all of their cover glass needs and some where we just do the majority. So which customer gets impacted can impact us a little more outsized when you're dealing with a slower growth market.","And then second has just been timing on adoption of some of the higher value-add products and our ability to manufacture them. A good example of this is Phire, where we continue to get pretty good pull on Phire, especially for wearables. But the difficulty of that manufacturing process has pushed us a little bit out in time versus our original launch dates.","But overall, we would look over the long term for this business and for us to continue to have pretty robust growth and to be able over that four-year timeframe to double our revenue on this overall platform. It also includes things like augmented reality, but more on that to come in the future.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, and just one more, if I may, is on the gross margin line. That was the largest positive surprise, I think, relative to our expectations. If we go back and look at multiyear trend, we've generally had a negative trajectory outside of acquisition benefits. And so I guess my question to Tony is, can you walk us through, outside of the Optical Communication volumes, what drove gross margin to rebound? And based on the guidance of sustaining this level of 43%, and if we take maybe an intermediate to longer-term view, are we at a point where Corning's gross margin should be stable to having upward trajectory from current levels?","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, I'd be happy to do that. I think compared to Q1, there are really two things. One was the Optical Communications improvement, both in terms of sales, but the amount of money that we were spending on our software project issue also reduced during the quarter. And there was a lot of one-time manufacturing inefficiencies that got better in the second quarter. That helped us and the fact that we also had volume growth up in the high single digits on Display also helped us considerably, and that's how we ended up at the 43%.","When you look out into Q3, we expect to see growth. We see some of it in Optical Communications and some of it in Display and Specialty Materials. And when you average those out, keeping in mind that Optical Communications gross margins are lower than the corporate average and the others are higher, we end up back at that 43% level. As you look forward, it obviously is going to depend on where the mix of our businesses are, but I think being in that 43%-plus level is certainly what we're aiming for from an overall business standpoint.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, thank you for taking my questions. Good luck.","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask on Display. Tony, you guys are keeping the Display guidance unchanged for the full year, at least the market guidance. And the seasonality implication for that, at least on our calculations, is that Q4 ends up higher than normal seasonally. So I wanted to see if we could get more color on why you see that occurring, given the weakness we see in smartphones and elsewhere in the consumer electronics market.","And then secondly, I wonder if you guys could comment on the Specialty guidance reduction that is consistent with what we see in the market as well, which is weak demand. But I wonder. Could you give us more color on regional demand weakness? Where do you see things incrementally developing weaker as you sit right now, and how do you think the regional demand plays out through the back end of the year? Thank you.","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay, let me start with the Display demand question. What really drives this market, Rod, of course, is what happens in TVs. And even though it is true that IT and handheld demand is down, it has a small impact on the overall display market. What really matters is what happens in TVs, and we expect that TV units are going to be up 2% on a year-over-year basis.","As we go through the year, we've seen some stronger demand than what we expected, in particular in North America but also in Europe, but there have been some areas that have been weaker like in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, and also Japan's been a little bit weaker. But when you net that out, it comes back to that 2%. And the other really important factor is what happens with screen size. And from a screen size standpoint, we're looking at screen size growth greater than 1.5 inches. So when you add all that together, even though it's a little bit weaker on other mobile consumer electronic products, that still puts us in that 8% to 10% range.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Tony, do you see seasonality better than normal though in Q4? Because that's what seems to be implied by that assumption.","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, we do. And keep in mind that last year, a lot of that just depends on where the overall demand actually is and how panel makers are adjusting their inventories at a given point in time. And given the strength in demand, we do see that.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And, Rod, it's a very legitimate question. Because in that fourth quarter, it's a lot about value chain management. And we're coming off a period where you can remember last year in quarter four and quarter one, we were seeing a correction of the value chain, and we think that's behind us. But you're right that that quarter four, it's going to get influenced a lot on how people feel about that selling season. So always worth some thought, but that's the way we see it.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Wendell. And then what about just how you see regional demand developing on IT and handhelds?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think we have that much remarkable there. Developing markets overall were part of the spot weakness, I think, as you take a look at that space. But I think it's a little \u2013 the data at that level, I think we have a little bit less clarity on than we do on something like TV that really drives glass demand. But I think by peeling apart some of the comments by our customers in conversations with them, that's what we're picking up is that the developing market will be weaker and less excitement about product launch this year.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Vijay Bhagavath at Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, good morning. Yeah, strong results here. I have a question on the strength you note in data center and fiber \u2013 fiber-to-the-home. Help us understand the sales dynamics. Like, would you have multi-quarter design wins at one of the major cloud companies for these data center and fiber build-outs, and similar design wins at the major service providers, publicly announced outside client fiber build-outs? I want to better understand the sales design win dynamics in Optical. Thanks.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It sounds like you actually understand them, Vijay. That's exactly right. The only little correction I'd make is it's a lot more than multi-quarter. When we do something like fiber-to-the-home systems, our development cycles with our customers go for a pretty long time. And then it sets and locks on this is the design that they're going to use and then away we go.","And then what really provides the dynamic there is that really share shift and things like that. It basically comes down to, these are our Works efforts and where they want to build networks. So, it sounds to me like you got a good understanding. The hyper data centers, the data center pieces, our share has been growing. And both our share of overall spend as Optical and then sort of within in Optical. And that's another one where our position is strong, so the more they build, the better we get.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then a quick follow-on, thanks to you. The AFOP, line fiber acquisition, is it helping you open doors in Asia Pacific in particular? Thanks.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Interesting. Yes. They have some position especially in some of the OEMs that we don't have in the Asia Pacific. And well, we're really, really interested in that. It wasn't the primary driver of the transaction, which is we want to get as big as we can in hyper data centers, but I think you've made a good observation there, and we think that could be a nice surprise, nice added benefit for us if it continues to evolve the way it seems like it could, Vijay.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, great results. Congratulations to you and your team.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks, good morning. Two questions from me, please. First on Gorilla Glass. You noted how Gorilla Glass 4 mix is actually helping your profitability now. Can you sort of talk about how that mix plays out in terms of where you are as a percentage of maybe shipments, roughly, and then how Gorilla 5 sort of impacts that mix maybe over the next few quarters and also the profits going forward?","And then, secondly, Tony, I know you mentioned that the cash flows are back-end loaded for the year, but are we still looking at similar expectations as to what you were thinking a quarter ago at the analyst meeting for cash flow from operations around $3 billion or is that maybe a little lighter now? Thanks.","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'll start with that question. Probably from an overall standpoint, it's a little bit lighter than that. If you think about what drives our cash flow, we did have a onetime payment, a legal settlement, that wouldn't had been in that projections originally. And then, of course, the other big factor is where income actually ends up on a year-over-year basis. And our first quarter was obviously softer than what we originally projected, but it's still going to be quite strong. Still going to be well \u2013 closer to $3 billion than it would be to say $2.5 billion.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","To your first question, Steven, I would love to answer that question, but they're not letting me tell you. So, let me describe it in a little broader sense rather than give you my direct answer about what we're trying to do. So, the market has a certain dynamic in that how do our customers want to position themselves relative to consumers. And so, that's why we have open to us different products at different price points. So, the way Gorilla Glass 3 plays out is we really sort of aim out at those of our customers who are seeking to get benefits of Gorilla relative to Soda Lime or other aluminosilicate providers that are highly price-sensitive.","And so the more of that we gain, that's all great, because as you know the margins in Gorilla are terrific, right? But that price will be moving direct in response to competitors. GG4, GG5, what we're seeking to do there is for those of our customers who want to create absolute premium products that are as thin as can be and as damage-resistant as can be, they're willing to pay for that innovation, and therefore, we introduced those products at a premium.","Our overall desire is that, overall, we can continue to push down the cost of Gorilla while having the price on average sort of not fall so much. And that's exactly what we're trying to do in increasing sort of our \u2013 one piece of increasing our revenue per device. Now, why their folks don't want us to give guidance on anything like that, is back to the customer mix question that I addressed before. Now, which customer does what starts to get really important if you're trying to pick from your gross margin model how everything's going to work out.","And in a market that's already pretty tough to predict, given how the value chain moves, that added degree of complexity won't make us too accurate. But you're on exactly what it is we're trying to do, and then it will be a mix of how much value-type brands are going in a certain quarter versus a sort of premium cycle upgrade to the new glass. That makes sense, Steven?","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Yeah, that's very helpful. I appreciate all that color. Thanks so much.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to the line of Doug Clark with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Douglas Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks for taking my question. First one on Display and glass pricing. I notice you didn't mention the FX environment and the yen move. I've gotten a number of questions that wanted to kind of get your opinion if the recent strengthening of the yen has any impact or could factor into conversations about future glass pricing?","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, and I will be happy to answer that. We've got to obviously answer this based on our analysis of the situation. And we do recognize that the yen fluctuates, and that will impact both the glass procurement cost for our customers, and they buy glass in yen, they sell the panels in dollars. And we also know that our competitors, the Japanese glass makers, could also get a temporary translation benefit when the yen strengthens, or of course a temporary loss when it weakens against the countries they manufacture. But we don't think this is going to be a big impact. The effect on customers is not as big as it used to be. Glass used to be 15% to 20% of the customer material cost; it's now only about 8%. And then the second factor is our competitors are not as profitable as they used to be. And any benefit they get from yen appreciation may only be temporary, so for these reasons we don't expect to see a meaningful pricing impact, a result of the yen movement. And the perfect example of that is what happened in Q2, where the yen strengthened considerably but price declines were moderate. So we don't believe this is going to have a big impact, but we recognize there are a couple of areas where we need to \u2013 we are obviously monitoring it.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Worthy question, Doug, worthy question.","Douglas Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sure, Wendell, that makes sense and thanks for the detail. Second question related to more glass volumes and what's been happening in the supply chain, there seems to be a bit of a shift from LCD panel capacity to OLED panel capacity. I'm wondering if that impacts glass volumes either near-term or kind of leads to industry rationalization long-term.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So LCD, OLED, let me start macro, and then I'll get right down into the micro, particular customer capacity shifts one way or the other. So in macro, basically when we talk about OLED, you're only really talking about mobile consumer electronics, right, really phone-type business, which is a relatively small, right. I mean, really small. Sounds like under the single-digit percent sort of small, sort of percent of where, sort of glass changes in total.","Now, and overall I think all the adjudication of large-size OLED versus large-size LCD, LCD continues to just get stronger and stronger relative. So all we're talking about is that piece. Now there have been rumors about one of our major customers taking some of their capacity that currently makes LCD, large-size, and take that same plant and make more of the small-size polyimide OLED. We can't comment on is that true or not.","So let's deal with it in a more theoretical way. So here's what happens. What sets the overall glass demand is going to be what happens in the market. Which customer of ours makes it, okay? Does it impact, is the glass demand there or not?","In micro, we have some customers where we have incredibly high share and some customers where we have more moderate share. So what we would expect overall though is that we pick up what our average share is of whatever that market is. So we don't expect that to be a really big market shift for us.","And specific for us on polyimide OLED, is demand there? Net increases demand on us for glass, because our relative share there is very, very high and our relative share in the displays it is replacing, all right, which is just basically low-temperature polysilicone displays for phones, is lower. So I think overall though you can get some temporal impact, I'm not looking at that as being a huge driver. Makes sense?","Douglas Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That does, thanks for that extra detail. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to the line of Stanley Kovler with Citi Research. Your line is open.","Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask, this is actually a similar set but a different vein, so if the yen strengthened and you have some opportunity for additional hedging in the out years, given multiyear lows for the yen, were there any discussions or additional hedging taken? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","There were not any additional hedges taken. There was lots of discussion about it. We are 70% hedged out through 2022, and so it's something that we are spending time modeling. Also, thinking both in terms of what the outlying demand is out in those years, maybe different instruments that we could be using as opposed to the forwards we've been using. And so we're doing a lot of work on it, but we didn't do anything in the second quarter.","Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it, thanks. And back to Display, during the quarter, in late May you started to suggest that there is a possibility of unit volumes tracking towards more like 1.5% growth versus the original 2% guidance, and now back to 2%. That really is interesting because it didn't really impact your screen size inputs as well. I would think that with the strengthening of the TV space in general that there would be some discussion about maybe screen size tracking closer to two inches as well. I know those are two separate topics, but just the market in general.","And then looking out into next year, you talked about your share being relatively stable, irrespective of where customers are. But if that customer of yours does shift to a different technology and let's say sells off the equipment for Gen 7 and that goes to even a different region, how should we think about your share in other regions and with new customer entrants in the panel space? Thank you.","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So you're absolutely right on the TV demand. What we saw in the data in the last couple of months was stronger demand in North America and Europe, and a lot of those were larger-size TVs. And so there was also a little bit of tick up in our projection on screen sizes. But when you add it all up, we're still in that range of 8% to 10%. And we realize as we get data every month, that can change the absolute number a little bit, but it doesn't change what we think is the overall underlying demand, which is up in the 8% to 10% range.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And on the moving around of capacity, I think what's really important to remember is how small one Gen 7 fab is in the overall scheme of the enormous size of this market. And so in a way, that capacity could end up one place or another, but you're within the error bars on the overall market range. And I think a good way to just think about it is wherever it goes, we'll probably end up one way or the other maintaining a pretty stable share, our average share across the entire market just because it's just not that big a deal \u2013 relative. There was a time when one Gen 7 fab, that occupied most of my life. But now it's like, eh, another Gen 7 fab.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Stan. Cynthia, we have time for one more question we can squeak in.","Operator","And that will come from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is open.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks very much, guys. I guess I was curious, going back to the TV unit assumptions, positive 2% year on year. If I look at, for example, the market research firm IHS, I know those guys are looking for year-on-year comparisons that are negative on TV sales, and obviously it's such a huge variable for you guys. Do you guys have any comments on why your assumptions might be different from theirs?","And then also I wanted to ask on Iris, I think you said earlier in the monologue that you're seeing more commercial traction. Any detail you can give us on exactly what you're seeing there in terms of design wins or revenue would be great. Thanks.","R. Tony Tripeny - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. On the TV unit size, we do recognize that some forecasters have different projections than we do, but it's so important to us that we spend a lot of time looking at things by region. And you could pack a lot of intelligence, understanding at the very end markets on what's happening. And we feel very good about the idea that we'll be up about 2%. And especially what's happened in the last couple of months relative to the TV demand, in particular in North America where it is a good bit stronger than what we projected at the beginning of the year.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And just to add, I think what, TV units, there are legitimate point of view differences. But whether or not you thought TV units were going to be up 1%, up 2%, or even relatively flat, that you can remember, I think we actually showed it to you on this slide on the 2016 outlook when Tony was going through his talk, that TV units up about 2% would be a growth contribution in glass area by about 2%. But the screen size being up greater than 1.5 inches, that's driving 5% to 6% growth. And so what we're hearing from the market is television unit growth may be a little bit softer than what we would have thought at the very beginning of the year. But actually like the previous question, screen size is maybe a little bit bigger than what we thought, so it's pushing us in those ranges.","But it can be very legitimate that, rather than coming in around 2%, it comes in around 1%. All that is within the range of possibility, and that's why we try to give you sort of an idea of how to factor the various pieces so you can plug in what it is your opinion is and then figure out from that what's going to happen in glass demand.","And the final piece is value chain adjustments. Are you going to be bigger than that television unit piece? And that's how we all end up at the bottom line of mid-single digits in square footage growth for us, for the market, and I think that's okay.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","About Iris?","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Iris, right. So, Iris is continuing to get some really good commercial transaction with \u2013 now we're up to a number of customers that are really evaluating it very strongly, and some are choosing to launch with it, right? It's still early days. As many of you may have heard me speak, I tend to think about disruptive innovations like this, because it's highly disruptive, you're displacing an incumbent technology, a PMMA, with a brand-new material set, to be able to make televisions thinner and with smaller bezels, that it tends to go in phases. You go from the idea then you get a breakthrough. And then if it's really good, you can get a breakout and then you have to defend your really strong position. I'm getting increasingly confident we're going to have a breakthrough. It's going to penetrate large edge-lit TVs, and it's going to have a meaningful penetration into that. Now, whether or not we got a breakout and this becomes a really dominant technology choice for edge-lit, it's just too early to tell. But the good news is the increased commercial transaction is increasing our confidence that you're going to start to see some multiple sets introduce using this technology and we're going to penetrate the market some. But to be significant, we've still got a ways to go.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you. That was our last question.","Wendell P. Weeks - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great, thanks to everyone for listening and the terrific questions. We wish you an enjoyable summer and look forward to updating you on framework progress and results throughout the rest of the quarter. Be well.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Division Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Wendell. Just a couple of announcements from IR.","We will be at the City Conference on September 7 in New York.

They'll also be available on our website for downloading.","And now I'll turn the call over to Wendell.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Thank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. This morning we reported another excellent quarter. Sales and EPS exceeded expectations and progress on our growth initiatives continues to be outstanding. Third quarter sales increased 6% year-over-year. Sales in all of our business segments exceeded our expectations, highlighted by 15% year-over-year sales growth in Optical Communications and 26% growth in Specialty Materials. Looking ahead, we expect to maintain this momentum and fully achieve our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework goals.","As we've shared, the Framework outlines our leadership priorities as we continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength to extend our leadership, drive our growth and reward our shareholders. Under the Framework, we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion in cash through 2019. We are returning more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends, and we are investing $10 billion to sustain our leadership and deliver growth.","We have made outstanding progress against those goals since the Framework was announced in October of 2015. Our cash generation is on target, and we have returned $8.5 billion through share repurchases and dividends. Repurchases have reduced outstanding shares by about 29%. We increased the dividend 14.8% in February and 12.5% last year for a combined increase of 29%. We expect to increase the dividend by at least 10% annually in 2018 and again in 2019.","In addition to articulating our capital allocation goals, the Framework outlines how we utilize our focused and cohesive portfolio to generate value for our shareholders and to delight our customers.","We are best in the world in three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market access platforms. We focus 80% of our resources on opportunities that use capabilities in at least two of these three categories. By pursuing our focused strategy, we believe our likelihood of success increases, our cost of innovation decreases, and we create higher and more sustainable competitive barriers.","To advance our innovation initiatives, strengthen our product leadership in low-cost positions, and ultimately outperform our competitors, we are investing in research and development, enhancing our manufacturing capabilities and making bolt-on acquisitions. Our growth investments since the introduction of the Framework have been consistent with program needs. Our progress has been terrific and multiple projects are moving into the next phase of development.","So we've begun to accelerate investments in line with our four-year plan to invest $10 billion, and you can see the impact of these investments in our financial statements. Tony is going to talk more about the investments, but first let me review the progress starting with Optical Communications.","We celebrated a major milestone in September. We produced our 1 billionth kilometer of fiber. That's one-third of the optical fiber ever produced in the history of the world. It's also enough to go to the sun and back 3.5 times. But think about it this way, it takes light about 10th of a second to go around the circumference of the earth. It takes light 56 minutes to go 1 billion kilometers.","The milestone is a terrific measure of the success we've had over 40 years in leveraging our core technologies and manufacturing and engineering platforms. Our dedicated employees have helped us become the world's largest manufacturer of optical fiber, the world's lowest-cost provider, and the home to some of the most precise manufacturing operations of any kind anywhere in the world.","As a result, we're the world leader in Optical Communications and the only true end-to-end supplier of optical solutions. We believe that the opportunities ahead of us are much greater than those that are behind us. To capture these opportunities, we're investing to expand capacity, to innovate, and to increase our market access. Corning's unique co-innovation approach and technical capabilities position us to continue delighting our customers through distinctive innovation to manufacturing leadership. These investments are paying off. We are growing at more than twice the rate of the telecommunications industry with global leaders like Verizon turning to us in support of their vision. We're well on our way to more than 15% sales growth for 2017, which keeps us on track to achieve $5 billion in optical sales by 2020.","Our Mobile Consumer Electronics platform is much younger than our Optical Communications platform, but it also reached an important milestone this year; the 10th anniversary of Corning Gorilla Glass. Over the decade, we innovated to make Gorilla thinner, tougher, and more damage resistant than ever with Gorilla Glass 5 showing dramatically-improved drop performance over alternatives.","We've developed specialized processes to reduce glare, improve aesthetics, and enhance scratch resistance. Today, Gorilla Glass is seeing broader adoption than ever before. Over the past few months, leading smartphone manufacturers adopted our glass on their new devices. Advanced Glass offers several benefits over other materials like metal or plastic. Along with improved wireless charging, Advanced Glass on the back also enables improved reception. It allows for new levels of design and customization.","We're also realizing more value per device through our innovations. For example, Acer's new wearable Leap Ware is using Gorilla Glass SR+, our scratch resistant glass composite. And we continue to see increased sales of Vibrant, our photorealistic parts on notebooks and computers, with growing interest in the handheld space.","Walmart recently introduced a new line of screen protectors under the name Blackweb, which uses our accessory glass. And we continue to win at smartphone OEMs in emerging regions including new devices at Positivo in Brazil, LAVA in India and Polytron in Indonesia.","For the first nine months of 2017, Specialty Materials segment sales grew 28% over last year, which clearly illustrates the power of our approach. Our close customer relationships enable us to innovate jointly and we're on track to double sales in mobile consumer electronics over the next several years.","In our Automotive market access platform, we are helping customers build cleaner, safer and more connected vehicles. The gas particulate filter business is starting right now. As the year began, we needed to win platforms and we were waiting for regulations to be fully adopted. Let's fast forward to today.","European regulations are in place with China expected to follow soon. Most European and many Chinese OEMs have now declared platform awards and we won the majority. In the third quarter, we had our first commercial sales and we expect sales to ramp going forward.","The exclusive global supply agreement we announced in August for Groupe PSA's PureTech Engine Platform is a great example of our success. PureTech engines power Groupe PSA's latest models in its Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn brands. All PureTech gasoline direct injection engine models in Europe and in China will be equipped with Corning GPFs beginning this month.","And we continue collaborating with OEMs globally on Gorilla Glass for auto. We're making solid progress with Gorilla Glass on more than 25 auto platforms globally. On the exteriors of cars, Gorilla Glass laminates are lighter and tougher than conventional auto glass, plus its superior optical quality allows larger, clearer head-up displays. For interiors, Gorilla Glass makes cars more connected and durable with sophisticated capabilities you've come to expect from your smartphones. The Renault SYMBIOZ Concept car unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September demonstrates this value proposition. The SYMBIOZ reimagines the car as an interactive personal space. At home the car's design and electric power system make it another room. On the road, full autonomy allows passengers to relax or focus on activities other than driving.","Everywhere, Corning Gorilla Glass for auto interiors provides access to the digital world.","In our Life Sciences vessels platform, we're building a long-term multibillion-dollar franchise. At our joint announcement with Merck and Pfizer in July, we unveiled Corning Valor Glass, a revolutionary breakthrough in pharmaceutical glass packaging. It helps protect patients and improve pharmaceutical manufacturing by dramatically reducing particle contamination, breaks and cracks, while significantly increasing throughput. Valor results from a combination of capabilities unique to Corning and demonstrates our focused and cohesive portfolio in action.","Although this industry moves at a deliberate pace, we believe Valor has the potential to power Corning's growth for the next decade and beyond. The industry is excited about our innovation and announcement and we continue to make strong progress.","We're also in the process of finalizing plans for manufacturing capacity and we'll be announcing more details in the coming months. The good news is that the regulatory environment de-risks our investments by providing clear advance notice of demand and by creating stable sales that will occur over many years. We continue to believe that Valor is an outstanding opportunity.","In Display, our priority is to maintain stable returns and win in new display categories. Our strategy focuses on lowest-cost manufacturing, stable share and supply\/demand balance. The benefits of this strategy continue to be encouraging. We are the lowest cost producer by a wide margin, and our pricing has become consistently more favorable over the past three years. And our new plant in Hefei, China is on schedule to start shipping the world's first Gen 10.5 glass, another demonstration of our market leadership.","So that's the summary of progress across the company. We're very happy with how 2017 is playing out. We're outperforming on sales, seeing the first returns on near-term growth investment and making great progress on our longer-term growth initiatives.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tony for a review of our results and details on our outlook.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. As I reflect on our performance year-to-date and our expectations for the fourth quarter, every segment is meeting or beating the plan we set in January. We have strong operating performance, and our innovation pipeline continues to achieve milestones and deliver the tangible proof points. We have accelerated our growth investments accordingly and remain on track to deliver our Framework goals. Third quarter results reflect the strong performance, and our fourth quarter guidance incorporates our expectations for continued strength.","Let's start with GAAP and its impact on our hedge contract accounting. GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter.","For the third quarter, the yen was relatively stable and the value of our hedge contracts was relatively unchanged. This resulted in an after-tax GAAP loss of $15 million when we marked the contracts to market as required by GAAP. And be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. We remain very pleased with the results of our hedging program and the economic certainty it delivers.","Since its inception, we have received cash totaling $1.6 billion under our hedge contracts. These proceeds offset much of the yen-related fluctuation in Display's earnings. Hedging our earnings and cash flows through 2022 provides higher certainty for our growth investments and future shareholder distributions. For information on the mechanics of these contracts, please refer to the tutorial on FX hedge accounting on the digital media disclosure section of our Investor Relations website. And as always, Ann and her team are available after the call.","Third quarter sales rose 6% year over year. Core earnings were $433 million and EPS was $0.43, up 2%. Third quarter growth highlights include 15% year-over-year growth in Optical Communications, 26% year over year growth in Specialty Materials and the first commercial sales of gas particulate filters.","The third quarter gross margin was 42% of sales with gross margin dollars up 3% versus last year.","SG&A was 14% of sales at $372 million, and RD&E was 8% of sales at $213 million. As we expected, investing in the growth opportunities that Wendell described is beginning to impact gross margin, SG&A, and RD&E.","Our growth investments include capacity expansions for Optical Communications, our Gen 10.5 Hefei plant and gas particulate filters, plus development for Gorilla Glass, Valor, and a few other projects we're not quite ready to dive into publicly. These, along with our higher tax rate, are the primary reason our sales grew more rapidly than EPS.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3.9 billion of cash, approximately 16% of which is in the U.S. Adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter was $765 million and keeps us on track to meet the goals of our four-year Capital Allocation plan.","Now let's look at detailed segment results and outlook beginning with Display Technologies. Sales were $860 million and core earnings were $227 million. Our Q3 volume was up mid-single digits sequentially, exceeding our July guidance. Sequential LCD glass price changes were similar to last quarter and consistent with our expectations for a more favorable environment.","In addition, costs were up slightly sequentially in the quarter: First, because of the investment in the start-up of our Gen 10.5 facility in Hefei; and, second, we're running a handful of tanks outside their optimal range for a few quarters to meet strong demand for our fusion assets across the company. As a reminder, we used our fusion assets for Display glass, Gorilla, Iris and Automotive so when aggregate demand is high we have less flexibility to optimize our tank fleet.","For the fourth quarter, we expect the LCD glass market and Corning volume to be consistent with Q3. Sequential glass price decline should remain moderate and similar to the third quarter's sequential decline. And for the reasons I just noted, we expect fourth quarter cost to be similar to Q3.","For the full year, we continue to expect that the retail market, as measured in square feet of glass, will be up mid-single digits, driven by increasing screen size. We expect our glass demand will also be up mid-single digits in line with the overall market, and we continue to see progress towards a more favorable pricing environment.","Our price declines in 2015 were smaller than in 2014, and in 2016 they improved further. This pattern is continuing this year. For example, year-over-year price declines in the second half are on track to be less than 10%. So we've entered single-digit year-on-year decline territory. We expect this to continue and pricing to improve over time.","Now, three factors drive our view of the more favorable pricing. First, we expect glass supply to be balanced or even tight. We will align our capacity to our demand even as we ramp up new capacity. Publicly-available information indicates competitors are aligning their capacity to their demand. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. Therefore, we expect their price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable. And third, LCD glass manufacturing requires ongoing investments in current and new capacity. To generate acceptable returns on new investments, glass pricing will need to improve even further.","In summary, we remain very pleased with the current dynamics in our Display business and our progress in maintaining stable returns.","Let's move to Optical Communications, where we had a very strong quarter. Third quarter sales were up 15% and core earnings up 13% year-over-year. Sales grew in both our enterprise and carrier businesses, with especially strong demand for our carrier products. Capacity expansions and other growth investments account for the difference between sales and profit growth. Without these investments, earnings will have grown much faster than sales.","Our growth stands out as we look across the telecom industry. Our outstanding performance results from our choice to focus our portfolio on tacit optical solutions that are replacing legacy copper and incremental growth as we deliver unique solutions for next-generation networks. We expect fourth quarter sales to be up high single-digits over last year, and we're increasing our view of full-year sales growth to more than 15%. We're on track to achieve our $5 billion annual sales goal for Optical Communications by 2020.","Turning to our Environmental business, third quarter sales were $277 million, up 5% year-over-year. Notably, these include our first commercial GPF sales. Core earnings were $34 million, consistent with last year. Investments in our new gas particulate filter business partially offset the benefits of increasing sales.","Third quarter year-over-year automotive sales were driven by worldwide market growth and from share gains. As anticipated, the North America heavy-duty diesel market returned to year-over-year growth and is showing signs of a steady upturn. Our new gas particulate filter business delivered its first commercial sales as the first phase of Euro VI regulations went into effect. We also delivered additional platform wins in the quarter, extending our majority position of platforms awarded to-date. Once regulations are fully implemented in Europe next year and China in early 2020, we estimate the GPF opportunity will exceed $0.5 billion of annual sales for Corning and offer margins and ROIC similar to our existing businesses.","In total for the fourth quarter, we expect low-teens year-over-year sales growth driven by improvement in heavy-duty diesel and the successful launch of GPFs. So for the full year, we now expect Environmental sales to be up mid-single digits over last year.","Let's move to Specialty Materials where third quarter sales rose 26% over last year and core earnings were up 61% year-over-year. Both were ahead of our expectations, driven by strong shipments of Gorilla Glass in support of new phone launches. We're clearly seeing the financial benefits of our focused and cohesive portfolio. Overall, we're thrilled with our performance in Specialty Materials and expect sales in the fourth quarter to be up low to mid-teens over a very strong 2016 fourth quarter. As Wendell covered, we expect strong demand to continue as we make progress on all three of our approaches to grow sales.","At the beginning of the year, we said we will grow in 2017. Exactly how much would depend on the timing and extent of customers adopting our innovations. We can now say the extent and timing has been outstanding, and we expect 2017 sales growth to exceed 20%. We are well on our way to our goal of doubling sales for mobile consumer electronics over the next several years.","In Life Sciences, third quarter sales were $223 million and core earnings were $21 million. For the fourth quarter, we expect mid-single digit sales growth year-over-year. As a reminder, our new pharmaceutical packaging business continues to be reported in our Other reporting segment, along with other new product lines and development projects. We group our emerging opportunities in Other to better manage their goals and objectives, independent from a fully commercialized business.","Shifting to the full company P&L. For the fourth quarter, we expect gross margin as a percent of sales to be consistent with the third quarter or about 42%. As I said earlier, our growth investments are also affecting our operating expenses. SG&A and RD&E should be a bit above 14% and 8% of sales respectively. We expect other income, other expense to be a net expense of approximately $45 million to $55 million, and fourth quarter total gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $110 million to $120 million, predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor, implying full year gross equity earnings to be in the $200 million to $210 million range. This is higher than we expected, driven by slightly higher volume and better business performance at Hemlock.","We expect our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 19% and for the full year 2017 to be approximately 18.5%. Our U.S. income is up from 2016, which raises our effective tax rate.","Finally, let me update you on our plan to return at least $12.5 billion to shareholders under our Framework. During the end of the third quarter, we have returned $8.5 billion. In the third quarter, we returned $1.1 billion, bringing the year-to-date total to $2.5 billion. As you may recall, in February, the board increased the cash dividend per share by 14.8%.","Let me close by saying that we are very pleased with our continued positive momentum. We're focused on closing out a very strong 2017 and keeping that momentum heading into next year. We remain on track to deliver the overall goals of our strategy and capital allocation framework and are excited about the rich set of opportunities ahead of us.","With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Corning, Inc.","Thank you, Tony. Hey, Greg, we can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. And one moment please for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Hey. Yeah. Good morning. Yeah, it would be helpful to get color, Wendell, Tony, in terms of order strength in the optical fiber business. Where I'm coming from is, is the demand primarily driven at hyperscale clouds? And are you seeing any timing delays at any of the major service providers for fiber-to-the-home or metro optical buildouts? Thanks.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","We're seeing very \u2013 thanks, Vijay. We're seeing really very, very strong demand. And we're feeling the most strength out of our carrier business, but we're also seeing good strength in enterprise. We're really tight, which is why you heard from Tony about our investments in capacity. We expect that tightness to continue for the foreseeable future until we're able to get that capacity up and running. So right now, the market seems very, very strong to us, sir.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Wolf from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. I had a question about the Gorilla Glass business and just if you could give us a little bit more detail about the mix. If we look at the growth of new customers' adoption rates for the first time, which you talked about on a couple of countries, the mix of versions 3, 4, and 5, and how good 5 \u2013 how well 5 is doing right now, and then how much of the growth that you're seeing is coming from the double-sided opportunity and how widespread do you think that will go down the cost curve of the handset vendors?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","So we tend not to break out our mix by generation, but let me try to be responsive to your question, Joseph. GG 5 is the most successful Gorilla Glass launch we've had since the beginning. It has been exceeding our expectations in terms of penetration, and we expect that to continue. Its performance is much, much better than any of the alternatives, and that performance is what is leading to not only its rapid adoption versus GG 4 and GG 3, but also putting glass in new places like the back of the phone. We still have a lot more innovation to do to solve the core problem, which is to develop a transparent material that when you drop your phone, it doesn't break, no matter what innovative new way you have found to drop your phone. And we have many generations ahead of us. But what you see in the financial performance and why you're seeing that really strong net income performance together with the sales performance is the increased richness of GG 5 and its very rapid adoption.","I think it's too early yet to opine on how rapidly the total glass enclosure penetration will grow. It's obviously off to an encouraging start, which you can tell from watching the news. I think in the end, it will depend on how much we can continue to improve the glass to make sure that the customer's ultimate experience of this product has all the great benefits of glass, wireless charging, improved receptions, improved aesthetics, but at the same time to have the type of durability you'd see from more opaque materials.","Is that responsive, Joseph? Does that get at you want to, sir?","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. It's going on the right direction. Just a follow-up related to the investment. On the capital allocation plan, the pace on the cash give-back is, if you take it at just a \u2013 if you straight-line the four or five \u2013 four-year plan, it would be ahead of plan. If we think about the $10 billion in investment \u2013 and Tony went through a couple areas where the investment is going, but how do we think about that $10 billion in terms of the pace up to the 2019 plan and where you are in dollar-wise?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Sure. I think as you think going forward, as we continue to have greater success, we will increase that investment. If you think about capital spending, for example, in the first year we just spent $1.2 billion. We're going to spend more than $1.5 billion this year because of the success that we're having with the capacity expansions that are required right now. I think the second thing to keep in mind is, is that from an RD&E standpoint, we're consistently investing there, but there will be opportunities to continue to grow that a little bit as we continue to have success.","The other thing to remember is, is that that is no more than 10% from a gross standpoint. Some of that comes from M&A, and that M&A depends on just when those opportunities actually make themselves available. But clearly we spent in the first half a little bit less than what you'd expect, and so it's likely we'll spend a little bit more in the second half of the four-year plans, mostly as long as those opportunities are there and it makes a lot of sense to invest in them.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Yeah. I think stepping back from this, the key thing to keep an eye on is we don't expect to invest more than $10 billion. We think the $10 billion in the capital allocation plan, when we put it together, we had all these things in mind. Now, it is true that the exact timing of the different innovations and the exact timing of when you need capacity is really hard to call within any given six-month time period.","But also I think the plan is, we're going to invest $10 billion, we don't see the need to invest more, and how the timing works out is going to follow the flow of programs. And probably its predictability isn't worth spending a ton of time on because the total capital allocation flow is going to be what we described.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Please go ahead.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. Two follow-ups. Historically, panel prices have correlated very closely to Corning's display revenue. But this time is different, especially you've done relatively well compared to panel price decline. Other than competitors' balance sheet, the constraint, what else is out there that makes historical correlation no longer valid? And then I have a follow-up for Tony. Can you just remind me of the capital \u2013 of the overall capital return program budget for $2.5 billion? Where are you now? Can you give us an update on how much accumulatively you have already spent?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Yeah. So let me start with the panel price question. As we've laid out, over the last three years, we've been on a favorable trend relative to pricing, and we just reported that we've entered a period of single-digit decline territory. And we expect this to continue, and if you think about over the last three years, pricing has improved every single year despite what's happening from a panel price, whether panel price is increasing, whether panel prices are decreasing, we're seeing that pricing environment from a glass standpoint to improve.","And the reason we think that's the case is it's driven by the factors we've laid out in the past: glass supply\/demand, which we expect to remain balanced or even tight; our competitor profitability; and then finally, the need for glassmakers to generate acceptable returns on manufacturing investments. And so those are the reasons that we think on a going forward basis we're going to continue see even more moderate glass pricing as we go forward.","In terms of the capital allocation plan, what we have said all along that we would return more than $12.5 billion over the four-year period, and what we returned through the end of this quarter was about $8.5 billion of that.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Does that suggest that you would end up increasing given the pace that you're returning the cash to investors? Or would you hit that $12.5 billion sooner than later?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","I think that we've always said it's greater than $12.5 billion. And certainly at the pace we've been at, I suspect that we will hit it sooner than later. But the reason that we've been going at the pace we have is that we don't believe that investors really have all the growth prospects in our stock, and we've found very opportunistic to be able to do share buybacks. And in fact of the share buybacks we've done, the average price has been a little over $22, and we feel pretty good about that.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Newton from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Patrick Michael Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, Wendell and Tony. I guess, first, I wanted to focus on Gorilla Glass. Clearly, you've seen some improved demand trends there from new launches and also glass on both sides of multiple products from multiple OEMs. I guess my question is how comfortable are you with the current supply\/demand dynamics for Gorilla Glass given the product has a history of having unexpected supply swings on one side? And then there's also some well-documented manufacturing challenges associated with a large new customer product ramp?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","So, Patrick, I think you're right to note that the exact predictability of the mobile consumer electronics supply chain can be problematic. Now given that, let me sort of express the way we're feeling right now and how we're experiencing that supply chain. Right now, we continue to see very, very strong pull as we look forward to this quarter. So that's the way we're experiencing it. We're not experiencing a slowdown, and you see that in our own way in which we're operating tank fleets, right? We're actually having to run a little bit longer than maybe we would've liked, and a little bit less than on an optimum utilization base, and it's really because of that strength.","This doesn't mean that all of a sudden the supply chain in mobile consumer electronics has become highly predictable. It has not. But I hope it helps that you get a sense for how we're experiencing at least our piece of that supply chain at this time.","Patrick Michael Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's helpful. I guess, Tony, I wanted to shift to a question on your margin profile. Great results, great guidance, especially on the top line side. But if I wanted to nitpick on something, it'd be on the gross margin, which was a little bit disappointing. I'm curious if we take an intermediate-term view, how should investors over the next several years think about the balance of accelerating the growth from Optical, Environmental, Life Sciences, et cetera, which I believe are margin dilutive relative to a display business, which should decline as a percentage of revenues.","So, I guess, is it reasonable to think that gross margin is relatively sticky around current levels, while op margin could see some pressure in the near-term from both mix and investments but then an eventual expansion from scale?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Yeah. I think the issue always is with our gross margin is, to your point, it really is a mix of our different businesses. And how they are going to grow and contribute is hard to know. For certainty we see a lot of growth that's going on right now in Optical Communications, a lot of that growth. And you're right that's a little bit below the corporate average. On the other hand, Specialty Materials is above the corporate average. The way that we always look at it is how is each of those businesses performing relative to their competition. Are they the low-cost producer? Are they doing better than the competition? And that's clearly what's happening.","I think from a near-term standpoint, still our gross margin was 42%, a little bit less than it was in Q2, but our cost, that's really driven by our cost in display being up slightly sequentially. They were down on a year-over-year basis. That was a combination of the startup of our Gen 10.5 factory. And then, as I mentioned, we're running a handful of tanks outside of our optimal range for the quarter.","But I think it's important to note that even though our gross margin percent was impacted, because we got more sales in Display and Gorilla than we expected, we did make more money. So while it was a little bit less on the percentage, it was better on the bottom line, and that's of course what we always consider to be the most important thing.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","I think as we think about gross margin long term, if that's your core question, because I think in the medium term or in the near term I think Tony is right on that, a) what we're trying to do is just make more money for our shareholders and we pay a lot more attention to that and to win in all the various markets, and so then that becomes really a mix question.","But as you think longer term, our businesses that are capital intense, we're going to generate extremely high gross margins on. And some of the businesses we talk about mix being a little bit of less gross margin percent in, right, like Opto (46:09), tend to be a lot more capital light. And so what's really driving us is how do we generate that really powerful return on invested capital to the capital that we deploy. And in certain businesses, where to generate that, the gross margin percent must be very, very high, right? And then, for other business that are relatively asset-light, we will tend to have a little less gross margin percent, right, but a lot fast returns.","And so as we work our way through that, I think as you think long-term about the business, we're still going to be pretty capital-intense. So you should expect us to have pretty sticky gross margins sort of in this very high level relative to other companies. That in combination with being the lowest cost producer in the world, certainly helps.","Patrick Michael Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Appreciate the details. Good luck in the quarter.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Wendell, Tony, you've done a great job at capital return here and you addressed sort of you're two-thirds of the way already to your $12.5 billion-plus target. Can you maybe address what sort of levers you have to drive that $12.5 billion higher over the next couple of years? Is it capital? Is there business strength that's going to drive that? Do you think that there is potentially other portfolio changes that are in the works? And then I have a follow-up.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","I think it really comes down to something pretty straightforward, Wamsi, which is that in Tony's answer, we said greater than $12.5 billion to start when we put this together.","And, really, it just comes down to the cash generation, which we are right on target for. So if we continue to be right on target for cash generation, you can expect it to be above $12.5 billion, right, and we think we can get done what we need to get done to be able to drive growth over the next decade with our $10 billion. So that's a good way to think about it if you want to think about it analytically.","At such time as we're ready to be able to discuss openly a decision to get a little more specific rather than greater than $12.5 billion, we'll be sure to get back to you. This, of course, is something we have to work through with our board of directors, and I wouldn't expect an announcement relatively rapidly. We're only part of the way through this, but this is something that is always top of mind with us and you can expect us to give it really crisp and due consideration.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks, Wendell. Appreciate the color there. And as my follow-up, in Gorilla historically, the supply chain has been quite long and ramps to support new product introductions have happened earlier in the year. Clearly, you guys are seeing some significant uptick. You're running tanks at lower-than-expected utilization rates, or maybe sub-optimally, not utilization rates. But that would suggest sort of a tighter correlation to product launch timing versus what you're seeing in your Gorilla business. So I'm wondering, has something really changed in the Gorilla supply chain that is causing the ramp to happen at a later point, or is it just that the volumes that you see maybe further out are quite significant and so the upside that you're seeing now is addressing sort of future volume pick-up but the supply chain has not really changed? Thank you.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","I think that's a really astute question. I think we don't have enough data yet to be able to reach a high-confidence conclusion. Very sound question, though. Working on the mobile consumer electronics supply chain, understanding and clarity and correlation between our shipments and new product launches is something that occupies a good amount of our analytics time. But at this point in time, we just don't have enough data to reach a high-confidence call. But great question.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Wendell.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Two questions for me. First off, when you think about the investments that you've highlighted that maybe are putting a little bit of a downtick on gross margins, can you talk about like where you would see maybe a peak level of investments relative to revenue starting to ramp and absorb some of those investments, and maybe excluding the Gorilla Glass seasonality from that? And then secondly, Wendell, you did mention some more momentum around Gorilla Glass for automotive applications. Is there anything specifically you're thinking about there or is it similar to the progress you talked about at the meeting in June? Thanks.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","So let me take the investment question first. Clearly, we've been investing more as the year has gone on this year and we always factor that into our guidance both on gross margin and SG&A and OpEx. And so we invested a little bit more in Q3 than we did in Q2. Investments in Q4 are pretty similar to what we did in Q3, maybe a little bit more. The good news is, is that, so is the sales growth that's happening there. What you've got is that we're really focused in three primary areas from an investment standpoint. That's our Optical Communications map, that's our mobile consumer electronics map, that's our automotive map. And if you think back to the areas where we've seen the growth, those are the three areas that we're growing. So we feel pretty good about the alignment between the investments and when the growth is happening, especially in the near-term.","Thanks. And just the question on Gorilla Glass for auto?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Yeah. We're seeing really nice momentum. Now that being said, this is an industry that moves at a very deliberate pace. So we tend not to try to get overly excited, because you win today for revenue that's in the farther future. But we're feeling really good. And it's interesting, in any innovation that is pretty disruptive like this one is, then what you tend to try to do is you'll get positive surprises and negative surprises; and when you get the positive surprises, you start to double down on them. I'd say we're getting some really nice positive surprises right now in automotive interiors.","People's vision for what they want to do in the interior of vehicles is quite stirring and is driving them very much into the arms of our material set and our co-innovation approach. So we're actually \u2013 been investing an awful lot of time and attention into that, and we're getting really, really nice pull. So I think that's what you're sort of sensing is the exteriors is going about how we would anticipate with the normal deliberate pacing and we're getting really nice positive surprises that we're doubling down on in interiors.","And what's interesting is the type of innovations that they want, a very high revenue generation want because of the value add they want from us around optics, around shape. So that revenue opportunity is looking very attractive right now.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Great. That's very helpful. Good luck going forward.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Notter from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. I guess I wanted to ask about the Optical business. As I go back to the end of Q2, I felt like you guys hesitated a bit in terms of the full year guidance for Optical, and I think part of the narrative was just around timing of certain customer projects. Can you talk about what's changed now versus how you saw things coming out of Q2? Is it just a customer project or two? Is it the Verizon One project? Or is it something more broad-based you're seeing in the industry that's really helping that business? Thanks.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","I'm not so sure there's been a tremendous amount of change since the end of Q2. I think what we were trying to communicate in Q2, which we didn't do a good job of because a lot of people thought it was a hesitation. It was just the lumpiness that happens in this business.","And going on a forward basis, there will be a time when this is just going to show up. We just wanted to remind the investors of that. We didn't mean to imply that we thought that was going to show up in Q3 or in Q4 and that's clearly what some investors interpreted it as.","And so from an underlying standpoint, as Wendell said, we've seen strength in carriers, we see strength in the enterprise business, and from an overall standpoint, we think we're going to be up more than 15%. So we feel very good about Optical Communications.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Got it. And then just one last follow-up. I'd love to ask you about the FX rate. Certainly constant currency, I think you guys are talking about adjusting that rate going into 2018. Can you kind of remind us where you are in that process and when you might address that? I assume you would address it for both the constant currency won as well as the yen. Thanks.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Yeah. That is correct. I mean as we stand right now, we have about 70% of our yen exposure from 2016 to 2022 hedged, and the blended rate of that hedge is about 1.06% (56:44). We're obviously fully hedged in 2017 and we're actually pretty high percentage hedged in 2018 and 2019, the near-term years where we have more confidence in those results.","And what we plan to do in the January call is talk about a new core rate. The core rate today is 99% (57:06). We'll make an adjustment and when we make that adjustment, we'll go back and recast 2016 and 2017 so it will be easy to make comparisons between based on where the core rate adjustment is and so it'll be easy to understand what our underlying business performance is.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question...","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Corning, Inc.","Sorry. We've got time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. That question comes from the line of Rob Cihra from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. I'll sneak in just a quick one. In Optical, carrier has been the driver, continues to look like the driver, but enterprise has been choppy. It looks like it actually may be stabilized a bit after being choppier the last few quarters. I mean, are there any trends you're seeing there? Do you think from here, I mean, looking better or worse I guess in enterprise and data center versus the last few quarters? Thanks.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","So I think it is quite accurate to make the observation that we're having a lot of strength in carrier and that in enterprise and cloud, the predictability and consistency of that has been a little bit less than carrier.","That being said, even though the total actual pacing of how that whole market works can be a little more difficult to predict. One of the reasons you see what you see in our numbers is growing adoption of more and more of our product set and more and more cloud-based providers. So I don't know that you can necessarily look at our revenue alone and then conclude what exactly is going on in the total market because you're having a combination of yes, some wind in the total but also we're getting up some more sale area, so people are liking, our customers are liking our product set more and more across a wider footprint, if that make sense to you, sir.","Robert Cihra - Guggenheim Securities LLC","That's great. Thank you.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Corning, Inc.","Great. Wendell, you have any closing comments that you'd like to make for us?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Well, first of all, let me thank everyone for joining us today and let me reiterate how pleased we are with our continued positive momentum. Our focus is on closing out 2017 strong and then keeping that momentum headed into next year. As we've said, we're on track to deliver the overall goals of our strategy and capital allocation framework and we're excited about the rich set of opportunities ahead of us. And we look forward to staying in touch.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Corning, Inc.","Great. I want to thank you too for joining us today and before we close let you know that we will be meeting with investors at the Credit Suisse conference in late November and then a web replay of today's call will be available on our site for one year starting later this morning.

It is my pleasure to turn the call over to Ann Nicholson, division vice president of investor relations.","Ann Nicholson","Thank you, Lola and good morning. Welcome to Corning's third quarter conference call. With me today is Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jim Flaws, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin our formal comments, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These remarks involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's SEC reports.","You should also note that this presentation contains a number of non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation can be found on our website. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Flaws","Thanks Ann. Good morning everyone. Today I will be focusing mainly on our results for quarter three and our outlook for quarter four. However, we had a significant announcement last week. So I\u2019ll quickly recap that news and how it fits into our corporate strategy.","Corning is a company of long history and a clear strategic framework, which has three main components. First, we grew up primarily through global innovation. Because of our innovation, our operating leverage brings risks, we also work to bring stability and balance to the company with conservative strategies and a broad portfolio of businesses to participate in diverse markets. And finally, we proactively live our values. ","Last week, we announced a series of agreements with Samsung that included an expanded technology cooperation and attaining full ownership of SCP. We also announced incremental returns to shareholders with a new stock repurchase program. Last week\u2019s announcement fits very well within our strategic framework. First, it\u2019s an outstanding financial transaction for the company and for our shareholders with strong accretion and increased cash flow. We will be putting that financial strength to work for shareholders immediately with the new buyback program.","Second, it strengthens our LCD business worldwide with cost reduction opportunities, provides a simpler go-to-market approach and allows future lower capital spending. It enhances our ability to service all our glass customers, including Specialty Materials, Gorilla Glass customers. It enhances our 40-year relationship with Samsung and it preserves Corning\u2019s independence, allowing us to work with all customers.","This slide recaps the major elements of our announcement. Corning will become 100% owner of SCP\u2019s LCD business. We will have a 10-year supply agreement with Samsung for LCD glass. We will expand our collaboration on technology development. Samsung will directly invest $400 million in Corning.","And finally, we have authorized $2 billion in an additional share repurchase, which is effective upon closing, which is expected to occur during the first quarter 2014. This new share repurchase will offset the delusion from a common shares embedded in a convertible preferred shares issued to Samsung.","Resulting impact to our core financial statements expected to be approximately $2 billion increase in sales, $350 million in incremental NPAT, and additional $500 million per year free cash flow. When you include the impact of the share repurchases, total accretion to EPS on a fully diluted basis is approximately 20% in 2014 and \u201915.","So before I jump into the quarterly details, I would like to remind you we provide our results on a core earnings basis in order to exclude non-performance-related items and increase transparency of our operating results.","Core financial measures are non-GAAP and of course, we continue to report our GAAP results.

Pleased to say our third quarter results were very strong. We experienced some headwinds in certain portions of the company compared to our expectation entering the quarter.","However, thanks to excellent operational execution and cost control, we delivered a fourth consecutive quarter year-over-year strong EPS growth. In total, we delivered 17% growth in NPAT, 18% growth in earnings per share on a 10% increase in sales.","Display technologies continues to regain positive momentum. During the quarter, we renewed the contracts that we had announced at this time last year. We think this is a very positive signal for our Display business.","LCD glass price declines were again moderate in Q3 as expected. Looking ahead, we expect Q4 price declines to be in the same moderate range as Q3 and our market share remains stable going forward.","And our other businesses also performed well during the quarter. Telecom nearly doubled, net income year-over-year and a 24% increase in sales. Specialty Materials has sequential profitability gains driven by Gorilla Glass manufacturing and sales. Life sciences and environmental had year-over-year net income expansion, despite lackluster demand for environmental products and diesel. So, overall, we are pleased with the third quarter.","So now I\u2019d like to turn to our quarter three core earnings results. Sales were $2.1 billion, up 10% versus a year ago. Gross margin was 44%, up 1.5 points year-over-year and better than our expectation, driven by additional volume in Display.","Gross equity earnings of $121 million were down 30% versus a year ago. As a reminder, the SCP portion of this is at constant yen. I\u2019ll provide more on equity earnings in a few minutes. And our core effective tax rate for Q3 was 18%. We now forecast the full year core effective tax rate to be approximately 17%.","Finally, core earnings per share were $0.33, up $0.05 over a year ago. Versus a year ago, SG&A was down in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales, and RD&E spending was also down as a percentage of sales.","Now let\u2019s turn to our segments and I\u2019ll start with Display. We believe the overall glass market was up slightly in the quarter. Sequentially Corning and SCP\u2019s combined volume grew by low single digits. Overall, our market share remained stable.","Core sales for Display were $689 million in Q3, an increase of 7% versus last year. Price declines were similar to Q2 and in the range we expected. Core gross equity earnings from our Display equity affiliates, which includes Samsung Corning Precision and also our OLED glass venture Samsung Corning Advanced Glass were $85 million in Q3, a decrease of 40% year-over-year and down 27% sequentially. Lower year-over-year volume of LCD glass, price declines on a higher tax rate impacted SCPs results versus the prior year. The sequential decline was driven by a more moderate sequential price declines and lower intercompany glass sales and some foreign exchange impact. Your modeling purposes Display equity affiliates third quarter, Display glass sales in constant-yen were about $509 million, a decrease of 19% from last year. ","As a reminder this represents Eagle XG and Lotus Glass sale only. Our public filings report our Display equity affiliate's total sales, which include various other products. Now we consolidate sales from our acquisition of SCP, we\u2019ll be reporting their LCD Glass sales in our Display technology segment results. Now sales from SCG and other products will remain excluded in the equity earnings from those non-LCD Glass entities will remain in the equity earnings line. Equity earnings from those affiliates would have been immaterial in Q3.","Display\u2019s core net income was $304 million down 9% versus last year, however without the equity earnings Display\u2019s net income would have been up approximately 14%. Strong wholly owned results reflect increased sales and solid cost reduction efforts. Our wholly owned Display business increased gross margins slightly on a year-over-year basis. On the supply chain front, we estimate the forward looking weeks of inventory contracted to 16 weeks in quarter three as we expected. This drop is due primarily to the higher seasonal volume in Q4. We expect that the absolute level inventory will decline significantly in Q4 and that forward looking weeks of inventory will be approximately 15.5 weeks at the end of Q4. ","Now let me turn to telecom. Q3 sales were $650 million that was up 24% year-over-year and slightly better than our expectation of 20%. Majority of the year-over-year increase was due to career growth in North America and EMEA, as well as enterprise growth in North America, which more than offset year-over-year declines in China fiber sales. China fiber market was softer than expected in Q3 and we believe this will continue through Q4. I give some more detail on this in our outlook. The consolidation of previous equity affiliates and small acquisition also contributed to sales growth year-over-year. Telecom\u2019s year-over-year net income was up 86%, earnings improvement was driven by the higher volume and also cost reductions in manufacturing and asset management. ","Environmental Q3 sales were down 3% year-over-year and slightly below our expectations. Light duty diesel sales were down versus last year in the week European auto market and the U.S. Class A truck demanded retail and [Belgrade] remain soft. Light duty substrate sales were consistent with quarter three over a year ago. And despite the Environmental sales decline, net income was up 19% year-over-year driven by improved manufacturing performance in cost reductions and operating expense. ","Now Specialty Materials, Q3 sales were up 8% sequentially as expected and they really delivered on a sequential growth target in the quarter. This is down approximately from 10% last year due to our continued working off of extra supply chain inventory that was built during Q4 of 2012. We've been dealing with this work off of inventory every quarter this year and expect to be pass the issue after Q4. The good news is at a consumption level plus usage going to retail has been up more than 30% this year. Core net income was consistent with last year, Gorilla Glass manufacturing improvements offset year-over-year segment sales decline. We\u2019re very, very pleased with the improvement in Gorilla manufacturing efficiency over the last several quarters. ","In Life Sciences, Q3 sales were up 39% year-over-year due to the additional sales from the Discovery Labware acquisition, which closed on October, 31 last year. The year-over-year core net income was up a 156%. After one full year of ownership we\u2019re very happy with the progress of the Discovery Labware integration and its positive impact on our earnings.","Now, we did feel some effects of the continuing government sequestration in this business. We estimate the impact on sales in the quarter was somewhere between $5 million and $10 million.","Now turning to Dow Corning, gross equity earnings for silicones were $28 million in Q3, consistent with last year better than expected, driven by some favorable one-items of approximately $14 million. Sales were down slightly year over year, and pricing issues continued primarily in Asia.","Although we are not including Hemlock in our core earnings this year, Hemlock was cash flow positive. And we have been encouraged by some elements of Hemlock\u2019s performance.","Our balance sheet is strong. We ended the third quarter with $5.4 billion in cash and short-term investments was about $1.6 billion of that in total United States. Our net cash position is $2.6 billion.","Capital spending was $244 million in the quarter. We will now expect our total capital spending for the year to be $1.1 billion, down from our previous forecast of $1.3 billion. Free cash flow for the quarter was $268 million. As a reminder, free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation GAAP can be found on our website.","You may recall late April, we had announced 11% common stock dividend and a new $2 billion stock buyback program. During quarter three, we purchased -- repurchased $209 million of our stock. Year-to-date purchases on the April program are $441 million.","So now I\u2019ll turn to our outlook. As we mentioned in our pre-release last week, quarter four has normally had some seasonal downticks in several of our businesses. Long-time followers of Corning know that telecom pattern is usually seasonally down in Q4.","Now last year 2012, we did not follow that pattern due to Hurricane Sandy in the NBN ramp in Australia. However, we are expecting a normal seasonal downturn in telecom this year. And that will be amplified by some specific items in telecom and other businesses.","These are likely to result lower sequential earnings. Also embedded in this outlook is our expectation of a slight pullback on Display glass demand versus Q3. We did not experience that pullback in quarter four of 2012.","Our year-over-year earnings comparison will be influenced for some of the same reasons but also for some different ones. We had a significant supply chain inventory building, Gorilla Glass in quarter four last year, that will not repeat.","So I\u2019ll turn to Display outlook. We start with the current view of the end market 2013. Expected retail market is measured in square feet of glass to be up mid-to-high single digits. Right now, it currently looks tracking to be at the high end of that forecast. This is predominantly driven by the increase in the average screen size of televisions.","Worldwide units sales of 50-inch plus televisions are up 93% year-to-date. The television market in China continues to meet our expectations. Sales of television to Chinese National Day holiday were as we expected.","Many industry analysts are describing the sales in China at the back half of this year is disappointing. Please recall that we had forecasted the end of the China Television subsidy and for retail sell through, area demand area to be up only 5% in the second half.","Now let me turn to quarter four. For the LCD glass market will be down slightly. We expect our wholly own Display business in SCP combined volumes to be down slightly from Q3 but shares remain stable.","Inventory buildup from earlier this year is expected to feed the high-retail demand in Q4. In lower panel maker utilizations, we expect the supply chain inventory to reduce by approximately half a week from 16 weeks of inventory to 15.5. We estimate LCD glass price declines to be moderate in Q4 and a similar moderate rate to Q3.","I\u2019ll spend a little extra time on telecom\u2019s forecast today to make sure you understand the current dynamics. Recall last year, our telecom sales in Q4 did not decline sequentially because of the disaster recovery efforts from Hurricane Sandy increased quarter four 2012 sales in North America and fiber-to-the-home sales to NBN ramp strongly quarter four a year ago.","In contrast this year our sales in North America were actually in all-time high in Q3. Our fiber-to-the-home sales in Australia's NBM initiative were expected to ramp over the course of 2013 versus 2012. The construction delays have gotten worse since the lower the ramp. So we expect Q4 sales in Australia to be down significantly year-over-year. Worldwide carrier sales are expected to be up 10% versus last year.","The fiber market in 2013 has not materialized as we had expected. Optical fiber market had grown by an average volume of 16% through last decade and had set record high for each of the last six years. We had expected 5% to 10% market growth for 2013, but now I believe that 2013 fiber market will be flat. North America declined more than expected. China is flat and we have served contractions since some other key markets. ","While we are still assessing our view of the 2014 market, inventory has been increasing in certain locations due to the flat 2013 market demand. So for quarter four, we expect telecom sales to be down low single digits versus last year and total for the year we expect 5% sales growth in telecom driven primarily by fiber-to-the-home in enterprise projects. Environmental we expect Q4 sales to up slightly verses Q4 of 2012, driven by heavy duty diesel market in China and Europe.","We believe that China -- regulation in Europe and China will lead to growth and demand for heavy duty diesel products as we enter 2014. Full year sales environmental segment are expected to be down approximately 5% year-over-year driven by the softness in light duty diesel market in Europe and heavy duty diesel in North America. ","Specialty material sales are expected to be consistent sequentially, but down 20% year-over-year in Q4 due to inflated Q4 in 2012 by previously mentioned inventory building in Gorilla Glass. Expected advanced optics sales to be up year-over-year as demand for semi-conductor industry continues to improve. Gorilla Glass sales are down year-over-year due to IT handheld supply chain over built in Q4 of 2012. This chart shows the Cover Glass sales volume versus industry consumption (inaudible) being handheld square feet.","In Q4 demand is up nicely year-over-year, but the overbuilding Q4 of 2012 puts our volume down versus last year. Gorilla Glass 2013 sales volume is expected to be down 15% for us due to the fact of last year's inventory build. Adding to that decline is a lower -- Large Cover Glass sales year-over-year. The full year expects specialty material sales to be down in mid-single digits driven by the impact in the supply chain build up and lower demand for Large Cover Glass. However, Gorilla profitability improved nicely this year and we expect net income to be up slightly. In Life Sciences, we expect sales to be down 10% year-over-year, mostly due to the full three months of added sales from acquisition versus the partial quarter of 2012, as I say down and up 10%.","Dow Corning expects earnings from its silicon segment to be similar to Q3. We expected Core gross margin to be consistent year-over-year at 42%. SG&A is expected to be 15% of sales and R&D 9% of sales. Core equity earnings expected to be down about 20% versus last year. SCP is expected to be the main drivers caused by year-over-year price in volume decline. We expect our Core effective tax rate for 2013 to be about 17% and that concludes my opening comments. Ann?","Ann Nicholson","Thank you, Jim. Lola, we'll open the lines now for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. (Operators instructions) First we'll go to the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan","Yeah, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So I wanted to pick off Jim with maybe a little bit of further color inventory. I mean the inventory was pretty volatile this year. We sort of got to the reduction that you'd call for at the end of the year or at the beginning of this year, but it's more than I think you guys were anticipating and I just wonder if you could talk about the sustainability of these inventory levels in 2014, kind of what should we feel be expecting to have a reduction over 2014 or do you think we hold the key level, just kind of what you are thinking there. And then also on the CapEx, just a clarification, are you guys into new CapEx number now including the elimination of that Chinese plant bill or is that still yet to come?","And then on optical, if you could just talk a little bit about, if there is any more color you could give us in terms of what\u2019s going on in North America, is this is a single carrier effect that you are seeing or is it more broad based in terms of what\u2019s happening with optical fiber demand? Thanks.","Jim Flaws","Okay. That\u2019s a lot of questions. So on inventory in the Display industry, inventory in absolute terms build as we march through quarter one and quarter two significantly and somewhat in quarter three. At the end of quarter two, we got to 18 weeks and now we are at 16. As we do that, we are always forward looking. So the drop from 18 to 16 really reflects the fact that Q4 forward-looking volumes are always so much higher.","In quarter four, what we expect is the absolute non-inventory drop and we looked in the forward looking relative to Q1, I think we will be a little below 16 at 15.5. It\u2019s our expectation right now that there is no reason for the inventory to be very different from this 15.5 to 16, frankly our precision our accuracy and ability to do that for week is pretty suspect. But I would say we are delighted by the fact that we think we are back about 16 level and maybe 15.5, because as you know we didn\u2019t like being at 18.","Relative to the CapEx question, Rod, the 1.1 is the forecast for this year and you may recall that China Television plant was never in Corning wholly owned numbers. So you would not be seeing that in any of the guidance that we would have been talking about. The drop from 1.3 to 1.1 reflects two elements. One, we are always a little slower in capital spending than what we think we are going to be.","And the second, we are teasing given in the slightly moderate -- more moderate sales growth than what we expected, that\u2019s probably split about half and a half. But the China is not a factor in that at all. Wendell, you want to comment on optical North America?","Wendell Weeks","Sure. In North America, what we saw that this year we ended the stimulus program and that is what has led to the lower volume levels. We had expected that -- we did expect the stimulus to add and the volumes to drop as a result. But it was what base when it return to and we had expected the base to show a little more growth from what we are currently forecasting.","On a longer-term basis, we are pretty bullish on North America. If you are a close watcher of the space, you would have seen comments from major carrier on that getting more aggressive on fiber-to-the-home, which we take as very encouraging.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. The pricing Display glass seems to have been moderate for a numerous quarters now and returns from the strong partner and important shareholder. Can we call victory on pricing -- little moderate pricing pre-sale, perhaps what\u2019s been the response from non-Samsung customers? And if that\u2019s the swing factor to watch in terms of pricing as we move into 2014. And then changing to overall early lead as we look into next year, how you feel about global demand for Display glass?","And then, Wendell, just a follow-up on your question, if the fiber may have peaked due to these lack of stimulus now here in North America and if I look at some of the big projects overseas that seems to be winding down, how should we think about demand for fiber, is that just kind of a trough here that we should be intriguing to? Thank you.","Jim Flaws","I\u2019ll start and then turn over to Wendell. On pricing for LCD glass, I don\u2019t think you can declare permanent victory. We have to remain ever vigilant about this, but we are obviously delighted by what you mentioned, Mark, with a number of quarters were down, had a moderate level.","I\u2019d call your attention also to something we announced this morning and that is the renewal of the agreements that we announced last October, which had the structure of certain customers where our position was determined by the contract and the pricing would be related and that customer would be done by what the competition is of that customer.","We are very excited to have those be renewed for this upcoming year of 2014. In some cases, we now have contracts that extend beyond 2014. So I'll never, in spite of all [retrieve] that we really made a lot of progress. Let me take the early read on 2014 and then I'll turn it over to you for the comments on what other customers are saying about the Samsung agreement.","Our early read right now Mark is that we're heading into 2014 in a pretty good position in Display, if our expectation is right that there is a little pullback in utilization in Q4 at panel makers, we think that makes the inventory situation being very good heading into next year. And we continue to feel that, television sales will be strong. For us, it's all about size and as I reported we're seeing great year-over-year demand in large size televisions. And so, we're feeling pretty good about our early read on 2014 of for LCD. ","Wendell do you want to comment about reaction from other customers","Wendell Weeks","I would say so far the reaction from other customers to our recent series of agreements with Samsung has been positive. I leave after the conference call today on a world tour to spend some time with (inaudible) face-to-face. But so far the reaction has been positive. We may view it as an enhancement of our ability to act independently across the globe and then that taking it as a positive.","So more to come, once again we're vigilant on those items, in the end it will be our ability to innovate for them and serve them well that will keep them loyal with us. You also had a question on telecom I want to make sure I understand it. You are asking that, are we entering a slower period for telecom in the upcoming year, was that what you were asking?","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets","","Yes. Since the (inaudible) is one down here and some of the margin projects overseas seems to have peaked, we see long people or we see growth again maybe into 2015.","Wendell Weeks","","We're just putting together our view of that. I would say we have some opposing practice in terms of fiber volume, then I find that hypothesis that you are laying out has some merit in terms of fiber volume that a lot of it all pivots around China. And this year China was relatively flat in terms of fiber volume demand. And China can be okay as it looks forward. But I think your hypothesis has some merit on fiber demand, I think on overall telecom sales though it's a little different. We're seeing an awful lot of strength in enterprise those were all of our data center built machine and awful lot of strength in our wireless product set.","So I think telecom sales are about a lot more than fiber volume. So I don't know that your hypothesis holds for overall telecom sales. Does that make sense to you?","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets","Yes. That's helpful. Thank you and good luck gentleman. ","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Vamsi Mohan with Bank of America.","Vamsi Mohan - Bank of America","","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Jim, can you bridge the SCP equity income between Q2 and Q3. It looks like it's down from $117 million to $85 million, that's a 25% or so decline, was there incremental share loss there. And roughly what percent of SCP capacity is correctly unutilized and I will follow up?","Jim Flaws","So in quarter one and two we are averaging about $125 million net come, in quarter three we're $85 million and probably be about $80 million in quarter four, so there clearly is a step down, we've known this for a while. The impact is we continue to have price erosion and unlike our wholly owned business, we have no volume growth and actually have a little bit of volume decline. It is not a share loss. Share remains the same it has been at both our large customers in Korea. ","We did have some other impacts, some of the strength and income at SCP in earlier part of the year was actually they are making product and selling it through us under our old agreement. And you may recall that we've told in the first half of the year, a wholly owned business is relatively full. So we had SCP make product for us and under the old agreement they kept the majority of those profits.","There also was a little FX impact in this quarter, but fundamentally not a share loss. But just there is not growth in demand in Korea right now and prices go down there and that impacted and we are not having them make product for us. And obviously this all resets when we get to the deal closing. Then we can use the worldwide capacity most efficiently.","Relative to your comment on capacity in Korea, we have a significant amount offline there, but that significant amount offline comes about from what happened in the fourth quarter 2011 when the LG shares stepped down dramatically. So that\u2019s where we have a big opportunity to use those very efficient tanks going forward.","Vamsi Mohan - Bank of America","Thanks. And as a follow-up, given the utilization rate cuts at panel makers that you alluded to? Can you talk about if you are taking this opportunity to also cut utilization rates in Display and what the anticipated gross margin impact from such cuts could be? Thank you.","Jim Flaws","You are seeing the gross margin impact in our corporate guidance which was down for the quarter that\u2019s driven primarily by Display, some by Telecom. We have an enormous sequence of tank repairs coming up, so we will take advantage of those repairs that will allow us to throttle back a little.","I do want to emphasize that this pull back from panel makers that we are talking about is not a significant one. We are talking about the -- our volume in Q3 down only a small percent, in Q4 to only a small percentages versus Q3. So it\u2019s not a big deal but it is down.","Wendell Weeks","Yeah. I would characterize it -- it\u2019s really a feathering as we come out to that end of the year and the degree of precision on whether or not we will -- how much we will feather is in the pretty precision area. So this is subtle move. It\u2019s not a significant move.","Vamsi Mohan - Bank of America","Thanks Wendell. I mean, but if I could just follow up to that, I mean, to get to a two to three-week reduction in inventory, that\u2019s quite a material amount in inventory weeks. What sort of TV units sell-through, would you need for that inventory weak number to for a large sized TVs would you need to -- for that inventory number to move down by two to three weeks? Thanks.","Wendell Weeks","Vamsi, I don\u2019t think you realized that we have already achieved couple of weeks because of the forward looking. But as you know the television demand jumps up seasonally dramatically, in the square footage at retail in Q4 versus Q3 in absolute square feet goes up by 33% driven by the seasonality, primarily in North America and somewhat in Europe because of the holidays and obviously large sales -- large sized television of that.","But we always see that type of seasonality. But we are -- it is that increase of a couple of 100 million square feet at retail, it gets pulled out of supply chain that causes the absolute number to come down.","Vamsi Mohan - Bank of America","Okay. Thanks, Wendell.","Operator","Next we go to the line of Amitabh Passi with UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Hi, guys. I had a couple of questions as well. Jim, Wendell, for you this year, you talked about re-upping or renewing your contract. I was wondering if you can update us in terms of whether there were any changes and in even market share or pricing assumptions?","And then, Jim, I wanted to confirm, if I look at your fourth quarter guidance? Do you anticipate core EPS to be down year-over-year. I wasn\u2019t sure what you said about OpEx?","And then my final question was just on the Gorilla Glass guidance? I would have expected a seasonal uptick in the fourth quarter, so just surprised that you are guiding sales to be sequentially flat? Thanks.","Jim Flaws","So Gorilla being sequentially flat, we did have some new model launches in Q3. I think there is a possibility, it could go up a little, but right now we are thinking it\u2019s flat sequentially. You wanted to comment on the renewal of the contracts and the terms?","Wendell Weeks","Sure. So we are really happy that to come to renewals to extend those contracts at least to the end of 2014. As Jims said, some of them now stretch beyond that. On -- in all of them, these are not market share gaining moves, these are market share stabilization move, so no change in our share at these customers and no change in the pricing mechanism.","Jim Flaws","Now I\u2019ll finish up with your question about core EPS. Since you know we don\u2019t give official EPS guidance. Our hope would be to have -- be flat sequentially but it\u2019s possible with this down draft in Telecom because of the year-over-year seasonality we\u2019re having this year, didn\u2019t have last year and the fact that we don\u2019t have any inventory build than Gorilla that we had last year, that we could be lower year-over-year on core EPS. ","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Okay, perfect. Thank you, guys. ","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go through line of Joseph Wolf with Barclays. ","Joseph Wolf - Barclays","Hi, thanks for taking a couple of questions. Just quickly one on the CapEx with the reduction of about $200 million, how sure we\u2019re thinking about a catch up next year or is it too early to think about that based on what\u2019s changing given the Samsung deal? And then on the cover glass, you mentioned that the -- some of the large sizes were down and that turned some of the results. Could you talk about new opportunities that you may be seeing for Large Cover Glass maybe new designs or things that are out there for 2014?","Jim Flaws","Yeah, I\u2019ll start up by the CapEx. The couple of $100 million being down, we\u2019re not expecting that we will see a big role over into next year. We\u2019re still holding right now our forecast of 13 for the next year. That excludes what would be the impact of consolidating Samsung, but I remind you when we consolidate Samsung\u2019s ongoing capital and we do get the benefit of all their cash flow. But right now we\u2019re expecting to be about 13 next year also. Wendell, you want to talk about Large Cover Glass?","Wendell Weeks","Yes. So we continue to work at a number of different opportunities for Large Cover Glass. I think you\u2019ll understand if I don\u2019t speculate directly on the timing of those and the like. However we\u2019re presuming them in both consumer electronics and non-consumer electronics applications. We\u2019re not counting on a big surge in the near term, but we believe that long term there is a strong opportunity within and like, large area covers. ","Joseph Wolf - Barclays","Great, thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go through Stephen Parks with Cross Research.","Stephen Parks - Cross Research","Good morning. Just a follow up on the Gorilla Glass question, what changed between Q3 and Q4 because it seems like Q4 is a little bit weaker than you would have thought just a few months ago and then secondly given my understanding of what you\u2019re saying about sell through of Gorilla Glass to retail level, is it to assume that once this inventory corrections are over that you\u2019re still working for that type of growth next year? Thank you.","Jim Flaws","So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a real change (inaudible) from our point of view on Gorilla. We\u2019ve been dealing with the inventory work off all year long, but if you -- the consumption cycle can vary by depending one moral roll ups happen. But clearly year-over-year consumption quarter four versus or '12 versus this year is up, so we feel pretty good about that sequence and that consumption level last year quarter four was down from quarter three just like it is slightly this year. We believe that we\u2019ll be finished working off this pile of inventory that was built in quarter four last year after quarter four and the thing that we\u2019re interested in is the growth of IT and handheld and roll out a touch on notebook should drive year-over-year growth for Gorilla next year.","Wendell Weeks","So as we think about it Steve, I think the -- at the end market level, we\u2019re seeing phones that are touch enabled up about 25% this year and tablets up about 30% and we see continued nice growth next year. I think though the --- always the challenging thing about forecasting quarter-to-quarter in Gorilla is the relatively long and complicated supply chain. Having Jim hit on, the good news which is, we believed that as we get through the fourth quarter of this year we will have worked to the last of the overhang of the over ordering from our customers in quarter four of last year. But I totally hear you, the supply chain, given its length and complexity can be difficult to forecast in any given quarter but the year-over-year trends at the consumption level continue to look good to us, Steve.","Stephen Parks - Cross Research","That\u2019s totally fair. And then just one very quick follow-up, did you wind up shipping as much as you though into the touch notebook market for the second half of the year or how would you describe that? Thanks.","Wendell Weeks","Our Touch on notebook, I think there is couple of areas. First of all, the overall penetration touch into notebooks has ended up being less than what we had thought it would be at the beginning of the year. Some of this has to do with the some of the challenges of Windows 8, some of it has to do with some of the challenges of what will notebooks work like with touch. Will they be convertible or will they just be notebooks that work just like a notebook but I can touch it to.","And all of that I don't think has yet been work through with the clear product concepts by our brands. So I think the penetration is certainly lower than what we would have thought at the beginning of the year and the notebooks continue to be priced and volume challenged.","We do believe that this will be overcome that touch will be an important part of notebooks going forward and that ultimately about half of them will be touch enabled. And what we\u2019ll continue to do is work to devise product that makes that more compelling product as well as to deal with some of the lower end and attack of lesser materials because of the incredible price sensitivity of these notebooks and that no one is yet to find the way to turn touch into a compelling price feature.","Stephen Parks - Cross Research","Great. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next we go to line of Jim Suva with Citi.","Jim Suva - Citi","Hi. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask a question, on this acquisition of SCP, you laid down the 20% accretion. Can you talk a little bit about the implied buyback timing or character assumption under that. Is it for the whole $2 billion to be employed like on the very early part of the year or average through the year and what is Corning\u2019s intention for that large stock buyback for the timing?","Wendell Weeks","So we said 20%, we said approximately but our intent is to get those shares taken out of the market as soon as we can. So we have made a final decision on what we are doing in terms of whether we\u2019re doing to accelerate stock repurchase program or not. As soon as we do make that decision, we\u2019ll let you know, but our desire is to get them out of the share account for 2014.","Jim Suva - Citi","Back to start. It sounds like in other words not average through the year rather very front end of this. So you can get the EPS benefit for the whole longevity of the year rather than spreading it gradually over the year. Is that correct?","Wendell Weeks","That would be our tendency to try to lean that way.","Jim Suva - Citi","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Patrick Newton with Stifel.","Patrick Newton - Stifel","Thanks for taking my question. I guess, first one for Jim or Wendell, I guess pertaining to your LCD price mechanisms been in place now for about four quarters and your announced renewal. I\u2019m curious if you could discuss any competitive responses you have seen during this -- during this time?","Wendell Weeks","Well, we try not to applying to much on what our competitors are doing but what\u2019s happen for us on moderate price decline has obviously been influenced on those customers where we have these clauses on what our competitors do can have an impact. But I think overall the industry has seen moderate price declines, but I won\u2019t comment more detail about our competitors. You obviously can look at your public statements.","Patrick Newton - Stifel","All right. And then I guess on SCP, the $350 million in incremental income that you've guided to and implied the continued erosion of fundamentals at SCP relative to even the most reported quarter or the most recently reported quarter. I guess can you help us understand what to do comfort that these fundamentals are going to stabilize and what kind of thought process is behind you achieving your targeted $2 billion in free cash flow for the next four years?","Jim Flaws","I start out by saying we do expect erosion to continue at SCP in quarter four. And once we take over, we believe that we\u2019ll have the ability to manage that operation in a way that we can stop the erosion. And so we expect to get synergies from better utilization of the world wide set of tanks that we have. We\u2019ll be able to get out of some high cost facilities. We will -- we do expect volume growth next year. In a way, we\u2019ll be thinking about this as -- we\u2019ll no longer be telling you what SCP is. We\u2019ll be telling you what our worldwide LCD business is and also our Gorilla business.","Remember, this year we\u2019ve been dealing with Gorilla basically not having the growth we expected because of the overhang of inventory. We\u2019ll now get that growth again because we\u2019re matching the consumption level and that\u2019s got to come out of tanks that we need to operate and so that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to get some of the benefits going forward. But we\u2019re pretty confident that we\u2019ll be able to achieve that $350 million incremental.","Wendell Weeks","I think, if we just take a look at the fundamentals here, we expect Korea has a market, the two customers in Korea to be relatively stable. They have been and we expect them to continue to. We\u2019re quite happy with our market share in Korea and our customer share at both of those players. So for us, the acquisition is about cost reduction and being able to utilize that low cost capacity to deserve our growing other customer bases around the globe and that\u2019s where that real stabilization comes from on the financials.","To your first question, I would just amplify what Jim said is for us, these customer agreements aren\u2019t about our competitors, they\u2019re about our customers. And approaching, one of the main reasons that we\u2019ve extended them is that we have noted and our customers have noted that it has significantly improved our ability to focus on what really matters to our customers around innovation, service, quality et cetera and it has taken the whole tone of our dialog and focused it on how do we improve each other\u2019s situations in a more integrated way. So that\u2019s one of the main reasons that we have extended it.","Patrick Newton - Stifel","All right, thank you very much. And I guess just last one for me Jim is on Gorilla to make sure I understand what you are implying. It seems like you are now looking for flat to slightly up Gorilla revenue year-over-year given the 4Q guidance. And as recently last quarter, I believe you reiterated a 10% year-over-year Gorilla growth. You\u2019ve been aware of the inventory issues now for several quarters. I\u2019m curious it sounds like something on the demand side is kind of a delta between what you expected last quarter versus the new guidance. Am I reading the growth rate correctly? And if you could elaborate a little bit on what changed sequentially outside of the inventory? Thank you. ","Jim Flaws","I\u2019m struggling following your numbers for Gorilla.","Wendell Weeks","I think this may be best if -- while we\u2019re pausing here, are you talking about the consumption level that you saw on that slide or are you talking about our sell in?","Patrick Newton - Stifel","If you can tell about your revenue recognition on Gorilla, I think by my math we don\u2019t have an absolute number for 3Q. But I believe you said your guidance is flat on a revenue basis for Gorilla sequentially.","Jim Flaws","No, we said flat volume I believe.","","Patrick Newton - Stifel","Flat volume, okay. Well, that helps explain, I have to go and recheck with my math. But in essence, I guess that 10% number year-over-year growth I\u2019m assuming is coming down slightly?","Jim Flaws","10% in, what?","Patrick Newton - Stifel","","You originally guided to Gorilla Glass or just revenue to grow 10% year-over-year in 2013?","Wendell Weeks","","That was a long time ago.","Patrick Newton - Stifel","Because recently you last quarter you implied that was still\u2026","Jim Flaws","It could have been sequential. I think we are probably best serve here. Maybe if you and Ian can do a follow-up and think of the -- and just think of the models, make sure we\u2019re not plugged and passed each other. I think we are probably best serve by that and what more we are talking past each other.","Patrick Newton - Stifel","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Yeah. I\u2019m wondering if you could talk a little bit about -- you talked about 2014 and your expectation for TVs a little bit. What type of volume growth in glass should we be thinking about for 2014?","Wendell Weeks","But we haven\u2019t given official guidance yet for the market for next year. But I think that we\u2019d be expecting probably directionally the glass demand in the absence of inventory shifts that we are not expecting, so it would be again in the upper single digits.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Okay. And the inventory situation in Gorilla, is that -- is that one customer or is that multiple customers?","Wendell Weeks","Multiple Customers. ","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Multiple customers. Okay. And I just want to clarify, I may have missed, EPS growth was a little confusing. I thought you said flat quarter-on-quarter but then you came back and said year-over-year it could be flat. So, I just want to be clear, are you talking year-over-year or are you talking sequentially could be flat or slightly down","Wendell Weeks","","We said sequentially, EPS could be down and we said that year-over-year, EPS could be flat or slightly down.","Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Thanks very much. Just on the contract renegotiation. It seems like you guys completed that a bit earlier than last year and also for a longer-term, and also it seems like this year you didn\u2019t have a price reset like you said last year, and all of this in the context of what seems to be an environment with a little excess inventory in the supply chain than what we had last year. So, is there anything we can read into that as far as Corning having a better structural or competitive position relative to a year ago?","Wendell Weeks","Timing was identical to a year ago. But we said, you are referring to was the impact of the first initiation of this, as we had to get kind of reset in quarter four as a result of the agreement. But the timing was identical for those.","Jim Flaws","I think I would add. I think what you should read into it is that our customers are really delighted with the agreements. And so they like the way in which this allows us to work together and I think that\u2019s why it seems like such a come easy event, is it something that our customers really want to do.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","","Got it. But, also it does seems extended for a longer period of time. It seems last year was just a one year extension or contract and this year it seems to have been for a longer?","Wendell Weeks","So it\u2019s a real mix by the customers and what we -- what our customer do is pick what they like and we were willing to agree to that. I think if we were willing, we probably could have gone even longer with more customers. But as, Jim, said for us, this takes cost and vigilance in each of these moves as we try to measure twice.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","","Okay. And then just a quick on Gorrilla, can you just characterize the competitive environment there and whether that has played any factor into the slightly lower expectations?","Wendell Weeks","So really we haven\u2019t see much change in the competitive environment. So it\u2019s not a market share issue for us in any of the major brands. We continue to feel very good about our share. Now that being said, there is more growth in the very low end piece of the smartphone market or sort of white goods and for tablets, the know named tablets in China. And these are phones for instance that sell for like less than $150. In that area, we have not penetrated as highly as you would normally expect us to.","But our competition there is not from other alumino-silicate glasses. It\u2019s from just thin window glass with chem. exchanged. So what we\u2019re doing now is we\u2019re taking a look at what should we do in that market segment to compete against the very low end product that really -- we haven\u2019t seen since the very beginning of the cover -- glass effort so long ago in handheld and tablet. We defeated that as an inferior material.","And now we\u2019ve got to figure out how to address it in a market segment that is addressing a different piece of the market. So the way I\u2019m looking at, that\u2019s a really nice opportunity. Sorry for the long answer, but I thought maybe a more wholesome answer would be helpful to you.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","No, that was very helpful. Thank you.","Ann Nicholson","Okay, we\u2019ve got time for one more question.","Operator","Certainly and that will come from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray.","Jagadish Iyer - Piper Jaffray","Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Two questions; first, Jim you talked about the demand for 2014. I just wanted to hear you thoughts on what is your early read on supply in terms of the glass. We have talked about capacity being taken off line, but is there any early thought into how the supply is going to be for next year? And then I have a follow up.","Jim Flaws","So we think glass supply remains relatively stable. We\u2019ve seen disciplined behavior by the glass industry including ourselves. So we\u2019re not expecting any change in glass price as we head into 2014.","Jagadish Iyer - Piper Jaffray","And as a follow up, just wanted to -- you did say that the inventory is going to be finished up by the end of Q4 for Specialty Materials. So I was just thinking about -- as we look at 2014 and as you start to roll out new products, how should we be thinking about growth rates for these new products potentially driving year-over-year growth in Specialty Materials for 2014 or it should we still expect consumer devices to be the -- the mobile devices to be the main driver here? Thank you.","Wendell Weeks","I think you should continue to think about the mobile devices to be the main driver. I think you\u2019ll see some touch on notebook improve as well. And most of the other areas around was format and other applications are going to be sort of slower moving as opposed to the speed you see out of mobile consumer electronics.","Ann Nicholson","Thanks, Jagadish. Jim?","","Jim Flaws","Just to wrap up comments, first on investor relation events; we\u2019ll be attending the UBS Technology Conference on November 20 in a new location Sausalito, California. And second, we\u2019ll have a group at the Credit Suisse Technology Conference on December 3 in Scottsdale. A brief summary of the highlights of the call; we remain very excited about last week\u2019s announcement on the purchase of the remainder of SCP LCD business. We\u2019re looking forward to closing the quarter one and realizing the synergies that Wendell was talking about from the integration.","I think we\u2019re delighted by our performance in Q3, strong results across all of our businesses. We\u2019re expecting just normal seasonality in Q4, but obviously additional headwinds from China fiber demand. We are very happy with the progress return to positive momentum in Display, combining the synergies of the deal with Q4 moderate price declines and now the vast majority of our 2014 volume under contract should continue that momentum. For the company, we feel we\u2019ve got fundamentals in our businesses that are solid. And lastly for you as shareholders, we\u2019re very committed to continue to return more cash towards you. Ann?

It is my pleasure to turn the call over to Ann Nicholson, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Ann Nicholson","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Corning\u2019s quarter two 2019 earnings call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.","I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company\u2019s financial reports.","You should also note that we will be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at Corning.com.","You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. Supporting slides are being shown live on our webcast and we encourage you to follow along. They are also available on our website for downloading.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Wendell.","Wendell Weeks","Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. This morning we reported excellent results that keep us on track for growth in 2019 and beyond. Our performance demonstrates the strength of Corning\u2019s portfolio and our ability to deliver for shareholders in a mixed macro-environment.","Looking at the second quarter, sales were $3 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Net income of $410 million, grew faster than sales at 14% year-over-year, driven by operating margin expansion. And EPS was $0.45, up 18% year-over-year. Segment sales growth rates ranged from the mid-single-digits to mid-teens. And we grew earnings in all segments.","Highlights from the quarter include optical communications met expectations delivering high-single-digit sales growth, driven by data center and fiber demand. Environmental technologies delivered 15% year-over-year sales growth, driven by the accelerating adoption of our gasoline particulate filters and continued strong demand in the North American heavy duty market.","Life Sciences sales were up 6% year-over-year, with net income growing much faster than sales, up 29% year-over-year. Specialty Materials sales were up 8% year-over-year on the strength of Gorilla Glass and our other innovations.","Display continues to deliver stable returns with second quarter sales and net income up significantly year-over-year and better than expected pricing.","Our performance stems from the successful execution of our four-year Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework introduced in October of 2015. Under the Framework, we targeted returning more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends, while investing $10 billion to extend our leadership and deliver growth.","We surpassed our 4-year goal of $12.5 billion by returning more than $300 million to shareholders during the second quarter. And we\u2019re seeing the benefit of our investments in our first-half year-over-year performance and in our expectations for the second half of 2019. Of course, as you\u2019ve all seen this earnings season, many companies are facing uncertainty and macroeconomic headwinds. And we\u2019re not immune to economic downturns or trade disputes or other geopolitical upsets, but we are more resilient than at any other time in our history.","Across the company, while the end markets we serve are experiencing downward growth revisions and many of our competitors are not growing at all, we continue to outpace the markets. In the auto market, global auto production is down, but we expect sales growth in our environmental business to be in the low-teens this year.","Retail television sell-through forecast are declining in units, but we expect display volume and sales growth this year. Smartphone unit sales are also forecasted to be down, but we are growing Gorilla Glass sales this year as well.","In Life Sciences, the industry is relatively immune to economic headwinds, so it is growing in its typical low-single-digit rate, but we expect mid-single-digit growth of our Life Sciences business this year.","And finally, in Optical Communications, we now expect the passive optical market to be down. Earlier in the year, we projected the market to be up 5% and for our sales to grow in the low-teens. We now expect the market to be down mid- to high-single-digits and for our sales to grow low- to mid-single-digits.","While the growth is lower than previously expected, it is still very positive relative to the market. You\u2019ll hear more details from Tony on the current dynamics.","So, the good news is, even in this environment, we are growing. And when markets improve, we\u2019ll grow even more. We are confident in our long-term growth prospects. The successful execution of our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework adds to our confidence. We face challenges along our path to growth throughout our 2016 to 2019 plan. But we addressed those challenges, and met or exceeded all our goals.","In so doing, we created a bigger stronger company and we created a strong foundation for significant additional growth. Our new Strategy & Growth Framework sets our leadership priorities for 2020 to 2023.","It\u2019s our original Framework evolved for a new growth era. We will continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We plan to return $8 billion to $10 billion to shareholders, and to invest $10 billion to $12 billion in growth and extending our leadership.","We expect a sales compound annual growth rate of 6% to 8% and an EPS compound annual growth rate of 12% to 15%, an annual dividend per share growth of at least 10%. Our capabilities are becoming increasingly vital and multiple trends are driving growth across multiple businesses and in multiple geographies.","In optical communications, we are on track to deliver growth twice as fast as the passive optical market, driven by opportunities in 5G and next gen hyperscale. Recently, CenturyLink announced that it is using Corning fiber to build the largest ultra-low-loss fiber network in North America.","They\u2019re connecting more than 50 major cities throughout the U.S. and will soon expand into parts of Europe as well, creating a 4.7 million mile fiber network. In the second half, we\u2019re going to be introducing next generation solutions that enable 5G and access networks to be installed faster and reduce the total cost of ownership.","While pauses may occur as network operators transition between projects, photons replacing electrons in network after network provides a strong upward trajectory over longer periods. In Mobile Consumer Electronics, we are well on our way to doubling sales, despite a maturing smartphone market.","As the world leader in glass for smartphones, tablets and emerging categories like wearables and augmented reality devices, we expect to continue capturing more value per device. Gorilla Glass has now been featured on 7 billion devices worldwide and adoption of Gorilla Glass 6 is expanding.","We continue to innovate in new categories and expect further adoption of new products in the second half. Turning to the automotive market, we expect to double sales by 2023, driven by gas particulate filter adoption and our new Auto Glass Solutions business. As I already noted, many companies in the auto industry are dropping expectations.","We\u2019re generating double-digit growth and ramping new capacity. In one new plant, we\u2019re now producing large parts to serve the growing pipeline of projects awarded to our Automotive Glass Solutions business. In another, we\u2019re capturing accelerating demand for gasoline particulate filters and not only are we making great progress building a $500 million GPF business, we\u2019re growing faster than we expected.","We now expect GPF sales to exceed $200 million for the full year. Our market leadership for this new technology was publicly recognized by two customers in the first half of 2019. We received the Daimler Supplier Award in March. And just recently we also won the Volkswagen Group Award. We were 1 of just 8 suppliers honored in the Global Performance Champion category, chosen from Volkswagen\u2019s global network of 40,000 suppliers.","Turning to Life Sciences Vessels, we aim to outpace the industry by more than 2 times. We\u2019ve recently increased manufacturing capacity for several key products used in cell and gene therapy development and production. Our growth is also supported by the increasing need for safety and quality in the packaging of injectable drugs.","On this front, we continue to make strong progress on the path to a new long-term multibillion dollar franchise with Valor Glass.","In Display, our goal is to stabilize returns and we are successfully delivering. The growth driver for display glass is large size TVs, which are most efficiently produced by our customers on Gen 10.5 fabs.","We continued our leadership in quarter two, with the announcement of two new Gen 10.5 plants. Corning now has 3 of the planned 4 Gen 10.5 facilities in the world. And we are thrilled about pricing.","Third quarter glass prices are expected to remain consistent with quarter two. Yes, you heard me correctly, third quarter prices should be approximately flat to quarter two. As a result of the glass pricing through three quarters, we now expect full-year glass prices to only decline in the low- to mid-single-digit range.","Across our markets, our relationships with industry-leading customers are creating new opportunities for collaboration and our strategic investments are paying off. We\u2019re capturing opportunities and generating significant top and bottom line growth in multiple businesses.","I look forward to sharing our progress against our new objectives over the next 4 years. Now, let me turn the call over to Tony for more details.","Tony Tripeny","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We had another excellent quarter. Year-over-year, we grew sales 8%, net income 14%, and earnings per share 18% with sales and earnings growth in every business segment. And we did this all while continuing to invest for a long-term growth. Before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the largest difference between our GAAP and core results are a non-cash, mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts, and a change in our tax reserves.","With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earning translations hedge contracts and foreign debt setting in future period to be mark-to-market and recorded a current value at the end of each quarter, even though these contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us this reduced GAAP earnings in Q2. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.","Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions.","Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We are very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We\u2019ve received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than five years ago.","That brings me to our results and outlook. For the second quarter, sales were up 8% year-over-year to $3 billion. Net income rose 14% to $410 million and EPS was $0.45, up 18%. Our strong growth results from our technology and manufacturing leadership. We are benefiting from recent investments, including capacity expansions for optical fiber and cable, Gen 10.5 display glass, gasoline particulate filters and multiple development projects such as advanced glass for mobile devices and automotive.","We are very pleased with how these investments are playing out, and we are continuing to invest. We are bringing new plants online this year, creating capacity for committed demand and driving additional sales growth in 2019 and beyond. Capital spending in Q2 totaled $570 million and we expect to spend just over $2 billion in 2019 with programs in every market access platform.","Now let\u2019s look at the detailed segment results and outlook. In Display Technology, our goal is to stabilize returns and we had a very strong quarter. Second quarter sales were $848 million, up 9% year-over-year and net income was up 11% year-over-year. Second quarter sequential glass price declines were moderate and even better than we expected.","As Wendell said, we expect third quarter glass prices to be approximately flat to Q2. As a result of the glass pricing through three quarters, we now expect full year glass prices to decline in the low- to mid-single digits versus our prior guidance of mid-single-digits. Now three factors drive our view that this favorable pricing environment will continue. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced demand or even tight. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations.","Absolute glass prices must support acceptable returns on those investments. For Corning, we will only add capacity if we can get an attractive return for our shareholders. In the second quarter, the display glass market volume grew mid-single digits year-over-year and our volume grew faster as expected due to the ramp of our Gen 10.5 plant.","Now, while end-market demand is meeting our expectations, as you\u2019ve been hearing recently some panel makers have lowered their utilization. Therefore, for the third quarter of 2019, we expect to display glass market volume to be roughly consistent year-over-year, and to decrease by a low-single digit percentage sequentially. However, our volume is expected to be up year-over-year again due to the Gen 10.5 ramp and decreased low-single digit sequentially in line with the market.","For the full year, despite this anticipated weaker third quarter, we continue to expect to outperform the market by delivering volume growth in the high-single digits driven by Gen 10.5. In summary, we remain very pleased with the current pricing dynamics in our display business and our ability to capture Gen 10.5 glass growth to deliver stable returns.","Let\u2019s move to Optical Communications, in the second quarter sales were $1.1 billion, up 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. Net income of $158 million, grew 11% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. Growth was driven by multi-year data center projects, fiber sales and the addition of sales from our 3M Communication Markets Division acquisition. Now in spite of our strong first half, we are reducing our expectations for the year.","We entered 2019 projecting the global passive optical market to increase by more than 5% and our sales to grow in the low-teens. We now believe that the global market will be down mid- to high- single digits and that our sales will be up in the low- to mid-single digits. We see the weakness primarily in the carrier market. Since the last earnings call, several large build projects we projected for the second half of the year have been pushed out, and multiple carriers have reduced CapEx for the remainder of the year.","We see delays in Fiber-to-the-Home builds that several Tier 2 carriers, slower deployment at North America cable operators, and fiber densification for next generation wireless has not yet gained momentum outside the early leaders. Also, we have further reduced our expectations for the 2019 China market and are now seeing related weakness in India and Southeast Asia. The delay in China Mobile\u2019s tender announced earlier this year resulted in surplus inventory, which is currently being absorbed in these regions.","Now we continue to execute well against factors in our control and our growth remains significantly above the market. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be consistent sequentially and down low-single digit versus an exceptional third quarter in 2018.","Environmental Technology second quarter sales were $366 million, up 15% year-over-year and ahead of expectations, driven by ramping GPF sales and continued strong demand in North America heavy-duty market. Net income grew 20%. We are well on our way to building a $500 million gasoline particulate filter business. European regulations are in full effect and automakers in China are preparing for full China 6 implementation in 2020.","The market is developing faster than we planned and we\u2019re winning more platforms than we anticipated. We sustained our majority position of awarded platforms to date with additional wins particularly as OEMs prepare for China 6 implementation. As a result, we now expect GPF sales to exceed $200 million in 2019, and to grow robustly thereafter. Based on our accelerating demand, we now expect full year sales to be up by a low-teens percentage versus our prior expectation of 10%. We also expect third quarter sales to be up by a low-teens percent year-over-year.","In Specialty Materials, second quarter sales were $369 million, up 8% year-over-year and driven by continued strong demand for the company\u2019s portfolio of mobile consumer electronics glass solutions. Net income was up 5%. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be up approximately 25% sequentially and consistent year-over-year. We continue to expect full year growth again in 2019 despite a maturing smartphone market, exactly how much will depend on the adoption rate of our innovations. Our results and outlook demonstrate the value of our premium glasses and the strength of our innovation portfolio.","In Life Sciences, second quarter sales were $260 million, up 6% year-over-year. Net income was up 29% year-over-year, manufacturing performance and operating leverage were outstanding. For both the third quarter and the year, we expect sales to be at mid-single digit year-over-year. In summary, we had an excellent second quarter with strong performance across the company. The benefits of our recent investments are contributing to results. All of our businesses have solid momentum relative to their markets and we are on track for sales growth for full year 2019.","Now let\u2019s move to the consolidated income statement, second quarter gross margin was 40.1%, a slight increase from the first quarter. As I described last quarter, we are continuing to invest, while we build startup, ramp and optimize new facilities associated cost offset some of the normal leverage on our gross margin line. For the second half of 2019, we expect gross margin to be slightly better than the first half. This is less than we thought in April because of lower-than-expected sales in optical as well as higher-than-expected cost in display.","In our Gen 10.5 facility, we are bringing up new technology, ramping volume and improving our cost, just not as quickly as we expected. We are excited about our Gen 10.5 projects, because they enable us to capture the majority of the market growth and will ultimately provide a step change in glass manufacturing. From an operating margin standpoint, we expect the second half to expand over the first half.","Moving to additional outlook details, we expect other income, other expense to be approximately $250 million for the full year. Full year gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $210 million predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor with the third quarter at approximately $20 million to $25 million versus second quarter 2019 gross equity earnings of $28 million. And we expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 20% consistent with Q2.","In closing, we had an excellent first half with sales and NPAT growth in every one of our businesses. As we discussed, most companies are facing uncertainty and macroeconomic headwinds right now. We feel these headwinds as well, but our solid execution that gets the factors within our control is evident in our strong first half, and makes us confident in our ability to grow every business for the full year.","Now, we are not immune to challenges, but we are more resilient than ever. Our portfolio and emphasis on capturing technology substitutions enable us to outpace the markets we serve. As conditions improve our growth will accelerate. Our confidence is reflected in the long-term growth targets we\u2019ve laid out in our 2020 to 2023 Strategy & Growth Framework. There are exciting opportunities across our market access platforms. We are becoming increasingly relevant to the trends fueling those markets, and that allows us to capture more opportunities in products and categories, where we are already the leaders.","I look forward to sharing progress on our Framework in the months and years ahead. With that, let\u2019s move to Q&A. Ann?","Ann Nicholson","Thanks, Tony. Okay, Greg, we\u2019re ready for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes, thank you. Good morning. Tony, can you bridge the gross margins in 2019 versus 2018 in the second half and actually even operating margins if you could? It will be helpful if you can isolate the impact of the mix of the faster growth businesses, which might be a little bit lower margin versus the incremental impact that you\u2019re talking in Display.","And can you just square the trends of improving glass price to the deteriorating sort of gross margin optics here in the year in the second half? Thank you.","Tony Tripeny","Sure, Wamsi. I think the big change statement here is that we had expected gross margin to go to 41% to 42% in the back-half. And now we\u2019re looking at it to be slightly better than the first half. And it\u2019s really there are two drivers on this. I mean, the first is what\u2019s happening in the Optical Communications sales. This is all driven in the carrier market, where we\u2019ve gone from low teens sales at the beginning of the year to low- to mid-single-digits.","There is incremental profitability on these sales are high, given that we have all the fixed cost infrastructure in place. So we see margin compression for COC in the company as those sales don\u2019t occur. And then the second area is the higher-than-expected cost in Display. And that is really driving \u2013 is really being driven by, as we bring up our new technology and ramping volume and improving our cost in Gen 10.5, it\u2019s just not happening as quickly as we expected.","So that is the big change statement over what we had expected a quarter ago. In terms of operating margin, we did expand operating margin in the first half of the year versus last year. And we expect to expand operating margin in the second half of the year. And so, from our standpoint, as we\u2019ve discussed, that\u2019s the most important of the metrics, because of the operating leverage that we get as we grow sales.","Wamsi Mohan","Thanks, Tony.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Please go ahead.","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes, just a quick follow up, Tony. Free cash flow has been negative for two consecutive quarters, with gross and operating margin in the second half is slightly better than the first half, how do you see free cash flow trending?","Tony Tripeny","So, Mehdi, I mean, keep in mind that the normal operating cash flow pattern for us is to generate most of our operating cash flow in the back-half. And that is, because in the first half, we have working capital growth to support our increased sales. And we also have some significant annual payments that occur in the first half related to compensation, tax payments and legal settlements.","And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened this year. I mean, our operating cash flow for the first half is about $150 million. And included in that is the build and working capital of about $500 million. Now, that\u2019s a couple of hundred million dollars maybe more than what you would normally expect, which is mostly in inventory.","And the reason for that is that we have significant new products like GPF, Gen 10.5, some of our new innovations in Specialty Materials. It\u2019s also a little bit higher than you\u2019d expect, because we thought at the beginning of the year Optical Communications would be a little bit stronger in terms of sales. And now it\u2019s a little bit less than that.","But we expect that inventory to correct itself in the second half. And we expect just like in most years or in all years, will generate more operating cash flow in the back-half. So I think we\u2019re confident that we will end up with free cash flow for the year. And this is just the normal cycle that we have.","Mehdi Hosseini","Sure. And just one quick follow on Optical. I\u2019m a little bit confused and would appreciate any high level color. On the handset side, there\u2019s increased optimism that the 5G phone is going to be available especially with the carriers investing in for millimeter wave. And you\u2019re down ticking especially with densification of additional sales capacity. These trends are kind of contrary and I\u2019m just having a hard time reconciling. So any color or additional clarification here would be great.","Wendell Weeks","Great. So, Mehdi, I think you\u2019re actually right on top of that. And it\u2019s just those two things that you need to understand around, when we think about our demand cycle. First is the one that you\u2019re highlighting, which is architecturally which solutions win and what our folks choosing. And then, second is, how quickly do our customers put it in.","So you\u2019re right, sort of all lights are flashing green. And that we\u2019re right with the point of view we laid out over 2 years ago, that 5G is going to equal significant network densification, which in turn means classification, which means more demand for our innovations.","And you\u2019re right; all you tend to be hearing is confirmatory data on that topic. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re hearing as well. So we are increasingly confident of our long-term projections, of which architecture wins for 5G. And that\u2019s a bullish signal for us.","Now, then, the next piece has to happen. These are significant capital projects and our customers need to get themselves organized, make the decision, and then begin to make those investments. Now, in that, timing can be difficult to call. And what we\u2019re seeing right now is that people are waiting a little bit, there is sort of a little gap between projects. Other than the sort of a real leaders in 5G, they\u2019re putting their plans together, getting their financing house in order and getting their alliances in place, that then we would expect the demand that you\u2019re pointing to, to occur.","Does that make sense to you?","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes. But, what you\u2019re saying, are these trends coming together, is it like a 12-month timeframe? Or does that require more than 12 months?","Wendell Weeks","No, it\u2019s really so customer specific and announcement specific that it\u2019s hard to like name an exact time period. We had thought, coming into the year, there was going to be at least one other major player that came on strong, on the 5G densification piece. They altered their business model slightly and changed their timing slightly.","So I think that, what we\u2019re trying to do is be right on the architecture and the long-term demand cycle, and then be able to support our customers as they gear up. The good news here is this isn\u2019t going to be subtle, as our customers announce and decide they\u2019re going to roll. And how they\u2019re going to roll in 5G, they\u2019ll talk about it. All the different cities that they are going to go to, we\u2019ll talk about it.","And in a way, you\u2019ll see the normal cycle of the announcement piece getting a little bit ahead of demand, and then demand will follow, and will have a hard time keeping up.","Mehdi Hosseini","Great. Thanks so much for the color. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox","Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more perspective on the change in the 10.5 G ramp that you mentioned. You\u2019re still looking for, it sounds like about the same growth in your own units overall. TV demand is obviously weaker, but how does this change in terms of the new projects you\u2019re bringing on versus the existing plant you\u2019re operating, et cetera? Any help there would be appreciated.","Wendell Weeks","So, Tony, will make some comments on how \u2013 the relative strength of the large sized TV market in a moment, which I think a really interesting data point. But at the core of what\u2019s happening to us from Gen 10.5, it\u2019s not really a ramp issue of significance, right? You have the normal sort of how high our customer utilization is at a given month.","But what\u2019s really driving our dynamics is we\u2019re meeting all those requirements and we\u2019re really bullish on Gen 10.5\u2019s ability to be the powerhouse of large size TVs. All that\u2019s happening to us is how quickly our yields are improving. That\u2019s all that\u2019s going on here, right?","So there\u2019s nothing deep. This is just a matter of us making our technology yield at the rate at which we would like it yield to be able to put more profit in the hands of our shareholders. So Tony, maybe you want to talk about television.","Tony Tripeny","Yeah, Steve. Yeah, I would just add in terms of the TV market, sell-through is actually tracking slightly ahead of our expectations through April. As you know, it takes a couple of months for all the data to come in, but the most important piece of that is what\u2019s happening on large-size TVs. Sell-through for 65-inch TVs have grown almost 40% and for 75-inch TVs they\u2019ve grown almost 60%. And of course, that\u2019s the TVs that are really are optimized in the Gen 10.5 and it\u2019s really what is driving these Gen 10.5 investments, where we have ended up going to have three out of the four announced Gen 10.5 factories. So we feel really good about that.","And so from an overall standpoint, while there\u2019s some of \u2013 a little bit of a panel maker utilization slowdown in the third quarter. We expect for the full year our volume to be up high-single-digits well ahead of the market because of Gen 10.5.","Steven Fox","That\u2019s helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, when you think about the Gen 8 and below market for you guys. Is there a functionality here where you\u2019re taking more tanks offline given what\u2019s going on at the customers and as pricing trends similarly as strong as you\u2019re seeing overall? Thank you.","Wendell Weeks","So our pricing trends. Yes, it\u2019s very strong, right. We feel really good about that. And then what you will see from us is that will continue to account for our increasing yield and productivity out of our technologies by adjusting the overall capacity and roots that we have to support it. So that\u2019s really the dynamic more than anything else, we feel really good about the market, we feel really good about price, right. And we feel really good about our ability to service our increasing share of that market with our technology. And we\u2019ll just adjust by taking sort of the older generations of tech offline or repurposing it for other markets.","So that long-term trends you\u2019re on, Steve, I think is just continues. And all we got to do is get our yields up a little faster, and then that would match beautifully to our plan.","Steven Fox","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Rod Hall","Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess, I wanted to come back to this flat glass pricing indication window, and see if you could comment on what is kind of driving that? It seems like maybe it\u2019s a mix towards Gen 10.5? So I wonder, if you\u2019d comment on whether that\u2019s helping pricing? Or is it the below Gen 10.5 pricing dynamic is driving that?","And then the other thing I wanted to ask about is, Tony, I know you mentioned working capital on the cash flow, but I also see a larger drag in other cash flow. And I wondered if that is related to some of the tax deferrals? What exactly is going on there\u2019s a non-cash adjustment to income? Thanks.","Tony Tripeny","Sure. Let me first take the pricing one, as Wendell said, this clearly is across the market including below Gen 10.5 and particularly below Gen 10.5. And I think the reasons are pretty straightforward, I mean, first, we expect glass supply demand to continue to be balanced and even tight. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, our display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments to maintain operations, and so absolute glass pricing must support acceptable returns on those investments. So that\u2019s consistent what we\u2019ve been saying for a number of years and we continue to see improvement in the pricing environment. And as Wendell said, we\u2019re very thrilled by the pricing environment, what happened in Q2 and the continuation into Q3.","Rod Hall","If you \u2013 Tony, if you expand on that, can pricing actually go up at some point?","Wendell Weeks","Rod, you\u2019re now really right in the center of this debate that I\u2019ve been really open about between myself and my operators, where I think the wisest thing to do from an investment theory is to count on our Display business aging gracefully, right. A number of our operators creating leadership of those businesses believe that they can actually make display grow in net income. Their recent performance would tend to be data on their side. And therefore, your question is fair. They have not put together enough consecutive quarters yet though for me to change my investment thesis. Does that make sense, Rod?","Rod Hall","Yeah. Thanks, Wendell.","Tony Tripeny","And then, Rod, in terms of the operating cash flow, the comparison on the other, I think, last year we had a couple of payments that occurred in the first quarter that were nonrecurring \u2013 a couple of receipts that occurred in the first quarter that were nonrecurring, some of them related to the incentives in the factories that we\u2019ve been building and others related to the indemnification asset with our CPM transaction of a number of years ago. And so that\u2019s the reason why it\u2019s a different number this year than last year.","Rod Hall","Okay. Thank you, Tony.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","James Faucette","Great. Thank you. I just wanted to ask about, I think, one of the concerns that investors have right now is probably around visibility into end markets back through the supply chain to what you\u2019re supplying? And in particular, I think, the narrative on larger display size as well as in the optical business makes sense. But I\u2019m wondering, if you can talk a little bit about things that you are doing or can do to further improve your visibility and are you able to see changes in demand trajectory first?","My second follow-up question is, at the Analyst Day last month you gave a pretty upbeat assessment of the opportunities in both Valor Glass and automotive opportunities. Just wondering, if there\u2019s been any additional data points you can contribute to those new products. Thank you very much.","Wendell Weeks","So I think on \u2013 let\u2019s do the value chain first, and then I\u2019ll try to tie in the other piece. So for us, it\u2019s a little like the walk through that I just did on optical. We\u2019ve got two levels that we try to align. The first is the long-term technology substitution curves for our innovations. And as you remember from the Investor Day, the core of our growth story is a content story, which is what we expect over the coming four years is more and more of our innovations to be adopted into the products that people buy. And then that is our primary growth driver as opposed to how much of everything everybody buys or what type of economy do, we face.","We continue to get nothing, but positive signals on those items whether it\u2019s an optical or in the areas that you just named, automotive. So here we are in a time period when you see declining forecasts of overall automotive sales and production, but we\u2019re projecting growth in the teens, because of more and more of our content. Similar things we would expect to happen in the Valor story. We once again tend to have confirmatory evidence that we\u2019re on the right side of that substitution curve. Optical, very much the same as you heard in my answer. And in Specialty Materials, our Mobile Consumer Electronics business, also much the same. So that\u2019s the first level, we feel pretty good about that. The next then comes to how does the timing of that substitution curve play out and how does that interact with overall demand for our customers.","Now that you can get a little more noise in, in the near-term, and we\u2019re certainly experiencing some of that. So then we have folks like Jeff Evenson, who\u2019s here in the row as well as pretty significant analytical groups to try to start right at the end market and then work the way \u2013 all the way back to the value chain and build models and the right analytic tools to keep track of it. We don\u2019t always get it exactly right, but we feel pretty good that we are able to track record demand signals through the system.","James Faucette","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Samik Chatterjee","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to start off with gross margins, and if I get the guidance right here, you probably imply more of 100 basis points decline in gross margin year-over-year for the full year. As we look at kind of the recovery of that 100 basis points and maybe coming back in line with 2018. Is it more contingent on some of the macro headwinds dissipating? Or are you looking at some cost actions that might help you kind of exit that recovery back of that 100 basis points?","And secondly just to follow-up, second question on display side, I just wanted to see given that you have an outsized share of the Gen 10.5 plants market share there. Is \u2013 can you give us a sense of your market share in display today? And what it will be once all the plants are online? Thank you.","Tony Tripeny","So let me talk about our gross margin, clearly, what\u2019s most important to us in the way that we really think about our profitability is what\u2019s happening on the operating margin line. Our operating margin is being compressed and our gross margin is being compressed, primarily \u2013 compared to what we thought at the beginning of the year, and what\u2019s happening on optical communication sales, and what\u2019s happening in cost in our display business. So as those things change then of course we\u2019d expect that continued for improvement there.","But from an overall standpoint, what we\u2019re really measuring and what we\u2019re really driving for is improvement in operating margin. And in the first half of this year, our operating margin actually expanded by 80 basis points and we expect that to continue in the second half of the year. And the other thing, of course is, what\u2019s very important to us is return on invested capital, over the last four years we\u2019ve improved our return on invested capital by 300 basis points and over the next four years we expect to continue to expand that is our profitability improves, and we get the returns on the investments we\u2019ve been making.","Samik Chatterjee","Got it. Any help on the market share in display?","Tony Tripeny","I mean \u2013 I think that what\u2019s important there, I mean, we don\u2019t disclose market share numbers and what\u2019s important there is that in a market, where the growth is really occurring, because of large-size TVs, where the both in 65 and 75 inch TVs are much larger growth this year. That gets supplied by Gen 10.5 and we have three of the four projected announced Gen 10.5 factories.","Samik Chatterjee","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tejas Venkatesh from UBS. Please go ahead.","Tejas Venkatesh","Thank you. I wonder, if you\u2019re seeing any change in competitive environment in optical. In particular, I was wondering, if you\u2019re seeing any pricing effects of China fiber makers moving to other markets.","Wendell Weeks","This is Wendell. So, yeah, clearly, we are seeing that in China as one of the key parts of the carrier market that had a strong downward revision this year, especially the delay in China Mobile tender, right. And so that led to sort of a buildup in China that expressed itself in terms of pricing largely in China. We\u2019re also seeing some knock-on effects in India and Southeast Asia, primarily. And we\u2019ve incorporated all that into our outlook for our Optical Communications business.","Tejas Venkatesh","Thank you. And as a follow-up, the adoption of glass backs on smartphones has been very helpful for your Gorilla business, now you have other smartphone innovations like vibrant glass and so forth. As we get closer to new smartphone introductions, I wonder, if you expect any of those newer innovations to be adopted over the next 6 to 12 months? Thank you.","Wendell Weeks","That is an excellent observation, and my simple answer to your question is, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Asiya Merchant from Citi. Please go ahead.","Asiya Merchant","Hi, thank you. A lot of the questions have been answered. But if I could just about the 5G commentary that Wendell shared earlier about some customer push outs, et cetera. Can you maybe walk us through some of the more puts and takes now to your outlook for the Optical segment? Is there more risk that we see that coming down as the year progresses on the other side as maybe some 5G reception by customers \u2013 by the end consumer is better on the phones and the smartphone to we expect an uptick there? Again, it\u2019s more about the puts and takes to the outlook for the Optical segment as the year progresses? Thank you.","Wendell Weeks","That\u2019s an excellent question. So first, let\u2019s do with the 5G one, because I think there\u2019s \u2013 just the way to understand 5G is how quickly does it start and expand beyond some of the few early adopters and leaders? So it\u2019s less people like changing deeply their 5G plans, if them arriving at their 5G plans, and how they\u2019re going to deploy and then get that rolling. That\u2019s sort of the next leg of growth. And for us, when that clicks in exactly \u2013 when it clicks in, it will be very significant in growth. When it happens is sort of hard to call. Meanwhile, what we see in our near-term results is more having to do with the pieces of the carrier market that dealt with particular projects that they have on wireline, some on wireless, but it\u2019s just really just some delays and push outs that they\u2019ve done into 2020 rather than big significant 5G changes.","So that\u2019s why I keep saying, the 5G piece won\u2019t be subtle when it starts to hit our demand cycle, you\u2019ll see it coming and all you\u2019re seeing in our growth this year primarily, right, is the adoption of our previous innovations and other pieces of the network. We haven\u2019t really started to feel the big oomph from the wireless networks of the world changing from relatively fiber-poor to very fiber-rich. That\u2019s all ahead of us.","Now to your next question on, can we expect continued downward revisions in auto? I would say, it is clearly our intent that that is not the case. What we\u2019ve tried to do here is guide in a way that we feel highly confident it will deliver. Now as the months go by, we\u2019ll know more and how accurate our point of view is, but it is not our intent to have a sort of sliding set of expectations in [opto] [ph]. Does that answer your question?","Asiya Merchant","Yeah. No, that\u2019s great. And then, just as we think about when the 5G hits, like given that it\u2019s more fiber rich, how should we think about the margin for that solution relative to, let\u2019s say, the Fiber to the Home builds, which are driving more of your sales this year? Is there a significant leg-up we should expect or are the margins similar? If you can just kind of walk us through how you see the margin profiles on the more newer innovation relative to what\u2019s been happening for the past few years.","Wendell Weeks","In my opening remarks, this is really a great question \u2013 in my opening remarks, you heard me make an allusion to that we\u2019ll be introducing some new products in the second half related to this densification approach. What those new products represent is ways for us to bring the full suite of our technical capabilities to bear in wireless.","What our plans would be is for the 5G opportunity to have our full suite of products involved in it or our whole suite of innovations, and therefore, that its relative profitability should be consistent with that which you\u2019ve grown to expect in optical communications.","Asiya Merchant","Right.","Wendell Weeks","That\u2019s a little mysterious. And the reason it is, is I don\u2019t want to steal my operator\u2019s thunder when they launch their new product set.","Asiya Merchant","Thank you.","Wendell Weeks","All right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Notter from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","George Notter","Thanks a lot, guys. I guess, maybe to start with just a clarification. So when you talk about glass pricing in Q3 being flat relative to Q2, just to be clear, are you talking absolute pricing or are you talking about a flat rate of pricing erosion and I got a follow-up.","Wendell Weeks","Absolute pricing.","George Notter","Okay, great. That\u2019s a real improvement. And then, just to follow on, as I look at the dynamics among your panel-maker customers, I think about the supply coming on in China, there is certainly Gen 10.5s, but also Gen 6s and Gen 8s in China. And I guess with that supply coming online, it seems like it can create some changing dynamics among your traditional panel-maker customers in places like Taiwan and Korea, Japan.","So how do you see that kind of rippling through for Corning? Is there potential for that pricing pressure to flow downhill on to you? Or do you feel like you have enough leverage in terms of those customer relationships where again pricing can remain flat on a go-forward basis?","And then, I guess, alternatively, do you think that could ripple effect through in terms of changing utilization rates or how do you see the dynamic with China? Thanks.","Wendell Weeks","So you had a number of observations. Let\u2019s just compact two key ones. So first, I think you\u2019re quite wisely pointing out that, once again seeing some regional shift in the display market. We have followed it from Japan to Korea to Taiwan and out of China.","What we try to do with each of those moves is enhance our position in each new region and we have done that again here. So we are very well positioned for the direction with which we see panel production shifting. So that\u2019s the first strategic level.","Now, embedded in there, of course, I think you\u2019re making a wise comment, which is then what happens to the sort of panel production capability, glass production capability, in the regions that will be relatively weaker, relative to China? So in that, you\u2019re seeing a combination of things happen. First, is shifts to newer and more advanced display technologies, right, which we\u2019re supporting with newer and more advanced glass types.","Second, you\u2019re seeing optimization of our network of supply, of glass, and you can expect to see us to continue to optimize that to always make use of the capital that we have in place, to serve our number of growing different glass markets. So we will expect us to continue to optimize our cost structure, optimize our glass supply, and then support our customers in those previous regions, so that innovation aspirations and their market diversification.","Like, for instance, in Taiwan, we\u2019re seeing a nice buildup of capabilities to address in the automotive industry, which are going very nicely with our automotive glass opportunity sets. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to work through it all.","Now, I can\u2019t pass this answer to your question without noting that you said pricing continue to be flat in Display. We are not saying that yet, for a long term. What we\u2019re just saying is we expect the rate of decline to continue to improve and for our glass returns to stabilize. We\u2019re not predicting that glass prices remain flat for the foreseeable future.","George Notter","Right, thank you.","Ann Nicholson","We\u2019ll squeeze in one more question.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Brian Yun from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Yun","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Most of my questions have been answered as well. But could you just give us an update on the hyperscale cloud side of the business? Any color on the visibility there or spending trends into second half 2019 or even heading into 2020 would be helpful. Thanks.","Wendell Weeks","Hey, I\u2019d say once again here, I\u2019ll divide it into 2 layers. First, architecturally, each passing month in piece \u2013 a new piece of technical work and interactions with our customers, are making us more confident that that point of view we presented at our IR Day is accurate. So we see growing adoption of glass in the glassification of the cloud continuing and becoming even more dense. So we feel really good about that.","Exact timing for cloud and hyperscale, we\u2019re not seeing any real fundamental shifts there in terms of the total market. And you can get different time periods, where they can\u2019t quite get these large facilities up quite as fast as what they may have planned at the beginning of the year. But we\u2019re not seeing any sort of fundamental shift, that\u2019s saying we don\u2019t expect hyperscale and the cloud to continue to be a real growth driver for us, both this year and beyond.","Brian Yun","Great. Thank you.","Ann Nicholson","Thanks, Brian. And thank you, Wendell and Tony. And thank you all for joining us today. Before we close, I just wanted to let everyone know that we\u2019ll be at the Jefferies Semiconductor, Hardware and Communications Infrastructure Summit on August 27, and the Citi Global Technology Conference on September 5.","We\u2019ll also be posting some virtual presentations and webcast on business topics.

Welcome to the Corning Incorporated Quarter 3 2012 Results Conference Call.  [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Director of Investor Relations Ann Nicholson. Please go ahead.","Ann H. S. Nicholson","Thank you, Greg. And good morning. Welcome to Corning's Third Quarter Conference Call. Jim Flaws, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, will start the call with some prepared remarks. Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will join us for the Q&A.","Before Jim begins, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These remarks involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's SEC reports.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.","James B. Flaws","Thanks, Ann. Good morning, everyone. As we enter the fourth quarter, I'd like to step back a little to reflect on the past 12 months for Corning before I cover the Q3 details and the Q4 outlook.","Corning's identity and strategy have been in place for a number of years and remain unchanged. We are the world leader in specialty glass and ceramics. We grow primarily through internal innovation led by our R&D in material science and process engineering. This focus allows us to innovate and create keystone components that establish market-leading positions in a variety of industries. Now we pursue this vision by adhering to a strategic framework which guides our decisions and helps us navigate good times and their opportunities, as well as potential volatility of our industries in the macro environment. We emphasize different parts of this strategic framework in response to changes in our environment.","The best current example of the framework helping us is our ability to push forward on innovation and develop new businesses, like Gorilla, and also fund shareholder-positive actions despite a weak macro environment and turmoil in the LCD and photovoltaic industries.","Now one year ago, we entered the fourth quarter of 2011, we were experiencing significant changes. On the positive side, our financial health and declining need for capital expenditures led the board to act to return more money to shareholders, with a 50% increase in the dividend and starting a $1.5 billion share repurchase. We are also experiencing positive momentum in our telecom, environmental, Specialty Materials segments, led by increasing sales and improving margins.","However, on the negative side, we had experienced a significant share loss of a large LCD customer in Korea, and also we are entering into what turned out to be a 2-quarter period of significant price declines for LCD glass. And at Dow Corning, our equity venture, we began to experience a collapse in the pricing of polysilicon for the solar market.","These events led us to announce to investors at the beginning of 2012 the company would experience a reset to a lower-level profitability. We laid out a plan for 2012 of performing bottom, primarily by stabilizing display performance and returning positive momentum to this segment and also by marching up, improving our earnings by growing sales and improving margins in our other segments. We felt and continue to feel this plan will result in a return to earnings growth for Corning.","So now I'd like to give you a brief summary of our progress against this plan before I turn to the Q3 results.","I'm pleased to say we made good progress against these goals especially in light of the current global economy. We'd held LCD glass pricing to moderate declines in Q2 and Q3, and we now have new agreements with key customers that we believe will stabilize our share, all the while diligently managing our LCD glass capacity to the level of demand. I'll discuss the new agreements in more detail later.","We've also had some positive revenue and earnings momentum in our other segments. So while telecom will likely not meet our internal growth goals for the year, it remains well positioned in key growth markets when the economy picks up. As of Q3 year-to-date, Specialty Materials sales are up 13% and even more in gross margins. And with the pending close of Discovery Labware acquisition in Life Sciences, it will become nearly a $1 billion business.","Our environmental business is feeling the effects of slowdowns in the auto business in Europe and, now, the Class A truck industry. I would like to remind you that, earlier this year, we secured long-term agreements with key diesel customers, positioning us for future growth driven by diesel engine regulations. And we have several innovation programs with the potential for explosive growth.","So we continue to feel good about the growth prospects of the non-LCD businesses, our innovation portfolio and the expected free cash generation of display in the company as a whole. These strengths, coupled with our continuing financial strength, led the board to increase the dividend by 20% earlier this month.","Now we've also expressed some worries about the economy in both our Q1 and Q2 calls, and unfortunately, some of these are now coming true. We're now at the point where the macro economy is weakening, affecting sales across most our businesses, with several not achieving the growth we had laid out at the beginning of the year. We believe this weakness will continue into next year.","Therefore, as -- part of our plan to grow earnings must be to contain costs, so we're currently thinking through several cost-cutting measures, including slowing project spending, trimming fixed costs through restructuring which will likely include headcount reductions, and slowing capital spending. We've not made a final decision yet but we anticipate taking a pretax charge of up to $50 million in the fourth quarter.","So now I'll turn to the third quarter details. I'm pleased to announce that our results, both sales and earnings per share, were above consensus for the quarter. Third quarter sales were $2.04 billion, up 7% versus Q2 and down 2% from a year ago. Having sales above consensus has been a feat this quarter, and I'm very pleased that we did it.","Gross margin was 43%, up about 1 percentage point, as expected. Higher volumes in display and Gorilla Glass drove the improvement. SG&A and R&D were flat on a dollar basis. Versus a year ago, SG&A was up as a percentage of sales due to the non-repeat of 2 events that occurred in quarter 3 of 2011. We had credit spend resulting from a reduction in the contingent liabilities associated with an acquisition in telecom and we also had reversed some accrual for performance-based compensation.","Equity earnings were $230 million, excluding specials, and were down about 11% sequentially, in line with the expectations. EPS, excluding special items, were $0.34. That's 10% higher than Q2 but obviously a material climb from a year ago. EPS is stated here as a non-GAAP measure, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found on our website.","Now I'll turn to our Q3 segment results and I'll start with display. Display sales were $763 million in Q3, an increase of 19% sequentially to down 6% versus last year. The yen exchange rate was not a factor in comparing Q2 and Q3.","Equity earnings from our joint venture in Korea, SCP, were $187 million in Q3, an increase of 2% versus the second quarter. For your modeling purposes, SCP's third quarter LCD sales were about $745 million, an increase of 1% from the second quarter. Now as a reminder, this represents SCP's LCD sales only. Our public filings report SCP's total sales, which include CRT glass and other products.","As we expected, LCD glass price declines in display were moderate in Q3 at both our wholly owned business and SCP. LCD glass volumes also met expectations. Our wholly owned business volumes were up about 20% sequentially driven by customer utilization increases. Volumes at SCP were up in the mid single digits sequentially, in line with their customer utilization rates. The combination of moderate price declines, high capacity utilization from the higher volumes, solid manufacturing execution, led to an increase in gross margin and net income sequentially.","On the supply chain front, we've come through Q3 inventories about 15.5 weeks on a forward-looking basis. Because Q4 is seasonally larger, these weeks of supply are actually misleading. We believe the supply chain built a little over 350 million square feet of inventory through the first 3 quarters in preparation for the seasonally strong Q4. I'll comment more on the outlook and risks in the supply chain in my outlook session.","As final retail data for Q2 has come in and Q3 begins to come in, we are now lowering our view of retail glass demand to be approximately 3.5 billion square feet. The reduction is from the continuing sluggish worldwide demand for monitors. We now believe monitor demand will decline year-over-year versus our previous view of flat and the reduced demand for television units. TV units are tracking to about 208 million units into retail, a slight year-over-year increase. The good news from the television market is that large-sized televisions continue to sell well, driving the average screen size higher. If we compare our forecasted TV units at the beginning of this year and now, the increase in size has made up for 60% of the unit shortfall, as measured in area.","As I said in July, we believe the China region is our biggest risk. China has been tracking below our forecast overall in the first half. However, the new stimulus program implemented in August seems to be driving demand. Preliminary August units were up 14% and early indicators on their Golden Week holiday sales appear in line with our expectations. We'll have some additional data on retail and our 2012 expectations in the appendix section of our slides, and you'll find them posted on our Investor Relations website later.","Now telecom sales were $523 million, down 6% sequentially and lower than our expectations. The sequential decline in this versus the expectations was largely driven by lower sales in North America and Europe offsetting growth in China. Europe's miss is mostly due to the softer economy. North America was down due to project delays and the second half decline in stimulus spending on optical cable in support of infrastructure projects.","Compared to last year, Q3 telecom sales were down almost 7%, with the strength in China offset by the lower sales across most product lines in North America and Europe.","Net income for the quarter was consistent with Q2. Compared to Q2 of 2012, the impact of 6% lower sales was offset by improvement in manufacturing performance and a reduction in operating expense spending. However, net income was down year-over-year by 57% or $47 million due to the non-repeat of the contingent liability reversal from M&A of $22 million in Q3 of 2011 and, in addition, the compensation adjustment I already mentioned.","The environmental sales were $233 million, down 6% sequentially versus our expectation of flat to up slightly. While we did see some sales increase in light-duty diesel after summer shutdowns, our orders for heavy-duty truck products declined substantially as our customers reacted to their negative net orders over the past 6 months and also began to manage inventory in lieu of slowing sales. Q3 sales were down year-over-year due to lower sales in light-duty diesel.","Net income was down sequentially, in line with the lower volume in heavy-duty diesel. Year-over-year, net income was consistent on the lower sales due to the improving heavy-duty diesel gross margin.","We had another very good quarter in Specialty Materials, with sales up 23% sequentially and higher than our expectations. Gorilla Glass sales hit a new quarterly record. Net income was up 74% sequentially, 55% year-over-year, driven by the continued improvement in Gorilla gross margin.","I'm delighted to say there are now more than 1 billion devices worldwide containing Gorilla Glass. It continues to be the cover glass of choice, with more than 33 brands as our customers. We believe the increased Q3 volume beyond our expectations was driven by new device introductions in IT and health.","In Life Sciences, Q3 sales were down sequentially and worse than our expectations of flat to up slightly, but they were consistent year-over-year. The lower sequential sales were due to the softening economy, impacting end market demand, and also distributor inventory carrying levels. Net income was $9 million, down from Q2 on lower sales and higher M&A expenses and also down versus a year ago due to these M&A expenses and foreign exchange rates.","We are working with the government to get an antitrust approval for the BD acquisition. We expect we'll get this approval very soon. More importantly, we remain excited by this transaction. After we close the deal, we'll provide more details on our plans.","Now moving to Dow Corning. Equity earnings were down 38%, x specials, in Q3 mainly due to the lack of 2 non-recurring gains from Q2 and also a higher effective tax rate in the United Kingdom based on tax law change.","Sales in polysilicon were down on export to solar to China. Our speculation, this is due to the trade disputes. Versus a year ago, silicone sales are up slightly, but polysilicon sales are much lower driven by a dramatically lower pricing due to the continued softness in the solar market. This is reflected in the year-over-year equity earnings decline of 57%, x specials.","Now in Q3, Dow Corning also recorded a $20 million NPAT credit for contract settlement. Corning chose to not reflect our share of this gain in our non-GAAP earnings for the quarter. Dow Corning did resume paying dividends in Q3. Corning received $50 million in dividends Q3 from Dow Corning.","Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with $6.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. Capital spending was $422 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was a positive $214 million. As a reminder, free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure, and a reconciliation to GAAP can be found on our website.","We also continued our share repurchase program during the third quarter. We repurchased 187 million shares in the quarter, leaving us with about 125 million left on the authorization entering Q4.","We entered the quarter with approximately $2.36 billion of cash in the United States. As I mentioned, the Life Sciences section did not receive the FTC approval for the BD transaction yet. The BD transaction will be primarily a U.S. cash acquisition. If the transaction closes this year, as we expect, our U.S. cash should end the year at about $1.4 billion. We expect capital spending for the year to be approximately $1.9 billion. Our current expectation: capital spending in 2013 will be $1.3 billion.","So now I'll turn to our outlook and I'll start with display. As we near the end of October, input from panel makers indicates continued strong utilization levels that, if maintained, would result in the Q4 glass market sequentially of flat to down low single digits. However, our top-down look based on retail demand trends and the level of inventory leads us to view that the Q4 glass market could decline sequentially between the low single digits and the mid single digits, or slightly worse than the panel makers' input to us. We're basing the guidance for Corning on this top-down look of the market. Based on this view, we expect volume of our wholly owned display business and SCP to be flat to down low single digits. Our new agreements with key customers, stabilized shares at specified levels, will help achieve this volume performance.","For glass pricing, new agreements we have entered into have mechanisms that establish a relationship between Corning's price and the market price. These new customer agreements will assist us in maintaining Corning's market position in specified levels. We believe these new agreements will allow us to manage our capacity more efficiently and enable us to continue to improve on our cost position. However, as a result of the agreements, we do expect slightly higher price declines in Q4 than the prior 2 quarters.","We expect to maintain high levels of utilization at our wholly owned manufacturing sites as a result of these new agreements and have no plans to expand LCD production capacity beyond our committed supply.","Our new LCD facility in Beijing is now melting glass, and we are shipping in Q4. This facility provide our Beijing customer with outstanding local service while allowing us to direct capacity in Taiwan and Japan to the very-rapidly-growing Gorilla Glass business.","So to close on display, and I'm sure just until the Q&A portion of this call: As the LCD industry continues to mature, we believe, going forward, we'll enter a new era marked by a more stable share and slowing price declines. We believe our customers will benefit from our recent actions as it stabilizes supply and allows us to invest in innovation for their current and future technologies.","Now moving to telecom. We expect Q4 sales to be consistent versus Q3, with normal seasonal declines offset by realization of some of those delayed projects in the third quarter. We believe our telecom sales will be up in the low single digits for the year, obviously less than our original expectations established in February but solid nonetheless given the European economy and slowdowns in some projects.","Environmental, we expect sales to be consistent to down slightly sequentially, with some seasonal decline from auto customer holiday shutdowns.","Specialty Materials should have another strong quarter, led by Gorilla Glass. We expect sales to remain at the high level of Q3 led by growth in IT and handheld Gorilla sales, offsetting slowing sales of our semiconductor products.","In Life Sciences, we expect sales to be down about 5% on normal seasonality.","In Dow Corning, we expect equity earnings to be up about 25% driven primarily by a tax rate decline.","Now continuing on with the rest of our Q4 forecast. We expect gross margin to decrease by almost a percentage point driven mainly by pricing in display. SG&A and R&D will be consistent as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter. Equity earnings, excluding special items, should be down about 5% sequentially. Our tax rate for the year will be about 19%.","For FX, the yen has been relatively stable for most of the year. We're hopeful there will be no weakening. As a reminder, our results move to changes in the yen-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate. The weaker yen lowers our results, the stronger yen helps. If the yen averages 1 point higher or lower in Q4, we estimate our sales and net income would increase or decrease by approximately $6 million.","That concludes my opening comments. I'll turn it back to Ann.","Ann H. S. Nicholson","Thank you, Jim. Operator, we'd now like to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Sue from RBC Capital.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Jim, if we consider LCD TV penetration rates, it appears future LCD demand will be increasingly driven by replacement. And more and more, it does seem the macro can extend replacement rates for LCD. And if we add to this the concerns on monitor demand, which is tied to PC units which has turned negative, I'm wondering if glass volumes may not grow next year unless the environment gets better. Maybe just your preliminary thoughts on just kind of volume growth as we move forward, that would be helpful.","James B. Flaws","So we're planning on volume growth next year in the business. Obviously, that's somewhat dependent on where the supply chain ends this year and the amount of inventory. As I indicated, they built quite a bit. But we believe that we'll see growth in the glass market next year.  We think televisions will grow. We have to keep reminding everybody that size matters here. The fastest-growing segment is the 50-inch and above, and obviously that's a lot more glass for us. Actually, one thing that's very interesting about the television market this year: Sales of television below 30 inches, the units are actually negative year-over-year and that's making it look like the television unit growth is not as great. Obviously, it could be influenced by tablets. But when you look at the 30 to 40, 40 to 50, and 50 and above, we're seeing good growth rates. And if you take out small-sized, you are seeing good unit growth, and obviously the area is really helping us. So we are planning on the glass market growing next year and we'll give out a number in January after we see how the supply chain finished the year.","Wendell P. Weeks","So I'd add to that. I think, if you take a look at this year, which certainly hasn't been the easiest economic environment ever. And it's easy to forget that, with the price moves down in LCD, because you're not seeing the revenue growth, volume growth is actually quite robust. And there's nothing about that dynamic other than you can have, in a given quarter or 2, supply chain moves one way or the other, the weakening changes going forward. There's going to be more displays sold in the future than there are now and it's going to continue to be robust. And the key thing is getting pricing stable and continuing to drive new apps.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And the pricing -- the changes that you just made, early on in the year, we made some price changes and we saw moderate price declines. You're going to see a dip in the near term with the new price agreements. How does that revert once we start the year? Does that kind of normalize and so the net of it for the full year is still a low or moderate rate of declines for overall pricing?","Wendell P. Weeks","Well, we certainly hope so. Perhaps, it'll help if we explained it a little more detail of how it is our agreements with customers are working and what's changed. So let's start with the way we previous -- previous agreements worked. We would set a price, we would go out with a price. And then usually, competition would have to price under us to get share. Now over time, our premium would build up with this approach are leading to share volume and price volatility usually in times where supply and demand got a little bit off-kilter. So now let's talk about our approach now: What we've done with these new agreements is to set our market share and set a fixed relationship between our price and the market price. Now with the agreements that are starting in quarter 4, there'll be an initial correction to take into account the premium that it built up under the old agreements. And that is captured within the guidance you heard from James. Now let's talk about going forward. If you just think through the game theory and think through how these things actually work, logic would lead you to conclude that this new approach should give us steady share at the customers and allow us to smooth our operations, as well as reducing price volatility. Now, of course, the underlying foundation of -- for all of this is always managing glass supply to demand. Now as we look forward, barring supply chain motions in any given quarter, we expect very high utilization and we're not planning to expand our capacity beyond committed supply. And on the supply and demand, also I think something people don't always think through, is what we have done to create more balance. So first, we're getting the increased capacity to serve the growth in the display industry from increased productivity, a combination of thin as well as running better. So that has continued to improve the supply level, all right? Our costs tend to be by the pound and we sell by the square foot. Now as we increase our output of -- what we're doing is we're freeing up capacity to serve the high-growth Gorilla market, which we're also taking thinner. So this combination does a couple of things. First, it makes it possible for us to more closely match supply and demand, which aids in the pricing of LCD. Second and quite importantly, it enables us to grow our revenues without having to invest as much capital, which increases the cash returns for our shareholders and improves our return on investment. So as I describe the totality here, you see what we're trying to do is set the table to be able to have an environment of better price stability as well as better cash returns for our shareholders.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I see. So it does cap your market share near term but improves profitability longer term.","Wendell P. Weeks","Well, I think cap is an interesting word. What we seek to do -- now let's take a look at what's happened over the last year. Basically, as Jim said in the opening, we had a series of motions at a particular customer where one of our competitors tried to significantly increase their share. Here we are, a year later, worldwide market shares are basically where they started before all that, okay? And what has happened is just a lot of motion underneath the water but we're back to pretty much where we were before this whole thing started. So we're not seeking to gain share overall as a company. We're happy in the leadership position that we're in. What we're seeking to do is have better stability of our volumes and to have a less-volatile environment. We think that's good for our customers and we think it's good for the industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just to follow up on, Wendell -- on some of the commentary around the sort of \"set relationship in pricing versus market pricing.\" Does it still involve a premium to competitors? And does the mechanism adjust intra quarter? I mean, specifically, is there some sort of bend for market share? Or if a customer underperforms in a certain quarter, can they sort of have any sort of outlet for the extra glass supply? Just trying to understand the dynamics of the pricing structure.","Wendell P. Weeks","Well, I'm not going to comment on the exact relationship between our price and the market price, for obvious competitive reasons, right? Now to the -- will we see intra-quarter motion? The idea behind the agreements is that the share is set, as well as the fixed relationships. So in any given quarter, even for the year, we should not see motion in the share figure. You can see motion in the price figure, and then of course overall market demand can move up or down, but our share figure locks down. So what that would mean is that most of the dynamic in our customer supply chain would be played out with the other glass suppliers, as opposed to us. Does that make sense?","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then switching gears a bit away from pricing. You folks have been very proactive in terms of returning cash to shareholders, with the number of dividend increases, obviously getting towards the tail end of your buyback allocation. I was just wondering just in terms of, strategically, you mentioned CapEx is coming lower. Cash flow generation. It seems to be improving. Is buyback -- share buybacks part of the longer-term strategy for the company at this point? I mean, should we expect some sort of additional announcement sort of post the completion of the current allocation? I would love to hear some color from that standpoint.","James B. Flaws","So the board will consider returns to shareholders probably on a regular basis. As you saw in October, Amir, they moved the dividend up by 20%, and it's now up 80% over a 12-month period of time. I'm sure they will consider also our cash position and where the cash is and think about share repurchases again. But I would not anticipate an immediate announcement. But the board will continue to monitor this in -- on a regular basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amitbah (sic) [Amitabh] Passi from UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just maybe a big picture question, Jim, Wendell, for either of you. I was curious, how did the quarter progress? Did you think trends got worse through the quarter? I'm just trying to get a sense. It looks like your year-over-year trends have improved but yet your tone, extremely cautious. And I was just trying to get a sense for whether you think the environment is worsening or do you think we're seeing some level of stability at these levels.","James B. Flaws","Well, clearly, as quarter 3 unfolded, we saw some step-downs in 2 of our businesses. And that really occurred primarily in August in telecom and environmental where, in environmental, we saw cutbacks in orders from heavy-duty truck makers. And in telecom, we just saw business not materializing that we expected. I would say environmental is continuing to get worse. Telecom has been relatively stable since that step-down in August.","Wendell P. Weeks","And I think the reason that you see the mix is, on the other hand, display -- as the quarter moved its way through, both display and Gorilla were good. And Gorilla got extraordinarily good and it's continuing really strong momentum. So I think, when you step back and look at the total, the strength in our glass side more than offset any issues on telecom and environmental. So why you hear the mix in tone is that we are -- we want to make sure that we're cautious in the economic environment that we face, but at the same time, we're happy with the way in which we're playing out our hand in display. And in those areas where we've got big innovations, you're seeing them behave like big innovations which is, no matter what the wind, you tend to sail pretty fast.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And maybe just as a quick follow-up. Jim, the $50 million in restructuring you're taking in the fourth quarter, how should we think about the associated savings related to those cost-restructuring plans?","James B. Flaws","I'm not prepared to give you the number yet, but it clearly will be more than what the charge of the restructuring is. And by the way, that $50 million is -- we expect to be mostly cash. There's no asset write-offs in it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Piper Jaffray.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Two questions, Jim. First, I'm trying to reconcile: You had made a commentary that panel makers' utilizations are improving. Why should pricing decline in such a scenario in Q4? Is that -- I just want to make sure that I understand it correctly. Is that for a single customer, or is it across the board?","James B. Flaws","So I think I made the comment that customer utilization has improved in Q3. We expect them, at best, to be similar in Q4, maybe slightly down. From price point of view, our perspective is that we're in a consumer electronics industry. Price is going to come down over time. We expect to -- our goal is to have price declines every quarter to be moderate, if we can. The increase in Q4 versus Q3 on prices, as Wendell indicated, are related to the new contracts and some catch-up. But our price declines are not just at one customer.","Wendell P. Weeks","And if you take sort of at a base heartbeat of what we're seeing on the pricing in quarter 4, it is -- as Jim described, it is that moderate price-down that we seek, and that we think is going to continue going forward. And then it's just a matter of that switch in approach ends up with us having to overcome sort of that premium that just builds up over time under the old way.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And just as a follow-up. Jim, you had talked about that 6- to 7-year time frame were the product gets refreshed. Given the macro situation in terms of how we see the uncertainty, how much are -- how much conviction do you have that this is likely to materialize going forward into '13?","James B. Flaws","You're talking about the 6- to 7-year replacement rate?","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Exactly.","James B. Flaws","We remain pretty confident about the replacement rate. Sometimes, we see events like, in Japan, where, thru the echo-point, they kind of pulled forward all their replacement rate into a concentrated period of time. But our evidence says that the replacement rate is continuing to be along with our expectations. Obviously, you have some places in the world where macro events can overwhelm that, if your economy is really terrible. And clearly in some of the Southern European countries that's obviously occurring. But in terms of the fundamental of people replacing LCDs, we're now starting to get to the point where, in some markets, LCDs are crossing over that 5-year age, and that's where we start to see it. And we are closely monitoring it, but we still think it's going to happen.","Wendell P. Weeks","And I think the other place you've got to look to for replacement rate is the new technologies that are coming. Now it's really hard to tell what year they'll have an impact, right? Whether it's '13, '14, that's hard to tell. However, what's easy to tell is that they will. So in very-large-sized displays, you have a tremendous amount of innovation that you're not quite seeing yet, but we are because we're working with folks on it, that are going to change the way flat-panel displays -- the customers experience flat-panel displays. And that will help spur it. And then the other is take a look at -- notebooks is -- one thing we know with high degree of confidence is touch is going to come to notebooks, right? I've seen a lot of new product sets that people are working on to do that, and they're quite exciting. What we don't know is when the combination of Windows 8, the brands who are designing these new types of notebooks and Intel, with some of the processing fees, until it all comes together in a compelling package. Is that '13, is it '14? It's hard to tell. But what is pretty easy to tell is that is going to lead to us -- both a strong refresh cycle as well as nice new demand for us on both the touch and the monitor side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum from Morgan Stanley.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of quick things. The -- going back -- I apologize for this, but going back to the contracts -- the new contracts in display. Are all the glass providers -- so your competitors in Japan and other, are they -- have they agreed to similar contracts? So is this kind of an industry-wide thing, or is this something that Corning initiated separately? And does this go across all of your customers, including BOE and Samsung's new China business that you're supporting? And it was asked about intra-quarter pricing, but -- so you're -- just to understand the mechanism, you're guaranteed a certain percentage, I assume, or share of each one of these customers' requirements each quarter and they decide what the price is. And does it change from quarter-to-quarter? Just a little bit of flavor around that would be helpful. And then I have a follow-up on Gorilla.","Wendell P. Weeks","Jim will probably help me through it because you have a lot of questions buried in there. First one was, what are our competitors doing? I don't know. You should ask them. The second one on sort of what customers have we reached these type of agreements with: the ones that we consider to be significant from a volume standpoint as well as how that particular dynamic is playing out in the customer on what they want to do and how they want to work their way through it. And each customer is a little bit different. The final one is asking on the mechanics, basically, of it, is -- what we would expect in any given quarter that -- once the market share already is set, guidance across that year. And then in any given quarter, our price is set with a fixed relationship to the market price, which we would expect to stay consistent for a given quarter, so there should not be significant inter-quarter moves, assuming that it all works the way we are planning for it to work. And that is the way the mechanics work. Did that make sense?","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A little fuzzy. Who decides the market price? And how does that -- does it actually get changed from each quarter to each quarter?","Wendell P. Weeks","So there'll be a level of detail underneath that I'm not going to want to go into. But it is, \"What is the actual market price?\" And that will be a fixed relationship between that and our price, which should account for any sort of noise but maybe in differential perception.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, helpful. And then Jim, CapEx guidance, it was basically in line for 2013 but a little bit on the higher side of your previous guidance. With macro getting worse, could we see CapEx actually perhaps come down from that $1.9 billion for '13? And then kind of a big picture question, I guess, back to you, Wendell, is: Gorilla Glass and autos, that's always gotten me excited. How far away is that? You talked about that at your Analyst Day earlier in the year, but is that something we can look at in the next couple of years? Or is that more of 5 or 6 years away?","James B. Flaws","So Ehud, on the capital, you may have misspoken, but the $1.9 billion is this year. Our number for next year is $1.3 billion, that was our number that we've had for a while. In the July call, we said we had some risk that it might climb. We now think it won't climb so we're very confident about the $1.3 billion. It's possible it could be lower, but it's $1.3 billion for next year.","Wendell P. Weeks","The automotive. We're getting some really nice pull and engagement actually as recently as this last month. So that's the good news. I think you just got to keep in mind that the automotive industry does not move like tech and consumer electronics. So even once you have a platform win, it's a while before that platform win turns into commercialization. So it's got a little bit slower heartbeat as much as both us and our customers probably wish it went a little faster.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Newton from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I guess, the first one, I'm trying to understand the variance in display results from your very strong wholly owned business and the somewhat-weaker SCP results. And I was hoping you could discuss share at the problematic customer earlier this year and, I guess, later last year, whether that stabilized, grew or contracted sequentially and also your thoughts on share of that customer on a go-forward basis. And then additionally, Samsung announced, I believe it was on Monday of this week, that they've -- they're terminating their LCD contract with Apple. And I wanted to get your thoughts around how this announcement perhaps impacted SCP's 3Q results and how this could impact your wholly owned business on a go-forward basis, given your exposure to Apple's other qualified suppliers? And then I have a follow-up.","James B. Flaws","Okay, I'll try and take some of these. Maybe Wendell will take the Apple question. So our wholly owned business was quite strong, as we expected when we entered the quarter. That was driven primarily by increased utilization in Japan. You may recall, in Q2, our primary customer there had lowered their utilization quite a bit. We expect it to come back, and it did in Q3, and that really drove the larger increase because of that. We had good demand at our other wholly owned customers especially in China. For Samsung Corning Precision, basically, they have 2 customers. The utilization rate at those 2 customers didn't change very much during the quarter so we didn't really expect to see much change in demand there. Relative to the one customer, we announced that we had a -- the deal with them for the entire year. I think we made that announcement in the spring and so there really hasn't been any change with that customer since the spring. We obviously expect to continue to supply them. And we'll -- have not yet entered into negotiations for next year but will and hope to be a supplier with them and continuing what we've done for the last -- latter part of the 9 months of this year. Now Wendell, I'll turn it to you, to talk about Samsung and Apple.","Wendell P. Weeks","For mental and physical health, we try never to talk much about anybody who lives in Cupertino or Seoul, so I don't want to comment on any of that dynamic. What I will do, though, is, at -- the core of your question sort of gets into, for very high-performance displays, do we have really nice channel to market either through a direct relationship with the brands or through the appropriate players in the panel display chain? And I'd say we feel good about that. And actually, with what's going on for us right now in high-performance displays or those very high-pixel-count displays as well as creating backplane engines for things like OLEDs, we are feeling stronger and stronger with every passing month rather than vice versa.","Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Well, I guess, it was worth the try, Wendell. I guess, for my follow-on, Jim, I kind of want to ask the same kind of display pricing but in a different way, just looking at the P&L and on gross margin. And if we look at gross margin, I understand that the guidance for sequential decline as -- I think you said, is a -- pertains to a pricing reset in display in 4Q. But if I take your comments about, I guess, the preliminary expectation of volume growth in the display business in 2013, should we expect to see an improving gross margin trajectory as we kind of move through the year given that preliminary thought?","James B. Flaws","It'll obviously be a combination of what the volume is for next year and what pricing is for next year. We achieved what we hoped to on moderate pricing and have that carried for the entire year. And with the volume that we think it's possible, you might see a slight increase in display gross margins. And clearly, relative to the corporation, it will depend on what the other businesses are doing. The good news for us right now is Gorilla is well above the corporate average. And therefore, like we've experienced in years past with display, we are niche-pulling strong. It actually is helping drive our corporate number up. So in the future, when I talk about our corporate gross margins, it -- hopefully, they will be less all about display margins and about the impact of Gorilla helping out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","Two questions, please. First of all, with return to forward technology trends, I think Apple was highlighting on their new product introduction yesterday the use of thinner glass. And I was curious if that announcement in any way is accelerating the use of thin glass and if you could tie that into sort of where we are with the Willow development, whether you've had any progress during the quarter. And then just secondly, if we could just talk a little bit about diesel and Gorilla Glass gross margins. Putting aside the volumes for a second, can you talk about where operationally the gross margins are, whether there's more room to improve or you have them at optimal levels, that would be helpful.","Wendell P. Weeks","Great. So on the forward tech, once again, we're going to follow our general rule of never talking about anybody who lives in Cupertino or Seoul. So I will now generalize. We're continuing to see really a trend that we started in glass, which is to push towards thinner, to gain more and more momentum. And you see that in a variety of different product offerings and it's really validating our strategy from a technical standpoint and from a productivity standpoint, so that's great. On Willow, Willow is a really big idea that we continue to make good progress on both in our ability to do it in commercial levels of production as well as market development. That being said, because it's a big idea, in any given quarter, it isn\u2019t going to feel like there's a lot of progress on the outside because, until the fundamental supply chain -- it changes so much that it's going to take a while for a really strong obvious market pull to arrive. And then when it does, it will scale very rapidly. It will be one of our classic innovations where everybody will go, \"What's going on? What's going on? I haven't heard a lot about Willow?\" And then, it will turn on like a light switch and be really big. And which exact market it's going to hit first, this is hard for us to tell, but we certainly feel good about our progress so far on that. Jim, do you want to touch on margins? And then I'll build on the diesel.","James B. Flaws","So I would say, on Gorilla, we still feel the potential for margins to improve, they're really quite good right now. We are delighted by them but, we think, have potential to improve. On diesel, my -- I'll let Wendell comment. My own take is that, that we made quite a bit of improvement in diesel margins but I think we still have manufacturing projects that, when we have a volume, will allow our gross margins to improve, in diesel also.","Wendell P. Weeks","I think [ph], without doubt, that's the case. We got a lot of momentum there. And now we just need the volume to come on back, which I think I'm certain that it will. When? It's hard to tell. But people are going to buy heavy-duty trucks again, right?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simon Jankowski (sic) [Simona Jankowski] from Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So a couple of questions. First, when you talked about exiting the quarter with 15.5 weeks of inventory, can you just remind us how that compares to what would be a normal level of inventory heading into Q4 or, put another way, if you can just try to quantify the amount of excess inventory that you see right now and where those pockets are?","James B. Flaws","So we would say, normal is hard to judge in this business because of all the cycles we see, but I would say it's definitely more than what we expected to have -- be there. And I would say that we're -- from our perspective, we would say it's probably 50 million square feet, 50 to 70 million more than what we would have expected at this stage. The thing that's harder for us to judge is as the LCD business has grown rapidly in what I'll call the more emerging markets and then in China as it's expanded in more rural regions, is whether the supply chain is more inefficient, and therefore that's a reason why we may be seeing more inventory. But I would say that's my characterization of the risk of too much inventory right now heading into the fourth quarter.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And implicit in your guidance for Q4 is that you think some of that may get reduced, which is why you're taking a more conservative stance than what the panel guys are saying. Why do you think that you have that different view than the panel makers? Why are they not seeing the same dynamics as you are and why are they still planning to run at equal, if not slightly higher, utilization levels into Q4?","James B. Flaws","Well, this comes down to something we've been debating with ourselves, is we could fundamentally be wrong and there may be stronger demand that they're seeing that we're not. And therefore, they have good judgment of why they should keep running, and they're not going to end with that much inventory. That obviously would be a good news story for us that they don't end up with inventory, and retail is stronger. So we may be subject to our particular modeling and our solid experience with the volatility of the supply chain in the past. But they may be right, and if they are, we'd be happy to ship it to them. And we'd be delighted if they ended with less inventory and better retail.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just to follow up on the whole contract pricing discussion. You mentioned that you have done these contracts now with a number of your larger-volume customers but that some customers, like the -- one of your SCP customers, you're -- you have yet to renegotiate a contract into next year. Can you just give us a sense of roughly -- are you done with the majority of these at this point, or do we have another sizable chunk ahead? And the reason I ask is just trying to anticipate if we may see another pricing reset next quarter as kind of the next chunk of customers get into these kind of pricing readjustments.","Wendell P. Weeks","So we wouldn't expect the sort of correction of premium to be a recurring theme because at the core of what we're doing is to have the set relationship. That being said, I think the key thing to watch for as we go forward is going to be supply, demand and balance, what's happening overall with the market. And I think that will be more of the leading theme, as well as, \"Is the table that we have tried to set here, is that -- end up playing out the way that we would hope that it would?\" And the logic would say it ought to.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And -- but just to be clear on why you would not expect the correction of a premium to occur to one more quarter. Is that because the amount of volume that at this point has been renegotiated is much larger than what remains to be negotiated? Or is it just because the one that remains, the potential adjustment, is much smaller?","Wendell P. Weeks","I'd say the first is a more correct statement than the second.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts from Buckingham Research.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Does Dow Corning have its own restructuring plan in addition to what Corning is talking about here?","James B. Flaws","Well, Dow Corning does have their own restructuring plan. They've been reducing people ever since the second quarter, but we're not anticipating any special charge, they've been doing it on a consistent basis.","John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Scope it out for us at all? Will it be a -- does it -- will it turn their earnings, do you think? Do they exit that quarter still declining in terms of earnings?","James B. Flaws","It all depends, John, on Hemlock. And that's the wild card there, as you know, going into the polysilicon prices that occurred, actually, about this time a year ago. This is an extraordinarily profitable business, and pricing has plummeted and now we're seeing demand into China plummet with the trade wars. So that overwhelms. But I think that silicone margins are likely to grow slightly.","Ann H. S. Nicholson","We have time for one more question, Greg.","Operator","Okay. That question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Going back to earlier questions about the industry. How should I think about penetration of LEDs into the overall TV market? And I'm asking that because it seems to me that we're exiting 2012 with, like, a 70% penetration. And yes there's growth for the larger-sized LED TVs, but doesn't that imply that, despite inventories that are coming at -- under control, there could be below-average growth until the next catalyst for the replacement appears? Any thoughts you have will be great. And I have a follow-up.","James B. Flaws","Sure. On LED penetration, I'll just give you some statistics. Actually, the place where LED penetration is really low is the United States. It's only achieved slightly over 50%. Japan is the highest, but it's probably no surprise. It's in the 80s. And Europe has been moving up, but it's still only again 70%. So we think LED is an important part of the replacement factor. It makes what used to be a thin television, super thin. And as you see the ads for this upcoming holiday season, people aren't at the sizing can [ph]. So I think LED is still a driver, along with other improvements in the technology.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So what are you -- what is raw penetration worldwide as we exit 2012? Are you implying that it's actually well below 70%?","James B. Flaws","Yes, I do believe it's well below 70%.","Wendell P. Weeks","Yes.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Got it. And then on the Gorilla and more on the mobile market, should we expect a typical seasonality into early next year, especially with some of OEM partners that are already out with their new products, they may take a pause until the next refresh comes in?","James B. Flaws","We don't have, unfortunately, a typical seasonality with Gorilla that we've been able to prove. Part of this is that the supply chain is actually far longer in the Gorilla cover glass business than it is in the LCD business. Obviously, that can be similar to customers who can have an influence when they do a big rollout, but we've seen customers do more frequent rollouts with models and so it's always possible we have a pause. But right now, we're having a hard time keeping up with our customer demands to Gorilla.","Okay, so I'd like to wrap up. I just have a couple of comments here. First, from an IR point of view, we will be speaking at the UBS global technology conference in New York on November 14. And also, we will be at the Credit Suisse Technology Conference in Scottsdale on November 27 and we're delighted to see our investors there.","In terms of summarizing some of the things we talked about today. We think we've made excellent progress on our plan to stabilize display and grow out earnings potential in the other businesses. In display, we're delighted with our new agreements with key customers and we think they will give us strong benefits in 2013.","Demand for Gorilla is very strong and we expect it to continue into Q4. We've got very good operating cash flow. The board reacted by increasing the dividend 20%, increasing our 12-month increase in dividends to 80%.","We obviously are feeling some effects of the macro economy, but the management is reacting quickly to control costs due to restructuring and will offset some of those impacts and hopefully allow us to grow earnings in 2013.","Lastly, I'd like to make one comment, first of all on Ken Sofio. Ken continues to progress and appreciates very much people who emailed him. And second of all, I'd like to thank Ann, Linda and Kelly for stepping in and doing great job with IR over these past few months.","And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Ann.","Ann H. S.

Welcome to Corning\u2019s fourth quarter conference call. With me today is Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Jeff Evenson, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer. ","Before we begin our formal comments, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These remarks involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company\u2019s financial reports. You should also note that this presentation contains a number of non-GAAP measures, and our results are presented in core performance measures. A reconciliation can be found on our website. ","We have slides posting live on our website to accompany our formal comments, and they will be available on our website later this morning.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Wendell.","Wendell Weeks","Thank you, Ann. Good morning everyone. As we reported in this morning\u2019s press release, we met and in a few places exceeded our expectations in quarter four and also beat consensus. That said, year-over-year results in most of our businesses were impacted by the weak global economy, the stronger dollar versus other currencies, and continued softness in the TV and IT retail markets. We expect these headwinds to continue in quarter one.","Despite the macroeconomic challenges we faced in quarter four, we had several major successes executing against the strategy and capital allocation framework that we introduced in October. The framework, which describes our leadership priorities for the next four years is simple. We will focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength to grow, create significant value, and return cash to our shareholders. ","As we told you in October, over the course of the next four years, we expect to generate and deploy more than $20 billion through 2019. We will distribute more than $10 billion to our shareholders, which is by the way roughly half of our current market cap, and we will invest $10 billion in our growth and to sustain our industry leadership. We are confident this new framework will drive the company forward and guide our value creation in 2016 and beyond. ","Let me just take a few minutes to highlight our recent successes under this framework. We generated more than $3 billion in adjusted operating cash flow in 2015 despite significant macroeconomic headwinds. This is good evidence of our ability to generate the cash flow that underpins our capital allocation plan. We\u2019re off to a good start on our commitment to return more than $10 billion to our shareholders with a $1.25 billion accelerated stock repurchase program that we completed last week. We continue to focus our portfolio with the recent announcement of the strategic realignment of our interest in Dow Corning Corporation. ","As we indicated when we announced the transaction, we\u2019re very proud of Dow Corning\u2019s success over the last 72 years. However, Dow Corning\u2019s silicones business lies outside our three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market access platforms. Given Dow\u2019s strong synergies with the silicones business, we believe the transaction unlocks the value of Dow Corning for our shareholders.","When we close this transaction, Corning will exchange its 50% interest in Dow Corning for 100% of the stock of a newly formed Down Corning entity that will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Corning. The new entity will own approximately 40% interest in Hemlock Semiconductor and approximately $4.8 billion of cash. We believe that our ownership interest in Hemlock and the additional $4.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet creates significant value.","$4.8 billion is approximately a 30 times multiple on the equity earnings from Dow Corning\u2019s silicones business, and it\u2019s important to remember that we expect the realignment to be essentially tax-free. This additional cash increases the amount of funds available for deployment from the $22 billion to $26 billion we discussed in October, to $26 billion to $30 billion to 2019. We will provide more details on how we intend to deploy this cash when we close the transaction.","In support of our commitment to utilize our market access platforms and financial strength to grow, we leveraged our competitive advantages and strengthened customer relationships in display to stabilize returns. First, we established a long-term supply agreement and a low-cash investment in a Gen-10.5 glass manufacturing facility adjacent to BOE. By utilizing others\u2019 fundings, we significantly de-risked this transaction and we expect outstanding returns. The investment total is $1.3 billion. Our cash investment, however, is one-fourth of that at $290 million, and at that level exceeds our target of obtaining $2 of every $3 from others when we invest in new melting capacity. Second, we obtained favorable pricing for LCD glass in quarter four. ","It\u2019s no secret to any of you that the display industry is experiencing significant challenges. The retail market for TV and IT softened in the back half of 2015, and supply chain weeks of inventory grew. Despite these market dynamics, our fourth quarter sequential price declines were the lowest of the year. ","Stepping back and looking at 2015 as a whole, the display industry had its most challenging year in the last five years on a number of dimensions. First, it was the lowest end market growth in area terms over the last five years. Second, panel price declines were the highest they have been in five years. Finally, the year ended with the highest level of inventory in the supply chain over the past five years. Now even in this environment, we had the smallest annual price decline for glass in five years. This is important evidence that we\u2019re making significant progress on stabilizing our returns in display, and as you will hear in a moment from Tony, that trend continues in quarter one of this year.","Finally, evidence continues to build that we will successfully leverage our automotive market access platform to disrupt the 6 billion square foot auto glazing market to drive growth for Corning. We made two significant announcements. First in December, we announced that Ford will use Corning Gorilla Glass in the iconic Ford GT. This is the first production vehicle to use Gorilla Glass for multiple glazing applications, including the windshield, rear engine cover and acoustic separator. It\u2019s a great example of leveraging our market access with the world\u2019s leading automakers to pursue disruptive opportunities while utilizing our existing fusion assets. This collaboration demonstrates what Corning does best - applying expertise in glass and material science to help industry leaders solve tough challenges, unleash new capabilities, and enhance experiences for their customers.","Second, just last week we announced a joint venture with Saint-Goban Sekurit to develop, manufacture and sell lightweight automotive glazing solutions. Saint-Goban is a leading global producer of automotive glazing. Corning will continue to produce and market Gorilla Glass to this JV and other glazers, retaining 100% ownership of the glass business. This venture allows us to move forward in the value chain beyond glass to manufacture and sell glazing solutions with a leading producer. This provides a low-cost path for us to scale Gorilla Glass glazing solutions across the globe.","To summarize, we\u2019re making solid progress delivering on our new framework. We are generating strong and sustainable operating cash, unlocking significant value for shareholders, and focusing our portfolio by removing assets outside our core capabilities, leveraging our three core technologies, four manufacturing engineering platforms, and five market access platforms to deliver strong financial performance, and we\u2019re returning cash to shareholders. Though we will clearly face economic headwinds in the first half of 2016, our confidence continues to build in our ability to deliver on our commitments to our shareholders.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tony, who will review our fourth quarter results and first quarter outlook.","Tony Tripeny","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. Before I get into the details, there are two hot topics with investors where I want to provide an update: LCD pricing and yen hedging after 2017. Starting with LCD glass pricing, I\u2019ll spend a few minutes giving you our perspective on the display industry dynamics and explain why we are increasingly confident that our strategy to stabilize returns will work. ","Let\u2019s start with the end markets. To recap 2015, it was a challenging year for the industry, driven by the fall-off in demand at retail. TV unit demand was actually down in several regions. Specifically, TV demand in Europe and Latin America was weaker due to the effect of the stronger dollar on retail prices and continued economic uncertainty. Taken as a whole, worldwide TV unit sell-through was down low single digits. On an area basis, the unit decline was more than offset by an average screen size growth of more than one inch. ","In addition, IT and mobile demand was weak, driven by a lack of replacement drivers, the strong dollar, and continued economic uncertainty. We estimate the worldwide IT market was down 6% in area in 2015. In total, the glass market at retail was up about 2% in 2015 as measured in area.","As a result of the lower end market demand, supply chain inventory grew. Panel price declines began to accelerate and panel makers began lower utilizations in Q3 and lowered them again in Q4. Panel prices fell 30 to 40% for the year with most sizes approaching cash cost. While inventories decreased in Q4, they are still at a high level. ","All of that said, coming into 2016 we expect end market demand to recover in units, and for average TV screen size to continue to grow. Specifically, we expect sell-through units to be up low single digits and for average screen size to grow at least 1.5 inches. We think demand for IT in units will be consistent with 2015 and screen sizes will grow slightly. As you can see on the slide, the biggest contributor to glass area growth is screen size. TV screen size grows annually driven by affordability. As TV prices decline, consumers can buy a bigger TV for the same price. For example, today you can purchase a 50-inch TV for the same price as a 42-inch TV in 2013. ","Now for TV units. TV units were down low single digits last year. History tells us that when you have a year with compressed TV consumption, you typically get a rebound the following year. Other drivers supporting growth in 2016 are lower panel prices will have a positive effect on TV retail prices and will therefore increase demand; the U.S. dollar appreciation is less likely to continue; and we expect an improved economy in western Europe. As a result, we expect worldwide TV unit sell-through to be up about 2%, so for the full year, we expect demand for LCD glass at retail to grow in the high single digits. We will share more details on our market outlook for LCD in February at a our investor meeting.","Now let\u2019s turn to the display supply chain and look how the end market in terms of glass sell-through interacts with glass demand. On this chart, the green line is end market demand, and the blue line is glass market demand. When the green line is below the blue, panel makers are running at higher utilizations to build inventory to support an upcoming retail season. When it\u2019s below, inventory is being depleted by pull through at retail. You can see in the time frame of Q1 to Q3 of \u201915, the glass market was flat because panel makers were maintaining utilization in anticipation of the retail season, and it resulted in a significant inventory build. Beginning in the third quarter of \u201915 through Q1 of \u201916, glass market demand is lower as panel makers lower utilization in reaction to falling panel prices and a weaker end market. Panel maker utilization and the glass market are expected to be down sequentially in Q1, allowing the supply chain to reduce inventory. The combination of a healthier supply chain and end market growth will lead to panel maker utilization increasing and our glass volume growing as the year progresses. We expect this to start in the second quarter.","Now to sum up the year for glass demand. In Q1, we expect the glass market and our volume to be down mid to high single digits. The good news is that lower panel maker utilization will help draw down inventory. We expect glass demand to resume strongly in the second half, and we expect glass demand for the full year to grow in the mid single digits.","Now let\u2019s turn to the bright spot - glass pricing. Pricing in 2015 was the best in five years. Q4 price declines were less than any other quarter last year, and we expect glass prices in Q1 to decline moderately sequentially. The price decline in Q1 is typically the highest quarterly decline of every year because Q1 is when annual supply agreements are finalized. Our moderate Q1 price decline this year equals the best Q1 declines we\u2019ve seen in five years, despite this very tough environment. We think our display strategy passed a significant test and that Q1 pricing is a strong indicator that we can maintain favorable pricing going forward and deliver on stabilizing returns.","Now moving to the yen. As a quick refresher, we sell our display glass in yen. We have hedged through 2017 at an average rate of 99. With the stability our hedging program gives to our display cash flows, investors naturally ask, what happens in 2018 and beyond? Our response is that we\u2019ll consider extending our hedge position as we gain certainty on our future yen flows and when the currency market offers an attractive yen-dollar rate opportunity. We are happy to announce progress on this front. Late last year, we extended our long-term supply agreements with our two largest customers. We extended our agreement with Samsung and BOE through 2025 and 2028 respectively. This greatly increases our confidence in future yen flows. ","On the rate front, I\u2019m sure you all noted the recent volatility in the currency markets and the brief strengthening of the yen. We took advantage of this opportunity to add to our hedge position. At this point, we are hedged for approximately 70% of our anticipated yen flow from the time period of 2016 to 2022 at an average rate of 106. For those investors who were concerned about our yen exposure beyond 2017, this action will greatly mitigate those concerns. Because our capital allocation framework factored in weak yen scenarios, the additional hedges give upside to our expected operating cash flow in our four-year plan, so while the yen will always be an important topic, we significantly reduced the downside risk and increased the certainty in our ability to return greater than $10 billion to shareholders over the next four years.","Now let\u2019s get into fourth quarter financials. For the quarter, we met and in a few places exceeded our expectations, and we also beat consensus. As a reminder, these are core results. Sales in the quarter were $2.4 billion and higher than consensus. This was down 5% versus last year\u2019s strong fourth quarter. Corporate gross margin was 42%, as expected. This is consistent with Q3 but lower than last year. Most of our businesses have a relatively high fixed cost structure, therefore the decreased sales lower our gross margin as a percentage of sales versus last year. ","S&A and RD&E were down versus last year in absolute dollars. S&A was a bit higher than we expected due to external fees associated with our external transactions. These expenses are one-time in nature and we do not expect them to repeat. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than expected. Congress passed the extenders bill in December and this reduced our tax expense by approximately $20 million. ","Net income was $429 million and lower than last year. The lower earnings reflect the lower volumes, mainly in display, and the impact of foreign exchange rates. Additionally, last year we received payment regarding an IP dispute that did not repeat. EPS was $0.34 and exceeded consensus. ","For the full year, our sales and earnings reflected the macroeconomic headwinds in the back half of the year. ","Now let\u2019s look at detailed segment results, beginning with display technologies. Display performance in Q4 was in line with our guidance. Volume was down slightly, price declines were moderate, as expected, and the lowest sequential decline in 2015. Display sales were $903 million and net income was $234 million. As a reminder, in Q4 last year we received a payment regarding an IP dispute that did not repeat. As anticipated, in the fourth quarter panel makers again lowered utilization in response to the softer end market I already mentioned, which resulted in volume down low single digits for the glass market. Our volume was down slightly sequentially, a bit better than market declines due to the favorable resolution of a customer dispute leading to recovery of the missed volume at that customer.","Sequentially, fourth quarter price declines were moderate, as expected, and declined less than in Q3. During the quarter, we secured the majority of our 2016 volume under customer agreements, helping us maintain stable share which in turn enables us to be more efficient in planning, manufacturing and reducing costs. ","Display sales were down 8% for the full year and net income was down 14%. The reduction in net income is the result of the slower growth of the LCD glass market at retail in 2015 that I already spoke to.","We had many accomplishments in display in 2015. I already talked about the favorable pricing. We extended long-term supply agreements with two major customers that go to the middle of the next decade. The integration of CPM continues to go well and we exceeded our synergy target. Finally, we reduced costs by more than 10% and we continue to maintain our significant cost leadership.","Now moving to optical communications, which performed better than our guidance. Q4 sales were $736 million and up 9% versus last year, driven by acquisitions and growth in fiber-to-the-home. This was better than expected, driven by stronger carrier network sales. Net income was $47 million in Q4. Net income was down 2% versus last year, which is not what you would expect with sales growth. This is mostly about mix. We had less of our sales in our higher margin data center integrated solutions and more of our sales in lower margin products like cable from our newly acquired Korean operation. We also experienced higher cost in our fiber business. We are addressing the cost issue and we expect overall profitability to improve in 2016. ","For the full year, we are very pleased with optical communications performance, which well exceeded our goal of growing more than two times the telecom industry capex rate. Sales were up 12% to $3 billion, driven by growth in nearly all parts of our business. Sales would have been up 16% without the impact of FX. Net income was up 28% and significantly more than sales growth. The improved profitability was driven by the additional volume in fiber-to-the-home and data center solutions and strong manufacturing performance.","In environmental, Q4 performance was also better than expectations. Q4 sales were $254 million, up 2% versus last year. Without the impact of FX, sales would have been up 5%. During the quarter, China implemented a stimulus program for car sales, and that drove demand for our light duty products higher than expected. Soft demand in China for heavy duty products continued. Year-over-year profitability was down, as expected and similar to Q3. It was driven mostly by the weaker euro and lower volume in the heavy duty China market. ","For the full year, sales were down 4% and net income was down 12%. Sales would have been up 2% without the impact of FX and profitability would have been consistent with record 2014 performance. In 2015, we expected growth in the global auto market and we expected another year of growth in North America and China heavy duty truck production. We invested capacity to support this growth. We grew as expected in all markets except for China, where heavy duty truck builds were down 30% and China\u2019s auto growth, while stronger in Q4, was less than expected for the full year. ","As we start 2016, we see continued strength in the auto market but are being impacted in our heavy duty segment in China and now in North America, which is coming off a two-year peak. As a result, we are carrying costs associated with capacity that is currently under-utilized but is ready and will deliver expanding margins when market volumes resume. We have taken action on costs which continues through the first half, and we expect gross margin percentages to improve year-over-year, beginning in the second half of 2016.","Moving on to specialty materials, which performed in line with guidance, Gorilla Glass volume was down sequentially and versus a strong Q4 of \u201914, as we expected. This reflected the reduction of supply chain builds compared to a very strong build in Q4 of \u201914. Sales were $275 million and net income was $44 million. Segment net income was up 40% in Q4 mainly due to improved gross margins in Gorilla versus last year, aided by Gorilla Glass 4 prices, improved cost, and the non-repeat of a one-time unfavorable item last year. ","For the full year, specialty material sales were down 8% driven by lower sales of advanced optics. Sales in advanced optics were down related to the completion of a large aerospace and defense program, softer demand in the semiconductor industry, and the weaker euro. Net income, on the other hand, was up 11% driven by Gorilla Glass volume growth, adoption of Gorilla Glass 4, and cost reductions. We are pleased with our Gorilla Glass business. The market demand for cover glass was up approximately 10% in 2015, and we gained share with the big China OEMs and on touch notebooks. Additionally, the successful introduction and adoption of higher priced Gorilla Glass 4 had a very favorable impact on our profitability.","In life sciences, Q4 sales were $202 million while sales and net income were down year-over-year driven by foreign exchange. For the full year, sales were down 5% and net income was down 12%, but both would have been up excluding the impact of foreign exchange. ","Q4 gross equity earnings from Dow Corning were $78 million, as expected. Hemlock contributed $39 million of the total, up from Q3 driven by customers fulfilling their annual contracts. For the full year, Dow Corning\u2019s equity earnings were $245 million. ","Now let\u2019s turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We delivered free cash flow in the quarter of $628 million and over $1 billion of adjusted operating cash flow. For the full year, we generated $3.2 billion in adjusted operating cash flow and spent $1.25 billion on capex, and had free cash flow of $1.5 billion. As Wendell indicated, more than $3 billion in adjusted operating cash flow for the full year really gives us confidence in our ability to deliver our capital allocation plan.","During the quarter, we spent $1.3 billion on share repurchases. This reflects our accelerated stock repurchase program. For the full year, we spent $3.2 billion on repurchases and lowered outstanding shares by 151 million shares. We ended the year with $4.6 billion of cash, with approximately $1 billion in the U.S.","Now for the outlook. We expect the global economic headwinds to persist in the first quarter and to impact all of our businesses year-over-year. We expect the first quarter to be the weakest of 2016, and we anticipate growth will recover in subsequent quarters. ","Let\u2019s begin by looking at each of our businesses. This morning, I will provide our Q1 expectations with some additional color on the full year. You can expect to hear more about our business outlook at our upcoming IR day.","Beginning with display, to repeat what I said earlier in the call, in Q1 we expect the glass market and our volume to be down mid to high single digits, driven by lower panel maker utilizations that I already mentioned. Once the supply chain returns to normal, we expect panel maker utilization and our glass volumes to grow. We expect this growth to start in Q2. We expect our LCD glass prices to decline moderately sequentially. Given how our contracts work, we are confident that the price declines will be moderate in the quarter. ","As we have previously explained, we expect this more favorable pricing environment to continue and maybe even improve for two primary reasons. First, the financial situation of our competitors indicate that they cannot continue historical price declines and remain profitable; and second, as we said before, we believe that glass supply and demand will remain balanced throughout the recent weakening in panel demand. We are keeping capacity offline to match our supply to our demand. Other glass suppliers have said publicly that they have levers to take similar actions. For these and other reasons, we continue to believe that our quarter-over-quarter price comparisons will be better for us going forward than they have been overall in the past. ","To summarize display, we expect our volume in Q1 to reflect the weaker retail market and lower panel maker utilization, and we will manage supply to demand. We do not believe that the current economic environment reflects any fundamental change to our longer term drivers of TV demand and that the end market will recover in 2016.","Moving to optical communications, for the first quarter we expect sales to be up low to mid single digits versus last year. For the full year, we expect our sales to be up mid single digits and exceed our goal of at least two times the overall industry capex growth rate. ","Turning to environmental, the U.S. heavy duty truck market is forecasted to be down about 20% in 2016 after a two-year peak, and we also expect China\u2019s heavy duty market to remain weak. This will impact our heavy duty volume and segment sales in Q1. We expect sales to be down approximately 10% versus last year. We do expect auto production to increase this year, but we do not expect it to offset the lower heavy duty demand and continued FX drag, so our outlook for the full year is for environmental sales to be down slightly from 2015. ","In specialty materials, we expect Gorilla Glass volume to grow in the high single digits this year; however, in Q1 segment sales are expected to decline mid-teens year-over-year due primarily to the absence of a ramp for new product launches by mobile device manufacturers like we had in Q1 of \u201915. For the full year, we anticipate double-digit sales and net income growth in specialty materials, driven by Gorilla Glass.","In life sciences, we expect Q1 sales to be up low single digits versus last year with underlying growth offset by the weaker euro. For the full year, we expect to grow sales faster than the market, which is expected to be up low single digits.","Continuing with the rest of our Q1 forecast, we expect gross margin to be approximately 41%. This is a one point decline sequentially due to the expected lower display and lower Gorilla Glass volume. We expect gross margin to improve with volumes in our businesses, starting in the second quarter. ","SG&A and RD&E spending will be approximately 14% and 8% of sales respectively. We expect other income\/other expense to be a net expense of approximately $50 million. We expect Q1 equity earnings from Dow Corning to be approximately $45 million. This is down from Q4, where polysilicone customers met annual contract obligations. For the full year, we expect slight growth in both silicones and polysilicone sales. We expect our effective tax rate for 2016 to be in the 16 to 17% range. ","That concludes our outlook for the first quarter. Now I will hand the call back to Wendell to summarize before we go to Q&A.","Wendell Weeks","Thank you, Tony. Well, no surprise - the global economy is impacting our company. Nonetheless, we continue to make solid progress on many critical fronts. Despite the worst display industry environment in five years, glass price declines are the smallest they\u2019ve been in five years. This provides us a good foundation for stabilizing returns in this business. We\u2019re generating excellent operating cash flow and we are returning cash to our shareholders. We are beating the competition and we have a great opportunity ahead of us, as exemplified by our recent progress on attacking the automotive glazing market with Gorilla Glass. We look forward to sharing many more details of our strategy and capital allocation framework at our annual investor meeting next week. ","Ann?","Ann Nicholson","Thank you, Wendell and Tony. We\u2019ll now open the lines for questions. Lois?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question will come from the line of Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath","Hey, good morning to you. Great call, and you guys are doing an amazing job with keeping your displays steady with all these gyrations going on. The question for you is, it\u2019s no surprise that China consumer demand is starting to weaken, especially in terms of sentiment with all the drama we are seeing in the China market there. Do you anticipate heading forward into the rest of the year further weakness in TV demand from the Chinese consumers? My guess is roughly 40% of HDTV sales will be to the China market, so that\u2019s where I\u2019m coming from, to get some qualitative commentary from you through the rest of the year if China consumer demand for TV sets would deteriorate, how that would impact your displays business. Thanks.","Tony Tripeny","I think from an overall standpoint actually, last year China was one region that had strong growth on a year-over-year basis, and that includes in the fourth quarter where there strong sales on things like the singles day on November 11, and also sales starting in the early part of December for the Chinese New Year. I think the important thing to keep in mind when we look at our growth on sales on a year-over-year basis, at glass at retail, what really drives a lot of that growth, of course, is what happens with the screen size. As you saw in the chart that we presented, that\u2019s the biggest single driver of our growth on a year-over-year basis. We think sales are going to be up 2%, TV unit sales on a year-over-year basis. It could be a little bit weaker than that, but we think our range of being up in the high single digits, we feel pretty good about that, and a lot of that actually has to do with the screen size growth.","Vijay Bhagavath","A quick follow-up, if I may, the Summer Olympics would mostly be broadcast in 4K. Do you anticipate any meteor spike in 4K TV demand because a lot of us would like to watch the Summer Olympics in 4K? Thanks.","Tony Tripeny","We would love for you to watch the Summer Olympics in 4K. I think when we look at 4K demand in general, it did increase in \u201915 to about 28 million units. We expect it to probably come close to doubling in \u201916, that price points are getting closer to 1.5, which we think will increase the adoption from a demand standpoint. But you know, it\u2019s always hard to tell on sporting events. Often it does give us a little bit of a pick-up like before, but from a whole year standpoint, it\u2019s kind of hard to distinguish them.","Vijay Bhagavath","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Rod Hall","Hi guys, thanks for the questions. So I\u2019ve got a couple for you. The first one, I wanted to just dive into macro more broadly. You\u2019re indicating a weaker Q1 than we expected but a pretty strong full-year guide, and I\u2019m just wondering behind that, what you\u2019re assuming for macro through the year. You said that the first half of the year, you expect it to be weak, but it looks like heavy duty trucks are slow - that\u2019s usually a pretty good leading indicator of macro. We see a lot of indicators that the U.S. is weakening, so just curious to hear what your views of macro through the year are that inform that full-year guidance.","Second question I wanted to ask, Tony, was on the hedging. Can you talk about the fade of the hedging? You said 70% coverage. I assume that\u2019s higher in the early years and then fades through that period, but can you give us a little bit more color on that? ","Finally, optical was very strong. Any color on regional strength or project strength there? Thanks a lot.","Tony Tripeny","Okay, well first, starting from a macroeconomic standpoint, we\u2019re not expecting a whole lot of change relative to the macroeconomics in 2016. I think as we look at each of our business units and what\u2019s driving the growth there, a lot of it is continuations of what we have seen in 2015. I mean, the one area that we do think will be down on a year-over-year basis is the one that you mentioned, which is in heavy duty trucks in North America. We expect to see continued weakness in heavy duty trucks in China, and that\u2019s why environmental in total we think will be down in low single digits.","From a yen standpoint, actually we\u2019re covered really throughout that--we were covered very significantly in \u201916 and \u201917, and then as we go out after that, we\u2019re covered at a lower percentage than that, so you are correct on that. ","Then Wendell, you want to talk about what\u2019s happening in optical, it\u2019s mostly in North America. ","Wendell Weeks","Sure. I\u2019ll hit on all three of Rod\u2019s questions. First, good to hear from you, Rod. On the macro front, bottom line is we\u2019re planning on not that exciting an economy in this coming year. Where you see us recovering as the year goes on mainly has to do with the supply chain correction in display and some pick-up in some very specific areas where we have very high margin product sets, like in Gorilla and some particular market segments in opto that have less to do with the economy and more to do with just the cycle of product introductions or where they are in their build cycles. But in general, we\u2019re with you - we don\u2019t see that much good news in the economy here in the near term. ","On the yen, yes it fades. What Tony and his team have managed to do here is the coverage is still quite high all the way out for a lot of years, so in many ways this has just lopped off the downside risk at the end, and the compliment I would make to him and his team is once we got in place the long-term supply agreements, it gave us confidence we were going to have the end flows. Then we just bided our time and were disciplined, waiting for what we knew there\u2019d be a volatile moment in the markets, the end would strengthen, and then we had in place all the trades that would make it close at a rate that we think is attractive and gives our shareholders a good shot.","In opto, actually though opto is really strong throughout the year, we think it can get stronger because we had two areas that are sort of in a low cycle at quarter four and somewhat in quarter one, which is the ultra-data center market. We\u2019re sort in between big builds in fiber-to-the home, right? We\u2019re sort of wrapping up in Australia, we\u2019ve got new ones on board that are going to be coming on stream, so right now opto continues to feel strong mainly because of how superior our product set is and the extent that we\u2019re really beating the competition in all of our core high value-add systems.","Rod Hall","Great, thanks a lot guys, and congrats on the hedging.","Wendell Weeks","Thanks, buddy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Please go ahead.","Mehdi Hosseini","Yes, thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Just as a follow-up to the previous question and focusing on your display, what is it in the supply chain that you see that gives you the confidence with your year-end unit volume up 5%? I ask that because this would suggest very strong sequential growth in Q2, Q3 off of your Q1 guide. So anything company-specific or supply chain-specific that you can offer that gives us confidence would be great, and I have a follow-up.","Tony Tripeny","Sure. I think when you go back and take a look at that chart on the demand that happens from a glass market standpoint and then from the retail market, what happens when panel makers lower their utilization, it gives an opportunity for there to be a significant reduction in inventory. Some of that happened in Q4, and we expect more of that to happen in Q1. Once that happens, then you\u2019re much more aligned with where panel maker utilization will increase their utilization and our glass volume will grow. We do expect that to happen more in the second half, but we do think there will be growth in the second quarter. ","Wendell Weeks","Mehdi, all I would add is I think to get a handle on this, you go back to that slide you saw from Tony, it\u2019s that slide that says Expect 2016 Retail Market Growth of High Single Digits. What that is--the first thing to get comfortable with is where do you see TV units? It\u2019s not a big part of the overall growth story, but that\u2019s up 2%, we think. Then it\u2019s about size, and we\u2019ll share more about this at the IR day, but television screen size has been one of the surest bets in display, and we expect that to contribute a lot, and then of course IT and small adds a little.","So the first thing to get comfortable about is what do you think about total LCD glass area growth, and we\u2019re sort of in line with what we see out of the most trusted external sources, and we have some specific thoughts on TV screen size. Then we go from that 8 to 10% to then we\u2019re going to see the supply chain decline and use up some of that growth, and that\u2019s what will take us to up mid-single digits. ","So I think, Mehdi, the first thing to get comfortable about is what do you think is really happening at demand, and we\u2019ll try to give you some of those details so you can make a good judgement, okay? ","Mehdi Hosseini","Great, thanks for the detailed color. Then moving on the specialty, with diversification of applications into auto, it\u2019s great that you have customer diversification, but can you help us understand how the margin profile is going to play out, especially in the past one particular customer may have pressured you on the prices. Now that you have diversification of application and customer, should we expect the recent improvement in operating margin will sustain?","Wendell Weeks","Now when you say auto, are you speaking about glazing or are you speaking about our environmental approach?","Mehdi Hosseini","Glazing, the Gorilla application, Gorilla using other applications.","Wendell Weeks","I think the way you should think about the way we\u2019re going to price this, is you should think about it sort of in the range of what we sell LCD glass for. So it\u2019s not going to be as profitable as some of our consumer electronics Gorilla stuff is, but it\u2019s still going to be quite profitable as you take a look at our display business. The key thing here isn\u2019t going to be how profitable it\u2019ll be. The key thing is going to here is how successful can we be about turning that market up on its head with our new lightweight solutions. If we can do that and get the volume, we\u2019re all going to love the profitability because we already have the capital in place, really. So the first $400 million of revenue we get in that business is going to be like a free shot on goal, because we\u2019ll be able to create that capacity rather than through capital spending and rather through productivity in our LCD and Gorilla businesses. So the key thing to watch there is, can we get that volume closed, Mehdi.","Jeff Evenson","This is Jeff, and as we move from the glazing market to the interior of the car, we see strong potential there for actual selling for more than we do, even in the consumer electronics space, because managing reflection and durability is so much more important in a car than it is even on your phone.","Wendell Weeks","Jeff, from your mouth to God\u2019s ears! That\u2019d be great. ","Mehdi Hosseini","Thank you. So if you had 16% net margin for specialty material in 2015, is that the bogey--is that something that we could model for going forward?","Wendell Weeks","I think for auto, what we ought to do is reflect a little, and let\u2019s see what we can do to help you in thinking, if you mean for auto. For specialty, I think what we would hope, what we\u2019re trying to get done in Gorilla is we\u2019re introducing ever more advanced product sets in terms of pure glass that sort of our revenue per device will go up, and with that our margin, as well as we\u2019re also going to add some other features to increase our revenue even further, and those may be at a little lower margin. But in auto, I think we owe you--once we get a little bit more momentum going, we owe you how to think about that business. ","Mehdi Hosseini","Got it. Very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Joseph Wolf from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joseph Wolf","Thank you. Just two follow-up questions. I guess I\u2019ll start with auto. I just want--as you look at the selling proposition right now, it sounds like the assets are in place, but when you go to these auto guys now that you have the glazing relationship, are you selling weight reduction, and does oil pricing matter, or are you selling visibility optics and clarity, and how is that resonating with the customer base right now?","Wendell Weeks","So great question, Joseph. We\u2019re hitting on really three things that are in the value prop. The first is lightweight. Now, despite the low gas prices, all of the car companies sort of by ranks have a target for what they have to increase miles per gallon for their fleet, so they are all very interested in lightweighting the vehicle. They have specific numbers in mind that they pay for every pound or kilo that they save, and with us being able to serve greater than 30% of--reduce weight by greater than 30% of glazing at a price point that looks attractive in terms of those weight buys, that gets traction. ","But what we\u2019re also able to do is actually increase the safety of the vehicle, because even though we\u2019re going lighter weight, basically what happens is when you have something like a rock strike, it can penetrate the outer layer of the soda lime glass but then it doesn\u2019t penetrate Gorilla. As well to that safety component is what we\u2019ve been able to show is dramatically reduced windshield replacements, is that with something like a sharp rock strike, basically we could save almost half of windshield replacements because, once again, the glass reacts in a much stronger, tougher way, so you don\u2019t end up with those classic cracks that can happen from thermal shock after you\u2019ve had damage introduced to the glass from something sharp, or blunt for that matter.","Then finally, it\u2019s the enhanced experience for the driver because here you\u2019re looking at a purely optical piece of glass. We make this on the same asset sets that we make display, so this piece of glass, because it\u2019s thinner, allows you to have HUD displays that are 70% or more bigger and tremendously clearer. One of the things Jeff did out at the Consumer Electronics Show, and you\u2019ll get a chance to see it at our IR day, is take a look at a HUD that we built in conjunction with Conti, who is the biggest HUD manufacturer in the world. What they said was that we had never seen a HUD display like this, it\u2019s incredible far and away.","So it\u2019s all those three things. Are we getting pulled? Without a doubt, people are really excited about it. Now, to calm us all down, damn this industry moves slow, so it just is a very conservative industry - for good reason, right? So man, it\u2019s going to take time for us to build, which is why we keep pointing to these proof points along the way. We\u2019ll know where we are long before the volume shows up.","That\u2019s probably more than you wanted to know, Joseph. ","Joseph Wolf","No, that\u2019s great. Just as a follow-up on optical, you started to address this, but what are the levers if you think about the opportunities in between product cycles in the fiber business or builds in different geographies and kind of a seasonal, it sounds like, ultra-data center sort of environment? What are the levers to get the margins up in 2016, and should we expect any of that throughout the year?","Wendell Weeks","I think the two major levers are--you\u2019re on the first one, which you heard Tony talk about, which is about mix. So we make more money when we sell these highly integrated solutions that we\u2019re the only guy in the world that does, so it\u2019s a classic example of capitalism working. For those, we certainly don\u2019t expect there to be less data centers built in the coming year. The main thing that\u2019s happened with the hyper-scale data centers is there was an adjustment from just a couple of key customers that were sort of adjusting their inventory. We expect them to come back online. We\u2019re going to look to expand our presence there, so that\u2019s one way we do it. ","The other is more like you say - we\u2019ve got to wait for the right cycles and builds on fiber-to-the-home and how that works. Meanwhile, we\u2019ll do the things we always do on margins - we relentlessly drive our costs down every year, and you can expect that to happen in opto as well. ","Tony Tripeny","That\u2019s exactly right, and one of the things that happened in the fourth quarter will continue a little bit into Q1, but will certainly be resolved by the end of Q1, are just some production issues that we\u2019ve run into, that we will get ourselves worked through. We\u2019re already well into that, and you\u2019ll start seeing margins improve there.","Joseph Wolf","All right, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Patrick Newton from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Patrick Newton","Good morning, Wendell and Tony. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess a two-part question on specialty materials. On the near-term front, you talked about not having some new product releases from customers, but I\u2019m curious - typically you don\u2019t see a sequential step-down of this level in Gorilla, or I guess in specialty materials, barring a meaningful price reduction you saw in 1Q13. So near term, can you talk a little bit about the pricing and volumes that are impacting your 1Q guide? And then guiding to the very strong remainder of the year, can you touch on what is driving this? Is this the beginning of some automotive benefits entering the model? Is touch accelerating new applications, or is the largest demand driver from a large customer on new product launches?","Tony Tripeny","Sure, so first starting with the Q1, I think there\u2019s two things that are going on in Q1. One is clearly the volume, as we don\u2019t see that launch like we did a year ago, and I think there is lots of people out there in the overall mobile device supply chain that have announced the similar type things, and we\u2019re seeing that in Q1 also. Q1 is where we do some price declines, but that\u2019s--this is not like what you saw in 2013. This is mostly related from a volume standpoint.","In terms of what\u2019s going to drive the rest of the year, it\u2019s not about automotive and getting a win there. This is all about consumer electronic devices and, as Wendell said, our ability to add value onto those devices. ","Wendell Weeks","Yes, I think you\u2019ve got it, Patrick, that it\u2019s going to primarily get driven by major new launches. As those new product sets come out, we see that natural surge up in supply chain at a profitability going to continue to come at us as Gorilla 4 continues to penetrate more. That\u2019s a product that we make more money on than we did on Gorilla 3, and hopefully we can keep that trend going, Patrick.","Patrick Newton","Great, and then just as a follow-up, Wendell, in your prepared remarks you said that weeks of display inventory grew at the highest level, or is that the highest level in five years? And then you said that area gross in display was at the lowest level in five years, while also adding in several times in both the prepared remarks and Q&A that area growth or larger screen sizes is the key driver for display. So I guess first, can you quantify where weeks of inventory currently stands in the display business, and then on the growth of TVs, you did guide for an increase of at least 1.5 inches, but given that we probably saw that much or more in 2015, do you anticipate that area growth will re-accelerate year-over-year, or have we passed that inflection point and should actually start to see area growth rates slow? ","Tony Tripeny","So first on the supply chain, we aren\u2019t going to give the number of weeks - we\u2019ve stopped doing that, but I think it\u2019s safe to say it was very high at the end of the year. It did come down versus Q3, but it still ended up very high and all of our remarks and thoughts about what\u2019s happening in Q1 is definitely based on that.","From a screen size standpoint, I think screen size, we think was up about 1.2, 1.3 inches. It was depressed a little bit because there was a big Mexico incentive program, and we expect, as we said, in 2016 for it to be more than an inch and a half. How much more than an inch and a half it is, we don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve certainly done some work and some analysis on that, and if it ends up being more than that, then of course the market will be a little higher.","Wendell Weeks","Yes Patrick, I\u2019d just add to that. Last year, it wasn\u2019t so much that the screen size was dead - it grew, right? And as Tony said, the Mexican subsidy was about specifically 24-inch TVs or something like that, some ridiculously small TV. But what happened and the dynamic was the units went down, and that is, I think, the key that is different between this coming year and last year. So we expect units to sort of pop back, as well as little bit more oomph coming out of screen size. ","You know, it\u2019s debatable, it\u2019s hard to see for sure into the future, but every other time we\u2019ve seen a little dip like this, a compression in television demand, the year after usually bounces back a lot stronger than what we\u2019re guiding at. Right now, there\u2019s a lot of other qualitative factors we can add up, but hey, it\u2019s a legitimate question, Patrick.","Patrick Newton","Thank you. Tony, in case I missed it, did you give capex guidance for 2016?","Tony Tripeny","No, we need you to come to the IR meeting next week.","Patrick Newton","All right, see you there. Thank you.","Wendell Weeks","You\u2019re going to want to see the displays anyway, man! It\u2019ll be worth coming.","Tony Tripeny","Yeah, that will not be the highlight of the evening!","Patrick Newton","All right, thank you for taking my question.","Ann Nicholson","We\u2019ll do one more quick question.","Operator","Thank you. That question will come from the line of Doug Clark from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Doug Clark","Great, thanks for sneaking in my question here. Something that wasn\u2019t touched on during the call, I\u2019m just curious about the transition to even thinner glass, kind of 0.3mm and below. Are we seeing that in any real material volumes at this point, or is it still kind of lapping through the transition to 0.5 and 0.4?","Wendell Weeks","Not yet. Not yet. That\u2019s a good question for Mr. Clapton when he shows up at our IR meeting, but not yet. We\u2019ve certainly got a number of folks talking to us about it. It\u2019s certainly something that we can do, but we haven\u2019t seen the big shift start as of yet.","Doug Clark","Okay, great. Then my one additional follow-up was just on the inventory situation throughout the supply chain. I was just wondering if the utilization cuts are a global phenomenon; in other words, are you also seeing utilizations come down in China as well, or is it more developed market dynamics that are responding to the panel price declines?","Wendell Weeks","That is a really clever, insightful question, very clever. So we\u2019ve seen something a little different in the supply chain in 2015 than we have in other years. Typically the panel makers have gotten-well, not typically, but the panel makers have gotten a lot sharper. When panel prices are falling and they start to approach sort of their cash cost, they have been not keeping any inventory and they have been rapidly adjusting their utilization. We saw that from most of the highly established developed panel makers. We saw less of a reaction out of the major Chinese panel makers, some of whom are really big customers, who continued to run their panel fabs probably longer than they should have. We\u2019ve seen a build-up of some very small size TVs in that set; however we\u2019re seeing them adjust now. ","But that\u2019s a very clever question. It\u2019s something we\u2019re going to have to keep an eye on to get an understanding of will the emergence of these strong Chinese players mean that the supply chain is going to run a little fatter than it used to, or is it just a matter of where they are in their own cycle of learning? We need a little more data to know.","Doug Clark","Great, well I appreciate that color. Thank you.","Ann Nicholson","Thanks Doug. Thanks guys. I think we\u2019ll end the call now. We have a few announcements first. As Wendell said, our annual investor meeting is on Friday, February 5 at Cipriani Wall Street in New York City. You can register for the event on our website. Wendell, Tony, Jeff and our business leaders will be present, and you\u2019ll have a hands-on opportunity to step into the glass age with Corning. We\u2019ll be sharing our very popular exhibits from the recent Consumer Electronics Show.","We\u2019ll also be at the Goldman Sachs conference on February 9 in San Francisco and Morgan Stanley on March 1, also in San Francisco.

Welcome to the Corning Incorporated second quarter 2013 earnings results. It is my pleasure to turn the call over to Ms. Ann Nicholson, division vice president of investor relations. ","Ann Nicholson","Thank you, operator, and good morning. Welcome to Corning's second quarter conference call. With me today is Jim Flaws, vice chairman and chief financial officer. Before Jim begins his formal comments, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These remarks involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These factors are detailed in the company's SEC reports.","You should also note that this presentation contains a number of non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation can be found on our website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.","James Flaws ","Thanks, Ann. Good morning everyone. Our priority over the last 18 months has been to reestablish positive momentum in our display technologies segment and also to grow our other businesses. We had a very strong second quarter, delivering our third consecutive quarter of year over year double digit EPS growth. We further stabilized our display technology business and achieved growth in our telecom, specialty materials, and life science businesses. ","Display continues to regain positive momentum. LCD glass price declines were less than in quarter one, and in the range we expected. Looking ahead, we expect Q3 price declines to be in the same moderate range as Q2, and our market share remains stable going forward.","Combined with our new product developments and cost performance, we are delighted with display\u2019s results in 2013, and we are growing our four other businesses. All four provided solid operation results, collectively contributing to sales growth and 40% higher net income on a year over year basis.","In total, with sales and gross margin up and S&A down, we delivered an additional $0.06 of EPS to the bottom line year over year, despite the weaker equity company earnings. This is a significant achievement against our commitment to investors to return the company to earnings growth. ","We believe three consecutive quarters of double digit year over year growth and an outlook for continued year over year earnings growth in quarter three provides solid evidence that our strategy is working. ","Now, before we jump into the details, I\u2019d like to remind you that last quarter we began reporting our results as core earnings in order to exclude non-performance-related items and increase the transparency of the operating results. It excludes two significant items, yen exchange rate fluctuations and the results of the polysilicon segment of Corning\u2019s affiliate Dow Corning Corporation and several other items such as acquisition costs, restructuring charges, and pension adjustments.","We report our results at a constant yen exchange rate of 93. As a reminder, we chose the 93 rate because of the hedging we did that lasts through 2014. To further reduce the impact of yen exchange rate fluctuations, core earnings exclude the impact of translation for the yen to dollar exchange rate and purchase collars, and beginning in quarter two it also excludes the yen-related transactions, specifically yen-denominated transaction hedges.","Removing the impact of these transaction hedges reduces our core EPS by about $0.01 in the first and second quarter of 2013. It also reduces our previous estimate of 2012 core earnings. A new 2012 summary and a 2011 core earnings non-GAAP reconciliation will be available on our website.","Our core earnings are non-GAAP financial measures and of course we continue to report our GAAP results. And please refer to the GAAP reconciliations on our website. Ann Nicholson in investor relations will be available after today\u2019s call to answer any questions you have about the financial reconciliations.","Now I\u2019d like to turn to our quarter two core earnings results. Our second quarter sales were $2 billion, up 11% versus a year ago. Gross margin was 43%, up 2 points year over year and better than our expectations. Specialty materials and telecom had particularly good margin growth versus last year. Gross equity earnings of $173 million were down 18% versus a year ago. As a reminder, the SCP portion of this is at constant yen.","I\u2019m going to provide more color on equity earnings in a few minutes. Our core effective tax rate for Q2 was 16.6%. Core earnings per share were $0.32, up $0.06 over a year ago. Remember core performance reports the results at a constant yen exchange rate of 93. Better operating performance drove the core EPS improvement over analysts\u2019 consensus. EPS as stated here is a non-GAAP measure, and a reconciliation to GAAP can be found on our website. ","Now, versus a year ago, SG&A was down in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales, and [RD&E] spending was also down as a percentage of sales. Now let me go into our detailed quarter two segment results, and I\u2019ll start with display. ","Our view is the overall LCD glass market was up slightly in the quarter. Sequentially, Corning and SCP\u2019s combined volume grew by mid single digits, with volume in the wholly owned display business up mid to high single digits and SCP volume up low single digits.","Overall, our market share remains stable. Core sales for display were $670 million in Q2, an increase of 21% versus last year. Price declines were less than the first quarter in the range we expected. Gross equity earnings, also measured at a constant yen from our display equity affiliates were $117 million in Q2, a decrease of 19% year over year.","For your modeling purposes, display equity affiliates\u2019 second quarter display glass sales in constant yen were about $564 million, a decrease of 12% from last year. As a reminder, this represents display glass sales only. Our public filings will report our display equity affiliates\u2019 total sales, which include other products.","I think it\u2019s important to also call out year over year volumes. SCP volume in Q2 was consistent year over year, reflecting Korean panel makers\u2019 relatively constant utilizations with low capacity additions. Our wholly owned business volume was up more than 40% versus last year, primarily reflecting the strong growth in the Chinese market as well as worldwide large sized television demand.","Display\u2019s core net income was up 11% versus Q2 of 2012. Results reflect increased sales and solid cost reduction efforts over the last year, resulting in consistent percent gross margin. The ability to maintain gross margins through cost reduction is a significant part of display\u2019s plans to reestablish positive momentum.","Now on the supply chain front, we estimate inventories grew to 18 weeks in Q2, up from 17 at the end of Q1. As a reminder, inventory was 18.7 at the end of Q2 last year. We continue to monitor inventory but several factors are at play driving the increase. ","First, we believe the share count inventory floor, or minimum carrying level to [unintelligible] has increased. Screen size proliferation by panel makers has increased the number of models carried at retail and therefore the absolute amount of inventory in the supply chain. We also believe the supply chain may need more inventory for growing emerging markets. I\u2019ll comment more on the supply chain in our outlook section. ","Now turning to telecom, Q2 sales were $601 million, up 8% year over year. The majority of the year over year increase was due to Australia\u2019s NDN project ramp, growth in wireless, and fiber cable and data center projects in China. Those offset the year over year decline we saw in Europe.","Sales beat our expectations, driven by stronger fiber at home projects in North America. Sales grew 28% sequentially, driven by an increase in demand for nearly all products in all regions, particularly North American fiber to the home in Canada and China fiber and cable. An acquisition in Brazil and the consolidation of a previous small equity affiliate also contributed to sequential and year over year growth. ","Telecom\u2019s year over year net income was up 62%. Earnings improvement was driven by the higher volume, as well as cost reductions in manufacturing and SG&A. Quarter two was telecom\u2019s highest sales and net income quarter in more than a decade.","Now, moving to environmental, Q2 sales were down 8% year over year, and actually slightly below our expectations. You will recall that the first half of 2012 heavy duty truck sales were very robust, and we were actually sold out. Since then, the U.S. class A truck demand at retail and build rates have softened. Our heavy duty diesel sales were down versus last year, and were the main driver of the division sales performance.","Light duty substrate sales were up slightly versus Q2 of 2012. We do expect a slight uptick in heavy duty diesel sales in the coming quarters, and I\u2019ll comment more on that in the outlook. Now, despite the environmental year over year sales decline, net income was actually consistent year over year, driven by strong operational execution in the auto business, offsetting the decline in diesel product volumes.","Specialty materials Q2 sales were up 17% sequentially as expected, and Gorilla delivered on its sequential growth target in the quarter. Core net income was up 33%, with significant improvements in Gorilla Glass manufacturing performance versus last year. We are very, very pleased with the improvement in Gorilla gross margins over the last several quarters.","In life sciences, Q2 sales were up 35% year over year, due to the additional sales from the Discovery Labware Acquisition, which closed in October of last year. The acquisition integration is going very smoothly, and is accretive to the segment again this quarter. Year over year core net income more than doubled on these additional sales.","Now moving to Dow Corning, gross equity earnings of silicones were down 19% year over year, down significantly from our original expectations. These earnings were flat with Q1, but we had been looking for improvement. Sales were down year over year, and pricing issues in lower-end silicone products in several geographies emerged during the quarter. I\u2019ll comment more on this in the outlook section.","Although we don\u2019t include Hemlock numbers in our core earnings, Hemlock results actually improved sequentially and year over year. ","Our balance sheet remains very strong. We ended the second quarter with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, with about $1.3 billion of that in the United States. Our net cash position is $2.6 billion. Cap spending was $244 million in the quarter, and we remain on track to spend approximately $1.3 billion in capital this year.","Free cash flow for the quarter was $62 million. As a reminder, free cash flow is actually a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found on our website. ","You may recall in late April we announced an 11% common stock dividend increase and launched our $2 billion stock buyback program. During quarter two, we repurchased $242 million of stock.","Now also during the quarter we entered into some new FX forward contracts to mitigate the potential negative impact of a weakening yen on our results above 93.5. No upfront premium was required for these hedges. These new contracts hedge about 25% of our projected 2015 yen earnings.","Now let me turn to the outlook. In the third quarter, we believe Corning is well-positioned to deliver a fourth consecutive quarter of year over year EPS growth, driven by continued moderate LCD glass price declines and growth in telecom, life sciences, and environmental. This optimism is cautiously tempered by the equity earnings performance at Dow Corning and somewhat at SCP. I\u2019ll speak to each in more detail as I go through the forecast. ","Let me start with display. Our current view of the end market in 2013 is we expect retail, as measured in square feet of glass, to be up mid to high single digits. For reference, 2012, on a similar metric, was 3.5 billion square feet. We have revised our forecast for LCD television units to grow in the mid single digits given continued softness in Europe and Japan.","However, we\u2019re also raising our view of average screen size, driven by large-sized television growth. Through May, worldwide TV sales of televisions 50 inches and larger were up 118%. Therefore, our view of demand for 2013 as measured in square feet remains the same.","As a fun fact to help you understand the dynamic of these larger televisions, a 65-inch television has as much glass as four 32-inch televisions.","We factored into our forecast the conclusion of China energy savings subsidies, although there are, of course, rumors that a more limited subsidy may be introduced this fall. ","Area sell-through in China in the first half was up 30% year over year, and higher than we had thought. Given that, we\u2019re forecasting the second half area growth in China to only be about 5% versus the second half of 2012. ","PC market we expect 10% year over year unit growth, with all of that attributable to tablets. Monitor units are expected to be down about 5%.","Now, in quarter three, as we near the end of July, we see a Q3 LCD glass market consistent to up slightly sequentially. We expect our wholly-owned display business and SCP combined volumes to be consistent to up slightly with the Q2 volumes, and our shares to remain stable.","Q3 is typically when the supply chain expands inventory, as measured in square feet, in preparation for the Q4 holidays. We believe this will happen again in Q3 of 2013, although this may be at a slightly reduced amount given the second half and demand in China, as I just mentioned.","As measured by forward-looking weeks of inventory, we believe inventory will exit Q3 lower than Q2. We estimate LCD glass prices in Q3 will decline at a similar rate to Q2. I think it bears repeating that moderate price declines in Q2, and our expectation that it will continue to moderate in Q3, provide another strong indicator that display is stabilizing.","Now, moving to telecom, we expect Q3 sales to be up about 20% versus Q3 of 2012, driven by strong fiber to the home demand in North America, Australia, and Europe; enterprise growth due to data center projects, particularly in the United States and China; and of course the sales of our recent acquisition in Brazil, in a full quarter of the newly consolidated affiliate.","For the year, we expect sales and earnings growth in telecom driven by fiber to the home and enterprise projects. We expect the China fiber market actually to be flat in 2013, due to large China telecom tenders coming later than originally expected. We expect the worldwide fiber market to be up slightly year over year, driven by emerging markets in India, other Asian economies, and Latin America.","In environmental, we expect Q3 sales to be up slightly versus Q3 of 2012, driven by some recovery in the North American heavy duty diesel market. We believe tighter regulations in Europe and China will lead to growth in demand for heavy duty diesel products as we begin to enter 2014.","For the full year, we believe automobile production will continue to grow, driven by strength in North America and Asia. Specialty material sales are expected to increase sequentially about 10% in Q3, driven by Gorilla Glass. We expect advanced optic sales to be consistent sequentially. The semiconductor industry may be turning cyclically positive coming into the second half, so our advanced optics business could see growth in Q4. ","In Gorilla Glass, our customers are moving to thinner glass, which of course helps our manufacturing costs. This is an important driver of specialty materials net income being up 35% year to date. We expect the trend to thinner Gorilla Glass to continue.","We expect the retail market for cover glass for phones and tablets to be up significantly, around 30% in 2013. Corning will feel less growth, with some work-off of excess inventory from Q4 2012 shipments and also customer yield improvements this year. However, the retail growth, combined with product leadership, leaves us very excited about our opportunities for Gorilla Glass. ","Yesterday we announced our latest Gorilla Glass product, Gorilla Glass NBT, our unique solution for touch-enabled notebooks. A major customer, Dell, will be integrating our glass into their lineup of new products launching this fall. ","Corning Gorilla Glass NBT has 8 to 10 times the scratch resistance of chem-strenghtened soda lime glass, has superior surface strength that allows for thinner designs. At just 1-2% of a device\u2019s retail price, we believe it\u2019s a very cost-effective solution for the protection of thinner, lighter, touch-enabled notebooks. ","We are working with additional customers now and expect to announce additional models in the coming months. We will likely see Gorilla Glass sales for these new products beginning in the second half of this year, and continuing in 2014. We believe the market for touch notebooks could triple from 2013 to 2017, and Corning will have a significant incremental market opportunity as a result of this growth, with our new NBT glass. ","Now, Gorilla Glass NBT is our latest advancement in cover glass technology, and we continue to work on additional innovations. We expect to ship both our antimicrobial and antireflective Gorilla Glass products in the second half of this year.","In life sciences, we expect sales to be up about 40-45% year over year, mainly due to the added sales from our acquisition. ","Now let me turn to Dow Corning. We had told investors in February that Dow Corning expected silicone sales to be up in 2013 and margins to improve. As the year has unfolded, currency, the yen, has created some drag. Volume growth has been okay, especially in what we call the spec-chem portion of Dow Corning silicones, or the higher-margin products, but their key issue is price pressure, especially in low-end silicone products.","The reasons are different in China and Europe, but the pain is the same. Dow Corning is working through this by managing supply and shifting mix while diligently focusing on cost reduction. Dow Corning is resetting its expectations for the year in total for the silicones business and we expect our total equity earnings from Dow Corning\u2019s silicones business to now show only slight improvement year over year.","Dow Corning expects earnings from its silicone segments to either down about 20% year over year, but the drop is more severe sequentially versus Q2, down almost 50%. Part of the more severe sequential drop is driven by cost movements within inventories, which should reverse in Q4. Dow Corning expects Q4 to bounce up, hopefully closer to the Q2 level of earnings. ","Most concerning to us is the level of price competition in lower-end silicones in Europe and China. We think this new Dow Corning information is different enough that I recommend analysts consider adjusting their models for the anticipated silicones impact.","Now let me turn to comment on Hemlock. Last week the Chinese government did announce preliminary significant duties on Hemlock\u2019s poly going into China of 53% in the trade case. This is a preliminary determination and one of many steps in a long path towards a final determination in China. ","While Dow Corning and we are disappointed with this preliminary finding, we\u2019ve known this was a potential scenario for some time. The United States trade representative has confirmed to the media after this preliminary announcement they are in discussions with China regarding the global issues in solar technology, including panels and polysilicone. Dow Corning has been and will remain actively engaged with all appropriate parties to seek a mutually acceptable settlement.","Ultimately, any tariffs on polysilicon or modules would impact market dynamics, but we do not anticipate any immediate impact on Hemlock Semiconductor\u2019s performance. With the potential tariffs looming, Hemlock Semiconductor sales in were already significantly low, and they\u2019ve already adjusted output and staffing to match current demand, enabling Hemlock Semiconductor operate cash flow positive in the second quarter of 2013.","Now let me turn back to the remainder of our Q3 forecast. We expect our core gross margin to be up 1% year over year, driven by manufacturing and increased sales. SG&A and R&D are expected to be down versus last year as a percentage of sales.","Core equity earnings is expected to be down about 25% versus last year, and we expect our core effective tax rate for 2013 to be around 16%. That concludes my opening comments, and I\u2019ll turn it back to you. ","Ann Nicholson","Thank you, Jim. Operator, we\u2019ll now open the lines for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] We\u2019ll go to Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets","Some of the programs you\u2019ve initiated, such as capacity control and the move to thinner glass are helping to improve gross margins. So I\u2019m trying to get a sense of the sustainability of your efforts. Are we at a point of diminishing returns? Or are there further efforts to tactically improve gross margins? And conversely, are we at a point where you\u2019re now getting the premiums or the early signs of premiums, particularly as it relates to Gorilla Glass and the new applications, such as NBT. Maybe if you could help us there, please. ","James Flaws ","Mark, I assume you\u2019re talking about our corporate gross margin. And as you know, that\u2019s always a combination of the mix of our various businesses. But what we like about our business hand right now is gross margins in telecom, specialty materials, life sciences, and environmental are actually improving. The corporate mix will obviously be dependent on the mix of the sales of those businesses, but the fact that all are improving leads me to believe that we have the potential to continue to move our year over year gross margins up.","Obviously the most important thing for us remains display, and we must have moderate price declines. We had good price downward movement in Q2, being less than Q1. We\u2019re expecting Q3 to be in a similar range, but we continue to believe there\u2019s potential for price declines to moderate even further as the quarters unfold.","So I would say we\u2019re not running into diminishing returns in terms of sustaining gross margins. It\u2019s premature for me to talk about the premiums on our new products. ","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets ","Now that we\u2019re almost anniversarying your price change to Corning\u2019s price and the market price, the thought is that the moderate price declines will prevail. How does that occur when you have a competitor that\u2019s still adding capacity? Or is that just very localized, do you feel? And at the same time, as we move towards the back half of the year, are there annual price negotiations that are still variable, or are we at a point where the pricing change that you\u2019ve made is going to be beneficial for the industry going forward?","James Flaws ","Obviously I can\u2019t speak for our competition, but we believe that price declines have moderated for the entire glass industry. And particularly with a benefit to our panel customers from the yen, we believe there\u2019s potential for that to continue. ","In terms of the capacity additions by our competition, we believe only one of our competitors is adding capacity in Korea, and we believe even that is at a very moderate pace. We\u2019ve learned that the capacity there is smaller tanks, so we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll be able to have an industry environment where price declines continue to be at a moderate level.","It\u2019s premature for me to comment on price negotiations and contracts. We\u2019ll give you an update on that in October.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. ","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jim, can you comment on the China deceleration in the back half as it pertains to display? I think you mentioned an area growth of 5% in the second half. What is the underlying unit assumption? And will your glass shipments match that level of growth? Or are inventory levels such that you might be undershipping that level?","James Flaws ","We\u2019re looking for our glass shipments to be consistent to up slightly. So units will be negative in China in Q3, but area will be only slightly negative. We\u2019re looking for area to be up in Q4 in China. And remember, there are Chinese holidays, again, in the later part of the year.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And a quick follow up. On specialty materials, it looks like the revenue outlook was a little softer than most expected. Can you address if it\u2019s an inventory correction related issue? Or is it weaker demand given the deceleration in tablets and to some extent in smartphones? And any update you might have for us on auto?","James Flaws ","On auto, I don\u2019t have any update for Gorilla at this stage. Relative to Gorilla for consumer electronics, we have been working hard on modeling the supply chain, and we believe that there was excess inventory built up by a number of customers from the fourth quarter. And that\u2019s being worked off this year. And then the second thing, of course, is that we have seen yield improvements in the supply chain over the course of the year. So those two things have been maybe reflected in what you perceive as the softer demand for Gorilla.","If you take those out, looking at the amount of Gorilla being pulled from the supply chain to go into phones and tablets going to retail, we think it\u2019s growing nicely. Obviously it always depends somewhat on model launches in the phone business, but that\u2019s what\u2019s affecting it. But really we did have some excess inventory carried over this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is open. ","Rod Hall - JPMorgan ","You just commented on the Chinese subsidy. You expect it may come back down again at the end of the year. Are you assuming that subsidy reduces in your guidance for Q3? Or are you assuming it\u2019s static in Q3, and then we\u2019ll wait and see what happens and decide how to guide for Q4? That\u2019s my first question.","And then the other thing is I know you normally don\u2019t like to comment too much on capacity utilization, but it feels like utilization for glass capacity is getting relatively high, and I wonder if you could just comment on that, give us any color, on what you think capacity utilization looks like. ","And then also, for panel, just where are we with capacity utilization and where you think we\u2019ll be as we get into the seasonally high month here heading into the back end of the year? ","James Flaws ","That\u2019s a lot of questions. On our assumption on China demand, we\u2019re assuming the subsidy has gone off. We\u2019re not including anything coming back in our outlook for the remainder of the year. All we\u2019ve heard is some rumors that there may be a new subsidy in the fourth quarter, but that\u2019s not in our demand at this point in time.","Relative to capacity utilization, our wholly-owned display business is relatively full. We\u2019re delighted by that, as you saw the very strong shipments in quarter two. Gorilla, because of the inventory work off, is not as full right now. We have significant capacity still offline at SCP. ","Panel capacity, we think there\u2019s adequate panel capacity to meet what we see as retail demand.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Newton of Stifel. Your line is open. ","Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus ","I wanted to dive a little bit into display inventory levels. You seem relatively comfortable with the 18 weeks of inventory level, but I\u2019m curious, if we go by geography, are there any areas where inventories were more elevated or lean? And specifically focusing on China, given your expectation of lack of subsidies in the second half? And then do you have any concerns on inventory levels in tablets and smartphones relative to TVs?","James Flaws ","I don\u2019t have any detailed information on tablets\/smartphone inventory. On display inventories, I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as relatively comfortable. I\u2019m always nervous when inventories get to an 18-week level. We have done a lot of work on trying to figure out is the items that I talked about with the more sizes really having an influence? We have some positive information that says that has been contributing, but I remain nervous about the 18 weeks.","I don\u2019t have a lot of geographic information. The only thing that I\u2019ll comment on is that we believe that there has been an excess of 32-inch televisions built in China. And that\u2019s the only place that I\u2019m aware of where there\u2019s a potentially significant problem, that\u2019s localized.","Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus ","And then I guess as a follow up, on the Gorilla Glass outlook, I\u2019m trying to understand. You did make the comment that touch could be shipping, specifically the Gorilla Glass MBT, in the second half of \u201813. I was wondering if that is baked at all into your guidance for Q3. ","And then the comments that you made about cover glass for phones and tablets increasing about 30% year over year, but you have yield improvements and inventory heading into the year. I\u2019m trying to circle that back to your previous guidance, I think, that Gorilla Glass would grow double digits year over year. Could you help us perhaps narrow that range between double digits and 30%? ","James Flaws ","","I guess I would say that when we look at the amount of inventory and the amount of yield issues, that have occurred for this year, that we would have thought that the demand for Gorilla on us would be greater. And when we adjust for those two things, we would say that there definitely is greater than 30% growth, but those two items have harmed us, if you do a comparison year over year.","Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus ","But still a double digit expectation for Gorilla Glass? Growth year over year? ","James Flaws ","Yes.","Patrick Newton - Stifel Nicolaus ","Okay. And then, I\u2019m sorry, in the touch notebooks, that all baked into Gorilla Glass for Q3?","James Flaws ","Yes, but very small levels. We\u2019re still unsure about how fast the consumer acceptance will come on touch notebooks. I was delighted to see in the Best Buy circular last week quite a few advertised, but we put in a fairly low level right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox - Cross Research","One clarification and then one question on LCD glass. Just on the guidance you provided, you referenced year over year comparisons versus gross margins and expenses. Is that versus the restatements already provided, $0.29 and the 44% gross margins? Or is there something else that has to be restated out of that, as you also mentioned? ","And then secondly, just on the LCD glass, the two big dynamics seem to be China and average screen size increasing. Is there any sense for how much the China subsidies helped in terms of that 40% growth in the first half? ","And then in terms of average screen size increasing, you seem to be implying an acceleration in average screen size, even versus what you talked about at the analyst meeting. Any more color around how that\u2019s helping, maybe in the second half of the year? ","James Flaws ","The screen size thing is becoming increasingly important. We really started seeing this large size impact start last year. We were uncertain whether it would continue to grow this year, but it definitely is, and seems to be accelerating. So you\u2019re right about that.","I think all of my statements on gross margin relate to our restated results from the prior year, and as I mentioned on our website we\u2019ve done some updates on that, and many analysts asked us to do 2011 also. So we\u2019re putting that on our website too.","Steven Fox - Cross Research ","And then just in terms of China, how much do you think the subsidies helped in the first half?","James Flaws ","I don\u2019t have a detailed number right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian White from Topeka. Your line is open.","Brian White - Topeka ","When we think about Gorilla Glass on the notebook, I just want to be clear, are most of these wins primarily coming at the screen level? Or are you also providing Gorilla Glass for the back casing and the keyboard?","James Flaws ","That\u2019s a level of detail I just don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry.","Brian White - Topeka ","And when we think about this ramp, you said obviously you have Dell, about how many other customers do you have? And is this more of a fourth quarter ramp? Or it really does start in earnest in the third quarter?","James Flaws ","It starts in the third quarter, in earnest. I don\u2019t have a list of the number of customers, but we think our market share on touch on notebooks has been climbing. Initially, our competition is really soda lime, for cost reasons. And we believe our market share on touch notebook wins is climbing every quarter. So we\u2019re quite pleased by that. But we begin shipments in earnest this quarter. ","Again, as I mentioned in reply to an earlier questioner, what we\u2019re just uncertain about is how well these notebooks will do at retail. Obviously pretty weak PC market. But definitely in terms of the models that will be out there, we\u2019re increasing our market share.","Brian White - Topeka ","So if I have a $500 notebook, this is a $50-100 price for the consumer? One to two percent is the cost of the Gorilla Glass.","James Flaws ","No, 1-2% is like $5-10.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Jim Suva - Citigroup ","It sounds like you\u2019re indeed building in a no return of the China subsidy into your outlook, which I think is a positive. Under the premise of if the China subsidy were to come back, do you have the capacity to ramp production? And if so, what\u2019s a typical lead time for you to pour the glass, get it into the channel, and for it to make it onto the shelves for selling to the local Chinese citizen, if the subsidy were to return?","James Flaws ","We do have capacity, and the lead time is relatively short, as we are in Asia, and it\u2019s pretty easy for do that. So I would say definitely two months or less we can have capacity there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amitabh Passi with UBS. Your line is open.","Amitabh Passi - UBS ","I was wondering if you could comment on LCD demand trends in some of the other geographies, particularly Europe and North America.","James Flaws ","North America has been good, driven by sizes, for the most part. Europe has been weak. Japan has fallen to a pretty low level. We think actually Japan television will probably be flat for the year now that we\u2019ve anniversaried that. These are in terms of units. We\u2019re seeing good growth in the other Asian markets in Latin America and the Middle East in terms of units.","Amitabh Passi - UBS ","I\u2019m curious relative to expectations, are these geographies generally in line? Weaker? Better?","James Flaws ","I\u2019d say Europe is weaker. Most of the rest are in line in terms of units. And then size is ahead of our expectations.","Amitabh Passi - UBS ","And then just based on the stock buyback you did in the quarter, I would have expected a larger decrease in the share count. Should we expect some of that to show up in Q3, or were there some offsets?","James Flaws ","Well, remember the stock buyback didn\u2019t start until later in the quarter. We didn\u2019t make the announcement until the end of at least one month had gone by.","Amitabh Passi - UBS ","Okay, so we should expect some of that to show up in the share count in Q3?","James Flaws ","Yes.","Amitabh Passi - UBS ","And then just any help you can give us in terms of your appetite to sustain buyback for these levels of how you\u2019re thinking about just capital allocation?","James Flaws ","Well, we have a $2 billion program authorized by the board, and we expect to continue to buy back in Q3 probably similar to slightly higher levels maybe.","Amitabh Passi - UBS ","And fiber to the home, you talked about strength in North America. Just wondering where you\u2019re seeing that. Is it with the tier ones, or some of the small operators? Any [insight into that] would be helpful.","James Flaws ","That strength was mostly Canada.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Wolf with Barclays. Your line is open. ","Joseph Wolf - Barclays","I wanted to come back to the inventory and the work that you\u2019ve done on the global side, and the differences between China and the rest of the world, and where you are in terms of reading that, and how we can think about that going forward in terms of maybe even not talking about price declines moderating, but prices starting to stabilize and maybe improve.","James Flaws ","I\u2019m not sure I follow your question. Are you asking about inventory in the supply chain regionally?","Joseph Wolf - Barclays ","Regionally and how that fits into, I guess you talked about a very strong demand in China and Korea kind of being consistent. So if there\u2019s a global element to that inventory, and whether that will impact any pricing in 2014.","James Flaws ","As of right now, I don\u2019t have a reason to believe that we won\u2019t stay on this moderate price decline that we experienced for these quarters. There\u2019s nothing that we\u2019re seeing right now in terms of the level of inventory. I don\u2019t have a lot of details, as I mentioned in response to an earlier question, about where the inventory is. I did mention that in China there seems to be an excess of small sized televisions, 32s, but beyond that I don\u2019t have a lot of detail.","I think the worry that you\u2019re probably touching on is if there\u2019s a sudden inventory correction, then that could impact on pricing. But right now we\u2019re not feeling that. Our order rate in July and our order rate for August has remained quite strong.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs "," ","I just had a question on display, and then a couple of followups on Gorilla. On display, you had ended Q1 with what you considered tight internal inventories and were air shipping some product. Is that still going on? Or do you feel like you\u2019ve caught up now in terms of your own inventories and production? ","And also, did you convert any additional tanks to Gorilla in the second quarter? Or are you putting that on hold for now given the situation in Gorilla you talked about? ","James Flaws ","We\u2019re not converting more tanks to Gorilla right now, as the supply chain works off some of the inventory. In terms of our own inventories, we actually remain tight. We did air ship in Q2. We hope to not air ship in Q3, but we\u2019re still tight. We wouldn\u2019t mind having more display inventory.","Corporately, on inventories, we have built inventory. The build is the largest in telecom, where we built over $100 million inventory. And we have built some Gorilla inventory.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs ","And then on Gorilla, where you talked about the perceived softness there in the guidance. You commented on thin glass. Is that impacting the revenue growth levels in Gorilla, in particular if that\u2019s causing you to get a lower ASP per square area? ","And then I also wanted to get an update on your expectations for 3D glass, if that\u2019s something that is going to ship this year, and is going to be a meaningful contributor. ","And then lastly, it seems that Asahi\u2019s Dragontrail is gaining some traction in the market and is starting to get used as a second source. Is that impacting your Gorilla expectations?","James Flaws ","I don\u2019t think Dragontrail is really impacting our expectations. Clearly we don\u2019t have quite as strong a share as what we had originally, but it\u2019s still extraordinarily high.","I don\u2019t have an update on 3D, so I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not current on whether we\u2019re going to ship anything this year or not. I know the program is continuing to move ahead.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs ","And the thin glass in Gorilla?","James Flaws ","Thin glass in Gorilla, it\u2019s primarily an impact on our cost.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs ","Okay, so it doesn\u2019t change the ASP per square area?","James Flaws ","Its primary impact is on our cost.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley ","Quickly start on telecom. You mentioned an affiliate that you brought in house. Can you just give us a sense as to what it was, how large it was, and how much that impacted the numbers? And then you also mentioned in telecom that there were some delays in China and some large fiber deals. Do you have any color on what caused those delays? Was it the change in management that happened in a couple of Chinese carriers? And how far out did this get pushed? And I have some questions on LCD and Gorilla.","James Flaws ","The small company was a previous joint venture that our Corning Cable Systems unit had. Its impact was about $5 million in Q2, and I think it will be almost $10 million in Q3 in terms of consolidated sales. It\u2019s really relatively tiny.","The telecom tenders, we were expecting tenders to happen earlier. I can\u2019t tell you why they don\u2019t. You probably heard me say in the past that we believe all of the telecom business in China is ultimately controlled by government policy. So whether it was the management changes or not, I can\u2019t know for sure. ","But definitely tenders that we expected earlier have not happened yet. There is a tendering process right now. What we just don\u2019t know is when it will be complete, and how much the volume will be. But definitely against our original expectations for China, this has been a slow down. ","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley ","On LCD, obviously screen sizes have been growing for the last almost 18 months or so. To what extent do you think the significant fall-offs in glass pricing that we\u2019ve seen over the last 18, 24 months, how much do you think that has contributed to people just buying larger TVs because the price points have come down, primarily because glass pricing has come down. ","And we\u2019re now, in 2013, in an era of moderate price declines as we get into 2014 and beyond, do you think that maybe we\u2019ll see an end to the larger screen sizes? You see what I\u2019m saying? Maybe the larger sizes will link to the lower prices? When you [unintelligible] lower prices, you [unintelligible] larger screen sizes a little later too? ","James Flaws ","I don\u2019t think the glass price declines have been the primary reason why pricing at retail has gone down. Obviously it contributed and for panel makers, also the fact that the yen has helped them on their profitability has gone up. I just think that the price points and the quality of televisions are so incredible that it\u2019s hard to imagine people buying a small television now. ","I got up early this morning and read a whole bunch of retail television ads for the past month, and I just remain stunned by how low the price points are. So I\u2019m not expecting price points to go back up on large televisions next year, and I think we\u2019ll begin to see sometime next year 2k\/4k showing up. Obviously that would be more expensive initially, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any going back on this size phenomenon. ","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley ","Okay. So I don\u2019t think prices will go up, I\u2019m just wondering what you thought about the glass prices going down impacting the total price of retail. On the Gorilla side, you mentioned Dell. You said that there were other OEMs coming out as well, but are we to assume that Dell is the only one that really will be using Gorilla in any type of volume in 2013, and the rest of them are out in 2014? ","And then you had a previous comment, on the last conference call, previously, before that, that you expected, I believe, 10% of notebooks and laptops to be either touch or have cover glass. I was wondering what your current expectations are. Is it still in line with the 10%, and is that in line with the guidance now for Gorilla and specialty materials? ","James Flaws ","The guidance for the year was around 10. It will be higher in the fourth quarter. I won\u2019t comment on customers. Dell\u2019s the one that announced with us yesterday, but we expect to be on a number of notebook manufacturers.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley ","In 2013?","James Flaws ","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. ","Jagadish Iyer - Piper Jaffray","Two questions, Jim. I just want to understand, you said you don\u2019t have any updates on the automotive segment. I just wanted to find out what is the gating item there in terms of the adoption of these specialty glasses for the [unintelligible] applications. And then I have a follow up.","James Flaws ","Well, it\u2019s always hard to get your first customer. You know, we had hopes that we would get on a certain model. That has not turned out right now. But we\u2019re still trying very hard. But this is a fairly revolutionary new product for the automotive industry, and it\u2019s always hard to win your first one. So beyond that, I can\u2019t say. I mean, we haven\u2019t stopped trying.","Jagadish Iyer - Piper Jaffray ","Would we have any timeline when we could potentially hear? Is it probably later this year, or maybe next year?","James Flaws ","I don\u2019t have a new timeline. I actually thought I would be already announcing. So we\u2019re a little disappointed by that.","Jagadish Iyer - Piper Jaffray ","When do you think you\u2019ll have some meaningful uptick of the Willow Glass in terms of you\u2019re actively engaged with customers? When do you think we can expect to hear more on the traction on Willow Glass?","James Flaws ","I think we\u2019ll talk more about Willow in the October conference call. Okay, so we\u2019ll wrap up here. I just have a couple of investor relations comments. First, in case you missed our announcement in June, we did officially appoint Ann Nicholson division VP, and she\u2019ll be leading our investor relations function. We\u2019re delighted to recognize Ann\u2019s performance with this promotion.","Our second announcement is we will be speaking at the Citi technology conference on September 4 in New York City. ","I\u2019d like to summarize a few highlights of the call. First, we\u2019ve made great progress on our plan to stabilize display and then return to positive momentum in this segment. ","Second, we\u2019re executing our goal to grow earnings in our other businesses. In addition to volume growth, strong operational execution and cost reduction efforts have been a significant driver of profitably improvements.","We grew our core earnings per share year over year by double digits for the last three quarters. We think this is strong evidence we\u2019re marching up.","Fourth, Dow Corning silicones are not improving year over year, and that\u2019s a big disappointment to us.","And finally, as we look forward to Q3, we\u2019re confident that we will have our fourth consecutive quarter of year over year core earnings growth, despite the weak Dow Corning outlook. It will be driven by moderate glass declines in LCD, and growth in telecom, life sciences, and environmental.","Ann?","Ann Nicholson","Thank you, Jim, and thank you all for joining us today.

It will also be available on our website for downloading.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Wendell.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Thank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. This morning we reported second quarter results that exceeded our expectations. Sales were up 6% and EPS was up 14% over last year, with strong sales growth continuing in Optical Communications and Specialty Materials. Our Display business performed in line with our expectations, including price declines that continued to moderate.","We remain on track to deliver our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework goals due to strong operating results and solid progress on innovation. We believe that the strategic and financial benefits of our Framework are becoming even more apparent during its second year. The Framework outlines our leadership priorities and is designed to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength.","As we have discussed, we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion in cash through 2019. We plan to return more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends, and we will invest $10 billion to sustain our leadership and deliver growth. We have made great progress against those goals. Since October of 2015, our cash generation is on target and we have returned $7.4 billion in share repurchases and dividends. Through our repurchases, we have reduced our outstanding shares by approximately 26%. We increased the dividend 14.8% in February and 12.5% last year, for a combined increase of 29%. We expect to increase the dividend by at least 10% in 2018 and in 2019.","In addition to articulating our capital allocation goals, our Framework outlines how we have and will continue to utilize our focused and cohesive portfolio to generate value for our shareholders and to delight our customers. We are best in the world in three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market access platforms. We focus 80% of our resources on opportunities that use capabilities in at least two of these three categories.","We are investing in research and development, capital expansion and acquisitions to advance our innovation initiatives, strengthen our product leadership and low cost positions, and ultimately outperform our competitors. By pursuing our focused strategy, we believe our likelihood of success increases, our cost of innovation decreases, and we create higher and more sustainable competitive barriers.","Our focus in leadership also attract some of the world's leading companies to collaborate with Corning because they know how our expertise and unique combination of capabilities can help address some of their toughest challenges.","During the first quarter earnings call in April, I discussed how our joint announcement with Verizon illustrates the power of our Optical Communications market access platform. Verizon's commitment to our optical solutions is one outcome of the deep dialogue we are having with major telecom players across the globe. They are anticipating transformations in communications, education, healthcare, transportation and eventually the way we all live, and they are turning to Corning for our unique co-innovation approach.","Since then, Apple joined us to announce its $200 million investment in our advance glass manufacturing capabilities in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. Apple's commitment for future innovations illustrates the leadership of our mobile consumer electronics platform. Today, I would like to focus on how our cohesive set of capabilities is attracting leading pharmaceutical and biotech companies to seek our help to transform pharmaceutical packaging.","We work closely with our development partners who are also long-standing customers of our life science vessels platform. As a senior scientist at one of these partners remarked, Corning took a macroscopic set of problems, followed them to their root cause, dissected each cause to its science and rebuilt a solution at the molecular level on up to create a totally redesigned pharmaceutical package.","This remarkable product, Corning Valor Glass packaging dramatically reduces particle contamination, breaks and cracks, while significantly increasing throughput. As a result, Valor helps protect patients and improve pharmaceutical manufacturing. In March of 2011, the FDA issued an advisory on glass lamellae or the tiny flakes of glass that can be shed from the inside of the container, contaminating the product. This is just one of the many issues Valor addresses. Consequently, there is significant excitement in the industry.","Now, our customers' endorsements are far more powerful than my words. When announcing Valor at the White House last week, Merck's CEO, Ken Frazier, said biologic medicines and vaccines remain on the leading edge of scientific innovation, and Valor Glass represents a similar advancement in materials science, a glass that is purpose-built for medicines and vaccines. Merck plans to convert several injectable products to this exceptional new glass packaging solution, pending appropriate regulatory approvals.","And Pfizer's CEO, Ian Read, stated we believe that our collaboration with Corning is a game-changer. The glass industry represents about $4 billion in expenditures for the pharmaceutical industry. But subsequent issues, potential shards or breakages require strong quality control to ensure that it doesn't get through to patients. The subsequent costs are multiples of the glass cost, to ensure that we deliver a high-quality product to patients. So Valor is a major innovation, a major way that we can be more competitive.","This strong pull from our customers led us to announce an initial investment of $0.5 billion. Total investments over time could reach $4 billion, in sync with global demand and customer commitments for additional sales. Planned investments are included in our Strategy and","Capital Allocation Framework.","We ultimately expect about $1 of annual sales for every $1 of investment and profitability that exceeds our corporate average. Now, you've heard me say before that the timing and revenues of disruptive innovation are difficult to predict. This is especially true in highly regulated industries, such as drug packaging. The good news is that the regulatory environment derisks our investment by providing clear advance notice of demand and by creating stable sales that recur over many, many years.","In sum, we are extremely excited about this opportunity. You can watch for customer and regulatory announcements as proof points to mark our progress. Valor also provides a powerful example of what happens when our focused and cohesive portfolio meets a customer opportunity. We started out with major customers from our life science vessels platform. We reapplied our expertise in glass science, optical physics, vapor deposition, precision forming and extrusion to develop a breakthrough product that we believe has the potential to power Corning's growth for the next decade and beyond.","Stepping back, the announcements with Verizon, Apple, Merck and Pfizer show how global leaders are attracted to participate deeply in our ecosystem, and inviting us to participate in theirs. We think this indicates that we're on the right track and bodes well for our future growth.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tony for a review of our results and details on our outlook for 2017.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. As we noted in today's release, our second quarter core results reflect strong year-over-year improvement that exceeded what we expected, and we are very pleased with our operating performance. We remain on track to deliver both the full-year business objectives that we laid out in January, and our overall framework goals.","Now before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to address GAAP and its impact on our hedge contract accounting. GAAP accounting requires our earnings translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be marked to market and recorded at their current value at the end of each quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter.","During the second quarter, the yen weakened, increasing the value of our hedge contracts. This resulted in an after-tax GAAP gain of $94 million when we marked the contracts to market as required by GAAP.","To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. We remain very pleased with the results of our hedging program and the economic certainty it delivers. Since its inception, we have received cash totaling $1.5 billion under our hedge contracts. These proceeds offset much of the yen-related fluctuations in Display's earnings.","Hedging our earnings and cash flows through 2022 substantially mitigates risk from a weakening yen. For investors who have additional questions on the mechanics of these contracts, please refer to the tutorial on FX hedge accounting on the Digital Media Disclosures section of our Investor Relations website. And as always, Ann and her team are available after the call. Also as a reminder, last year's GAAP net income included a $2.7 billion non-taxable gain on the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning.","Now, let's turn to the core results. Second quarter sales rose 6% year-over-year. Core earnings were $431 million, consistent year-over-year. On an apples-to-apples comparison that excludes silicones' equity earnings from the second quarter of 2016, core earnings grew 12% year-over-year. Second quarter EPS was $0.42, up 14%.","Second quarter sales reflected strong growth in Optical Communications on healthy demand in the fiber-to-the-home market. Strong growth in Specialty Materials with continued strength in Gorilla Glass volume and LCD glass volume growth with continued moderate pricing declines. Gross margin of 42.4% was in line with our expectations and consistent with Q1. SG&A was 14% of sales at $358 million, and RD&E was 8% of sales at $207 million.","Total gross equity earnings were $38 million, largely from Hemlock Semiconductors, which exceeded expectations predominantly because of the timing of Hemlock sales between the second and third quarter. We are changing our view that full year gross equity earnings should be about $150 million.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 18%.","Turning briefly to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $4.2 billion of cash, approximately 25% of which is in the U.S. Adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter was $479 million and keeps us on track to meet the goals of our four-year capital allocation plan.","Now let's look at the detailed segment results and outlook, beginning with Display Technologies. The second quarter display market and our results met expectations. Sales were $841 million and core earnings were $240 million. Volume and pricing were in line with expectations. The glass market and our volume were up low-single digit sequentially. Sequential LCD glass price declined moderately. And as we expected, the decline in this quarter was substantially less than the first quarter.","We continue to expect that the full-year 2017 retail market, as measured in square feet of glass, will be up mid-single digits, driven by demand for larger screen size TVs. For the year, we expect our glass demand will be up mid-single digits, in line with the overall market. We continue to see progress towards a more moderate pricing environment. Our price declines in 2015 were smaller than in 2014, and in 2016, they were smaller still. We expect this pattern to continue with our glass prices declining 10% or less this year.","Now, three factors drive our view of the more favorable pricing. First, global glass supply and demand remain balanced. We are successfully aligning our capacity to our demand. Publicly available information indicates competitors are doing the same. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. Therefore, we expect their price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable. And third, LCD glass manufacturing requires ongoing investments in current and new capacity. To generate acceptable returns on new investments, glass pricing will need to moderate even further.","For the third quarter, we expect the LCD glass market and Corning volume to be up low-single digits. Sequential price declines should be moderate and similar to the second quarter sequential declines.","Looking into the supply chain, panel makers and total supply chain inventories expanded slightly at the end of Q2 as we expected. Total supply chain inventory should continue to expand in Q3 in preparation for a seasonally-strong fourth quarter retail demand, which we anticipate will then draw inventory down. Year-end inventory will depend on Q4 sell-through and we continue to expect total supply chain inventory at the end of 2017 will be in a healthy range. In summary, we remain very pleased with the current dynamics in our Display business and our progress in stabilizing returns.","Let's move to Optical Communications where the second quarter results were strong, with sales up 13% and core earnings up 26%. The growth was primarily driven by the North America fiber-to-the-home market. Throughout this year, we have been saying we expect low-teen sales growth for 2017. In line with this, we expect third quarter sales to be up more than 10%.","Now, given the strong momentum in the first half, Optical sales have the potential to be up mid-teens for the full year like many sell-side analysts are modeling. That said, we are always cautious about our guidance to you because sales are driven by large civil works projects that are subject to delays that can lead to quarterly volatility. This introduces a measure of conservatism and leads to our guidance.","The good news is, we continue to see major carriers shifting more spending towards optical solutions. This is a long-term positive for Corning and transcends fluctuations in individual quarters. This is an exciting time for our Optical business. Overall, we expect to grow significantly faster than the optical markets we serve, and we enable next \u2013 as we enable next-generation networks and our customers benefit from our unique set of capability. We are on track to achieve our goal for Optical Communications of $5 billion in annual sales by 2020.","Now, while the vast majority of this growth is expected to come from organic initiatives, we also plan to acquire or gain strategic advantages by strengthening our portfolio or increasing our market access. We are excited about last week's announcements that we acquired SpiderCloud which will help us accelerate the deployment of fiber inside buildings.","Turning to our Environmental business, second quarter sales were $263 million, up slightly year-over-year. Core earnings were $32 million, down year-over-year due to investments for the development and introduction of our new gas particulate filter. Second quarter year-over-year automotive sales rose on worldwide growth in the automotive market and additional business wins that allow us to grow faster than the market. In addition, the North America heavy-duty diesel market appears to be stabilizing. Our total diesel sales were flat sequentially.","As we previously noted, we're leveraging our position in mobile emissions controls by building a significant new business for gas particulate filters, or GPFs. Evidence strongly suggest that having a GPF is the most effective way for automakers to meet new environmental regulations in Europe and China. We continue to win the majority of platforms and have agreements for more than 50 models from 20 automakers, with new wins in the past month and more to come.","Our GPF platform wins require select capacity and engineering investments. In the near term, you will see both cost on the P&L and capital expenditures. We will see our first commercial sales in the third quarter. We're excited because our sales per vehicle increased by a factor of 3 times to 4 times, with profitability similar to our current Environmental business.","Once regulations are fully implemented in Europe and China in the early 2020s, we estimate this opportunity will exceed $0.5 billion for Corning. In total, for the third quarter, we expect low-single digit sales growth. For 2017 overall, we expect sales to be consistent to up slightly from 2016.","Let's move to Specialty Materials where our goal is to double sales for mobile consumer electronics despite maturing smartphone unit growth. Second quarter sales rose 27% over last year and core earnings were up 21% year-over-year, both ahead of our expectations, driven by stronger Gorilla Glass shipments to support new product launches.","We had record shipments of Gorilla Glass and expect strong demand to continue for the remainder of the year. Now, we made progress on all three of our approaches to grow sales. In particular, we again saw the benefit of Gorilla Glass 5 which leads the market for drop performance and is now on 22 devices. Also, we continue to see strong adoption of Gorilla Glass on devices being introduced in developing markets, with brands such as Micromax of India. We also had growth on other major programs to increase sales per device.","Overall, our growth prospects remain strong in mobile consumer electronics. Our innovative products provide added value for consumers, particularly in terms of durability and create new opportunities for us to increase sales. We expect sales growth in the third quarter to be up in the low to mid-teens year-over-year.","Exactly how much growth we will see for the full year continues to be dependent on the timing and extent of customers deploying Gorilla Glass 5 and other Corning innovations. Through the first half, sales are up 29%, so we are clearly pleased with the adoption so far this year.","In Life Sciences, second quarter sales were $221 million and core earnings were $19 million. For the full year 2017 and the third quarter, we continue to expect low-single digit sales growth year-over-year. Also, we've had a number of investors ask if our new pharmaceutical packaging business will be included with the Life Sciences business in our financial results or remain in our Other reporting segment. For now, it will remain in Other along with other new product line in development projects. We group our emerging opportunities in Other to better manage their goals and objectives independent from a fully commercialized business.","Shifting to the full company P&L, for the third quarter, we expect our gross margin as a percent of sales to remain in line with the first half of this year at about 42.5%. SG&A and RD&E spending should be approximately 14% and 8% of sales, respectively. We expect other income, other expense to be a net expense of approximately $25 million to $35 million.","Third quarter total gross equity earnings are expected to be approximately $10 million to $20 million due to the timing of Hemlock's Q2 earnings that I mentioned earlier. We continue to believe full year gross equity earnings will be approximately $150 million, predominantly from Hemlock. And we expect our effective tax rate for the third quarter and full year 2017 to be approximately 18%, and CapEx for the year to be approximately $1.5 billion.","Finally, let me update you on our plan to return at least $12.5 billion to shareholders under our framework. Through the end of the second quarter, we have returned $7.4 billion. In the second quarter, we returned $780 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $1.3 billion. As you may recall, in February, the board increased the cash dividends per share by 14.8%.","Let me close by saying that we are very pleased with our continued positive momentum. We remain on track to deliver our 2017 objectives and the overall goals of our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework. We feel very good about the rich set of opportunities ahead of us.","With that, let's move to Q&A.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Corning, Inc.","Thanks, Tony. Cynthia, you can start the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question will come from the line of Joseph Wolf with Barclays. Your line is open.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. A question on the partnerships that you were describing. With the Apple one, it seems like there was an investment from the company of $200 million. It wasn't clear to me from the Life Sciences whether Merck and Pfizer contributed to this initial work or if that was all current Corning dollars? And I'm just wondering how that progresses.","And then you also mentioned we should be watching with that $1 in sales per $1 of investment milestones about announcements. But I expect that those are not going to come for a couple of years. Is there anything else we should be looking at in terms of a decision-making process in terms of milestones for the incremental opportunity? And then finally, just to add on to this long question, is this opportunity even bigger than the Gorilla Glass for auto, internal and external?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Thank you, Joseph. Let's try to take them in order. The development partners did contribute to some of the development expense that is related to creation of this product. This is a significant development effort for us and a significant development effort for them. So they were a critical part of getting us to the announcement the other day.","That being said, their major contribution is to adopt our product over time across their product lines. As you noted, with something as significant as new pharmaceutical packaging, what the pharmaceutical companies need to do is, because it's existing marketed product already, is take and show that new product in the new package to the FDA. And when they do that, it's got to be already based on them having done stability testing, machine ability and a number of things. This means it will take a while for the revenue of this business to ramp.","That being said, there are actually a number of other milestones you'll be able to see. You will be able to see some of the FDA submissions as they go in. You will hear from other customers as they take our product for different ones of their products. So I think we're going to be able to really clearly set out a map for you. And as we start to build out this business, it will become pretty clear sort of how large a breakout it will become.","I think your last question, which was dealing with how large is this opportunity, and you used as an example comparing to our Gorilla Glass for automotive. I think there is no question that the size of this opportunity is larger. The key here is how much of a breakout does it become. If truly this product picks up very strong regulatory support and we also, if our data that we've gathered so far with our development partners holds true on its tremendous benefits, patients, as well as increased throughput for pharmaceutical companies, this is going to be a very, very large business. It is going to grow for decades, and that's why we've been pursuing it so strongly. But that being said, last week was our breakthrough moment. We have a lot of work ahead of us for it to turn into the size of breakout that I just described.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Just one quick follow-on, and, Tony, you talked about this a little bit. But if we look at the strong performance in Gorilla Glass, and you look at the guidance for the rest of the year and even into 2018, can you give us any more color on what the SKU is in terms of that growth? Whether it's the units which seem kind of to be kind of flat? Is it just pricing being stronger on the Gorilla Glass 5? Or is it the more glass per phone option in that?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Well, certainly the more glass per phone is pretty significant, and as you know, we talked about in the last quarter several devices that have put glass on the back of a phone, including the Samsung Galaxy X8 (sic) [S8]. And so that is a significant part of the growth that we have year-over-year.","Now the adoption of the Gorilla Glass 5 is also a significant part because as we've talked in the past, that creates real value for our customers and we're able to charge a higher price for that. So it's a combination of all these items. The overall underlying market, as we said, is relatively flat and consistent, and our ability to grow really has to do with our innovations.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question for me, recently there's been sort of a blip-down in LCD panel prices for large sizes. And I know, Tony, you just mentioned that you're pretty comfortable with where inventories are right now. I was wondering if you could just sort of react to that near-term trend and what you make of it and what you think the risks are relative to the outlook you've provided just for LCD glass. And then I had a follow-up.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Sure. It's true that panel prices have started to decline on a sequential basis in the last quarter. They're still really close to record highs. I think it's important to remember they've risen significantly every quarter since Q2 of 2016. And this has resulted in both record panel maker profitability and we believe that prices have room to move down to more sustainable levels. So this should enable lower set prices to stimulate some second half demand. I think it's important from a supply chain standpoint to remember that in 2017, panel maker capacity does not grow significantly.","So our panel makers have to run at high utilizations to build inventory for Q4 selling season, and we saw that happen in Q2 just as we expected, and in Q3 set maker demand is strong and set makers will be building inventory for that seasonally strong Q4 demand, and we anticipate that's going to draw down inventory. So when we look at this from an overall standpoint, we think the 2017 is going to end in a healthy range.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Great. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. Wendell, I was wondering, you mentioned the AT&T (sic) [Verizon] agreement is probably not going to be unique within the industry. I'm sure you can't talk about specific timing, but I'm wondering if there's any other near-term drivers that maybe could lead to other announcements, say, before the end of the year? Or are we thinking this is more something to watch out for \u2013 as you get into next year and year after? Thanks.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","So, I believe when you say AT&T, you mean Verizon.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Oh, I'm sorry, Verizon.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","That's no problem. So, the Verizon agreement is not unique among the deep conversations we are having around the globe with telecom players. Whether or not we will announce those or not deals more with our customers' preference. In Verizon's case, they felt that it was so strategic to their densification plans; they wanted to do it for their own purposes. And for us, we put our customers' needs first. Some will probably want to be public, some will probably not want to be public, and that's how we'll make a decision around announcements.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just very quickly, the Optical profits are growing faster than the sales in the most recent quarter. I was wondering if you could just explain why that dynamic happened most recently. Thanks.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Sure. I mean, I think that from a leverage standpoint, an awful lot of fixed costs that are in the Optical business, actually in all of our businesses, so generally speaking, you'd expect over time for our profits to grow faster than sales in any of our business segments. The exception being in the Display business where we're looking for stability. And we certainly saw that in the second quarter in Optical Communications. It's important to realize that while that's happening, we're also investing a lot. We're investing in particular in some of the expansions that we've talked about to keep up with demand. So \u2013 but from an overall standpoint, I think it's safe to assume that in the Optical business, in most quarters, we'll see profits grow faster than sales.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess I wanted to open up with just a tax question in light of the Valor announcement and the administration backing for that. I wonder, Wendell, could you just maybe give us an update on your thinking on tax reform generally just kind of how that's moving along in timing? And are there going to be disproportionate advantages for people that build manufacturing onshore here? And then I have a follow-up.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","As to tax reform, I think it's easy to be confident long term that the current tax policy of the United States is not stable over time, that it leads to things that are not good for our economy or jobs, and that ultimately that's going to get fixed. And I think that's \u2013 that I feel quite confident about. What I am much less confident about is how the political math works in any given year. So I think calling timing on that one is above my pay grade.","I do believe that there are significant advantages to be gained by manufacturing where your customers are. And that is the core of our investment philosophy. We believe we can serve our customers better, we believe that serves the communities better, and we believe it's part of being a good citizen and a spectacular competitor. And so that tends to guide our philosophy, and that's what all these various announcements you've been seeing recently really deal with about us. Valor Glass is aimed at the pharmaceutical industry. The U.S. is the powerhouse of biotech and pharmaceutical manufacturing, and we believe this is the right place to put it.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And then I wanted to \u2013 my follow-up, I just wanted to come back to Tony on Display. Samsung has recently cut their expectations for demand later in the year. I know your commentary suggests that things are relatively on track. But I wonder if you could just talk about what you think is happening with end-market demand right now. Are we just seeing some temporal weakness and as we move into the back end of the year, you feel that demand will be relatively normal? Or any other color you can give us on what you guys are seeing on end market demand would be helpful. Thanks.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Yeah, sure. I mean, I think that if you look at the data from January to May, it does show the TV viewing area, some weakness in China and Western Europe, while all the other regions are up on a year-over-year basis. But I think what's important to remember about this is, retail demand is clearly back-end loaded, and we're just now entering the significant selling season. So it's hard to draw a conclusion based on the first five months' worth of data.","Second thing I'd remind you is, is that what really drives the growth of our business is the size of TVs. And we said that TVs would grow more than an inch-and-a-half, and all the data in the first five months confirms that, we feel very confident about that.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning. I have two questions. First, for Wendell, I was hoping you could comment on the breadth of strength you're seeing in the U.S. optical market; how much is coming from the Tier 1 telcos like Verizon, how much is coming from cable or other verticals? And then perhaps you can help us understand what you're seeing internationally, and are you seeing any improvement there that could become an optical tailwind later this year or next?","And then for, Tony, I was hoping you could comment on the gross and operating margin trajectory. Both were down sequentially relative to Q1. It seems like you're expecting similar trends during Q3. So I guess I was hoping you can help us understand if you believe these are the margin levels we should be thinking about over time, or do you still see the potential to drive some margin improvement.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","So in Optical \u2013 I think that's a really excellent question. First, note that our growth is really strongly driven by our organic innovations. And second is that exact timing of when those are being pulled into these major network builds can be quite challenging to call accurately. That being said, you are right to note that you're seeing the major telecom players are driving a hunk of our growth at this point in time. That being said, we are seeing the same type of momentum being built in our dialogues really across the spectrum of our Communications business.","And this, together with the growth that we are also seeing in the cloud-based optical systems and around the world, is what is leading us to believe that though any given quarter could come out different ways. There is the potential here for a building wave of demand in our Optical Communications business largely because as fiber pushes closer and closer and deeper and deeper in the network, right, what happens is the amount of demand for our particular type product goes up significantly. And so that's what we're feeling around the world. But like I say, these are major programs, and calling exact timing can be quite challenging. But I think we're seeing at least the basis of a long-term secular momentum building for our tech.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","And from a margin standpoint, I mean, we were happy with our margin performance in the second quarter. Gross margin was doing 42.4%, very consistent with where we were in Q1, which I think was 42.3%, and we expect the rest of the year to be in the 42.5% range.","But I think it's important to remember, and I mentioned it a little bit when I was answering the Optical question, is that we are beginning to invest in a number of growth areas that we've talked about, and that increases spending slightly. It increases it in the cost of goods sold, it increases it in S&A and RD&E, not above any of the percentages \u2013 normal ranges we've given you, 14% in SG&A, 8% in RD&E, gross margins in the 42% to 43% range. But you do see some of that that's occurring in our businesses. So we don't see anything unusual about that, and we're actually quite pleased with where we are.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Newton with Stifel. Your line is open.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, Wendell and Tony. I guess first question is on your Other Sales. They seem to have broken out sequentially and year-over-year. I'm curious if you could help us understand what is driving this, perhaps commenting on auto trends or whether Valor Glass trials are driving some incremental revenue. And could you also remind us what businesses or products are embedded in Other Sales?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Sure. We have a lot of our development programs are in our Other Sales. It includes the business that we acquired a couple years ago from Gerresheimer that's part of our some pharmaceutical packaging technology business and it includes a variety of other programs that we have in there. And I wouldn't say that those specific trends are a reflection of anything specifically that's going on. The proof points you ought to look at are the ones we've talked about in each of these programs.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And auto is in this bucket as well. Correct?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Yeah. Auto is in this bucket as well.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, Wendell, you talked about Valor Glass having a uphill climb for regulatory purposes and making timing of adoption difficult to predict. And I guess just given that backdrop, is there any long-term timeframe that you could provide to us to help us understand the potential timing of when Valor Glass could become a meaningful impact to your P&L? And then on the profitability side of Valor, I think with your purchase of Gerresheimer's glass tubing operations, you did form an equity venture that's about 75% owned by Corning. So does this mean that Gerresheimer's going to receive 25% of future Valor business profit?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","So let's handle both questions. Let's start with the timing one. I think it's a little early for us to be able to give a good idea on what the ramp is going to look like next year. We'll start to see the submissions go into the FDA and we'll begin to get a feeling for what type of regulatory process they want to bring it through and how accelerated they want to make the adoption of Valor if they choose a highly accelerated rate, then we're going to move much more quickly towards breakout, right. If they choose a more typical conservative rate, then it's going to move a little slower towards breakout.","I think the beauty of this particular business is though the regulatory nature of it can make adoption a little slower, it makes it way more certain that allows us to put the \u2013 we can put capacity up faster than a particular cycle of adoption of regulatory approval. So it derisks our investment very significantly. And then second, once you win that, it's forever business. So we like it. It can be a little frustrating in the early stages, but long term, I think it builds the type of very robust business that, assuming we have a breakout here, we are just going to be delighted with over the next decade and beyond.","And then the Gerresheimer question, so the Gerresheimer piece, yes, we acquired their glass tubing business as we explained at the time, when they've got a early look at what it was Valor was. They understood what it is they were looking at, and decided to have us become the glassmaker for tubing. And it allowed us to get a lower cost platform for us to do what we just announced. One of the expansions we have is to build a new glass manufacturing line there and that helps us on our cost structure.","As to the go-to-market for the actual vials and cartridges, that is all still in development. You would have seen an announcement from Gerresheimer and from Stevanato just the other day saying how delighted they are to be cooperating with us on this. How we actually end up resolving that go-to-market, what goes through venture, what goes to 100% us, what's pieces of the value chain are carried where, I think that's all ahead of us. Our first hunks of investment that we just announced, they're flowing through 100% owned a play and we'll see how it develops over time. It's all going to be about the best way to serve our customers and the best way to create value for our shareholders.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you for taking my questions. Good luck.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, good morning. Just a bigger picture question here on 5G, like to hear your thoughts there and how you see it impacting your Optical Fiber business heading into next year. Do you see mostly tactical opportunities next year like fiber updates to small cells, or you foresee a bigger, broader fiber build-out opportunity kind of kicking in as 5G starts to unravel at big service providers like Verizon, AT&T, et cetera? Thanks.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","It's a great question. We view 5G as having the potential to be an extremely significant demand driver for our product. If truly 5G as it is defined by the industry becomes the standard way to do wireless connectivity, then we are looking at a very significant secular driver for our product, perhaps one of the more significant that we have seen in our long and storied history in this business.","It is still too early to make a call on what exact architectures will be used to deploy this tech. If Verizon's view, with the right technology to deploy, the right architecture to deploy, is correct, this is a huge opportunity. So we'll have to see as our own work progresses, as our deep engagement with other customers progresses, how will the architectures evolve? But there's just no question that it is a positive momentum driver for us. The only question is the size, scale and timing of that momentum. As we get better acuity, we will make sure that we share it with you because of its significant importance to our shareholders.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Corning, Inc.","Thanks, Vijay. Cynthia, we have time for a couple more questions.","Operator","Okay. The next question will be from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I have one regarding margins. When I look at the Display group, revenues were fairly flat, but the net income margin was down. And also with Specialty Materials relative to Q4 of last year, revenues were kind of flat, but net income margin was down there as well. I just want to better understand the dynamics and how we should think about given what has happened with a specific segment net margin over the past couple of quarters, and I have a follow-up.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Yeah, Mehdi, on the Display, in Q1, we received a technology payment that didn't repeat itself in Q2, and that's the whole difference between the two. Otherwise, given where price and volume was on a sequential basis, income was flat. And in terms of Specialty Materials in the second quarter, we had a lot of ramp-up costs for new production that happened in the second quarter that didn't happen in the fourth quarter of last year.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Okay. Got it. And as a follow-up to Specialty Materials, it seems to me that there was some kind of a pull in, in revenues, and some of the handset OEMs are introducing their new product later in the year. And in that context, how should we think about; A, the volume shipment; and B, the increased content? Is it going to be lumpy? Or the initial material push is done, and now we have to wait to see how demand is going to look like, which means there could be a spillover into Q1 of next year. Just trying to understand the dynamics of the specific part of the Specialty Materials.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Yeah, for sure it's going to be lumpy. I mean, our Specialty Materials business has always been lumpy since we've gotten into the Gorilla Glass business, and we'd expect that to continue on a going-forward basis. We said in Q3 we think we'll be up low to mid-teens. Where we're going to end up for the full year, we're not sure because it depends on the adoption of the technologies, but there's no doubt that this will be lumpy as we go forward.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","But could there be a scenario where March quarter will be less seasonal if the new product introduction has a tailwind?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Sure.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Would it be a more than 50% probability?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","No, I'm not going to \u2013 I'm not going to handicap \u2013 I appreciate the question, but I'm \u2013 we're not going to talk about Q1.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group","Okay. Thank you.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Yeah.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Corning, Inc.","Last question.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Stanley Kovler with Citi Research. Your line is open.","Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks for squeezing me in. I'll be quick. I just wanted to ask a question about the use of cash and potential M&A. After SpiderCloud, it seems like you're continuing to make some small acquisitions, particularly in the Optical space. And kind of as we head into 5G, I just wanted to follow-up on the question about M&A. Should we expect to wait on more significant M&A as \u2013 Wendell, you talked about some architectural things that you still have to shake out in the industry before you can make bets on how to augment or add complementary technology to your Optical offerings?","And I'll squeeze my follow-up in; it's just on free cash flow. How should we think about that going into the second half of the year and planning for next year as well? Thanks very much.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Why don't you start with free cash flow, and I'll handle 5G.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Okay. Sure. I think from a free cash flow standpoint, we've said our capital spending part of free cash flow will be about $1.5 billion. It could be on the heavier side of that, given all of the investments that we're making today, but somewhere in that neighborhood. And then in terms of operating cash flow, remember, the second half of the year is where we generate very strong operating cash flow. So it will certainly be stronger than it was in the first half of the year, and relatively consistent with what we did last year.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","And as to how do we see the role of acquisitions, what we currently perceive is that far and away, the bulk of our growth is going to be organically-driven and innovation-driven. That being said, we're in a very privileged position, have deep knowledge as we work with our customers on these architectures, really whether it's in the cloud, in buildings, or in 5G network densifications fiber-to-the-home. You can expect us to take advantage of that privileged position if we start to believe in a technology that can augment what we do and be driven through our market access platform.","That's really the story of SpiderCloud. It was a small acquisition, right, but we really like the tech, and it has an opportunity for us to significantly increase demand for our fiber in the horizontal in buildings and run right through our market access platform. Expect us to continue to do that, but the bulk of our growth is all driven organically and about innovation. I hope that answers your question.","Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Corning, Inc.","Thanks, Stan. Wendell, closing comment?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","First, thank you to everyone for joining us today. I just want to close by reiterating how pleased we are with the continued positive momentum in both our financial results and against our Framework goals. Our focused and cohesive portfolio continues to produce milestones, and we're particularly excited to share our breakthrough moment with Valor. We look forward to staying in touch.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Corning, Inc.","Thanks, Wendell. Before we close, I just wanted to let everyone know that Investor Relations is going to be at the Jefferies Conference at the end of August, and we'll be meeting with investors at the Citi Conference in early September.","A web replay of today's call will be available on our site for one year starting later this morning.

It's my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Ken Sofio, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Sofio","Good morning, and welcome to Corning's fourth quarter conference call. This morning we have Jim Flaws, our Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer, to read some prepared remarks before we move to the Q&A. And those remarks do contain forward-looking statements under the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors  that could cause our actual results to differ materially, and these risks are detailed in the company's SEC reports. Jim?","James B. Flaws","Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Hopefully, you had a chance to read the press release we issued this morning on our fourth quarter and full year results. If you haven't, a copy can be found on our Investor Relations website.","Looking back at 2011, it was a year when the company achieved many milestones but encountered significant headwinds. From a financial standpoint, Corning had an outstanding year. In 2011, the company set records for sales, gross margin and operating income without specials. All of our businesses achieved increased sales year-over-year, sales of Corning Gorilla Glass almost tripled. We achieved our eighth year in a row of positive free cash flow, we maintained our very strong balance sheet, raised our dividend and initiated a sizable share repurchase program. We also brought significant new innovations to the market as our patient investments in research are paying off. Newer products, such as Lotus Glass for OLEDs and now a new, much thinner cover glass in Gorilla Glass 2 have been very well received by customers. We believe this is an outstanding list of achievements, despite less-than-robust growth in the developed economies around the world. However, it does not tell the entire story.","We also encountered significant challenges in the second half of the year. In the third quarter, the display supply industry began a significant contraction. Ultimate resulting in the first year in LCD's history, where the supply chain inventory at the end of the year was lower than the amount at the beginning of the year. Our customers, panel makers, continue to operate on unhealthy financial levels. And in the fourth quarter, we experienced significant pricing pressure and a dispute at one of SCP's largest customers.","Lastly, we witnessed significant upheaval in the solar industry, which impacted demand and price for polysilicon at Dow Corning. So while we're proud of our accomplishments we face and continue to face significant challenges. We're taking action to mitigate the impact of these challenges by reducing costs and adjusting capacity. Nevertheless, our profitability will be lower.","This reset in the display industry, as well as the pressure at Dow Corning had us feeling like the company is approaching a new floor in terms of profitability. It is our plan to grow profits from this level. In short, we expect strong growth in sales and profits from Telecom, Environmental, Specialty Materials and Life Science segments over the next several years. Our confidence is high for these businesses based on their achievements in 2011, with their collective sales up 31% and earnings before special items up 136%, and also due to our market leadership in these businesses.","Now our Display segment is likely not to grow but will generate strong profits and cash flow. In fact, investors should anticipate significant cash flow generation over the next several years. We anticipate using this free cash flow to fund the acquisitions to supplement organic growth, for dividends and for share repurchases. We'll discuss some of those plans this morning in our outlook for Q1 in 2012 and at our Annual Investor Meeting next Friday in New York City, we'll share our growth plans for the next several years.","So with that intro, I'd like to walk you through our Q4 results and our Q1 outlook. Fourth quarter sales were $1.9 billion, a 9% decrease sequentially and in line with our expectations. Compared to last year, sales were up 7%. Gross margin was 43.7%, down from the third quarter of 47.1% and in line with our expectations. The lower gross margin was due to higher price declines in Display, lower volumes in Gorilla Glass product line and seasonally lower volume in Telecom.","SG&A and R&D were higher sequentially, but in line with our expectations. As a reminder, operating expenses in Q3 were materially lower due to us lowering compensation accruals and also onetime credit. Equity earnings were $321 million, but that included a significant onetime gain at Dow Corning. Excluding that gain, equity earnings were $241 million or 26% lower sequentially, which was slightly better than our guidance.","Equity earnings also included a $12 million charge for an asset write-off, which we did not count as a special item. Earnings per share, excluding special items was $0.33 and substantially lower versus Q3 and a year ago. Both equity earnings and EPS, as stated here are non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation to GAAP can be found on our website.","For the year, sales grew 19% and reached $7.9 billion, the highest level in our 160-year history. All segments grew year-over-year. Gross margin dollars achieved an all-time high reaching $3.6 billion, an increase of 17% over the prior year. Operating margin, excluding special items was also an all-time record at $1.8 billion. So from a consolidated standpoint, we achieved significant financial milestones.","Below the operating margin line however, lower equity earnings and the higher tax rate reduced our earnings. Our tax rate increased as expected from 3% to almost 15%. Equity earnings fell 25%. The combination of higher taxes and lower equity earnings shaved more than $0.5 billion from our bottom line. EPS for the year, excluding special items, was $1.76 and that compares to $2.07 in 2010. Again, these are non-GAAP measures, and please see our GAAP reconciliation on our website. It is also important to note that our sales and EPS benefited significantly from a stronger yen this past year.","Now I'd like to turn to our segment results for quarter 4, and I'll start with Display. Display sales were $780 million in Q4, a decrease of 4% sequentially, but 4% higher compared to a year ago. Volume was in line with our expectations. Q4 results also benefited slightly from a stronger yen, which averaged 77 for the quarter. Volume at SCP was higher than our revised guidance, as we disclosed pricing in our wholly-owned business and at SCP, was down significantly.","Because the timing varies customer to customer and will spill into the first quarter, I'll discuss pricing more in the outlook section. Regarding the customer who SCP is in the dispute with, while we did ship them a significant amount of glass in the quarter, volumes were significantly lower than the original commitment from the customer. Equity earnings from SCP's LCD glass business were $192 million, Q4, a decrease of 14% from the third quarter. ","For modeling purposes, SCP's fourth quarter LCD sales were about $790 million, a decline of 7% from the third quarter. As a reminder, this represents SCP's LCD sales only. Our public filings report SCP's total sales, which include CRT and other product sales. For the year, Display sales were $3.1 billion, a 4% increase over last year. Volume growth was more than offset by price declines. Sales benefited from a strong yen.","Now moving to retail, on this slide you can see unit growth rates by region, by month. Based on some final retail data for November, December, it appears our forecast for LCD television growth is still on track for 2011. Demand for LCD televisions at retail in Q4, including Black Friday, were in line with our expectations. In the interest of time, I'm not going to go through the data region by region. The slide will become available on our website before the Q&A ends, and I'd be happy to answer any questions then.","Now as a reminder, the fastest-growing segment of televisions recently has been those 40 inches or larger. On this chart, you can see the growth rates. And we're seeing these higher growth rates across all regions, including developing ones. For glass makers, size matters. We love to see these larger televisions are doing so well at retail. And the area growth rates are actually a lot more meaningful metric since we sell glass by the square foot.","Now turning to this chart, you'll see a comparison of growth rates by quarter for units versus area. This is a trend we expect to continue in 2012 as well. Based on our preliminary Q4 retail data, we believe the worldwide LCD glass market was roughly $3.2 billion square feet in 2011, up only slightly from 2010.","I also have some updates this morning on display supply chain inventory model. In the fourth quarter we set out to understand how low inventory levels could theoretically reach. I'd like to share with you some of the learnings from that study which was done, with the help of McKinsey consulting firm. One of the more important learnings from the study was that the efficiency levels within the display supply chain have been modestly better than we estimated. While we always model efficiency improvements each year, we had underestimated this metric in 2011. As a result, the revised model indicates the supply chain built inventory in the first half of 2011, peaking in mid-year above 18 weeks. This is slightly higher than our original estimate of 17 weeks. Supply chain correction in the third quarter did result in a reduction of about 3 weeks in inventory. We believe there are about 15 weeks in inventory entering fourth quarter versus our prior estimate of 14. ","McKinsey also indicated supply chain levels entering 2012 at the low end of what is considered to be a normal range. But they could trend lower. The study indicated supply chain inventories could fall another half a week this year. Over the longer stretch of time, it's possible to imagine the average week's inventory could continue to decline. Of course, this can change both higher and lower depending on the supply chain sentiment. For example, if supply chain believes retail demand will be stronger and expect that there could be a short-term build up of inventory, and the concerns about the economy if less inventory could be carried.","This chart outlines the fluctuation in weeks of inventory since 2007, on the yellow line. With the average on that time, shown as a dotted blue line. As you see, the average level of inventory has been decreasing for the past 4 years. This is due to a number of factors that are consistent with the maturing industry, including lower growth rates, more experience leading to better forecasts of retail demand, and of course, financial pressures across the value chain. I'll have some more comments about our expectations for 2012 in the outlook.","Now on the innovation front. We're very pleased with the market acceptance of our new Lotus Glass since its introduction in the fall. As a reminder, Lotus is an environmentally-friendly, high-performance display glass developed to enable such new technologies as OLED displays. While I'm on the topic of OLED, we were pleased to see a number of new large-sized OLED TV prototypes on display at CES. And while these prototypes were quite expensive, as much as $10,000, we believe they showed consumers how beautiful a large OLED display can be. We here at Corning are excited about the potential for OLEDs. At our core, we believe we are a display glass company, not an LCD company. So while the industry does not anticipate a significant number of OLED televisions until later in the decade, for example, DisplaySearch is estimating just 3 million sold in 2014, we have been actively engaged with customers on delivering a unique glass solution.","Today, some of our customers are working on OLED's 2 pieces of glass, given the low yields and higher costs when using plastics and metal. And even those customers who are pursuing a one-glass solution, are also working with us on developing a 2-glass solution. The reasons for this are clear to us. Other material sets are not as inexpensive and result in lower yields. If the past year has taught us anything about consumers it is this, consumers are not willing to pay for high-priced televisions. We believe it will be very difficult for OLEDs to reach mass adoption if they're not priced appropriately. And to achieve lower price points, you need to lower costs. And we at Corning believe that a 2-glass solution will actually be the preferred path to this goal. We're going to have a lot more details on our OLED TV forecast and our unique position in the OLED market at our Annual Investor Meeting next Friday.","Now let's turn to Telecommunications. In Telecom, sales were $490 million, down 13% sequentially and in line with our expectations. Compared to the fourth quarter last year, sales were up 11%. For the full year, Telecom sales were $2.1 billion, an increase of 21% over 2010. This segment experienced significant growth across all product lines. Our Fiber-to-the-Home sales were up 39% and our Enterprise Networks sales were up 10%. Even more impressive was the strong bottom line performance of the segment. Net income, excluding special items, was up over 70% this year.","In Environmental, sales were down $234 million, down 5% and in line with our expectations. When compared to the prior year, sales were basically even. For the year, Environmental sales reached $1 billion, the highest in the segment's history, increase of 22% and driven by the surge in demand for diesel filters. And we're very pleased that our diesel business exceeded $500 million in sales for the first time.","Net margins in Environmental jumped from 5% to 11% in 2011, and net income almost tripled from $43 million to $121 million. We're delighted by the performance in Environmental and very pleased that we're improving in manufacturing and that our products are doing well with our customers.","In Specialty Materials, sales were $238 million, down 20% sequentially, which is actually slightly better than our expectations. Compared to the prior year, sales were up 21%. The segment posted a net loss of $105 million in Q4 versus an income of $38 million in the previous quarter. The loss was due primarily to 3 events. First, we took an $83 million after-tax charge related to impairment of assets. These assets were used to make large-sized cover glass. Due to low demand, we impaired a portion of these assets. We treated this as a special item. Second, there was an after-tax charge of $12 million related to the write-off of Gorilla tanks at SCP. This charge was not treated as a special item. And lastly, due to the lower demand for Gorilla Glass in the fourth quarter, we ran our assets at lower utilization rates, resulting in lower margins. Gorilla Glass sales in the fourth quarter were $161 million, down about 25% sequentially. The sequential decline, we believe, was due to improved yields at our customers and higher inventory levels within the supply chain. ","As we've mentioned over the past few months, our visibility into this supply chain is not nearly as robust as it is in Display. To help you illustrate the chain, I've got a simple chart to show you. These are the steps it takes for our Gorilla Glass to make its way into a finished product. Even though our customer wins are actually with the original equipment manufacturer, such names as Samsung, Motorola or Acer, the glass gets shipped first to a finisher. At the finisher, the glass is cut into parts and then chemically strengthened. The majority of our glass is shipped to only a handful of finishers, which is why you see in our public filings, there are only 2 to 3 material customers in Specialty Materials. It's also the reason why investors will not see the name of the list of any of our OEM component suppliers. The strengthened glass is then shipped to a touch panel assembler, who assembles the glass in the touch panel module. There, the touch panel gets shipped to an ODM, who assembles the entire consumer device. And lastly, it's shipped to retail under the OEM brand name. A lot more steps here than the LCD business. And for that reason, we need to get a better understanding of how much inventory is at each step. Our goal is to create a model somewhere to display, but we have a long way to go.","Now on the right-hand side of this chart, you can see our estimates for glass efficiency throughout the supply chain. And while the efficiency levels may not be that bad at any individual step in the supply chain, when you add up the low end of the cumulative losses, there's potential for significant inefficiency. For example, at the finishers, there is some glass that is lost in the process of cutting glass into device-sized pieces before chemically strengthening them. We've actually been working directly with the finishers and the touch panel assemblers to help them better understand how to handle and process our glass. We hope it leads to improved yields at our customers over time. And even though those improving yields will reduce demand glass for us, we'll lower the cost of the device. And in the long run, in consumer electronics, that's very important.","For the year, Gorilla Glass sales were $710 million, almost triple a year ago. Gorilla Glass is one of our fastest growing products in history, and the glass itself is our second highest gross margin product today.","For those of you who were at the Consumer Electronics Show, hopefully, you had a chance to stop by our booth and to see the next generation of Gorilla Glass. We're calling it Gorilla Glass 2. Gorilla Glass 2 enables up to a 20% reduction in glass thickness, while maintaining industry-leading damage resistant, toughness, optical transmission and scratch resistant. This newest innovation was in direct response to our customers' drive towards ever-thinner form factors. And to put it mildly, we have a lot of interested customers. Gorilla Glass is now used by more than 30 major brands and designed into more than 600 product models, spanning more than 600 million units worldwide. And we're going to have some very cool demos of the new glass at our Annual Investor Meeting next week. I'm going to have some more of this topic in the outlook.","In Life Sciences, Q4 sales were $143 million, 7% less than Q3 and flat compared to last year, and in line with our guidance. For the year, Life Sciences sales were about $600 million, an increase of 17% over 2010. Excluding acquisitions, Life Sciences' sales were up 7%.","Now at Dow Corning, equity earnings were $129 million in Q4, compared to $89 million in Q3. Q4 included a onetime gain of approximately $80 million. Dow Corning had brought legal action against one of it polysilicon customers, who had stopped taking product to enforce certain long-term sales agreements. The resolution resulted in a significant cash payment. Excluding this gain, equity earnings at Dow Corning were $49 million, down 45%.","Now in response to falling poly prices, Hemlock has modified a number of its sales agreements to provide temporary pricing relief while preserving the long-term favorable relationships with its customers. In addition, Hemlock has decided to delay certain plant expansion activities until market conditions for polysilicon improve. It is in difficult times like this where being the lowest cost producer provides a key advantage. Today Hemlock is the world's lowest cost producer of poly and its costs are still well below spot prices. Although reported spot pricing has actually ticked up in recent weeks, we still believe it's below production costs of some of our competitors. Regarding the current poly supply and demand balance, we believe there continues to be a significant amount of excess capacity, which will continue to put pressure on poly pricing.","Now let's switch to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $5.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, a decline from $6.4 billion in cash we had on hand entering the fourth quarter. Of course one of the major cash outflows during the quarter was our capital spending. The other was the cash we used to repurchase shares. We told investors we would be aggressive when the stock price is significantly lower than what we deem to be fair value, and we were. We began repurchasing stock in late October under the $1.5 billion share repurchase program approved by the board earlier that month. In roughly a 2-month period of time, the company spent about $780 million to repurchase approximately 55 million shares.","Looking ahead, we continue to be -- we expect to continue to be active in repurchasing our stock if it remains at levels below our estimate of appropriate value. I will not speculate on how fast we'll go through the remainder of the approved amount or what the board will decide to do next. I can tell you, given our cash flow expectations over the next several years, expect to have ample financial flexibility to fund additional share repurchases, M&A to supplement growth or to increase the dividend.","Capital spending for the year totaled $2.4 billion and was in line with our previous guidance. I'm delighted to say we finished our eighth year in a row of positive free cash flow with $544 million. Very pleased with our ability to generate over $0.5 billion in the year when our capital spending was higher than usual.","Now on to our outlook. This morning, we'll be providing first quarter, as well as some full year guidance by business. I'm going to start with Display in the retail market. In the first quarter, we're not expecting much sequential change in the overall glass market. Volume at our wholly-owned business should be in line with the glass market. Volumes at SCP are expected to be flat or down double digits, depending on the outcome of negotiations with that key customers. ","Now looking ahead to the full year, we expect the retail market, in terms of square feet, to grow about 10% in 2012 from roughly 3.25 billion square feet to about 3.6 billion square feet. Let me be clear, this is the amount of glass contained in LCD products sold to consumers, not the amount of glass that we're shipping to panel makers.","Amount of glass shipped above and below the retail number will obviously be dependent upon panel maker utilization rates and the supply chain dynamics. At this time, our most likely case is the supply chain could actually add about 100 million square feet of inventory during the year. As the retail market grows, so does the amount of inventory in the supply chain. In terms of weeks of inventory, we actually expect supply chain to contract by about 1\/2 a week. This is because we believe the supply chain will build inventory in square foot though at a slower pace than the retail demand growth.","I've outlined our point estimates for retail demand and supply chain inventory. Now for your planning purposes, we also have a downside case. With inventory being flat in terms of square feet rather than growing 100 million. And for retail demand we have a variety of cases for demand being above or below the point estimate of 3.6 billion square feet, obviously driven by different economic scenarios. For modeling purposes, we now expect LCD television units to be about 230 million this year, up about 10% versus 2011, and consistent with most industry forecasts. Again, we expect area growth to be higher. PC units, which include monitors, notebooks, tablets are expected to grow 10% this year, the strongest demand in the tablet area.","In regards to glass capacity, we believe the actions we've taken to reduce capacity has brought glass supply closer to end demand. If we've correctly estimated retail demand and supply chain dynamics, then we believe worldwide glass supply could move into balance with glass demand at some point during the year. We will of course then decide on the pace and timing of bringing capacity back on line, but we are likely to be very cautious about restarting tanks.","This brings me to the topic of what happened in the fourth quarter. We believe there are a set of circumstances within the LCD industry, that actually are leading to a reset of our LCD business. Circumstances have caused a period of more significant glass price declines. Glass price declines will be significant in the first quarter of 2012, as they were on quarter 4. We expect significant double-digit price declines cumulative over the 2-quarter period of time.","Now the circumstance driving this are the following: First, as you know, the rate of growth at retail has been slowing for many years, as the technology penetration phase is ending for television. This growth slowdown into maturity has actually been expected by the industry for some time. However, while the growth rate was still in the low double digits this past year, this decline in the maturity may have been hastened this past year by the worldwide economic malaise.","Second, the panel capacity has had far more capacity than retail demand. This excess capacity leads to low operating utilization, continued price pressure on panels and ultimately, terrible financial results including significant losses. This situation was aggravated in the back half of 2010, when the industry tried to fix its profitability by aiming high-feature and high-priced televisions to consumers. Consumers did not want the higher priced TVs, which led to lower growth and excess inventory. This is actually a good lesson learned to those who believe in high-priced OLEDs will be an immediate hit with consumers. Now these issues exacerbated the utilization problem, putting further pressures on panel prices and effectively pushing pricing to levels that were either at or lower than cash costs.","The third element is likely related to the first 2. Display's supply chain decided to reduce the amount of inventory carried. With the industry maturity and lack of profitability, this decision is very understandable. However, it caused lower utilization for panel makers and for glass makers. The glass industry has historically kept capacity closer to the retail level than the panel industry. This year, the inventory drawdown, combined with lower retail growth, pushed glass into a more significant overcapacity situation. And this circumstance combined with panel industry profitability has led to the pricing pressure on glass. ","So what does this mean for Corning? We have recognized this untenable financial situation of our customers, many close to record losses last year. We obviously have been working with them to reduce glass prices now to help their financial strains. We have proposed advancing our normal 2012 glass price declines versus more normal moderate price declines each quarter throughout the year. This will provide our customers more immediate financial relief. However, this cumulative 2 quarter of higher price declines will cause a reset of the profitability in our display business. We're hopeful that our pricing actions combined with capacity decisions will lead us to get back to more stable price declines after quarter 1. ","Display business continues to be extraordinarily profitable for us and will generate significant cash flow. Even more so as the combination of our innovations and retail maturity cause our capital spending to slowing in this segment. The changes in the Display business often mask from investors the growth in sales and profits of our other segments. Other segments represent about 60% of the sales, and each of them had great sales growth in 2011. In fact, the sales of our non-display segments grew 31% in 2011 and profits grew 136%.","One of our fastest-growing business is Telecom, where the demand is forecasted to be strong worldwide in the key markets we play in: Fiber-to-the-Home, Enterprise Networks, optical fiber and wireless. We expect another year of very strong growth in Telecom. We expect further gross margin expansion in Telecom driven by the mix of higher margin products. In the first quarter, sales will increase 5% to 10% sequentially, as well as year-over-year.","In Environmental, we expect another very strong year of growth due primarily to our surging diesel business. First quarter sales will be up slightly.","Specialty Materials sales will be led by Gorilla Glass and we anticipate the cover glass market could grow as much as 20% this year, driven primarily by tablets and handheld devices. However, we do expect further improvements in customer yields as the year progresses, as well as some price declines. Right now, it's hard to forecast the impact of each and the impact they will have on 2012. The first quarter we expect the segment sales to be up slightly driven solely by Gorilla.","In Life Sciences, we expect another strong year of sales growth through a combination of organic growth and a full year of sales from recent acquisitions. In the first quarter, sales are expected to increase 10%. We'll be providing more longer-term forecasts for each of these businesses next week at our Investor Meeting. ","At Dow Corning, we expect equity earnings to be lower in 2012. In the silicone business, it will be due to a combination of higher raw material cost and softer worldwide silicone demand, impacting prices and margins. At Hemlock, we're anticipating the challenging price conditions in poly continue. Pricing is not expected to improve until supply demand levels return to balance and the current overcapacity situation subsides. We'll provide additional color at Dow Corning at the Investor Meeting next week.","Now continuing on with our outlook for Q1, we expect gross margin to drop a percentage point primarily due to lower pricing in Display. SG&A and R&D will be consistent on a dollar basis with the fourth quarter. Equity earnings, excluding special items will be down between 5% to 20%, depending on that potential of lower volumes at SCP and the lower earnings at Dow Corning. Equity earnings from Dow Corning are expected to be down 35% due primarily to lower poly pricing.","Other income is expected to fall by more than half, primarily due to lower royalty income. Our tax rate, as expected, will move from 15% to 20% in the first quarter. Main drivers of the increase will be the expiration of certain tax holidays in Asia, the failure of Congress to pass the Extenders Bill and more profits in higher-rate jurisdictions. As a reminder, this is a non-GAAP measure as it excludes special items. Our share count will likely be lower as we have a full quarter's benefit from the share repurchases we did last quarter.","For FX, as a reminder, our results move with changes in the yen-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate. The average rate in Q4 was 77, so if the yen averages 1 point higher and lower in Q1, estimate our sales and net income would decrease or increase by about $9 million.","Now before I move to Q&A, I want to remind everyone that our Annual Investor Meeting will be next Friday, at February 3 at Cipriani's in New York City. I can tell you we're going to actually have a much different event than last year. This year we'll actually demonstrating live on the stage many of our next-generation innovations that we're most excited about. Obviously, including Gorilla Glass 2, but as well our ultrathin glass. It's shaping up to be very informative and actually a hands-on event. For those of you considering staying in your office or home, and listening to the webcast, please don't. I highly encourage you to attend. Many of the demos can only be experienced live. Plus, this will be one of your rare opportunities to interact with all of our key business leaders in one setting. We hope you will attend. Ken?","Kenneth Sofio","Thank you, Jim. John, we're ready to take some calls now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","First in the line is Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jim, clearly you're communicating to the LCD business growth and profit profiles different. How should we think about the CapEx profile for LCD glass without any new capacity additions? And could you also talk about plans for the Beijing, BOE-related glass melting facility?","James B. Flaws","So we are going to finish our Beijing facility. So you'll see that in capital spending. We believe our primary customer, the BOE, will be a very successful panel maker as the Chinese market grows. We obviously are going to pace the startup of that factory, and we will plan to do that. We're expecting the startup to occur in the second half. In terms of capital spending for Display, we are finishing up our earthquake preparedness capital spending we've outlined to you before. But in terms of any additional capacity in Display, either in our wholly-owned or SCP, you should not see us initiating anything new.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And as a follow-up, is there a level of price decline on the LCD glass quarter-after-quarter, after which you would rather walk away from the incremental volumes?","James B. Flaws","I could just tell you, Wamsi, that the LCD business remains extraordinarily profitable, despite these 2-quarter price declines we have. And the incremental margins are very high. So we definitely intend to maintain our position in the business. And we'll obviously respond to situations as they come along. But beyond that, I won't speculate.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If I could just squeeze in one last one in here. You noted Gorilla Glass pricing could decline in 2012. Did it decline in 2011? And can you talk about some of the drivers of these competitive reasons, excess inventory or just incremental pressures from customers?","James B. Flaws","We really haven't seen much in the way of price changes in this business in its early years. We always expected that this would be the year we'd begin to see some. It is not excessive price declines. I think some people are speculating that, that is not the case. In fact, we haven't even reached agreement with all our customers yet. But we're just assuming that in the consumer electronics business, that we will feel the fact that our customers always want to be lowering the price of their end product. And so we are highlighting to you that this is the year we might see some price declines. We have not agreed on those yet with customers. We are not feeling any competitive pressure. And if the excitement that we heard from customers on Gorilla Glass 2 at the Consumer Electronics Show continues, we don't expect to feel any competitive pressure.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Jim, you're doing the necessary things with pricing concessions in the near term. But how do we know that your actions don't create a change in future behaviors for your customers, creating a new price tier and undoing some of the pricing strategy changes that you implemented 3 to 4 years ago?","James B. Flaws","Well, I can never guarantee what the future's going to be, Mark. But I can tell you what we did coming out of 2006, is we adopted a strategy and communicated very broadly that we thought the best thing for our customers and for the industry was to have consistent price declines every quarter, keeping up with the fact that consumer electronics prices are going down. And we intended to do that. There have been several times since then, when we had price declines above that. But I would say, in general, what has led to that strategy, working for us in the industry, was for the glass makers to not have capacity substantially above what the real demand was. The biggest problem that occurred this past year, in my opinion, and take this as a Jim Flaws opinion, please, is that the glass industry, which has to shoot ahead of the duck in terms of thinking about capacity, expected retail demand to grow in 2011 by a certain level. And then it didn't grow quite that strongly. I think ultimately retail glass grew about 12%. And maybe a little bit more than that. But we had assumed, originally, that retail demand would grow 18%. So we had capacity in place for that. Second, in our models, for the prior 4 years, the 2010, '09, '08 and '07, the aggregate amount of square footage in the supply chain, in any one of those years, either grew 100 million square feet at a minimum or over 200 million square feet. We had anticipated the industry would build inventory again. It didn't. Not only did it not build, it actually declined. Those 2 things led to overcapacity in the glass industry by above 20%. That leaves the opportunity for our customers, who are always putting price pressure on us, to have a more effective way to do it when demand and supply and balance for glass gets out of whack by that greater amount. What I believe, Jim Flaws' opinion, what's going to happen is that we will not see the same precipitous drop in inventories going forward. Retail demand will grow, it may not be as great as what we'd all like, but we are going to be bringing the glass capacity in line, closer to end-demand, and that becomes a recipe for more moderate price declines. I cannot guarantee you that, that's our strategy, that's why we announced the 25% capacity offline in the fourth quarter.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Jim, as we look towards stable pricing declines after quarter 1, is there a promise or maybe a gentleman's agreement from your customers that once their margins improve, that subsequently, there's more rational and less inclination for discounts from Corning?","James B. Flaws","We have no promises or gentleman agreements with pricing on our customers.","Operator","And we'll go to Rod Hall with JPMorgan.","Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just got 2. One is on the pricing declines. If you could just elaborate, Jim, on where you are in the process of renegotiating prices among the panel makers for glass. Are we halfway through that process, are we a quarter of the way through, where are we in the process and the price levels resetting because that kind of thing is likely to happen beginning in Q4? And then my second question is on inventory. If could just talk about you said that we can expect for a half of week in inventory compression this year. Do you expect that to be more toward the first half of the year or do you think that's going to be spread across the whole year? I'm kind of trying to get a feel for whether you think inventory is stabilizing to earlier in the year or not until later this year?","James B. Flaws","So I don't have a perspective on the half of week of inventory. I mean we have done that saying, as that chart we showed, that we believe, over time, inventories will -- efficiency will continue to improve. We haven't gotten so specific to say we know that's exactly occurring in which quarter. In terms of pricing, we're basically done on price agreements with our customers with the exception of the one customer in Korea, so we're very far along.","Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And Jim, do you think that, that one customer -- do you think you can finish that in Q1 or do you have a feel for when that completes?","James B. Flaws","I just won't speculate. I mean this obviously has been a very difficult situation. And my ability to forecast how quickly we can do it has obviously been proven wrong, so I won't speculate anymore on them.","Operator","Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays Capital.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jim, in talking about that one Korean customer,  I mean obviously, your guidance here has a decent amount of variability for shipments out of SCP dependent on what happens with that customer. Can you give us a little bit of color as to sort of what's on the flat side versus the down 10% side, is it sort of a share recovery, expectation on one side or is it that share would remain the same at sort of new levels with that customer?","James B. Flaws","I think I have to decline to be too specific on it. This customer remains taking quite a bit of glass from SCP, they're just well below the original agreement that we had with them. And as you know, the dynamics that I walked through with you, unfortunately in November and December, is we thought we had reached agreement with them and then they took the share back up and took it back down. And so I think it's inappropriate for me to comment on the exact numbers in it. But depending on the outcome, because the quarter 4 had so much variability in the months of October, November and December, there's a situation that we could see where the aggregate amount obviously is good, or it could get worse. And I just won't forecast it, and that's why I wanted to give you a range there.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then lastly on the pricing front, obviously you're working with the panel makers given their challenged profitability here. Are you still looking to maintain a premium in terms of pricing in the marketplace versus competitors, dependent on sort of your pricing actions? I'm just trying to get a sense in terms of what you're seeing for yourself and also your competitors in the market.","James B. Flaws","Sure. We expect to get -- have a slight premium. As you know, the premium is fairly small but we expect to get it. From our eyes, we expect to get the premium because we think our product performs best. On the other hand, from our competition's eyes, they probably always want to be below us as a mechanism to try and do well with our customers. So we in general, expect to always have a slight price premium versus our competition.","Operator","And we'll go to Nikos Theodosopoulos with CBS.","Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I had some, hopefully, some simple numeric questions and then a general question. Jim, I did not actually hear a CapEx outlook for 2012, can you give us an expectation there.","Kenneth Sofio","Nikos, it's Ken. We gave it out a couple of months ago, it's around $1.8 billion.","Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So that didn't change? I guess that was my question, no change in that?","Kenneth Sofio","It did not change, no.","Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then the second question is, do you have for the full year of 2011, the LCD price declines in SCP and the wholly consolidated business?","Kenneth Sofio","Nikos, for both SCP and the wholly-owned business they were around 15%, maybe a little north of there for the full year of 2011.","Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then my question here is, when you idle capacity in LCD, can you elaborate what in fact that means? In other words, how long does it stay idle? What's the process -- more importantly, what's the duration to get it back when in fact, you want to get it back? And as part of that question, is there any commitment Corning has made regarding the Beijing plant in terms of a completion date or minimum capacity there?","James B. Flaws","A lot of questions. So in Beijing, we do have a commitment to operate the factory. The pace of when it starts and how much it does in a given quarter is not a commitment, but obviously we have a very important customer there, located right next to us. So we expect to supply glass to them from that facility. We're now forecasting the startup to be in the second half of 2012, we're actually shipping that customer from capacity in our other locations today, as they have begun their ramp-up of the Gen 8.5. In terms of the overall capacity situation, I think, as you know we have smaller tanks than our competition, and a lot of them. And what we basically do when we talk about capacity going offline is we try to get -- unless we think we're going to need it again in a very short period of time, we let the tank go cold. And the tank goes cold. We have a choice, do we repair it immediately or do we delay the repair, and that will depend on our outlook. In general, we by and large usually repair fairly quickly. You should think about the repair not being very expensive. It's just primarily rebuilding the refractory, swapping out the precious metals and putting in a new one and taking the old one out to be reformed. Neither that situation does not take a lot of time. And then once we decide to relight it, we have to heat up the tank. You can't go from basically the ambient air temperature to 2,300 degrees instantaneously, it takes a while because you don't want everything to crack. And so it takes a period of time to bring it up. But we can do that, it's not a significant issue in terms of timing. But I do want to emphasize, I mean, what we have done is said, we've taken this capacity offline, we don't have plans to bring a lot of this capacity back based on our outlook for the market and we're intending to stick to that for now.","Nikos Theodosopoulos - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Would there be a write-down if that capacity never got turned up? How would we measure it with the potential write-down on something like that?","James B. Flaws","So if the capacity was never used again, ever, then yes, there could be a potential write-off. There are 2 write-offs that occur, if a tank has not finished its life, there's a small amount of capital that has to be written off, because once you take it cold it's useless. You've seen that happen to us before. For example, in quarter 4 of 2008. I think you're asking more about a longer-term issue is if we never need some of these capacity again. Yes, there would be a write-off. I can't estimate it for you because I don't know which tanks would do. I will remind you that these tanks are very flexible tanks. Not only can we make LCD glass, we'll be able to make OLED glass. We can make Gorilla Glass and we can make photovoltaic glass in these. So in terms of saying that there will be a write-off of this capacity, it will be permanently never needed ever again. I'm just not sure that, that's an imminent decision that we're facing.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven B. Fox - Cross Research LLC","Just one question for me on the gross margin outlook. Jim, you're talking about gross margins being down about one full percentage point, but it's in a quarter where your wholly-owned business isn't growing, Gorilla Glass isn't growing and you have price pressures. So I'm just trying to see why the margin shouldn't be down a little bit more. What else is going on within the gross margin line?","Kenneth Sofio","It's Ken, Steve. It's a corporate gross margin forecast. Clearly, we do expect some good margin performance in our other segments during the quarter and that's going to help offset some of the things you mentioned in your question in Display.","James B. Flaws","And in particular, I'll draw your attention to Gorilla, where we had very low utilization in this quarter, where we were -- basically, we expect Gorilla demand to grow, so we didn't turn the tanks off.","Operator","And we'll go to Jim Suva with Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you quickly touch upon, I believe, the licensing agreement between SCP and Corning expired the end of last year and maybe just let us -- or at the end of 2011, and let us know what the outcome of that was. And then on the second note, can you just kind of revisit one more time your commentary about the hope for improved pricing or more stable pricing in 2012. Because if we're thinking about the supply chain and connecting the dots that the panel makers and also the OEMs are not profitable, I would assume that they're hoping for these panels -- or these glass prices to significantly continue to decline in the future. So what's the indications that's giving you that hope?","James B. Flaws","Okay. On the former Samsung agreement, as we've talked about before, the Samsung agreement expired, I think at the end of November last year. Embedded in that is a step down in the royalty rate. And we'll be talking some more about it at the IR Day. So I'd ask you to hold until that day because we do intend to address it then. So what leads to our belief around the potential to get back to more moderate price declines? It is all based on the fact that we believe the industry is correcting to get glass capacity more in line with what will be the demand. And when that occurs, we believe there's an opportunity for more moderate price declines. That is and had been the primary strength of why we had moderate price declines during those periods over the last 5 years. It is very obvious from our customers' perspective, they would love to have these price declines at this higher rate continue in perpetuity. And the tension is whether they have enough strength to force that upon the glassmaking industry or not. We believe that the capacity balance situation and competitive dynamics will ultimately lead to more moderate price declines. And our hope is that occurs as soon as quarter 2.","Operator","And we'll go to George Notter with Jefferies.","George C. Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess I was trying to better understand the relationship between price erosion on LCD TVs at retail and the size of the glass market. If I look back at 2011, it looks like pricing at retail came down around 6%. I think that was actually quite a bit below what you guys were originally thinking about coming into the year. And looking forward, 2012, it kind of feels like price erosion is going to be around the same place, 5%. I think if you look at the DisplaySearch numbers -- I think if you look at the glass market, you guys are talking about 11% kind of growth this year in volume terms. I mean, how do you feel about how those 2 numbers correlate? Is it possible that you guys could be overestimating the growth in the market if you only get 5% price erosion on TVs at retail?","James B. Flaws","So I don't think we actually agree with your TV pricing data down. I don't have it right in front of me, but I think we think it was higher than that 5%. And we have never seen an exact correlation between pricing and retail and our pricing to us. But we think we've got right the end market growth for televisions. Obviously we do realize that even though consumer television is a fairly resistant purchase in tough times, there is the possibility of weakened economic fence. I mean if Europe goes into a serious recession, then maybe we could be wrong. But we think we've got it right. In fact, if anything, I think we got surprised a little bit on the upside in terms of units of television in the back half this past year. So we remain comfortable with our estimate. Obviously, we could be wrong.","Operator","And we go to Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to clarify, Jim, some of the comments you made at the very beginning of your prepared remarks, where you talked about approaching a bottoming profitability but not expecting the Display segment to grow. Was that a comment looking out beyond Q1? If you can just talk a little bit about your longer-term expectations in the Display segment. And also, since you termed the margin decline this quarter as a reset as opposed to a decline, that implies some level of permanence. And so I just wanted to see if you can address how much of your gross margins you think you can recover beyond Q1? And also if you're thinking about offsetting some of that decline with actions at the R&D or SG&A line?","James B. Flaws","That was a lot of questions in one. So our comment about Display was a long-term comment. And we think we're reaching the point where the unit growth and the volume growth, even with moderate price declines, will give us periods of time when there basically is no net sales growth for Display. This may have come a little earlier than what we expected, I think we have been expecting it maybe this occurring in 2014 or 2015, rather than 2012 and beyond. But basically, it appears that we maybe at that point now. So that was a longer-term comment, that wasn't a quarter-by-quarter comment. Your second question was?","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just along the same lines. When you talk about a reset in profitability, does that imply that you view your gross margin permanently coming down to a lower level even beyond the big issues in Q1?","James B. Flaws","So I would say, with what we know today, we believe that the gross margin has come down in Display. And we don't see a set of factors that would drive it back up. To drive it back up, what would have to occur is that we would have to have a period of time where price declines were very, very minor and then we ran our tanks full and then cost reduction exceeded price declines. Right now, I can't, in all candor, tell you that I see a set of conditions that will allow that to occur. So that's what's leading us to say, with this double quarter down, double digits, significant, cumulative, we think we have driven the margin of Display down. I will point out, it remains extraordinarily profitable, it's still our most profitable business, but that's why we're calling it a reset. I'd love to have a situation outlined that occurred that we get to a few quarters of no price declines. If that happens, then I can reverse my comment.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just the last part of that was, would you consider just offsetting some of that with lower OpEx investment in the business given that the growth in margin profile there has changed?","James B. Flaws","Yes. In the Display business itself, you will see actions taken to reduce the OpEx.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the op margin impact you would think would be more muted, but still some relative to the gross margin impact?","James B. Flaws","I'll just comment Simona that the operating expense of this business is pretty tiny to start with, so the moves that we can make in OpEx here are not going to overcome the gross margin declines from pricing.","Operator","Our next question is from Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Couple things. From your study that you did with McKinsey, did they give a sense as to, as you go forward, how low inventories can sustainably get? I'm sure they looked at other industries and saw kind of where they went to. Could we be looking at, eventually down the line, a 10-, 11-, 12-week cycle or do you think it stays somewhere around 13, 14. And then in negotiations with this major customer out of SCP, what are the points of negotiation? What can you actually work with them aside from price or is it really just hitting a price point and that's it? I understand there's still a premium to be had for the level of quality of glass that you have versus your competitors. But what else can you provide to them besides price? I'm just wondering kind of -- or is it a matter of who just decides to finally give in? And then the commentary on the significant price declines over the next 2 quarters or actually over Q4 and Q1? Can you give us a sense as to the significant double-digit decline? Can you bracket that, is that 15% to 20%? 10% to 15%? 13% to 18%? Something that we can just make sure we're all sort of on the same page.","James B. Flaws","So I'll go in reverse order, I'm not going to be more specific on the numbers. Cumulatively, it's a significant double-digit decline and we're not giving out a more specific number. Relative to the customer in Korea, the thing we can always offer is that we believe that we are an extraordinarily reliable supplier. We believe our glass actually runs the best in their process. And those are the things that we would think that would lead them to want us to have at some share level. From their perspective, obviously price is probably the preeminent one. So  beyond that, we hope to reach agreement with them and have them as a customer. And your first question was?","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Inventory, how low can it go?","James B. Flaws","What McKinsey said was over -- they can't forecast in perpetuity here. But they did say, they believed over the next 4 years that we could see, going down 1\/2 week per year, obviously, with the potential always that the economy is much different, that could change. So if you think over 4 years, that knocks another 2 weeks off.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's helpful. I noticed you didn't mention the $10 billion revenue target that you have in the past. You also mentioned the CapEx and you said that was the same. But I'm wondering if that $10 billion revenue target is still out there for you? And then finally you mentioned that there is an imbalance right now with too much glass out there. We know you're taking capacity out of the market, Asahi is taking a similar amount of capacity out of the market, that leaves only one player that doesn't seem to be doing that. If that one player doesn't actively take glass out of the market, do you think you can still get to a supply balance or will they constantly be acting as a spoiler?","James B. Flaws","I'll have to let you talk to that competitor and see what their plans are in terms of running capacity or not building capacity. I'm just not going to comment on them. On the $10 billion, yes, I think the $10 billion is still possible. Obviously, Display will not be as strong as it was before. The flip side, Telecom is actually stronger than we originally expected and Environmental is stronger than we expected. So I still think it's possible. We'll probably talk some more about that next week. The mix will probably be different. But we certainly haven't given up on the goal. We do need some help. I think everybody forgot one of the assumptions we said on getting on our way to $10 billion is we can't have global a economic malaise. And so if Europe goes into recession, then I get more worried.","Kenneth Sofio","John, it's Ken. I want to recognize that we're past the market open and in respect of folks' time, we'll take one more call. But for those that are in the queue, Ann and I, we'll be in our offices right after the call, we can help answer your questions. But John, we'll take one more caller.","Operator","And that will be from with Ajit Pai with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Ajit Pai - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple of quick questions. I think the first one is just to the same point on the pricing side. You talked about, in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, working with your customers in trying to help them to get to better profitability. But could you give us some indication as to the competitive dynamics? And is some of the price reduction being driven by what your competitors are doing, or is it primarily customer-driven? And then the second question is, you've  talked about M&A and also bolstering your businesses outside of Display and potentially even Display. But could you give us some color as to whether in 2012 you can expect greater activity there? I think you have highlighted Life Sciences and Telecom as the 2 focus areas, whether that's still the case or it's broader than that?","James B. Flaws","So in terms of M&A, you should expect greater activity in 2012 than 2011. The primary segments that we're looking on remain Life Sciences and Telecom. But we definitely are moving to be more active. We're going to see more free cash flow and we think we can put it to work appropriately in M&A. In terms of the pricing dynamic, be sure, competitive price dynamics play into this also. Obviously, that's driven a lot of what happened in Korea in Q3 and Q4. So I don't mean to imply that it's just us being nice guys with our customers, clearly the competition has something to do with this too. But I think we clearly went to our customers, acting to help them in this situation. In Korea, obviously, we are feeling the competitive pressure. Ken?","Kenneth Sofio","Jim, any closing comments?","James B. Flaws","Yes. Just a couple. I think that I want to emphasize again, overall, the strength of Corning this past year. We had a very great year. I've mentioned the records in sales, gross margin and operating margin, eighth year in a row of free cash flow, raised the dividend and share repurchase. And the great performance in our business is outside Display. I think that right now the conversation is obviously dominated by pricing in Display. We recognize this reset has occurred. But we definitely intend to get the company at a new level of profitability and then Wendell and I are committed to get the company to grow off of that level. And so we think that's going to happen. And just one more reminder. Obviously, we'd love to see you in New York City. I promise you a very exciting event. Wendell is going to do some very creative work, and so we'd like to see you in person. And also, we, of course, will be presenting in February at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference on February 14. And on February 28 at the Morgan Stanley Technology and Media Conference. So hope to see you there, if not in New York. Ken?","Kenneth Sofio","Thank you, Jim, and thank you all for joining us this morning. A playback of this call will be available beginning at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time today.

It's my pleasure to turn the call over to Ann Nicholson, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ann H. S. Nicholson","Thank you, John, and good morning. Welcome to Corning's second quarter conference call. Jim Flaws, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, will start the call with some prepared remarks.","Before Jim starts, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks are detailed in the company's SEC reports.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Flaws.","James B. Flaws","Thanks, Ann, and good morning, everybody. Now before I turn to our comments on the quarter and the outlook, I actually have an organizational announcement. As some of you know, Ken Sofio, our Vice President of Investor Relations, has been working a reduced schedule since March. Ken has been getting treatment for a serious medical issue. Ken now needs to put full time focus into his health. As a result, he will not be on the call this morning, and he will not be doing follow-up calls with investors. Ann Nicholson, Director of Investor Relations, will be the primary IR contact in the interim. Ann will be supplemented by myself; Tony Tripeny, our Corporate Controller; and Mark Rogus, our Treasurer.","I have 2 requests of our investors. Number one, we will try to be as responsive as normal, but please recognize that our response time may take slightly longer, and time allocations may be a little shorter as we return calls today and tomorrow. Number two, you can direct e-mails to Ken's e-mail address with IR questions. Ken's assistant, Kelly Williams, will forward them to Ann Nicholson. You can also e-mail Ann or Kelly directly at the e-mail addresses shown on the screen. We ask that you keep Ken in your thoughts. If you wish to send a personal e-mail to him, Kelly will see that it gets to him. I appreciate your help at this time.","So now onto the quarter. Hopefully, you\u2019ve had a chance to read the press release we issued this morning on our second quarter results. If you haven't, you can find a copy on our IR website.","In January, we told you of the reset in the corporation's profitability and our plan of forming bottom and marching up. Briefly, I think we're making progress. \"Form bottom\" is our mandate into Display business. The phrase conveys the need to stabilize earnings and position ourselves to regain positive momentum. The critical first step is to return to moderate quarterly price declines for LCD glass. Today, I'm delighted to tell you that our quarter 2 price declines for LCD glass were indeed much more moderate than the previous 2 quarters' average. And just as important, we now believe price declines in quarter 3 will also be moderate. Now we need to continue to repeat this over the coming quarters while we execute our cost reduction projects.","We're also making progress on regaining positive momentum in Display, and this is all about new products for high-performance displays. We've introduced Lotus and Willow Glasses. We've now formed our new OLED venture in Korea, and we are shipping glass from that venture. And we're also shipping glass in our wholly-owned Display business for TFT metal oxide backplanes.","The \"march up\" portion of our plan is about capturing sales growth and expanding margins in Telecom, Environmental, Life Sciences and Specialty Materials with Gorilla. And we're also making progress against these objectives despite some macroeconomic headwinds.","So let me begin with our key messages this morning. First, LCD glass prices. Q1 call, I told you we had expected our glass price declines for the second quarter to be much more moderate than the average of the previous 2 quarters. As I said in my opening, but it bears repeating, price declines for LCD glass were indeed much more moderate in Q2, and we believe that price declines in Q3 will also be moderate. Second, as we assess the first half of the year for LCD glass, we see retail and supply chain statistics generally in line with our expectations.","Obviously, all is not perfect for the economies around the world, but unit growth, combined with area size increases for televisions, allowed us to keep our outlook for the 2012 retail glass market size.","On the supply chain front, we've come through Q2, always the trickiest quarter for Display, with inventories in line with our expectations.","Third, we told you in the last call, we are very alert for potential worsening economic headwinds. We are now experiencing those headwinds. We have seen lower sales of light-duty Environmental products principally in Europe, and we believe the economy could start to impact heavy-duty diesel soon. We've seen lower order rates than expected for some Telecom products, not fiber, but in connectivity products due to project slowdowns.","We've factored in these headwinds going forward, but as you'll see in a minute, our outlook for Q3 continues to include growth in most of our businesses.","So with that intro, I'll walk you through our Q2 results and Q3 outlook.","Second quarter sales were $1.9 billion. That was consistent with Q1 and down slightly from a year ago. Gross margin was 41.7%, just slightly lower than the first quarter, as expected. Lower gross margins in Display, driven primarily by the lower price, offset gross margin improvements elsewhere.","SG&A was up slightly on a dollar basis, while R&D spending was flat. Just as a reminder, we do grant our annual merit increases in Q2 in the United States, which drove some of the increases.","Equity earnings of $259 million were up about 19% sequentially compared to equity earnings of $218 million in Q1. Dow Corning drove most of the increase in sales growth in both silicons and polysilicon. Dow Corning results also included a favorable nonrecurring item of $11 million.","EPS, excluding special items, was $0.31, generally consistent with Q1 but a material decline from a year ago. EPS, as stated here, is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found on our website.","So now for our quarter 2 segment results, I'll start with Display. Display sales were $641 million in Q2, a decrease of 9% sequentially and down 16% versus last year. Volume was down in the mid-single digits, worse than our expectations of consistent, mainly due to lower utilizations of some large customers.","Price declines were more moderate, as expected. And the yen exchange rate was not a factor in comparing Q1 and Q2.","Volume in SCP was up in the mid single digit sequentially, which was better than expected. I'm pleased to say that SCP secured a multi-quarter deal with a customer, which gave them some additional volume in Q2.","Equity earnings at SCP's LCD glass business were $184 million in Q2, an increase of 1% versus the first quarter. For modeling purposes, SCP's second quarter LCD sales were $739 million, an increase of 1% from the first quarter. As a reminder, this represents SCP's LCD sales only. Our public filings report SCP total sales, which include CRT glass and other product sales.","I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing inventory levels in the supply chain, glass supply and demand and retail.","Our preliminary estimate of inventory at the end of Q2 was roughly 15.3 weeks. We think the supply chain built a little over 100 million square feet of inventory in the quarter. This number was in line exactly with our forecast. As a reminder, Q2 is the lowest quarter of retail all year long, so we always expect and experience inventory builds. The key is not to build too much.","Q2 is the quarter that has caused problems in the past. As of now, with the build meeting our expectations and with the number of weeks of inventory, it feels like the supply chain is okay heading into the back half of the year. As always, we'll continue to monitor inventory levels, especially as we progress through the third quarter, and we see panel utilization climbing in anticipation of the fall retail season.","Utilization rates in Taiwan are expected to increase on average from 70% to 75% in Q3. In Korea, we expect utilization rates to tick up slightly. In Japan, we expect utilizations to increase substantially from the sub-50% level that we experienced in Q2.","Now we believe glass supply and demand remains in balance. Tanks have been brought back online to support the anticipated seasonal Q3 increase in demand. We are running our wholly-owned capacity at high utilizations, driven by Gorilla Glass and the expected Q3 seasonal uptick. SCP continues to have capacity offline and tends to keep it so.","At this time, we would consider our glass inventory levels to be healthy. We actually came into Q2 on the low side of healthy, so we built a small amount of inventory in the wholly-owned business during the quarter.","Now moving to retail. Retail and supply chain statistics are generally in line with our expectations. We are sharing some preliminary data. It is a risk, as final data does differ sometimes, but with the uncertainty in the world's economies, we hope it will help investors.","I'd like to add that we look at both unit data and area data by geographic location. Unit data reveals the number of consumers purchasing, especially year-over-year. And it helps me think about the impact of the economy. Of course, we look at area data because in the end we sell by the square foot.","In the United States, we've actually seen positive unit growth rates all year. Unit growth rates are small as we'd expect in the developed economy that's fully penetrated. Year-to-date unit growth is 3%. Year-to-date area growth in the United States is 8%. These numbers are in line with our expectations.","Larger average screen size are driving the better area growth. In the U.S., 50-inch and above televisions are actually up 40% year-to-date. In Europe, unit demand was definitely weaker in the first quarter, but it has improved over the last 3 months. Year-to-date units are down 5%, and area is up 2%. The economic uncertainty makes forecasting difficult. We'd love to see recent months' performance continue.","As expected, year-over-year unit sales in Japan are down due to tough year-over-year comparisons with last year's eco-point promotions. We\u2019ll expect to see easier comparisons starting in the fourth quarter.","In China, we are seeing mixed performance. Now recall from the quarter 1 call that changing the time of New Year's holiday and promotion period made the early part of the year challenging to interpret. I told you the combined December to February units were up 15%. March and April were positive but not as strong. And as we all know now, the May holiday season's sales were weak.","We are pleased to see positive unit growth in June in the preliminary numbers. I feel our biggest risk in our television forecast is China, and we're closely tracking the situation. On the positive side, China has now implemented a new stimulus that we feel could help television sales in the back half of the year.","Emerging Asia and South America continue to show excellent growth year-over-year. In terms of PC demand for this year, we're paying attention to the weak results in Q2 reported by the industry. Our forecast for the year calls for desktops at 0% growth, notebook and netbooks at 7%, tablets at 50% growth. We do not expect any growth in the monitor market.","In terms of glass demand at retail, our estimate remains 3.6 billion square feet. As I mentioned on our January conference call, we have a variety of cases with retail demand being above or below the point estimate of 3.6 million square feet, driven primarily by different economic scenarios. We still expect the supply chain to lower weeks of inventory by about a half week by the end of the year. We expect the absolute amount of inventory to show a very slight increase year-over-year in square foot from the combination of retail growth, offset partially by the decline in weeks of inventory.","In terms of our migration to Eagle XG Slim, we continue to make excellent progress. We have now met our goal of more than half of our glass shipped being thin.","I'd like to comment on the new MOU announcement made on Tuesday relative to the new glass factory in China. Samsung and Corning are planning to invest in a new equity venture in China to supply LCD glass to the new Samsung Suzhou Gen 8 panel fab. This new entity has signed an MOU with the Wuxi New District in China on the intent to make this investment. The final agreements between Samsung and Corning need to be signed, and more importantly, we need to receive appropriate government approvals. The new glass factory will start production in line with Samsung\u2019s startup.","The ownership will be split 50-50 with Corning and Samsung. The capital will be funded by equity injections by Corning and Samsung and by loans. Corning's equity investment will be $100 million. The new company plans to invest up to $600 million in phases over the next few years. Now a portion of the equipment will actually be transferred from SCP. And as a reminder, SCP continues to have a significant capacity idled.","Lastly, I\u2019d comment on the high-performance displays. Samsung Corning Advanced Glass was officially established in the quarter, and we started shipping glass. We're pleased with the progress we've made establishing programs with panel makers. We hope to deliver a significant amount of Lotus Glass to multiple customers by year end.","Now Telecom sales were $559 million, up 10% sequentially versus our guidance of low to mid-teen growth. Growth was driven by enterprise and optical fiber and cable in North America and China. Compared to our expectations, we saw a slightly softer demand for optical fiber in EMEA and for legacy hardware products.","Net income was $36 million, up from $21 million in Q1 but down from $46 million a year ago. The increase from quarter 1 was driven by the sales increase and a nonrepeat of the $3 million impairment in Q1. Compared to a year ago, the decrease in net income largely reflects fixed cost increases, driven by investments for sales growth and some unfavorable product mix.","Our fiber sales set a record in 2011, and we believe the market is on track to grow 10% or more in 2012. The growth is fueled by wireless fiber-to-the-home and infrastructure investments in emerging markets and economic stimulus activities elsewhere. We're investing to meet this growth with investments in R&D for new products and capital-efficient processes that will expand our capacity.","In Environmental, sales were $249 million, down 5% sequentially, which was weaker than our expectations. Lower sales of light-duty diesel filters and substrates in Europe accounted for most of the sequential decline. Net income in Environmental was $34 million compared to $40 million in Q1 and $32 million in 2011. Year-over-year income was up 6% on slightly lower sales due to heavy-duty diesel gross margin improvement.","Specialty Materials sales were $296 million, up 3% sequentially and below our expectations. Gorilla sales were up in the quarter but less than we had anticipated. Forecasting sales in any given quarter in IT and handheld has proven difficult. A miss from expectations was due to a mix shift in orders late in the quarter that we could not react to. We will get those sales in Q3 and Q4. More on that outlook in a moment.","Net income was $34 million, up from $21 million in Q1. The increase was driven by continued improvement in Gorilla Glass margins.","In Life Sciences, Q2 sales were $162 million, up 5% sequentially and up from a year ago. Net income was $11 million, consistent with Q1 and down slightly versus a year ago. We continue to work with the government to get final antitrust approval for the BD acquisition. We continue to be optimistic we'll get that approval soon. More importantly, we remain very excited by the transaction.","Now moving to Dow Corning. Equity earnings were $61 million, up from $35 million in Q1. Dow Corning did have 2 small nonrecurring gains, which accounted for approximately $11 million improvement. Silicon sales were up slightly, and margins improved due to the manufacturing mix. Polysilicon sales were up driven by price. Poly margin also improved.","I'd like to pause here and comment on the recent developments in China on polysilicon. The Ministry of Commerce, MOFCOM, of the People's Republic of China has initiated a review of the United States and Korea-manufactured polycrystalline silicon in response to Chinese polysilicon manufacturers' allegation that companies like Hemlock Semiconductor Group have received unfair trade subsidies and may have been dumping product in the Chinese market. This review is part of a broader trade conflict, extending far beyond polysilicon solar industries, as an escalating number of trade disputes have been initiated throughout the globe in the last year. MOFCOM's investigation is expected to take 12 to 18 months. Therefore, at this time, it's premature to speculate on any potential financial impact to Hemlock Semiconductor or Dow Corning.","Dow Corning and Hemlock Semiconductor continue to work closely with government officials from the United States and China to express the need for trade policies that acknowledge the dynamics and opportunities in new and emerging global industry and are optimistic that a reasonable and mutual acceptable resolution is within reach.","Now turning to our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $6.3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Capital spending was $441 million in the quarter. We also made the equity contribution of $104 million to our new Samsung OLED equity venture. We had received a larger dividend from SCP in Q1, which essentially keeps Corning cash neutral on this new venture. We're actually going to follow the same procedure for the new LCD glass factory in China that will supply Samsung's new panel fab in China.","Free cash flow of the corporation for the quarter was a positive $27 million, and as a reminder, free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found on our website.","Now we also continued our share repurchase program during the second quarter. We repurchased $314 million in the quarter, a much higher rate than quarter 1 as we had guided you. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.2 billion in cash in the United States. As I mentioned in the Life Sciences section, we have not received FTC approval for the BD transaction yet. BD transaction will predominantly be a U.S. cash acquisition. If the transaction closes this year, our U.S. cash should end the year around $1.1 billion.","We expect capital spending for the year to be approximately $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Capital spending in 2013 should be lower but could be above our previous forecast of $1.3 billion if we decide to pursue new process technologies for high-performance displays.","So now I'd like to turn to our outlook, and I'll start with Display.","In the third quarter, the total volume of our wholly owned business and SCP should be up in the low double digits sequentially, as panel makers increase utilizations to supply the seasonally stronger retail demand in the second half. Customers in our wholly owned business have averaged lower utilization throughout the first half, so we expect volume at our wholly owned business to have more upside sequentially.","At SCP, volumes should be up sequentially as well. The obvious risks for volume are economic ones and sudden supply chain reductions. For glass pricing, as I've mentioned before, we expect our price declines to continue to be moderate in Q3.","Turning to Telecom. We expect sales to be consistent sequentially, in line with normal historical seasonal trends. We expect the demand to continue to be strong for fiber and cable and for enterprise solutions.","In Environmental, we expect sales to be flat to up slightly, driven by a seasonal uptick in light-duty vehicle builds.","Specialty Materials should have a very strong quarter, led by Gorilla Glass. We expect sales to be up 10% to 15% sequentially, led by growth in IT and handheld Gorilla sales.","In Life Sciences, we expect sales to be flat to up slightly.","At Dow Corning, we expect equity earnings to be down about 30%, driven primarily by the absence of the nonrecurring gains of $11 million in Q2 and seasonal plant shutdown-related expenses. We do expect Dow Corning to begin paying some dividends to Corning again in the third and fourth quarter.","Now continuing on with the rest of the corporate quarter 3 forecast, we expect gross margin to increase by almost a percentage point, driven by volume increases in Display. SG&A and R&D will be consistent as a percentage of sales in the third quarter. Equity earnings excluding special items should be down by about 10% sequentially. Our tax rate for the year is forecasted to be around 19%. For foreign exchange, the yen has been relatively stable in Q1 and Q2. We are hopeful there's no weakening. As a reminder, our results move with changes in the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate. A weaker yen lowers our results; a stronger yen helps. So if the yen averages 1 point higher or lower in Q3, we estimate our sales and net income would decrease or increase by approximately $7 million.","So that concludes my opening comments. Ann?","Ann H. S. Nicholson","Thank you, Jim. John, we'd now like to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first on the line, Rod Hall with JPMorgan.","Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. One, Jim, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about demand linearity to the quarter, how that progressed. Just trying to get a feel for how rapidly demand might be deteriorating, particularly in Europe and China. And then, I would also like to get some feel for the capacity situation out there. I think you said that you have more or less fully utilized capacity. Is that -- how does that compare to the 25% capacity you guys took offline a couple of quarters ago? Is most of that now reutilized? Or are you talking about more full utilization of the stuff that's already running? If you could just give us some update on that. And then lastly on the China JV, just a clarification. Are you guys going to guarantee the loans into that JV? Or can you give us some idea how the loan mechanics work into that operation?","James B. Flaws","Sure. So in reverse order, on the new Chinese venture, what's happening is Samsung and Corning are each putting in $100 million approximately. That will be funded for each of us by dividends out of SCP. And then the remainder of the funding, $600 million, and I emphasize that\u2019s spent over time, will come from loans from SCP to the new venture and, therefore, will not have any guarantee from Corning. So fundamentally, our cash going in is $100 million, and that's $100 million extra that we're getting out of dividends from SCP, which by the way is exactly what we did with the OLED venture. In terms of capacity, our wholly-owned capacity is running at high utilizations. That's driven by a combination of Gorilla and the uptick in LCD glass heading into Q3. However, if you recall, the original 25% included our worldwide capacity, and we still have significant capacity offline at SCP. In terms of demand linearity, I think your question was around Q2. And what we saw was weakening in light-duty filters in Europe, pretty much consistently starting in April. And in China, the weakness in cars was really with the shutdowns that occurred towards the end of Q2. In Telecom, we saw weakness throughout the quarter in Europe, principally in our legacy products.","Rod B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And Jim, just given you're seeing -- are you guys -- I mean you didn't say anything about your 230 million TV unit expectations for the full year. Is that something that's under consideration? Or do you think it still makes sense at this stage to keep that number?","James B. Flaws","I don't think our forecast was ever 230 million. It was in low 220s. I think there is some risk that it could be in the upper 2 teens. On the other hand, the flipside is from an area point of view, that's not hurting us because we actually have seen stronger average size television growth this year.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Ken, hope you feel better. Jim, just a question on the industry supply side. Do you think that the industry might consider and Corning might consider idling capacity after a near-term volume bounce in the  near-term considering the North American seasonality and possible rebound in China? Do you hold your capacity steady? And subsequently, what's the impact on price declines? Should we think about more moderate pricing declines to continue from now till year end? Or can we see a step function down if we -- if the supply chain further reduces their inventories?","James B. Flaws","So in terms of industry capacity utilization, obviously, our competitors will have to speak for themselves. But for Corning, we have the ability to throttle back relatively easily, but we always have a certain number of tanks that are coming up for their normal repair. And so to the degree that we saw in the fourth quarter the need to do that, we can do that relatively easily because there's always some tanks that we need to repair. In terms of pricing, I'm delighted by the Q3 pricing that we basically have reached agreement with almost all of our customers already. I'm not giving guidance for Q4 at this stage, but we're quite hopeful that we'll be able to again have Q4 pricing be moderate. Clearly, that's our goal.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then separately, just the Telecom business,  it seems to somewhat resilient. Does that -- does it feel that business might -- the trends there continue or do we come out somewhat peaked? And do they actually become impacted by the macro themselves on the Telecom side? Maybe your thoughts of Telecom sustainability maybe beyond the near term.","James B. Flaws","Well, the positive news for Telecom is that we think we're on the right side of the optical substitution transition with most of our products. And so compared to a lot of other Telecom equipment providers, we have that going for us. The flipside, we're not immune to the macro environment. We started to feel that, as I mentioned, in Europe, and we've started this -- we've seen some projects we expected to happen at a slower pace. But fundamentally, we feel very good about where we stand with our products. Demand for fiber remains very strong, particularly in China. We have good fiber-to-the-home visibility. The Australian project regrettably is starting slower than what we expected, and we probably should have remembered that because Verizon did also originally. But we feel pretty good about Telecom. I think our biggest worry would be Europe and Telecom.","Operator","And next, we'll go to with Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Ken, I hope you do better soon. Jim, can you address sort of the need to set up another LCD glass melting operation in China? I mean, you sort of characterized this market at the last Analyst Day as a mature market, sort of flattish over the next several years. I'm sure you have extensive analysis to support this, but can you share maybe what is the cost differential to a panel maker if you ship from Sakai, which is running at low capacity utilizations, or, frankly, SCP versus making it locally in China? And also, you have other operations in Beijing. Could you talk about the ramp up of that facility, too?","James B. Flaws","Yes, that's a very complicated question, so I'll take a shot at it. So as you recall in China, when the panel industry -- when the Chinese government requested applications from the panel industry to build several years ago, there were 9 applications, and I think 5 were approved. They have been phased, I think, appropriately by the various panel fab manufacturers on a very delayed manner. So we basically have BOE up and running. China Star is up and running, and none of the other new ones are really running. So Samsung had received approval for their Gen 8.5 panel fab. They have started construction, but it's on a much delayed basis from what they originally planned. This new facility is a small facility, and it's located very close to theirs. It will be built in phases and only as they need it. And so it's not like we're turning it all on at once. The same thing is true for our Beijing facility. We are actually going to write up the capacity in the second half of this year, but it will be on a very phased basis. We can ship in from Korea to Samsung. It would not come from our Japanese facility. And they could do that. I won't comment on the economics, but clearly, Samsung very much wanted to have a glass facility built there next to their fab. But we are going to be very, very careful on our managing our overall capacity. And I will comment that at SCP, we expect capacity to remain significantly idle with the loss of LG share.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","What equipment are you specifically expecting to move from SCP to China?","James B. Flaws","We\u2019re not giving out that detail at this stage.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And on the specialty side, sales came in a little below expectations. You alluded to a mix shift and others. Can you give us anything a little more specific over there? Was it just sort of the relative sizes that impacted volumes so you had more mix toward smartphones as opposed to tablets in the quarter?","James B. Flaws","I'm sorry, I'm not at liberty to give you more detail. I can just say that in the last month, we received a surprise that a customer wanted a different product shipped, and we had to scramble to try and make that, and we couldn't get it done in the month of June.","Wamsi Mohan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. The last one for me, have you seen any incremental activity in designs for Gorilla, particularly as it relates to automotive and anything related to Windows 8-based applications?","James B. Flaws","So in terms of auto, we are working with several car manufacturers and are quite hopeful that we'll get something designed in. As we've said before, the pace of the auto industry is quite a bit slower compared to consumer electronics. We are working with a number of people on touch devices, and I think people are hopeful about the impact of Windows 8. But I really can't give you any quantity forecast.","Operator","Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jim, when we're going over your commentary on sort of ASPs and sort of progression in terms of the marketplace, it does seem as though the shares issue that you folks were dealing with earlier this year and late last year now seems to be behind you folks. Is that an appropriate characterization?","James B. Flaws","Yes, I mean, it's very obvious that we lost significant share in LG last year. That's no secret. that was the customer. But I think, by and large, we think shares have been relatively stable. I mean, in any given quarter, they can move up and down a little, particularly because some customers may run at higher utilizations than others. But right now, we think the share situation is relatively stable, and it is our goal to maintain our share.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So going forward, in terms of your expectation, you don't see any potential additional sort of potholes or anything along those lines that could cause material fluctuation in terms of your share?","James B. Flaws","I'm not expecting any. I don't have a perfect crystal ball, Amir, but I would say that I'm not aware of that. And I think what I'm delighted by our Display team in heading into quarter 3 has reached agreement with our customers. We're quite hopeful that with the utilizations ticking up in Japan, that will be good for us. So I'm not expecting any share potholes. And as I said, our goal is to maintain our worldwide share. And in any given quarter, it can move up and down a couple of points. But generally, that's what we expect to have happen.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful, Jim. And then in thinking about sort of overall demand environment, you did mention that you expect utilization to pick up in the back half of this year as we head into the fall selling season. What are your expectations around the fall selling season and the holiday selling season this year? I mean, are you expecting embedded in your guidance sort of typical seasonality? Or are you taking it a notch lower with respect to the current macro environment?","James B. Flaws","I think it varies region by region. U.S., we're expecting to see relatively consistent unit growth. We're expecting to see the area -- the larger televisions do better, as they have all year long. I think the place, as I indicated in my comments, that we have the most concerns about would be China as to what the growth rate there will be in the back half of the year. And then it's not -- in China, as you know, it's not a traditional fall retail season like it is in the United States and Europe. And I think that's the one that we're most concerned about. In Europe, we\u2019re not looking for robust unit sales, although as I mentioned, we were delighted that the last 3 months have been year-over-year units have been up. And the area even more strongly in Europe, so that's good news.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, Jim. And then lastly, we've seen you folks put some of your cash to work either through acquisitions. Obviously, we are seeing some of the setups on the JV side, as well as a pickup in terms of your buyback this quarter. In the past, you guys have mentioned that you're going to be more proactive around utilizing your cash balance. Any other developments that we could expect to hear on that front as you're thinking at all a change with respect to using your cash on sort of shareholder return initiatives or anything along those lines?","James B. Flaws","I have nothing to announce today. I mean, we still have some money left on our share repurchase. Obviously, we'd love to close the BD deal. We are looking at some smaller acquisitions from time to time in Telecom, but there's nothing imminent. So you shouldn't be looking for any announcement right away. But we are very alert to trying to improve shareholder returns. And so I'm sure we'll be discussing that as the year progresses.","Operator","And we'll go to Steven Fox with Cross Research.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","I have 2 questions, Jim. First of all, in terms of the outlook for the wholly-owned glass business. Is -- things are being driven more by 1 or 2 customers, especially one that's underutilized into the third quarter? And then secondly, the Gorilla glass outlook, any color you can provide in terms of unit versus area? In other words, are you seeing it being driven more by tablets in the second half or at least in this coming quarter? Any color on those 2 issues would be helpful.","James B. Flaws","I don't have any unit data that I can give you on Gorilla, I'm sorry. In terms of outlook for our utilization, our wholly-owned business, it's -- we obviously are expecting, as I indicated, a significant increase in Japan, but we are seeing utilization ramp already at our Taiwanese customers and in China. So it's really relatively across-the-board in our wholly-owned business. Obviously, there are some customers we have stronger positions with. And when they ramp up, it helps us more.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","Great. And then maybe just to ask the Gorilla Glass question a different way. Relative to your expectations for the quarter going forward, how are you factoring in the economic environment into the demand for handheld devices where Gorilla\u2019s designed in?","James B. Flaws","We're -- as you know, we have difficulty forecasting Gorilla. And on the positive side, as we continue to feel smartphones are growing, we continue to feel touch is prevalent on smartphones, we are not feeling any competitive loss there. The downside is we can't -- it's hard for us to tell whether the economy is in fact going to impact phone sales. We think tablet sales are relatively strong. We're -- there obviously are, from time to time, model changes that influence quarters, but we're not sensing economic weakness in the Gorilla business. But it is a very difficult business for us to track because the supply chain is much more complicated","than it is in Display.","Steven Bryant Fox - Cross Research LLC","Fair enough. And of course, I'll make [indiscernible] to Ken and his family.","Operator","Our next question is from Amitabh Passi with UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jim, I think this morning, one of your Japanese competitors reported and guided for flat volume in the September quarter versus your low double-digit increase. Should we take that to mean that you're potentially getting share in the third quarter relative to your competitors? And what does that imply in terms of downside risk to pricing as we move through the rest of the year? And then just as a follow-up, you talked about some capacity still left in your share buyback plan. Can you just remind us how much is left in your buyback plan?","James B. Flaws","On the latter question, I think about $300 million is left in the existing buyback program. On our competitor's announcement this morning, I think you should talk to them. I think the thing for you to think about analytically is their customer portfolio and what's happening with their customers versus what's happening with our customers. I do not anticipate that we are going to experience anything other than moderate price declines, as we talked about.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jim, a couple of questions. First on Dow Corning, a little bit aside from the current conversation. Did I hear you correctly in saying that volumes and margins were up, competitors like Wacker saw them down, and kind of expect from the macro that Dow Corning should be doing probably a little bit worse? So just trying to understand the correlation. I know there was the one-time. But in terms of revenue, it sounds as though revenue was doing better there. So I wanted to understand if I misunderstand something, or is something else is going on there that maybe one-time-ish in nature, or what's kind of the difference there? Then on SCP, I think you mentioned something about signing a multi-quarter deal with, I believe, it was a new customer. I'm not sure if it was a new customer or an existing customer. But if you could give us some more clarity on that, that would be great. And then, can you give us an update on the Gorilla side, how the yield improvements are impacting your long-term growth? I understand that in the near term, there was an impact to mix in Q2 that you couldn't supply, and therefore, that might be why it's so strong in Q3. But if we expand over multiple quarters -- if you can help us correlate your previous comments on yield improvements over the last couple of quarters to what we should be expecting for Gorilla going forward.","James B. Flaws","So I'll try to get those questions. So on Gorilla, over time, our customers are improving their yields as they take our glass and finish it. We do not believe that yield improvement had any impact on the Q2. We think we had more significant impact from yields last year, and we think it's a more gradual improvement. The comment on Q2 was really around a mix related with customers changing their orders from one thing to another very late in the quarter, and we just couldn't react quickly enough. At SCP, it's an existing customer that we signed a multi-quarter deal with. At Dow Corning, Dow Corning is a complicated company, but our silicone business had volume increases and also had the benefit of, thankfully, some lower raw material costs structure. On the polysilicon side, what we saw was slightly higher prices in the quarter. Polysilicon, which is perhaps the one that has more comparisons to Wacker, is a -- it's a very difficult industry to predict right now because of the -- what's going on in the solar industry. But we think that Hemlock did quite well in the most recent quarter. But it's a really hard industry to predict right now.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. As a follow-up, is it the -- was the mix shift in Q2 that's causing the strong growth into Q3? Or is it the seasonal trend?","James B. Flaws","I'm sorry, what? Relative to Gorilla?","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Correct. Your guidance for Q3 is strong for Gorilla. I'm wondering if that's seasonal or that's because you couldn't meet some demand in Q2 because the late quarter mix shift, and therefore, that just got pushed into Q3 and we're seeing sort of a one-time bump?","James B. Flaws","No, we don't believe it's a one-time bump. We think it's related to strong end market demand for our products or our customers\u2019 products using the glass.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So we should be assuming that, that -- the yield improvement story that was an issue before, is less of an issue, like you said before, and therefore, we should be assuming nice strong growth for Gorilla going forward?","James B. Flaws","I hope so.","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My first question has to do kind of just a bigger picture. Jim, as you look at the capacity expansions, can help people better understand the concern about excess supply coming into the industry of glass as there's quite a bit of idled capacity today? And we know we hear you talk about coming in with very measured ramps. But can you talk to us about the strategy of going into China? Is it more so that the customers are kind of strong arming you into it? Or how come this industry just isn't going into permanent oversupply?","James B. Flaws","On the case of our new venture in China, our customers are partnered with Samsung. And this has been known -- we actually have talked about this for quite a while. I think investors kind of hoped it wouldn't happen, but we've always known it would happen at some point. Clearly, Samsung will make their own announcements about the timing of their panel fab there, but I think you should expect this not to be a sudden giant increase in capacity for the panel or the glass industry. We're building a factory that supplies Samsung. It's a small factory. It's going to be relatively close to them. We're going to be very measured about how fast we ramp the -- we spend the money first and ramp the tanks. We're doing the exact same thing in Beijing. We're being very measured about how we bring up the capacity. I don't think you should expect us to do any further capital spending for glass in Korea or in our wholly-owned business in Japan or Taiwan. I think any capacity increases that we\u2019ll get over the longer sweep of time will be around our productivity principally from thin. I think that\u2019s by and large -- my observation is probably true for the industry as a whole. I don't think you're going to be seeing a lot of new footprint there. So you shouldn't be thinking that this glass factory in China is very big. And I will remind you that we are -- there's a significant amount of capacity in Korea that is offline and likely to stay offline.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then as my quick follow-up, when you mentioned that gross margins for the company in total was going to increase about 1 percentage point, I mean, that's pretty good news. Is the strength behind that mostly driven by the increase of your wholly-owned utilization? Or is it a combination of other factors? I mean, the strength from the wholly-owned glass side of Display?","James B. Flaws","It's clearly the wholly-owned business with good volume growth this upcoming quarter. And again, moderate price decline should help our gross margin.","Operator","And next, we'll go to George Notter with Jefferies.","George C. Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess I was curious about the decision to formulate a joint venture with Samsung in China. I think you certainly have the option to try to take that business through your wholly-owned division. What was the rationale there? Any flavor would be helpful.","James B. Flaws","Well, I think we've talked about before, for Samsung, on our original agreement, which is now almost 20 years old with them, they have the right if they wanted to put a panel operation in China that SCP could ship into them in combination -- consultation with them, we decided the better answer would be to build a new venture there, a small one, and supply directly, rather than ship in from Korea. But I'm not at liberty to give you much more detail than that. But they always had the right to self-supply their panel fab in China from way back in 1995, when the original agreement was put in place.","Operator","Our next question is from Carter Shoop of Keybanc Capital Markets.","Steve Cho - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","This Steve Cho filling in for Carter. Can you guys talk about how your Environmental Tech division is positioned for the transition towards natural gas for the heavy-duty trucks next year?","James B. Flaws","We're not expecting much a significant switch in that at this stage. But clearly, it could have an impact on the demand going forward because you don't need a diesel particulate filter. But we're not expecting a significant shift at this point in time.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, I think you mentioned that half of your glass is now thin. Do you have an expectation of where that might be by year end or by next year? And then secondly, on the China JV, how much capacity do you think that will add to your combined wholly-owned and SCP capacity? And also, when you talk about the $100 million investment there, is that just a net reduction in your free cash flow? Or is there any other aspect to that, that you can have by reducing your capital intensity elsewhere?","James B. Flaws","So on investment in the new glass venture there, what you will see is higher dividend from SCP, for an extra $100 million, sometime in the back half of the year, and then we will turn around and put that into the equity portion of the new China factory. That is the only Corning financial impact, and so it's essentially neutral at free cash flow over the course of the back half of the year. I don't have the exact timing of which quarter it will fall, but we could get the dividend in one quarter and the investment in another. But essentially, it's neutral to our free cash flow for the new venture. In terms of thin, we are not giving out a forecast, but we continue to expect that every quarter the percentage of glass going thin will increase, and it will do so again next year and the year after. Ultimately, we'll get to a point where almost all the glass will be thin.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And in terms of how much your capacity will increase overall with the China JV?","James B. Flaws","It's a very small number. We\u2019re not giving out the exact number, but it\u2019s a very small number.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Two questions, Jim. First, how should we think about the mix between the Gorilla Glass 1 and the Gorilla Glass 2? Is there a qualification cycle? Or is it a seamless replacement? And then is it fair to assume that 2013 will be a majority of Gorilla Glass 2? And then I have a follow-up.","James B. Flaws","The answer to the latter is yes, it is. What we find is the transition is generally around a model change. People very rarely have an existing model that has one glass in it and then they will change to another. So we've been going through this, but the transition is going seamlessly, and customers are enthusiastic about Gorilla Glass 2.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes. In this year, do you think -- can you give us some idea about the mix between Gorilla Glass 1 and 2, please, for this year?","James B. Flaws","We're not disclosing that. I'm sorry.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Then just a quick follow-up. You gave some thoughts on the stimulus in China for the second half of this year, but you also mentioned there is some risk from China. If you look at the track record in terms of what the stimulus has done in China, there's a big uptick in LCD a few years ago. So can you kind of give in that context how do you see in terms of how things are most likely to play out this time versus the last time?","James B. Flaws","So it's a tricky thing to judge because when that stimulus was done 3 years ago, originally, the penetration of LCDs was much slower than it was today. But it's our belief that this will have some impact because the spread of LCDs is still moving -- I'd characterize it kind of westward in the country. And so we think it will be positive, but maybe not as big of a pop as what we experienced when they rolled it out 3 years ago.","Ann H. S. Nicholson","John, I think we have time for a couple more questions.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna International.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","2 questions. One on balance sheet. Jim, how should we think about the free cash flow, either in terms of absolute value or margin in the second half of the year? And I have a follow-up.","James B. Flaws","We expect free cash flow -- it's really 2 components. So I'll first say that we think operating cash flow will continue to be excellent in the third and fourth quarter. The free cash flow, it will all depend on the timing of the closing of the BD transaction. So if it closes in the third quarter, it's obviously a very big outflow. If it plays to the fourth quarter, it would affect that one. But other than that, we expect strong operating cash flow, and I don't think our capital spending will be all that different in the quarters going forward.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Sure. But on the blended basis for the second half, should we expect the free cash flow margin up like mid single digit?","James B. Flaws","I'm sorry. We're not quantifying the forecast of free cash flow.","Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then moving on to your comment about the TV -- total number of TV shipment for this year, low 220 million, to what -- to some -- to what extent are you concerned that there may have been demand pull-in due to Olympics or do we need to -- do you -- even focusing on this given how Olympics have played into the TV shipment in the prior years?","James B. Flaws","It's always typical for us to judge exactly sporting events and the impact on television demand. I would say compared to prior Olympics, you remember the Chinese Olympics, I would say there is much less talk about the Olympics being a big driver of televisions this year. We do suspect that there was some influence because of European soccer earlier this year. It may have had a little bit of influence. But we're not expecting as much of an impact from this Olympics as we did in 2008 with the Chinese Olympics.","Operator","And our final question will be from the line of Andrew Huang with Sterne Agee.","Andrew Huang - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought I heard you say that SCP would be transferring some equipment from Korea to Suzhou for the new JV. So first, is that correct? And can we take that to mean that there would be very little net increase in glass capacity?","James B. Flaws","They are transferring a small amount of equipment. But as I've said several times now, that capacity from this new facility, which is still quite a ways in the future, is not a very large amount.","Andrew Huang - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-on question, I think you mentioned at the last minute, there was a change in demand for Gorilla Glass. Can you give us a little more color on what that change was?","James B. Flaws","We have a customer who had ordered a particular products in Gorilla and then reduced that and changed -- and mixed into other products. And we were not able to respond quite fast enough.","Ann H. S. Nicholson","Thanks, Andrew, and thank you, Jim. Thank you all for joining us today. A playback of the call -- I'm sorry, Jim, go ahead.","James B. Flaws","We've got one more announcement before we wrap up. We do have one IR announcement. We'll be speaking at the Citi Technology Conference on Thursday, September 6, in New York City.","I'd just like to offer one summary comment about our quarter. I think we're making progress on our plan to form bottom in Display. We had one quarter of moderate price declines behind us, and we're executing on another quarter of that. We'll only know for sure when we see bottom in the rearview mirror, but I actually feel good about our progress so far.","Our other businesses are on track to grow sales and improve profitability. Obviously, we're not happy with increasing economic headwinds affecting some of them, worries that economic headwinds make the march-up results perhaps be slightly smaller. So we can't control the world's economies, but we can control our costs, and we tend to do so if we see more weakness. We look forward to updating you at the end of quarter 3. Ann?","Ann H. S.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Division Vice President of Investor Relations, Ann Nicholson. Please go ahead.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Corning, Inc.","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Corning's third quarter 2016 conference call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.","Before we begin our formal comments, I'd like to remind you that today's remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Thank you, Ann. Good morning, everyone. As you saw in this morning's press release, we had a great third quarter. Sales and gross margins increased in every business segment year-over-year. We also grew the company's sales, net income and EPS, both sequentially and year-over-year. Core EPS was $0.42, up 14% sequentially and 24% year-over-year.","On earlier calls, we told you that we expected our momentum to build steadily throughout 2016, and it has. For the fourth quarter, we expect, again, to see a year-over-year growth in sales, net income, and EPS. Our operating results and our progress on key growth initiatives continue to reinforce our confidence in Corning's strategy.","On our earnings call one year ago, we introduced our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework. We design the framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength. The framework includes a commitment to delivering at least $12.5 billion to shareholders, while investing $10 billion in growth opportunities through 2019.","As a reminder, we focus 80% of our portfolio on three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms. We believe that this focus reduces the cost of innovation, increases our likelihood of success, and attracts some of the world's leading companies to our ecosystem, because they see how our unique expertise can help address some of their toughest challenges.","We are very pleased with the progress on our framework. Since its introduction a year ago, we've gained traction with our customers on our growth initiatives, realigned our interest in Dow Corning and are on track to distribute $6 billion to shareholders by the end of 2016. Achievements on the framework this quarter include the launch of the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase, which we expect to conclude in the fourth quarter, significant new product introductions, and progress on several of our new growth initiatives. Let's look at a few examples.","In our mobile consumer electronics market-access platform, our goal is to double sales despite the maturing of the IT and handheld markets. We do this primarily by introducing products that advance the state-of-the-art. This allows us to capture a price premium and to win in new places like wearables and phone backs. We introduced two of these innovative products during the third quarter, Gorilla Glass 5 and Gorilla Glass SR+.","Gorilla Glass 5 has up to 1.8x better damage resistance than Gorilla Glass 4. And delivers up to 4x improvement in drop height to failure versus competitive glass designs. We are seeing superior drop performance translate into a meaningful price premium versus Gorilla Glass 4 and the opportunity to expand the use of Gorilla. Given that drop performance is the number one want from consumers, it's not surprising the traction at our customers has been strong. We are very pleased with the rate of adoption in just three months.","Next, Gorilla Glass SR+ delivers an unparalleled combination of toughness, scratch resistance, and optical clarity for today's wearable devices. You'll find SR+ on the Samsung Gear 3 later this year.","In our automotive market-access platform, we seek to build a gorilla sized automotive glass business and also to create a significant new business around gas particulate filters.","Let's start with the automotive glass opportunity, where our excitement continues to grow. Previously, we focused most of our commentary on the advantages of Gorilla Glass for car windows. But designers of connected and autonomous vehicles are likely to dramatically increase the use of glass and touchscreens in auto interiors. Gorilla Glass provides a unique path to deliver curved designs cost-effectively, and creates a great new opportunity for us.","Examples were featured recently at the Paris Auto Show inside the Renault Trezor concept car and also at the Faurecia booth in a curved, full-glass center console called Smart Pebbles. Both OEMs promoted their use of \"ultra-tough Corning Gorilla Glass\", and received significant media coverage. A reporter commented that the Trezor's dashboard is a big, curved OLED display made from Gorilla Glass that controls most car functions and possesses a design DNA that will be passed on to the French automaker's future models.","Moving to gas particulate filters, or GPFs. You've seen major car manufacturers announce that they will equip vehicles with GPFs to meet the Euro VI regulation. We've won the majority of platforms awarded to-date, and we expect sales to begin ramping in 2017.","As a reminder, no GPFs are used in commercially available vehicles today. Consistent with OEM announcements, we believe that GPFs will be required to control particulate emissions from gasoline direct injection engines.","CDI engines offer both higher performance and better fuel economy and as a result, have grown to about a quarter of passenger car sales worldwide, with units growing in the high teens annually. We expect gas particulate filters to become a significant business for Corning. They offer the potential to increase our sales opportunity per vehicle by a factor of 3 to 4 with profitability similar to our current business.","Today, sales of GPFs are insignificant. However, in line with our commitment to invest $10 billion in growth opportunities, our investment on GPF is ramping in tandem with customer commitments. So, you will see both cost on our P&L and capital expenditures in the near term as we seek to build another significant business within our automotive market-access platform.","In our Optical Communications market-access platform, our goal is to grow at least twice as fast as telecom industry CapEx. We plan to do this by focusing on high-growth segments and by delivering integrative solutions that offer new levels of performance and reduce our customers' costs. Optical Communications is now a fully evolved example of our Focus 345 (11:17) portfolio.","We began more than 40 years ago by leveraging our deep knowledge of optical physics, glass science and vapor deposition to disrupt the telecommunications industry with optical fiber. Over time, we increased our value-add by leveraging ceramics, extrusion, and precision forming. We're now working with customers on glass motherboards based on our fusion platform. Today, we are reaping the benefits of this unique combination of capabilities in segments like fiber-to-the- home and hyper-scale data centers.","We're also seeing the benefits of our approach in the wireless arena. For example, in August, the Atlanta Falcons Chief Technology Officer announced that Atlanta's new Mercedes-Benz Stadium will use the Corning ONE platform as a single optical network core that integrates Wi-Fi, cellular and video. We will be providing 4000 miles of optical cable and 1400 Wi-Fi access points. Now, what gets me excited about wins like this is not the size, which is certainly impressive, but instead, it's that the skill sets underlying the Corning ONE platform are directly applicable to the emerging opportunities in 5G wireless. And more to come on innovations in this space.","In summary, under the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework, we are utilizing our financial strength both to return capital to shareholders and also to invest in growth through research and development, capital expansion, and M&A. Since we introduced the framework a year ago, we have returned a total of $5.6 billion to shareholders in dividends and buybacks, reducing outstanding shares by about 18% and increasing the dividend by 12.5%. We believe that our investments will allow us to deliver secular growth over the long term, while consistently returning significant sums to our shareholders.","Tony will now provide a more detailed review of our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook. Tony?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. As we noted in today's press release, our Q3 core results reflected the sequential and year-over-year improvement we expected. We were very pleased with our strong operating performance. Sales and gross margins were up in every segment year-over-year and our net income and earnings per share were up significantly. Looking ahead, we see year-over-year sales, net income, and EPS growth in the fourth quarter.","Before I get into the details of our core performance and outlook, I wanted to briefly note that the primary difference between our GAAP and core results for the third quarter is, again, a non-cash mark-to-market loss.","As we have discussed previously, GAAP accounting requires earning translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at their current value in the current quarter, even though those contracts will not settle in the current quarter.","Consequently, in this quarter, we marked our contracts to market again as required by GAAP resulting in a GAAP loss of $150 million. The loss in this quarter was significantly smaller than we saw in the first two quarters of the year because the yen exchange rates moved less. And to be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.","We remain very pleased with the results of our hedging program and the economic certainty it delivers. Since the inception of this strategy, we have received cash totaling $1.2 billion under hedge contracts. These proceeds offset much of the currency related decline in Display's earnings due specifically to the weaker yen.","At present, we have hedged approximately 70% of our projected yen exposure through 2022 at a blended rate of approximately JPY 106 per dollar. For investors who are concerned that a weakening yen would negatively impact our business, hedging, earnings and cash flow through 2022 substantially mitigates that concern.","Now for investors who have additional questions, please refer to the more extensive discussion in our first and second quarter conference call or the tutorial on FX hedge accounting on the Digital Media Disclosure section of our Investor Relations website. And as always, Ann and her team are available after the call.","Now let's turn to the results for the third quarter. As a reminder, these are core performance metrics. Sales in the quarter were $2.55 billion, up 4% versus last year and exceeding our expectations. The growth was driven largely by strong performance in Optical Communications.","Corporate gross margin was 43%, on track with guidance and well ahead of last year. The year-over-year improvement largely reflected improved profitability in Optical Communications and good cost performance in Display.","SG&A was 13% of sales at $328 million. RD&E costs were 7% of sales at $187 million. Total gross equity earnings were $19 million. Recall, we closed on the realignment of Dow Corning on May 31, so third quarter equity earnings predominantly reflect our equity earnings from Hemlock. And our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%.","Net income was $466 million, up 7% sequentially and 4% from last year's third quarter. Adjusting for the former Dow Corning's silicone's business equity earnings, which no longer contribute to our results, net income grew 16% on the 4% sales growth. This reflects our strong underlying financial performance. EPS was $0.42, up 24% versus last year and above expectations.","Now let's turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $4.8 billion of cash. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of common shares outstanding. And adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter was $721 million, up significantly over Q1 and Q2, as expected, and driven primarily by higher core net income. Now, consistent with history, we expect Q4 operating cash flow to be up sequentially. We expect the increase to be driven primarily by a reduction in working capital and other cash receipts.","Now let's look at the detailed segment results and the outlook for each business, beginning with Display Technologies. Display had a very strong third quarter, exceeding our expectations. Looking ahead, we continue to expect the 2016 glass market and our volume to be up mid-single digits for the full year. As you would expect, there are a few puts and takes at retail versus our expectations. But the biggest driver of the growth remains TV screen size, which is tracking solidly to be more than 1.5 inches of year-over-year growth.","In the third quarter, the set makers pulled very hard for panels ahead of the Q4 peak retail season. Our customers, the panel makers, increased their utilizations to meet this demand, which resulted in additional sequential growth for the glass market. The glass market was up high single digits sequentially versus our expectations that the glass market would be up mid-single-digits sequentially. Our glass volume was up slightly more than the glass market due to customer mix.","For the ninth consecutive quarter, the decline in LCD glass pricing remained moderate and met the expectations we noted last quarter. These drivers produced the strong results for our Display business in the third quarter, with sales up 7% and net income up 14% sequentially. And forward-looking weeks of supply chain inventory remain at a healthy level and panel maker inventories remain lean.","As I already said, we expect the 2016 glass market and our volume will be up mid-single digits for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we expect panel maker utilization to remain high and glass supply to remain tight. So we could see Q4 glass volume consistent with Q3. But in light of the third quarter upside, it only follows that our fourth quarter volume may be down slightly. Therefore, while our overall guidance for the year remains unchanged, our guidance for the fourth quarter glass volume is consistent to down slightly sequentially. And we will watch this closely as the quarter unfolds.","In the fourth quarter, we expect LCD glass prices to decline moderately and be more moderate than Q3. And we expect that the moderate pricing environment we've experienced over the last nine quarters will continue or even improve for two reasons. First, we monitor utilization, in-market demand and other market factors very closely, and all of those indicate the glass supply should remain tight for the balance of the year and into 2017, especially in large gem (22:51) sizes as a result of the strong TV demand. We will manage our operating capacity to our demand and maintain our stable share strategy.","And second, our competitors' profitability is low. Even though prices declines have been moderate for two years now, their profitability has remained low during that period. Therefore, we expect that their price declines will slow down further as they try to remain profitable. For these and other reasons, we continue to believe that sequential pricing will be better for us going forward.","Let's move to Optical Communications. Overall, we are pleased with the growth in Optical Communications in the third quarter and expect strong growth again in Q4. Third quarter sales were $795 million, up 6% versus last year, with fiber-to-the-home very strong. While our growth in Optical Communications was strong on an absolute basis, we missed our own guidance because growth in hyper-scale data center projects was below expectations.","Note that our sales for our large hyper-scale data center range from $5 million-$10 million, so delay of a single project can reduce total segment growth by more than 1 percentage point. We remain well positioned to capture secular long-term growth in the hyper-scale segment.","Net income at $98 million was up 38% over last year. Improved manufacturing cost and favorable shift towards sales of our solution products contributed to the higher year-over-year profitability. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to grow in the high single digits year-over-year, led by continued fiber-to-the-home strength. We expect hyper-scale sales to continue growing faster than overall Optical Communications segment, but at a rate lower than we anticipated earlier in the year.","In Environmental, Q3 sales were up 3% versus last year and slightly ahead of expectations. Sales of light-duty substrates for auto were a record, up 17% year-over-year, driven by continued strong demand in North America, Europe, and China and additional platform mix. This strength was offset by continued weakness for heavy-duty products in North America and China. Note, we expect the market for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be down 30% this year.","Net income declined $3 million year-over-year, in line with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be down low single digits versus Q4 last year, as weakness continues in the heavy-duty truck markets.","Let's move to Specialty Materials, where both sales and net income were ahead of our expectations. Year-over-year, Q3 sales increased 2% and net income was consistent. Compared to the second quarter, Q3 sales grew 11%, while net income was impacted by ramp-up costs associated with the launch of new products and customer mix. With the majority of the launch spend behind us, we expect fourth quarter profitability to improve.","Earlier, Wendell noted that we introduced Gorilla Glass 5 and Gorilla Glass SR+ in the third quarter. Just last week, Chinese OEM, OPPO, announced Gorilla Glass 5 on its R9s and R9s Plus smartphones. And you can expect to see them on additional devices in the coming months. Volume growth of Gorilla Glass is expected to drive the high single-digit year-over-year sales growth we expect for the segment in the fourth quarter.","In Life Sciences, Q3 sales were $214 million and met our expectations for low-single digit growth. Net income was $21 million. And we expect Q4 sales to be up low-single digits versus last year.","Now I'll cover additional items in our fourth quarter outlook. On a consolidated basis, we expect our fourth quarter gross margins to be consistent with Q3 at 43%, which is up 1 percentage point from last year's fourth quarter. Our view reflects the higher sales we expect in Optical Communications and year-over-year cost reductions in Display.","SG&A and RD&E spending should be approximately 14% and 8% of sales, respectively. And we expect other income\/other expense to be a net expense of approximately $40 million.","Now we expect total gross equity earnings to be between $75 million and $85 million. This is higher than some analysts were modeling, driven by higher sales from Hemlock's solar business as customers complete their annual contract commitments. Versus last year, Hemlock's contributions to our net income is expected to be up $10 million to $15 million. And we expect our effective tax rate for 2016 to be approximately 15%","Let me close by saying that we are very pleased with the strong sequential and year-over-year growth in sales and earnings in the third quarter, and we expect similarly strong year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter.","Other than Optical Communications, all of our businesses met or exceeded expectations. While we do not expect Optical Communications to grow quite as fast as our prior guidance for the back half of the year, we are still delighted with high single digit growth and believe that we remain well positioned to continue growing more than twice the rate of the overall telecom industry.","Stepping back, our performance demonstrates the benefits of the Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework introduced last fall. Under that framework, we expect to generate more than $26 billion through 2019. We will invest $10 billion to grow and sustain our leadership. We also plan to distribute more than $12.5 billion to our shareholders and we will have returned $6 billion by year-end. We are focusing our portfolio to increase our probability of success, reduce the cost of innovation, and increase the barriers to entry for our competition, and we have a rich set of growth opportunities.","Overall, we feel very good about where we are. With that, let's move to Q&A. Ann?","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Corning, Inc.","Thank you, Tony. Greg, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. Your first question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Vijay, your line is open. Please go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, hello?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Hi, Vijay. You've got the line open, buddy.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hi. Sorry, I was on mute. My apologies. So solid results here. My question honestly is on the Optical business and on hyper-scale cloud demand. Like to get your clarity on how should we model and think about cloud customer demand heading into the next quarter and also into fiscal 2017? Thanks.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","So from an overall standpoint, obviously we were disappointed in the third quarter because it wasn't quite as strong as we had expected. We were still up on a year-over-year basis, and as we move into Q4, it's also not going to be quite as strong as we expected. Again, it will be up year-over-year, but it won't be quite as strong as we expected. So our guidance of being up high-single digits reflect that.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","And I think the way to think about it is, boy, it's hard to call within a couple of percent because just a couple of these hyper-scale data centers moving from one quarter to the next or changing in their overall build plan can really move those percents around a lot. But over the sort of the sweep of time, we feel good about our position there, and if you are a believer, as we are, that there's going to be a lot more hyper-scale data centers built, then we're going to grow with that. Calling the exact timing of these construction projects is not the easiest thing to do, as we just demonstrated.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So a quick follow-on would be, could we still anticipate the cloud customers directionally to be kind of a key growth driver for the Optical business, or is it quite lumpy, you don't know, and we should kind of focus more on fiber-to-the-home? Thanks.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Well, I think that depends on what you like best, right? So, I think, definitely this is an area that's going to be a key growth driver. Is it going to be uniform and smooth? No. But then again, fiber-to-the-home also can have these projects related flows. So, in general, we look at both as being two megatrends that are going to drive demand for our product and also where our market-access and our shares are quite strong. So I think both of those are worth paying attention to, Vijay.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Yeah, solid results overall.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Clark from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First one is on the glass business. You mentioned in the prepared remarks tight glass supply in the fourth quarter, but volume still being flat to down slightly. Does that set-up for 2017 where we're in an environment where inventories are still fairly low and we could see further restocking?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Yeah. So I think as we look out at inventories right now, we think that the value chain inventories are healthy and set makers clearly are counting on a strong Q4 retail season and they've been pulling hard on the panel makers and we've seen that, and we continue to see high glass supply. And we think that's going to continue throughout the fourth quarter. So, if set makers are right about the retail season, we feel pretty good about how we enter into next year. And right now, we're right at the beginning of that retail season, and so it's always the hardest time to know and be able to predict, but we're all paying very close attention to that.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That makes sense. On pricing as well, I think you talked about an additional moderation in pricing in the fourth quarter. We've gotten the question, I'm just kind of curious on your opinions on this, has the FX environment in any way impacted your discussions over pricing, particularly into the beginning of the year?","And then second question and slightly unrelated, but in the Gorilla Glass business, any impact from the Note 7 recall, knowing that that was a Gorilla Glass 5 product?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Sure. Let me start with the answer on from a yen standpoint. Clearly, the yen from a customer standpoint does have an impact, and of course, customers always ask for lower prices when we're having discussions with them. But I think when you think about it from an overall standpoint, the yen fluctuations can be pretty temporary, and we've seen now two quarters where the yen's been stronger and prices have been moderate. So we don't think it has a big impact.","In terms of from a Note 7 standpoint, of course, you know you never want to see a customer have an issue like that, but from an overall standpoint, we sell into the \u2013 that Note 7s into the premium handheld market, and it just depends on what people who are going to buy that buy instead. And as long as they buy a premium phone, of course, we have very high share on the premium phones, and of course, the Note 7, even though it was a premium part of Samsung's devices, it's not the biggest handheld that they sell. So from an overall standpoint, we don't see a really big impact there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Wolf from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on the Optical side. First, just a quick housekeeping. Were the issues from the \u2013 earlier in the year completely resolved at this point?","And then as a follow-up, is there any distinction between what we would call the public cloud and the private cloud as you think about either lumpiness, opportunity, or the direction or timing of spend right now? And if bandwidth is still growing, are we just looking at timing issues in Optical?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Yes, I think the fundamental answer is yes, we're just looking at timing issues in Optical. In terms of the computer issues that we had at the beginning of the year, we clearly got back to full production at the end of the second quarter. There's still some backlog that we're working through, but from a production standpoint, we're running full-out in that business, just as we said we were going to.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","The short answer, Joseph, to both of your questions is yes.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And is there any difference between public and private cloud appetite to spend right now?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","It's so hard to tell the difference because some of the public cloud players are also big private cloud players, so as an equipment manufacturer into it, I don't know that we're the best ones to ask. We can't tell which \u2013 what you're using our fiber and connector for, and whether you're doing public or your own private cloud.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. Just one last follow-up. You mentioned 5G on the Corning ONE platform. Are cable vendors at all already looking at that for widespread Wi-Fi coverage outside of stadiums? Is that an opportunity that connects up to the fiber-to-the-home story?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Now are you asking about ONE or are you asking about 5G or are you asking about medium power wireless?","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I'm asking \u2013 I guess on the way to 5G when you look at some of the cable vendors looking for ubiquitous Wi-Fi, is this a product that also can sell into that?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","So far where we've been focusing ONE \u2013 you ask an excellent question \u2013 is in those areas where you want very intense and high bandwidth and low latency applications, so that tends to be where you bring an awful lot of users together in one area. So that's been the focus of our development because we think if you look longer-term in wireless and longer-term at things like 5G, the critical thing to drive new applications will be that combination of high bandwidth and low latency. Those are the apps that get exciting, and that's what's shaped our efforts in wireless to not be a me-too player, but instead set a platform that would have real legs over time.","So you're right, ultimately, you can see this type of approach spreading because it's the same conceptual framework for what you have to do to get low latency, high bandwidth systems. Whether or not cable TV will be a strong adopter here or not, I'm not so sure that I would know the answer to that.","Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Rod Hall from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to \u2013 I just wanted to start with Specialty again. The guidance is about 6% below what we were expecting, and I think if I remember right, your guidance was weak last quarter as well. And I wanted to get a feeling for whether that is a demand expectation, just overall market demand that's weak, or is there something going on with lower content? Can you just give me a little bit of more color on what's going on with Specialty and why that guidance is a little bit weak?","And then I also wanted to come back to Display. The \u2013 I think, Tony, your comments suggested that you guys are maybe being pretty cautious on guidance there. It sounds like demand was pretty good in Q3, but you're still guiding for a little bit weaker than expected Q4. So I just wonder, are you guys less confident on demand than the retailers or the panel makers, or just give me a little bit of more color on what you're thinking on Display. I guess overall, I'm trying to get some understanding of what you guys are thinking about in-market consumer demand. Thanks.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Okay. Let's start with Display, and then we'll go to Specialty. In Display, I think, Rod, you've read us pretty well in that if we were to believe what our customers are saying and what the set makers seem to be preparing for, then our guidance may be a little conservative.","At the same time, we have a view of the full-year demand for glass that hasn't changed. So more glass was bought in quarter three than what we expected. So therefore, our arithmetic tells us that we ought to have a little bit lower in quarter four. Which of these things ends up being right I think is hard to tell, and that's why you hear our guidance of the sort of flat to down some, and if the set makers are right, you'd expect the very strong performance we've seen in quarter three to carry forward beautifully into quarter four.","If we're right that the total glass market is what it is we think it is, then arithmetically there needs to be a correction. Whether it's in quarter four this year or quarter one in the next, that's hard for us to tell. So I think you read us pretty well. Does that answer that question, Rod?","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, that's helpful, Wendell. Thank you.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","On Specialty, we're expecting sort of high-single digit growth in quarter four, and that's pretty much in-line with what it is we were thinking about. You could make a case for higher, as you may have, and you can make a case for lower. But I don't see anything systemically going on, net our sort of momentum has been building.","Tony answered the Note 7 question with basically it's too early to tell for sure. And you can make a case, as I think you may even have, Rod, of how much glass is used on one device versus another, and that's all solid logic. It's just, there's just so much stuff that goes on in that supply chain. Even though your logic is really sound, it's hard for us to draw a direct line once we start trying to guess which \u2013 what a consumer of a phone buys next. But your logic is sound.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Wendell, can I just get you to...","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Sure.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","What do you think about just broader in-market demand in smartphones? Do you think that it's a little bit weaker than you would have anticipated, or sort of in-line with what you think? I'm just curious what you think there.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","I think it's when you ask me when, right? So I think overall, if you had asked me at the beginning of the year, I probably would have been a little more bullish on demand. And now we pretty much look at this market over time as being pretty darn mature, right? And so, the secret for us to double our revenues here has got to be innovations that drive up our price point and make it possible to use the glass in new ways on the phone. So if we can double the amount of glass usage on a phone because we've improved drop so much, that can allow us to keep growing our revenues, despite what we see is a pretty mature mobile market. Does that answer your question, Rod?","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, it does. Thank you very much, Wendell. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Newton from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, good morning, Wendell and Tony. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to switch gears and talk a little bit about automotive. You had some commentary around autonomous vehicles driving interior demand in your prepared remarks. So I'm curious if this is a shift away from a focus on windows to interiors, or is this purely additive to the story?","And then from a targeted timeframe of the $1 billion in automotive by 2020, is that still the right revenue level and the right timeframe?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","I'll do the first one and I'll let Tony do the second. If Tony is foolish enough to predict revenues in a brand-new innovation, we'll let him do that as CFO.","So it is truly additive. When we launched our first automotive work a number of years ago and as friends of ours pulled us in to try to disrupt the automotive industry, really it was both aspects, both the exterior glazing as well as car interiors. And all you're seeing now is a lot of excitement is getting built up around the interiors and that \u2013 you're just hearing a lot more buzz about what we're doing there.","But both remain really important. Both can be similar size markets, and so we're really aggressively pursuing both of them. I think in both areas, you'll see us break through. We'll get revenues in both areas, right, and are already experiencing that. How big it will be, that we just don't know yet. We just don't know, unless Tony wants to make a guess. Tony?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","I do not.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. So I guess shifting gears, Tony, you spoke to some one-time Hemlock buys possibly impacting 4Q. We have some noise surrounding kind of the Dow Corning transaction. So can you help us understand what a more normalized equity earnings line should look like in 2017? And is roughly $80 million annually plus or minus the right way to think about 2017 equity earnings potential?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, we're not giving guidance on 2017, but I think in general, that's right. What you have to remember about Hemlock is is that a lot of their volume is under contract and so the cycles of \u2013 the timing will depend on when the customers meet those contracts. And historically, if you go back over the last four or five years, that's been primarily in the fourth quarter. Sometimes it moves to the third quarter a little bit and the like, but in general, it's in the fourth quarter. And so I think somewhere in the $80 million to $100 million range is right.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And then just on the Optical Communications side and the hyper-scale commentary, is there anything \u2013 I guess just given that every check seems to be pointing to a very hot market in general, but still understanding lumpiness, is there anything in particular you can point to? Is there ongoing shifts from 40G to 100G at main customers? Are you seeing constraints elsewhere in the supply chain that maybe are preventing you from generating better growth, or is there any comment you can make on AFOP? Was the slowdown more pervasive with that acquisition?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","No, I think that right now, we've got a signal-to-noise sort of issue. There's nothing we've seen so far that's telling us that the signal ought to be fundamentally different than the sort of logic that you've laid out. We think the same things. We think there's a good amount of noise level around that signal. Timing, different architectures being tried in one place versus another, what does their supply chain inventory look like? Did they buy our product perhaps before they buy storage product, right? That there's all these things that I'm not so sure yet that we are able to look forward and say, let me deconvolve all that noise; this is what's going to happen. I think we'll get better at it as the business continues to scale, and as we get better at it, we'll give you better tools to understand it. But there's nothing we're seeing right now that takes us off your fundamental logic. We'll keep working to get better sensing capabilities. That make sense?","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, but in \u2013 is AFOP any different or are any one of your more recent acquisitions?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","No.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","No? All right.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","No, no.","Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you for taking my questions. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. On the Gorilla Glass mix, I think you mentioned that Gorilla Glass 5 is off to a really good start. I think in the last few months you've talked about Gorilla Glass 4 becoming the largest percentage of the unit sales. So I was wondering if you could sort of reset where that mix is today and how it plays out net with the Gorilla Glass 5 ramping? And then I had a follow-up.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","Well, I think Gorilla Glass 4 is still the largest part of what we ship and our Gorilla Glass 5 is just starting. It's had a more successful launch than we had of Gorilla Glass 4, and we're on some devices, you know, I had mentioned one that we announced last week, and there'll be more coming up in this quarter. So I think as time goes on, you're going to continue to see that Gorilla Glass 5 is going to become a bigger part of the mix. And then from a pricing standpoint, that's good, from a profitability standpoint, that's good.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","And do you think that there's a path to Gorilla Glass 5 eventually becoming a majority of the unit sales, or is it too high-end to think of that in the next year or so?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","I just think it's too early to tell. There is that potential because it's a very unique product that's really competitively advantaged. So that's possible. I think that's possible. And \u2013 but it's just a little early for us to tell. Let's get another quarter underneath our belt. It's only \u2013 we've only had it out there for a few months. Give us a few more months, and then hit us with the question again, okay, Steve?","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","That's fair. And then just lastly, another Gorilla Glass question just in terms of increasing your content or actually doubling your content per device. Can you sort of give us some road marks in terms of where you're at now? Did you actually see some significant progress in this this quarter, or would we think of that slope maybe picking up next quarter or quarter after? Any help there would be appreciated.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","So I think the two areas to think about doubling our overall revenue in this space is introducing higher price point products that perform better, and you saw us in this last quarter introduce two of them, right? And then \u2013 and take-up on GG 5s made us feel good, and that's definitely going to help.","The other piece is increasing the amount of glass utilized both in \u2013 on phones as well as other apps like wearables, and those performance improvements that we've announced on GG 5 that previously on GG4 certainly have shifted the design conversation towards a desire to use all-glass enclosures or to use more glass per enclosure. It's too early to tell how those design conversations turn into product sets. And \u2013 but it's without doubt our improving performance is enabling designers to think about the product in a different way.","Just think about it this way. If you think it's likely the material is going to break if it's dropped on asphalt, then you probably aren't going to double the amount of that material and put it on both fronts and backs. If you think it is unlikely that that happens, and GG 5 certainly makes it less likely, right, and other products we're working on will make it less likely still, then that opens up the potential to consider that type of design choice. But still too early to bank it. It's our strategic desire; we're making progress, but way too early to declare victory. Okay.","Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC","No, that's very helpful. Appreciate the color. Thanks, again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler from Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Stan Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just have one question on the Environmental business and then a follow-up on Display. So on Environmental, as we look out into 2017 and we have the European regulation that's driving the gas particulate filter opportunity, do you see that as more of a second half opportunity, given that the timing of the regulation kicks in, in the latter half of the year? Or should we expect a build-up in the first half as well as product launches get going?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","I think it's mostly going to be a second half opportunity.","Stan Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. And then on Display, as we think about the panel customer capacity heading into 2017 and just a tight capacity that they have for this year, is there an opportunity for them to start building earlier in the year for next year because a number of the panel makers are shifting capacity to OLED? And given where supply tightness is right now, they would like to maybe build up in advance? And how would that impact your retail demand outlook into 2017 if panel capacity demand remains tight and shifting away from LCD to OLED for smartphones and other products? Thank you.","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","I'm not so sure it would really change what we would think about from a retail demand standpoint. But it certainly would have a difference relative to cycling and when people would start building for various retail peak seasons, including the fourth quarter season. So, yeah, I think we're not here to talk about 2017. But I think when we do talk about 2017 and we look at the cycle in 2017, it's likely to be a little bit different than what we've seen in the past, for that reason.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Yeah. And Stan, I think that's a really, I haven't thought about it quite that way. I think that's a good question. And I think you're right to bring up the, to the extent that people do the P-OLED by adding new panel capacity then that doesn't impact any of the dialog to the extent that they take out existing panel capacity, then to put in place the new capacity. Your question could impact the behavior at that micro level. So let us think a little more about that.","As we step back and think about P-OLED overall, as you've heard us speak before, we look at this as a net positive for us on volume because our share is so high on P-OLED relative to the LTPS product that it is replacing. On the dynamic that you're discussing, if we had a customer where we have an above-average market share that takes out capacity, then that could impact us for a temporary time period until the whole thing rebalances for about one or two share points. Similarly, if we have a customer that has below our average market share and they take out capacity, we can see a gain that would be temporary for a while until the whole industry rebalances. But how that whole dynamic works its way through, I think we've got to do a little bit better job explaining, and we'll do that as we get a little closer to next year, Stan.","Stan Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I appreciate it. And if I could just quickly follow up on the OLED opportunity for next year. For some of the product cycles on potential new products that will have OLED, and you referenced your high share, when do the lead time start for you to actually build and get revenue for potential second-half product cycles next year on the P-OLED opportunity referenced? Thank you.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","So we'll start pretty early, Stan. But I think what's really important to keep in mind is the total glass demand for P-OLED is going to be like 1% of the overall glass market for the next couple of years. So we agree it's exciting tack. That's why we've been investigating in it for four or five years and that's why our share position is really strong. But as far as seeing it in our financials, I don't think you're going to see it, buddy.","That make sense? You still there?","Stan Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Okay.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Corning, Inc.","Greg, we've got time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. That question comes from the line of George Notter from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Thanks a lot guys for squeezing me in. I guess I wanted to go back to the Optical business and your comments about hyper-scale customers. I guess my impression on your Optical business is that the dominant variable there is really your ability to ramp up and create additional capacity and supply. And so I'm a bit confused about the comments about the hyper-scale customers causing a little bit more, I guess, softer trends there. I would assume that given how supply constrained you've been, that extra supply would have been sopped up somewhere else. Any thoughts on that?","R. Tony Tripeny - Corning, Inc.","So, I think from an overall standpoint as we looked into going into the quarter, we expected a certain amount to actually go to those hyper-scale customers. And basically what happened is that those customers ordered less than what we had originally projected, and although a lot of our capacity is fungible, on a very micro level, there wasn't someplace else we could move some of that capacity to.","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","So in macro, you're right. In micro, if you expect to sell a product and you make it, then you've used that capacity. So but in macro, you're right. Over the fullness of time, we are net capacity constrained here, which is why we're adding capacity. So over the sweep of time, it will all turn into revenue, but it's really important to make the right thing that will particular quarter come out.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Ann H. S. Nicholson - Corning, Inc.","Great. Okay. That's the end of our questions. Wendell, you have some closing comments?","Wendell P. Weeks - Corning, Inc.","Let me just close out the call by emphasizing we're really pleased with our progress on our framework since we announced it a year ago. We've gained traction with our customers on our growth initiatives. We have a long way to go, but we're making progress. We realigned our interest in Dow Corning and we returned approximately $6 billion to shareholders by year-end is what we anticipate to do. We are also creating significant value for our shareholders along the way. Thanks, everyone, for listening. We look forward to updating you on our framework progress and results throughout the rest of the quarter and year.","Ann H. S.

Welcome to Corning\u2019s Quarter Two 2018 Earnings Call. With me today are Wendell Weeks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tony Tripeny, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Evenson, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.","I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements that fall within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.

All businesses met or exceeded expectations for the quarter with year-over-year sales growth in each.","Highlights include. Optical sales were up 16% year-over-year, and we are increasing our expectations for full-year organic sales growth. Environmental sales were up 21% year-over-year, and we have also increased our full-year outlook. Specialty Materials performed better than expected. We anticipate year-over-year sales growth in quarter three and for the full-year, driven by strong shipments of innovative new products.","And finally, progress towards stable returns in Display continued with sales and net income in line with expectations. The pricing environment in Display is the best it has been in more than a decade. We expect to reach the important milestone of annual price declines improving to a mid-single-digit percentage in quarter three.","In total, for the quarter, sales were $2.8 billion, up 9% year-over-year; net income was $359 million; and EPS was $0.38. We completed a strong second quarter in terms of financial performance and progress on our investments.","As planned, we undertook a phase of intense operating and capital investments to help us meet committed demand and capture new opportunities. We have now reached an inflection point where those investments are yielding clear benefits, including increased sales and greater profitability. Several of our largest projects have exited the startup phase, and production and efficiency rates are climbing. So, we are on track to meet increased demand, grow sales, and significantly improve profitability in quarter three and beyond. Specifically, we expect to expand margins and reach approximately $11.3 billion in full-year 2018 sales, up 10% year-over-year and an increase from our prior expectation of $11 billion.","So, we feel great about both, the back half of 2018 and our long-term opportunities, as Tony will describe with a little more detail in just a few moments.","Now, let\u2019s turn to the strategy and capital allocation Framework, which outlines our leadership priorities. Under the Framework, we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion in cash through 2019, we plan to return more than $12.5 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends, and to invest $10 billion to extend our leadership and deliver growth. We have made great progress toward those goals since we announced the Framework in October of 2015.","Our cash generation is on our target. And through the end of the second quarter, we have returned $10.8 billion to shareholders. Dividends per share have increased 50% since the Framework began. Investments in RD&E, capital expenditures and acquisitions also remain on track to our four-year plan, totaling $6.7 billion through June 30th.","As outlined in our Framework, Corning is the best in the world in three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms and five market-access platforms. Our capabilities are interrelated and reinforcing. We focus 80% of our resources on opportunities that use capabilities in at least two of these categories. This increases our probability of success, reduces the cost of innovation, creates stronger competitive barriers, and most importantly, it delights our customers.","Now, turn to our progress in each of our market-access platforms, starting with Optical Communications. We remain the world leader in passive optical solutions and the only true end-to-end supplier of integrated solutions. Our outstanding performance in Optical Communications continued in the second quarter and helped drive an increase in our full-year outlook. We now expect full-year sales to be up by a high-teens percentage year-over-year, with organic growth increasing to the low teens versus our prior guidance of 10%, plus an additional $200 million in sales from the acquisition of 3M\u2019s Communication Markets Division. Strong market demand and the continuing success of our co-innovation have resulted in faster than expected progress toward our goal of $5 billion in annual sales by 2020, with continued growth thereafter.","We reached a major milestone in June when we completed the acquisition of 3M\u2019s Communication Markets Division. This investment extends our market reach and access to global customers while expanding our portfolio in the rapidly growing optical solutions markets. We continue to introduce award-winning products. Our EDGE Mesh Modules received the data center cabling and connectivity product of the year award in the second quarter. This family of products has emerged as a critical enabler of data center networks. The award demonstrates strong support from our customers, distributors and payers.","Stepping back, we\u2019ve positioned our Optical Communications market-access platform to deliver advantaged optical fiber, cable and connectivity solutions for access networks, cloud data centers and the network densification necessary for 5G and even autonomous vehicles. We\u2019re excited about our excellent performance, our current growth and our future opportunities.","Now, let\u2019s turn to Mobile Consumer Electronics where we are the world leader in glass for smartphones, tablets and emerging categories like wearables and augmented reality devices. Our goal is to double Mobile Consumer Electronics sales over the next several years. We continue to make significant progress in adding more sales dollars per device by innovating in both glass and value-added component, while also expanding our share in developing regions and entering entirely new product categories. Gorilla Glass has been designed into more than six billion devices worldwide. Last week\u2019s launch of Corning Gorilla Glass 6, the world\u2019s most durable cover glass to date expands our market leadership.","Now, research indicates that consumers drop their device on average seven times a year. So, it\u2019s no surprise that having their devices survive multiple drops is important to our customers. And the innovations contained in Gorilla Glass 6 provide a significant step forward. In lab tests, our new glass survived on average 15 drops from one meter on to rough surfaces. Now, that\u2019s about twice as many drops as Gorilla Glass 5. Competitive glass compositions under similar conditions did not survive even the first drop. One of our levers to double sales is to increase revenue per device, and we fully expect Gorilla Glass 6 to make significant contributions toward that goal. Customers have shown very strong interest, and you should be hearing announcements from them in the near future. Increasing penetration of glass backs to enable wireless charging and higher data rates also supports our goal of doubling sales in Mobile Consumer Electronics. The fundamental properties of Gorilla Glass make it an ideal choice for both the fronts and the backs of smartphones. In 2018, we expect 28% of smartphones sold to have glass backs, nearly double the amount sold with glass backs in 2017.","We\u2019re also innovating in new device categories. Gorilla Glass continues to be the most widely used cover material on smart watches. And lastly, we launched Corning Gorilla Glass DX and DX+ which offered enhanced antireflective optics and extreme scratch resistance for wearables. We\u2019re also sampling these new composite materials in the handheld space.","Our broad product portfolio has enabled continued wins in developing regions and value segments. In the second quarter, General Mobile announced GM 8 smartphone in Turkey and Positivo launched the SKY smartphone in Brazil, both featuring Gorilla Glass. We also remain well-positioned with innovative glass based solutions for emerging applications including augmented reality and precision 3D sensing. Overall, we expect sales in Specialty Materials to grow in 2018 as more devices adopt Gorilla Glass 6 and our other innovations.","Turning to our automotive market-access platform. Our expertise focuses on helping customers build cleaner, safer and more connected vehicles. Corning reached a significant production milestone of 1 million gasoline particulate filters. As we lead to market in the next wave of emissions control, we\u2019re partnering with most automakers to equip their new European gasoline engine platforms with our technology. China will be the next market to introduce GPF, and we\u2019re preparing by increasing the pace of investment in our new Hefei China facility. Once regulations are fully implemented in Europe and China, we expect gasoline particulate filters to add $0.5 Billion in annual sales for Corning.","Next, excitement from about Gorilla Glass for auto continues to grow as the industry transitions to highly connected and autonomous vehicles that use technical glass. Polls for collaboration for more than 20 leading OEM is increasing, and customer commitments now support the creation of dedicated finishing capacity for Gorilla Glass for auto interiors. So, earlier this month, we announced an investment in the Hefei facility that will produce Gorilla Glass parts for automotive interiors. We expect it to be operational in 2019.","In our Life Science Vessels platform, we continue to make strong progress on the path to a new long-term, multibillion-dollar franchise. Valor Glass dramatically reduces particle contamination, breaks and cracks while significantly increasing throughput. Valor helps protect patients and improve pharmaceutical manufacturing. Our collaborators, Merck and Pfizer continue to demonstrate support for Valor. In April, both joined us for the announcement of a high-volume manufacturing facility in North Carolina, which was an important part of the plan we announced last July.","Both companies also spoke about the merits of our technology and collaboration at separate industry conferences. In mid-June, Merck presented its perspective and findings on an important patient safety attribute of Valor. Later in the month, I joined a senior Pfizer leader to share some perspective on Valor, a collaboration in Corning\u2019s in long track record of co-innovation. At the event, Pfizer leadership affirmed its commitment to Valor. The leader said, \u201cWe are working as fast as we reasonably can to provide those solutions we\u2019re talking about today.\u201d","Earlier this month, the Food and Drug Administration reaffirmed its commitment to support new technologies that can improve pharmaceutical manufacturing and help prevent drug shortages. We remain closely engaged with the FDA and support its efforts to address this important public health issue. We continue to believe Valor has the potential to power Corning\u2019s growth for the next decade and beyond.","In Display, we remain the global leader. Our priority is to deliver stable returns and win in new display categories, and progress is excellent. Television retail demand growth is strong and higher than we have seen in the past several years. We also have the most favorable pricing environment for LCD glass in more than a decade. We expect to reach the important milestone of annual price declines improving to a mid-single-digit percentage in the third quarter, and we expect the improvement trend to continue into 2019.","As we\u2019ve discussed previously, we took advantage of seasonally lower demand to upgrade our fleet with the latest technology. We\u2019re now completing those upgrades and our Gen 10.5 plant is ramping on schedule and in tandem with BOEs panel production. As a result of these actions, we expect display profitability to increase substantially in the second quarter half of 2018. So, we continue to make excellent progress across all our market-access platforms. We are investing to capture opportunities and are well-positioned to deliver another strong year of growth. Ultimately, we remain on track to fully achieve our strategy and capital allocation Framework goals.","Now, let me turn the call over to Tony for a review of our results and outlook.","Tony Tripeny","Thank you, Wendell, and good morning.","Our second quarter results set the foundation for stronger than expected 2018. Each of our businesses grew sales year-over-year. After investing to support near and long-term growth and to extend our market leadership, we are well-positioned and expect to reach approximately $11.3 billion in full-year sales, up from our earlier guidance of $11 billion. We expect to see sales and profitability improve significantly in Q3, and we plan to build on that going forward.","Before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to note that the primary difference between our GAAP and core results is again a non-cash mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts.","As we\u2019ve discussed before, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. For us, this resulted in an after tax GAAP gain of $387 million for the second quarter. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow.","Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions.","Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate, aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. We\u2019re very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We\u2019ve issued $1.6 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since our inception, slightly over five years ago.","That brings me to our results and outlook. Our second quarter core sales were up 9% year-over-year and EPS was $0.38. The intensive operating and capital investments that we have discussed with you over the last several quarters are now yielding clear benefits. Our investments include the continuation of capacity expansions for optical fiber and cable, our Gen 10.5 Hefei display glass plant, capacity for gasoline particulate filters, Gorilla Glass projects for mobile devices and automotive, plus several other development projects.","These planned investments constrained our gross and operating margin percentages in recent quarters. With several of the largest projects having cross major thresholds, we are now at an inflection point. Our sales run rate is climbing and our gross margin is expanding. We expect to achieve approximately $11.3 billion in sales for the year and to expand gross margins up 42% in the second half.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2 billion of cash. Adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter was $833 million.","Now, let\u2019s look at the detailed segment results and outlook. Let\u2019s start with Display Technologies where we\u2019re making great progress towards maintaining stable returns. Our results were in line with expectations. Retail sales are very strong, globally. And production at our new Gen 10.5 plant is ramping. The pricing environment is the best it has been in more than a decade.","Second quarter sales were $780 million, up sequentially and year-over-year. Net income was $192 million. Second quarter sequential price declines were better than Q1, as expected. For the third quarter, we expect sequential price declines to again be very moderate. These continuing improvements in sequential price declines will allow us to reach the important milestone of annual price declines improving to a mid-single-digit percentage in the third quarter and for that improving trend to continue into 2019.","Three factors drive our view that this more favorable pricing environment will continue. First, we expect glass supply to continue to be balanced or even tight. Our new Gen 10.5 plant supports the expected growth of large-sized TVs. It is co-located with and dedicated to our customer BOE. We pace and align capacity in tandem with BOE to ensure our Gen 10.5 glass supply is balanced to demand, the ramp is on schedule. We expect the glass supply demand balance below Gen 10.5 to tighten further because demand continues to grow in 2018 but public information indicates, there is little capacity growth plan in this segment by glass makers.","Second, our competitors continue to pace profitability challenges at current pricing levels. Therefore, we expect the price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable. And third, LCD glass manufacturing requires ongoing investments in current and new capacity to support growth. To generate acceptable returns on investment, glass pricing will need to improve even further. For Corning, we will only add capacity if we can get an attractive return for our shareholders.","Now, moving to retail. TV demand was very strong in Q2. Viewing area grew double digits year-over-year worldwide. Strong demand was driven by lower panel prices which are having a positive impact on TV retail prices and thus consumer demand. We expect TV retail demand to remain robust for the rest of the year.","As for the LCD glass market, second quarter total market volume grew low single digits sequentially and our volume grew faster as we ramp production in Hefei, in line with our April guidance. In the third quarter of 2018, we expect the LCD glass market volume to grow mid-single-digit sequentially and our volume to grow faster as we continue ramping production in Hefei in tandem with BOEs Gen 10.5 demand. For the full-year, we continue to expect LCD glass market volume to grow mid-single-digits as television screen size growth continues. We expect our volume for the full year to grow faster than the market, driven by Hefei Gen 10.5 ramp-up. In brief, we feel very good about price and volume.","As we described last quarter, first half Display gross margin was affected by two factors, the Hefei start-up and fleet optimization. Now that our factory utilization is increasing, our productivity and gross margins in the second half of the year should improve. In summary, we remain very pleased with the current dynamics in our display business and our progress in maintaining stable returns.","Let\u2019s move to Optical Communications. Second quarter sales were up 16% year-over-year and exceeded $1 billion. Sales growth was driven by both our data centers and carrier customers. Net income was $150 million, up 17% year-over-year. As expected, capacity utilization and profitability increased due to volume growth and progress on our capital expansion initiatives. We\u2019re continuing to bring additional capacity on line in the second half to support committed demand.","In Q2, we successfully closed the acquisition of 3M\u2019s Communication Markets Division. In 2018, in this transaction will add about $200 million in sales and be neutral to EPS due to integration cost. As previously announced, we expect it will be accretive in 2019 and beyond.","We expect third quarter sales to be up about 25% year-over-year, including sales from the recently acquired business from 3M. Given the strong first half, and our second half outlook, we now expect full-year sales to be up by high-teens percentage, year-over-year, with organic growth improving to the low-teens, and an additional $200 million in sales from the 3M acquisition.","Overall, we are growing Optical Communications faster than the market. These additional sales are driven by preference for our advantage solutions in the data center and carrier markets, and enabled by increased fiber and cable output from our new capacity expansions. We\u2019re excited about the growth we\u2019re delivering.","Environmental Technologies second quarter sales were $317 million, up 21%. All products contributed to our growth. Second quarter net income was up 42%, driven by volume growth in our product categories as well as strong performance in our manufacturing operations.","As anticipated, the North America heavy duty continues the improvement that began in second half of last year, driving 21% year-over-year sales growth in our diesel business for Q2. In auto, we\u2019re also growing our sales faster than the market. Sales were up 21% due to more awarded platforms and the shift to premium products. Additionally, gasoline particulate filters contributed to the growth as OEMs ramp for full adoption of Euro 6 regulations in September. We are making progress with capacity in engineering investments to support the ramp of the GPF business.","We expect the strong performance to continue in the third quarter with sales growth of high-teens year-over-year. We are also increasing our full-year sales outlook to mid teens growth year-over-year. We expect continued strength in sales of all products, including ramping GPF sales.","In Specialty Materials, second quarter sales were $343 million and net income was $64 million. Sales were ahead of expectations and up 2% year-over-year, driven by higher Gorilla Glass shipments as OEMs begin to ramp for second half product releases. While underlying operations remained solid, net income for the quarter was impacted by product development costs.","Although the overall smartphone market is maturing, we continue to progress towards our long-term goal to extend our leadership in Mobile Consumer Electronics and double sales.","Our ability to innovate and deliver value-added products at a premium price is playing out as we expected. We delivered another breakthrough innovation with last week\u2019s launch of Gorilla Glass 6. We also entered in Gorilla Glass DX and DX+ to capture more value in wearables. Innovations like these, increase the value of our glass, extend our differentiation and support using more glass in more places.","We expect strong shipments of innovative products in the second half. For Q3, we expect sales to be up about 10%, year-over-year. We expect the additional sales to generate strong specialty materials earnings growth throughout the second half.","In Life Sciences, second quarter sales were $245 million, up 11% year-over-year; and net income was $31 million, up 41%, driven by strong demand and manufacturing performance. We continue to outpace market growth. Third quarter sales are expected to grow by a mid-single-digit percentage over last year. We are also increasing our full-year sales outlook to be up by a mid to high-single-digit percentage over last year.","So, for 2018, all of our businesses have positive momentum. We now expect full-year sales of about $11.3 billion, which is up 10%.","Now, I\u2019ll share some additional outlook details. First, let\u2019s turn to gross margin. We expect our gross margin to expand to 42% in the third and fourth quarters, up significantly from the first half and versus last year. Annual operating expenses should remain consistent with last year as a percentage of sales. For the full-year, SG&A is expected to be about 14% of sales and RD&E about 8%. We expect other income other expense in Q3 to remain at our second quarter run rate of about $55 million to $65 million. For the full-year, we expect the net expense of approximately $210 million to $220 million.","Full-year 2018 gross equity earnings are expected to be similar to 2017 at just over $200 million, predominantly from Hemlock Semiconductor with the third quarter at approximately $20 million to $30 million, consistent with the typical seasonality. Recall that the timing of the contract typically makes Hemlock\u2019s fourth quarter its strongest. Our tax rate for the third quarter and full year should be similar to Q2 at about 21.7%.","The slides we are showing, give you an additional modeling related detail for the third quarter and the full year. In 2018, we expect to spend slightly more than 2 billion on capital expenditures with programs in every market-access platform. How much more, will depend on how quickly we ramp some of our investments. We will continue to keep you posted as the year progresses.","Finally, we do not expect a material impact from the inactive or contemplated tariffs. First of all, TVs are not on the current list of proposed tariffs. Second, it\u2019s our philosophy to manufacture products in the same region as our customer. This philosophy minimizes our cross-border activity and makes us less susceptible to the impact of tariffs. Third, we are not big consumers of aluminum and steel. So, we expect minimal impact from related tariffs. So, in total, we do not expect the significant financial impact from tariffs.","In closing, our second quarter results underscore that we are well-positioned and on track for the second half of our four-year strategy and capital allocation Framework. We now expect an even stronger 2018. We expect to reach approximately $11.3 billion in full-year sales with second half capacity and margin expansion. We expect continued growth in Optical Communications, Specialty Materials, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences. And as we said, the display pricing environment is the best in more than a decade and we expect to reach the important milestone as year-over-year mid single-digit price declines in Q3.","Other progress on the Framework included returning $829 million to shareholders in the second quarter of 2018 for a total of $10.8 billion, since the Framework\u2019s introduction. We\u2019re also investing to position our businesses to meet short and long-term sales growth opportunities.","Putting it all together, as we invest $10 billion to drive growth and extend our leadership, we are rewarding investors by returning more than $12.5 billion, which compounds the benefit of our future growth for long-term shareholders.","With that, let\u2019s move to Q&A. Ann?","Ann Nicholson","Thanks, Tony. Operator, we\u2019re ready for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Mehdi Hosseini, Please go ahead. Mr. Hosseini, your line is open.","Mehdi Hosseini","Thanks for taking my call. I want to go back to comment regarding Gorilla use in auto. It\u2019s encouraging to see investment taking place, especially in Hefei. How should we think about incremental revenue contribution? It will be great if you give us some milestones looking into the next year and 2020. And then, I have a follow-up regarding display. You talked about the best pricing environment, I think, you said ever. When I hear the best pricing environment, it kind of makes me worried because can it get even better from here or can it roll over from here? It will be great if you could elaborate how you see the sustainability of the current pricing environment. Thank you.","Wendell Weeks","So, let\u2019s start with your first question on Gorilla and auto. We\u2019re not quite ready to give insight onto how much revenues we\u2019d expect next year in Gorilla and auto. What I will say is we\u2019ve already got awarded business for hundreds of millions of dollars spread out over time to same platforms. How that timing breaks down, what our ability to supply will be relative to demand, all those things are things we\u2019re working through. So, we\u2019re not quite ready to cycle that and figure out exactly when that\u2019s going to be delivered for each vehicle platform. We\u2019re going to try to get there as we work through the end of this year, so we could be helpful to you going into next year.","Tony Tripeny","Maybe let me take your question on display pricing. We feel really good about display pricing and the trends that we\u2019ve seen. It is the best pricing we\u2019ve seen in more than a decade. And we do expect -- we expect to hit the important milestone in mid-single-digit year-over-year declines in the third quarter. And we think that improvement trend continues into 2019. There is really three reasons for that. I mean, the first, we have supply and demand in balance or even tight from a glass maker standpoint. Secondly, our competitors face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. Therefore, we expect their price declines will slow further as they try to remain profitable. And then, the third item is LCD glass manufacturing requires ongoing investments. And to generate acceptable returns on those investments, glass pricing will need to improve further. So, overall, we feel very good about where we are.","Wendell Weeks","We really don\u2019t need everything to continue to improve and improve. What we need to do is just have rate of decline to continue to slow. As long as that rate of decline continues to slow, our productivity will more than offset those price declines. So, that\u2019s what we are aiming for.","Operator","We have a question from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath","Yes. Hey, good morning. Yes. Hey, Wendell, I have a bigger picture question. The Company has been investing in multiple capital expansion projects. I mean, I could count to maybe 20 and then I gave up. So, my question is, you\u2019re going through this kind of meaningful investment cycle. What\u2019s the timeframe you have in mind for subsequent investments in manufacturing capacity expansions and then the harvesting time when you start monetizing these investments?","Wendell Weeks","Vijay, that\u2019s a great question. First of all, you are doing a good job on counting. We do have over 20 significant plant expansions, including a number of -- included in that are a number of Greenfield builds. So, we are in this pretty intense operating and capital investment cycle is the good news. I think, you\u2019re going to start to see the harvest begin now. We expect and that we\u2019re in a inflection point in this quarter, and that you are going to see growing sales from those capacity investments and expanding profitability from them. So, I do not think we need to wait long. I think, we\u2019re going to start seeing that right in quarter three and quarter four and beyond. Is that responsive to your question, Vijay? ","Vijay Bhagavath","You know it does. Yes. Thanks, Wendell.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Steven Fox","Just on the capacity expansions to-date and looking ahead. Wendell and Tony, you mentioned a few times that you have committed customer support for a lot of these expansions. Can you just give us an idea of how you\u2019re managing that risk? Obviously, the customer forecast can change going forward and how that would affect you. And then, secondly, how do we get comfortable with the idea that what you went through in the first half of the year was unique, and we don\u2019t see another sort of mini capital bursts next year or the year after as you continue to innovate? Thanks.","Wendell Weeks","I\u2019ll take the first one and Tony can address the second. So, we mitigate our risk with these investments a number of different ways, and it really depends on the business and the customer relationships. Sometimes, we actually insist that the customer fund or put their money by our side in our capital. That significantly mitigates our shareholders\u2019 exposure to any overcapacity risk. Another way we do it is long-term contracts with firm levels of revenue commitment; sometimes those are very public, sometimes they are not. The best example of this would be what you saw from Verizon with their long-term commitment to revenue from us for $1 billion to help underpin that investment in fiber and cable. And we have all sorts of variations really in between.","Our core philosophy here is since what do is so important to our customers, we want to do it in tandem with them. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that our customers are always right and that the demand always comes in as we both anticipate, but it does mean that we\u2019re sharing the risk in an equitable way that allows us to provide our unique products and ability to supply to help make their vision for they are trying to deliver in their business model, possible.","Tony Tripeny","And I think from a going forward basis, Steve, I think the important thing to keep in mind is, is that we\u2019re going through a period where we\u2019re seeing growth in all of our market-access platforms. And the good news is that that growth is showing up right now. As Wendell said, the infection point is today. And our second half revenue is going to be annualized at closer to $12 billion as opposed to the first half closer to $10 billion. So, we\u2019re seeing very significant growth in the payoffs, are really happening in the near term. As we look forward, of course we\u2019re going to continue to invest where that growth is. I think the probabilities of all of our market-access platforms growing at the same time is probably less than what we\u2019ve experienced right now. And on top of it, whatever that investment, it is going to be on a much bigger than what were even six months ago. So, as we look for both of those things, I think we feel pretty good about how we think about that on a going forward basis.","Operator","Next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.","Samik Chatterjee","I just wanted to start off with the display glass segment, and you mentioned you expect pricing to continue to improve in 2019. What are you hearing from your panel maker customers because panel prices are being down significantly in 2Q? Are you expecting any sort of cutbacks in capacity from them that might limit some growth in area in 2019? And then, I had a minor clarification on the gross margin guidance for the second half. I think, the language you used last quarter was that gross margin would exceed 42% on a quarterly basis from the back half. And today, I think you mentioned 42. So, is there any change in the gross margin expectation for the back half?","Tony Tripeny","No. There is no change in the gross margin expectation for the back half. We feel very good about bringing the capacity on and the expansion that we\u2019re going to see versus what we\u2019ve performed in the last three quarters. In terms -- from the panel maker standpoint, demand and what at the end of the what really matters here is the retail demand. And the retail demand has been very strong. As we mentioned, viewing area was up over 20% on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter. And then, we\u2019re seeing indications from panel makers that they are buying panels to prepare for what is really the big season, which is in the fourth quarter and that that\u2019s happening right now. So, we expect panel maker utilizations to stay about where they have been in the first half of the year and that\u2019s going to translate to a strong glass demand. And then, we expect the market to be up in the mid single digits from a glass standpoint. And of course, we will grow faster than that because of the ramp of the Gen 10.5 factory at BOE.","Operator","And our next question is from Rob Cihra with Guggenheim Partners.","Rob Cihra","Just on Gorilla Glass, I know you noted you are benefitting from the increase in content per phone, like with the double sided, which is great. And I believe you also get a price premium when you launch something like Gorilla Glass 6. I\u2019m just wondering, I guess first, how much the Gorilla Glass 6 price premium. I mean, is that a noticeable health in the second half? And more broadly, it seems to me and I am not even sure if it\u2019s the case, it seems the Gorilla Glass pricing has been better than it was a couple of years ago where it was pretty brutal. And I\u2019m just wondering, I mean, is that the case and has Gorilla Glass pricing stabilized? If that\u2019s the case, why?","Wendell Weeks","So, you are correct in that, Gorilla Glass pricing trends have been very good. And what\u2019s causing that has been a really strong cycles of innovation from us. And those innovations are yielding much better products. And customers value those products more and are willing to give us a higher price for them. So, you are noticing, in the numbers that fundamental strategy playing out. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not willing at this time to give you specific guidance on Gorilla Glass 6 pricing. That will be between us and our customers and some here shortly. [Ph] But, I think you are correct on the overall trends out.","Operator","And our next question is from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Rod Hall","I just wanted to come back to this auto glass plant in Hefei and ask what you guys think the utilization of that plant is likely to be, once you get it done. I mean, are you expecting it to be mostly utilized or do you think that it just incrementally gets utilized over time, you\u2019re just kind of at a point where you need capacity. And then, secondly, I wanted to -- I noticed that the R&D to sales guidance is up a little bit. And I just wanted to double check what\u2019s driving that, why you decided to make that slight change in R&D to sales.","Wendell Weeks","Let me adjust the first one and I\u2019ll leave the second one for Tony. So, what\u2019s happening to us is as we\u2019ve shared previously is the demand for our innovations in auto glass interiors has surprised us in a positive direction. So, as a result, at this point in time, we are having a difficult time keeping up with what our customers want us to do. So, if we could have had this plant six months earlier be up and running, we would have it full. So, we expect the utilization to run pretty high. I think, it\u2019s just worth pausing here a moment, though, so you understand what type of capacity this is. You shouldn\u2019t think of this as melting capacity. We don\u2019t need to add any Gorilla Glass manufacturing capacity to facilitate our entry into the automotive class market. We plan to meet all that demand with our continued productivity improvements on the fusion platform for today\u2019s Gorilla Glass business as well as display.","What this plant is going to do is going to be applying some of our vapor deposition technology to be able do advanced optical treatments; it\u2019s going to be able to do shaping of the product; it\u2019s going to be able to do the declaration of the product, cutting it exactly the right way, so with the value add parts on top of it. So, as a result of that you\u2019re not going to see a typical utilization effects you\u2019d be used to thinking about in a big time class factory. The capital intensity of this is much less. So, that\u2019s what this capacity is. Is that responsive to your question, Rod. ","Rod Hall","Yes. Thanks. It was super helpful. I appreciate it.","Tony Tripeny","And Rod on the RD&E, there really isn\u2019t a change there. We expect to spend about the same amount in the second half as we spent in the first half. The actual spending always depends a little bit on pacing of projects. But, the amount that we\u2019re guiding is in the normal range that we\u2019ve been guiding for a while.","Operator","Our next question is from George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","George Notter","Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess, I wanted to dig into display segment margins a bit. So, I heard what you said certainly on the BOE expansion ramping and now the reskinning of tanks and improved utilization. Where do you think we could get segment net income margins to go to? And if I look back at those numbers, I think there is some 30% numbers if I look back to last year and the year before; if I go way, way back, I can even see 40% segment net income margin types numbers. Where do you think we can go with these improvements in utilization and BOE? Thanks.","Tony Tripeny","George, I think, it\u2019s important to realize that what we\u2019re all about in display is stabilizing the profitability in that business. And we do that with continued what we\u2019re seeing from a pricing standpoint. As Wendell, we don\u2019t need any further pricing improvements than where we are today. But, with that along with volume growth, along with our manufacturing improvements, we\u2019re all about getting that bottom line to essentially be the same, and that\u2019s what our objective is. And that also means that sales will be about the same. And so, once we get to that point, the operating margin will be about where it is today. But, obviously, that\u2019s a significant improvement over the last few years, but we\u2019ve seen that decline for several years where we\u2019ve seen significant decline in display profitability.","Operator","And our next questioner is James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","James Faucette","I guess maybe I\u2019d relay probably one of the most common questions we\u2019ve gotten recently and that has to do with capital allocation. As we kind of drive [ph] towards the end of 2018, we see how that\u2019s likely to be divided up, et cetera. At what point should we expect to see a new plan or further forward outlook on capital allocation? And can you give us a general outline in terms of your preferences for dividends versus buybacks et cetera?","Tony Tripeny","I think, James, it\u2019s important to note that we have more than a year to go in our current Framework. And so, what we\u2019re really focused on is delivering our four-year plan. The good news is all of our existing business, especially Display is generating strong operating cash flow and we expect that to continue. The other piece of good news is we have multiple large opportunities for growth in all of our market-access platforms. So, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in those opportunities, especially those because they generate attractive return on invested capital to our shareholders. And as has been our practice is that anything beyond that, we\u2019re going to return to our shareholders. So, that\u2019s how we think about it going forward. But, in terms of specifics and how things are going to look beyond 2019, we are just going to wait until we get closer to the end of the current plan, before we share the next set of specifics.","Ann Nicholson","Amy we have time for a couple of more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next questioner is Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.","Wamsi Mohan","Wendell, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the dynamics in Specialty as it pertains to Gorilla. Some of your larger smartphone customers are not showing as much cyclicality as in prior cycles. And I was wondering if that is giving you more supply chain visibility as it pertains to Gorilla and is it changing the nature of lead times for Gorilla.","Wendell Weeks","That\u2019s an excellent question. We have noticed some of those trends that you\u2019re outlining. But they just haven\u2019t been around long enough for us to be able to say with a high degree of confidence that we see a strong improvement in visibility. That\u2019s mainly fact as you know just tends to be in which quarter we actually tend to see the sale. So, it doesn\u2019t really impact us from a long-term financial standpoint, but it certainly is valuable from an operational standpoint. So, more to come on this topic. If this continues, then, I think your logic is very sound, but it needs to continue further for us to establish good, strong, mathematical modeling and conclusions.","Wamsi Mohan","If I could follow up just with one quick question on TV, and I\u2019m sorry if you already addressed this. But, I was wondering, given the panel price declines and the magnitude of those panel price declines, how simulative has that been to large screen TV demand, and are you expecting -- what are you expecting for retail sellout trends in the back half of the year? ","Tony Tripeny","Wamsi, I think, it\u2019s been quite simulative and it\u2019s been very strong from the retail demand standpoint. Glass viewing area was over 20% in the first half of the year and we expect it to continue to be very strong in the second half of the year. That\u2019s why we\u2019re quite confident that the glass market will grow mid single digits on a year-over-year basis and we\u2019ll grow faster than that because of the ramp of our BOE Gen 10.5 factory.","Wendell Weeks","And just to build on that. I think, one of the main things that people can lose sight of is, in the end what really matters is how many television sets people buy and how much is sold through the whole system. And we\u2019ve certainly been in a cycle where the panel market went from incredibly high utilization and rising prices and then, I think that probably caused television demand to be a little suppressed from where we want to be. Now, we\u2019re moving to another cycle that you\u2019re seeing with display panel prices having fallen, now flowing through to the end customer. And I think this ebb and flow will continue to work its way out. We really like to sell through data we\u2019re seeing. And of course we would hope that panel prices will continue to stabilize and improve over time and that in turn of course that the glass supply and demand dynamics continue to work towards the path of us improving our pricing performance year-by-year. So, that\u2019s sort of the way we take a look at industry overall.","Operator","And our last questioner is Joseph Wolf with Barclays.","Joseph Wolf","I just had a question, I guess the continuation a little bit on the mobile market. Given some of the move to OLED and Corning\u2019s participation in both parts of the market, just can you give us some perspective on what you\u2019re seeing on the design side? There has been some talk about flexible applications. And while I know there is nothing customer-specific you can share, can you talk about what flexible designs might mean for the Gorilla Glass cover market?","Wendell Weeks","So, first let\u2019s do OLED, and then, we will do flexible. So, as you know, we made pretty significant amount of innovation efforts to put us in the spot to be a very strong supplier into the polyimide OLED market. For those of you on the call who don\u2019t know, even though the polyimide OLED isn\u2019t made of glass, to make it, you consume a lot of glass. Actually you consume more glass than is consumed in making a display of the same size using active-matrix LCD technology. And it\u2019s special glass, it\u2019s glass we develop for that application. So, with that being said, that I think is what we predicted, I think, quite accurately. We could see that becoming -- even though it\u2019s a small market, a significant force from Mobile Consumer Electronics devices.","What has been in the press really now for a number of years and it\u2019s been hyped for a number of years is the idea of a truly flexible device, which is in flexible display. And what the idea is, could we basically make something small that then you could fold it out and it becomes something big. And that therefore, you could fit more display area in a smaller volume area. So, that has real interest. We\u2019ve been engaged for a number of years in trying to solve some those really hard technical problems to be able to make a product that bends to very tight bend radius but at the same time, when something is dropped on it or experiences any sort of sharp event, it doesn\u2019t damage easily or scratch easily. These two things in terms of material science tend to push opposite from one another, and it\u2019s been the core of our innovation of this.","I think that ultimately, if foldables are going to be important, we are going to need to solve that problem for the cover. We are already -- there are still problems to solve in the display, but ultimately we have to solve that problem. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s solved yet. So, I think some of the first devices you\u2019ll see to try to market out will be products that are compromising on durability in one direction or the other. But, I think, it\u2019s just the stage of the thread. I think people will want to introduce it to get a feel for will consumers really get interested in it, can they make even a form factor that\u2019s compelling. These are really big questions. But, at the core, we still don\u2019t yet -- we haven\u2019t yet seen the cover material out of any material that combines all the required attributes for this to become a significant device. But, it takes a good amount of effort on our part. We\u2019re still working on it. We are working closely with our Mobile Consumer Electronics customers. They really want us to invent something, but we\u2019re still on it. Sorry for the long answer. ","Ann Nicholson","Thanks, Joseph and thank you, Wendell.
