My name is Kim, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Jim Lucas, Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","James C. Lucas","Thanks, Kim. And welcome to Pentair's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our second quarter 2014 performance, as well as our third quarter and full year 2014 outlook and updates to our 2015 target as outlined in this morning's release.","Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-K and 10-Q in today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randall J. Hogan","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Before looking more closely at the second quarter results, I thought it would be helpful to provide a summary of what we will cover on today's call. We have a lot of information to share and we want to leave time for your questions.","The second quarter met our expectations despite ongoing economic headwinds in our 2 largest verticals, Energy and Industrial. We announced this morning that our board has approved our strategic decision to exit the Water Transport business, which we will cover in more detail shortly.","We're reducing our 2014 expectations mostly due to our exit of the Water Transport business, but also due to a reduction in what we see as a more modest topline outlook. This is based on an Industrial recovery that's slower than originally anticipated and continued pushouts within Energy.","In particular, we continue to see lower-than-anticipated contributions from Canadian oil sands. And while we continue to win with both small and large customers, many of the large projects have continued delays in releasing capital spending.","Six months before the start of 2015, we do not see enough strength in the Energy and Industrial markets in particular to hold the 2015 $5 EPS target. We're adjusting that target to $4.50, reflecting the exit of our Water Transport business and factoring in these lingering economic uncertainties and ongoing deferrals in Energy CapEx.","While we have continued the overdrive on synergies and are seeing some growth, it's not enough to close the gap. Nevertheless, we're still targeting EPS compound growth rate greater than 20% overall across 2014 and '15.","As we have overall -- as we have overdelivered on synergies, we continue to show the power of PIMS adoption in the businesses that we acquired and our ability to integrate the acquisitions. Lean enterprise is a part of our DNA now and it's gratifying to see it delivering this way. The results is that our free cash flow continues to be strong in capital allocation disciplined as we continue to run the company for the long-term, focused on creating sustainable, long-term shareholder value.","Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a review of our second quarter performance. This slide is a review of our second quarter including Water Transport. We will have a more detailed look in the quarter in a few moments excluding the results of our Water Transport business.","With it, second quarter revenues declined 3% on a reported basis. Adjusted operating income increased 5% and adjusted operating margins expanded 110 basis points to 14.8%. Adjusted EPS grew 13% to $1.04, which met our outlook of $1.02 to $1.05.","Please turn to Slide 6 for a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Free cash flow was $384 million in the quarter, which followed a small usage in the first quarter from the seasonal working capital build in many of our Residential businesses. We expect to generate full year free cash flow greater than 110% of net income in 2014.","Our balance sheet remains strong, ending debt with approximately $2.7 billion or $2.5 billion on a net debt basis. And the second quarter returned nearly $250 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $700 million remaining under our current $1 billion repurchase authorization. We recently increased our quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share from $0.25 per share, which marks our 38th consecutive year of annual dividend increase.","Our ROIC ended the quarter above 10%. We continue to have a lot of opportunities in the working capital front in a number of our businesses and we would expect to make further progress as the year continues.","Please turn to Slide 7 as we look more closely at our rationale to exit our Water Transport business. As we mentioned in the beginning of the call, we announced our decision to exit our Water Transport business and move it to discontinued operations in the third quarter. As we discussed at length last quarter, this is a business that came with the Flow Control acquisition that was completed nearly 2 years ago that has consistently underperformed our expectations. At the time the acquisition was completed, Water Transport generated over $700 million in annual revenue with operating income of $50 million and had a couple of large projects in the backlog and several others in quote stage. At that point in time, the expectation for 2014 was for revenue to decline sharply, but operating income continued to remain near $50 million. Shortly after the deal closed, we saw some larger projects that canceled and while there have historically been a flow of smaller projects each year, there's been virtually no new activity of consequence over the past year. This is due in part to the impact of the Australian economy from a sharp downturn in mining.","We worked aggressively to rightsize the business. It has remained profitable despite revenue levels, declining significantly from where it was expected to be. We believe the decision to exit the business will allow us to better allocate resources to growth areas.","The decision to exit the Water Transport platform is consistent with our new platform approach, leaving us with 19 technology platforms. We aligned around these platforms at the beginning of this year within our 4 reporting segments. We have leaders in place to drive all 19 platforms and have recently completed our first round of strategic reviews with them. The platform approach allows us to more clearly define and invest in areas that have differentiated profitable growth opportunities. This approach also helps us identify businesses that may not have the same prospects and will have to play a different role for Pentair. We've talked for some time about flowing our resources to our best opportunities and this platform structure enables that more effectively.","Please turn to Slide 8 as we review the past performance of Water Transport net impact on reported results. To provide a baseline of Pentair excluding Water Transport, we want to share the impact on last year's result without it. On a reported basis, sales were up 3% in 2013 and adjusted EPS grew 26%. Without Water Transport in last year's results, sales would have been up 4% and adjusted earnings per share would have grown 29%. Going forward, we'll exclude Water Transport's results from the discussion of this quarter's results.","So let's turn to Slide 9 as we look at Pentair's second quarter results excluding Water Transport. For the second quarter, sales grew 2%, with 3 of our 4 segments growing. Adjusted operating income was up 13%, adjusted operating margins increased to 150 basis points to 15.2% and adjusted EPS grew 21% to $1.02. Again, a very solid quarter of execution.","Now let's turn to Slide 10 for a more detailed look at our second quarter performance. The waterfall on the left-hand side of the page shows that our 2% sales growth was the result of 1 point from volume and 1 point from price. FX was a slight positive in the quarter as strength in the euro was partially offset by continued weakness in the Australian and Canadian dollars. We saw many of our markets firming throughout the quarter with backlog and most product platforms expanding.","The right half of the page shows second quarter Pentair operating profits and margins. Operating margin expansion of 150 basis points was driven once again by strong productivity, which includes our synergies. We continue to gain momentum on both Lean and sourcing initiatives and our standardization effort continued their progress. As the top line has remained sluggish, we've taken further repositioning actions to accelerate our productivity results. While the top line continues to be slower than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year, we continue to focus on the elements within our control and feel good about our ability to continue delivering on productivity and synergies.","Now let's turn to Slide 11 for a performance review of our largest segment, Valves & Controls. For the second quarter, Valves & Controls grew 2%, which is comprised of 1 point of volume and positive 1 point from FX translation. This was slightly better than our forecast. Orders grew 7% from their comparable period 1 year ago and backlog remains firm with a slight sequential increase to $1.4 billion.","During the quarter, oil and gas showed a slight increase. Power was up modestly, Process grew 6% and Mining was down once again. The right half of the page shows second quarter Valves & Controls operating profits and margins. Adjusted operating margins expanded 60 basis points to 14.1%, which includes $4 million in cost for the segment's operating model transformation or OMT. As a reminder, we expect the OMT investment in Valves & Controls to continue on an annual basis through 2016. But that investment is expected to drive nearly $80 million of annual operating income savings once completed and an overall tax benefit to Pentair of roughly 3 points through the optimization of the global Valves & Controls structure into Switzerland.","Now let's turn to Slide 12 for a look at the orders and backlog for Valves & Controls. As you can see on Slide 11, the Valves & Controls backlog is broken down in 4 key industries, 3 of which fall into our Energy vertical. Those are Oil & Gas, Power and Mining and one in our Industrial vertical, which is the Process business. Overall, backlog ended the quarter near $1.4 billion, which is consistent with where it has been since we acquired the business in the end of 2012. We saw healthy order growth in Process, Oil & Gas and Power, but Mining orders were down due to a combination of a tough year-over-year comp and continued weakness seen throughout the mining industry. As we've seen many energies subverticals experience pushout for several quarters now, we're encouraged by the strength in Oil & Gas orders during the second quarter.","In particular, North America was strong in LNG and pipelines. We'd like to see a few consecutive quarters of strong order growth before we start to view a trend materializing. The quoting activity remains healthy.","With Power, backlog has remained steady but orders remain lumpy. While Mining is the smallest part of Valves & Controls, we're seeing signs that a bottom may be near and since we have a good installed base, we expect to see stable MRO demand.","Within Industrial process, orders and backlogs are up and we anticipate continued order growth as capital spending in North American capacity expansion in particular continues.","Now let's move to Slide 13 for a review of Process Technologies. Process Technologies reported solid top line growth of 4%, with volumes contributing 3% and a positive 1% from price. Residential & Commercial remains strong with 10% growth during the quarter, as our Aquatic Systems business benefited from healthy demand during its seasonally strongest quarter.","Food & Beverage was down modestly as the business faced a tough year-over-year comp with strong beverage shipments in the comparable period 1 year ago. But we still expect Beverage to be positive for the year.","Infrastructure, now a small piece of Process Technologies, was down another 11%, as demand within the global desalination industries remains weak.","The right half of the page shows second quarter Process Technologies' operating profits and margins. Operating income grew 17% and operating margins expanded 200 basis points to 18.6%. We discussed last quarter a slow start to the year for the segment and the impact of negative mix. But we saw that trend reversed during the second quarter, as Aquatics, one of our higher-margin businesses, had another strong performance. Although price was not quite enough to offset inflation, we saw a strong productivity that contributed to the robust margin expansion in the quarter.","Now let's move to Slide 14 for a look at Flow Technologies. Flow Technologies reported a 2% revenue decline, as the point of positive price contribution was not enough to offset a 3% reduction in volume. Residential & Commercial was down modestly as we continue to emphasize the more profitable pro channel and deemphasized the lower-margin retail business.","Food & Beverage, which is ag in this segment, was up a modest 2%, a sign that our agricultural business is delivering differentiated growth since overall agricultural demand has been slower this year, particularly on the irrigation side. Industrial was up 6%, led by continued global expansion in our fire suppression product lines.","The right half of the page shows second quarter Flow Technologies operating profits and margins. Operating income was up slightly, with operating margins expanding 40 basis points to 13.9%. Mix did have a negative impact due to the lower contribution from Infrastructure and Food & Beverage. We continue to focus on improving productivity within Flow Technologies and have actions in place to drive margin expansion as the top line remains more challenged short-term.","Let's now turn to Slide 15 for a look at Technical Solutions' results. Technical Solutions grew 3% in the quarter, with 1% volume growth and a 2% contribution from price. Industrial was down modestly in the quarter due to slower-than-anticipated recovery for our Equipment Protection business. Energy was down 11% as our Thermal business has seen continued weakness in Canada. Infrastructure, which is primarily datacom and telecom in this segment, was a bright spot, with a 33% gain reading out on our Electronics business driven by improving demand in new products.","The right half of the page shows second quarter Technical Solutions' operating profits and margins. Operating income grew 10% and operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 18.8%. Productivity and synergies remained strong, but slower growth in our profitable Equipment Protection businesses did limit margin expansion in the quarter. Standardization and repositioning remain on track, but as our most profitable segment, more growth is needed to leverage that high profitability.","Let's now turn to Slide 16 for a closer look at the total Pentair growth profile. During the second quarter, we saw solid growth in developed countries while fast growth regions were mixed. U.S. grew at low single-digit rates. We saw a larger decline in Canada, primarily in our Technical Solutions business, where the oil sands impact reads out. Meanwhile, our other businesses were up modestly in Canada. In Western Europe, we saw a very healthy mid-single-digit growth with all segments positive. China and Latin America showed growth, but we saw declines in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. The weakness in the Middle East was due to a very large project that shipped last year. We still see attractive growth prospects for the Middle East longer-term.","Energy continues to see demand shift to the right, to face the tough comp in the second quarter. We expect Energy to turn positive in the second half based on the strength of our backlog in Valves & Controls and overall improvements in order activity, particularly in Oil & Gas. Industrial continues to grow modestly. While we expect that overall CapEx activity to begin to accelerate, this is a trend that has not materialized for the last 2 years and we believe it is more realistic to taper our second-half expectations.","We experienced healthy mid-single-digit growth in our Residential & Commercial vertical, driven by strong Residential demand globally and in the Infrastructure vertical led by our Electronics business. Food & Beverage faced a very tough comparison and was flat in the quarter, but the growth prospects for this vertical remains strong for the year.","Our North American Residential business have continued to see growing in demand and Europe and China showed healthy demand for our Residential products as well. While a smaller piece of our Residential & Commercial vertical, we continue to see improvements in Commercial demand, too.","Infrastructure enjoyed a strong quarter and we expect a good year of growth on the strength of our Electronics business and Technical Solutions. Although comps will begin to get tougher later this year, overall demand has remained relatively steady for the past few quarters while we wait to see how and when Infrastructure and the water businesses rebound.","Food & Beverage is expected to post strong mid-single-digit growth for the full year, following strong double-digit growth last year. While the U.S. agricultural base businesses has slowed on lower farm demand, our businesses are experiencing growth due to expanded coverage from global expansion. Beverage continues to have a healthy backlog and foodservice continues to experience strong international growth.","Let's now turn to Slide 17 for an update on our guidance. We're updating our full year adjusted 2014 EPS guidance to a range of $3.65 to $3.70 from a range of $3.85 to $4. The principal reason for the revision in guidance is the exclusion of our Water Transport business, which is about $0.20 of the guidance reduction. At the top of the range, we've also lowered our full year organic growth expectations as continued delays in energy met slower global industrial recovery are factored into our expectations.","Energy started the year very slow and while our orders in backlog give us increased confidence the first half declines will turn to growth in the second half, it will not be enough to overcome the slow start to the year.","Our cost actions remain on track. Our cash flow remains very strong. We continue to have flexibility with our balance sheet and adjusted EPS remain on track to grow an expected 20% for the full year. We continue to be confident about the elements within our control, but many of our end market segments remain lower-than-expected and we feel it's prudent to adjust our second-half outlook accordingly.","Please turn to Slide 18, labeled Q2 Assessment and Full Year Outlook. We delivered on our first-half expectations as operating income grew 15%, despite only 1% gain on the topline. Operating margins expanded 180 basis points to 13.8% and EPS grew 25% in the first half. As we entered the second half, we're expecting a modest pickup within Industrial and our orders and backlog gives us some expectation that Energy will accelerate in the second half.","While we're seeing some signs of inflation, price and productivity are expected to continue to offset inflation and projected synergies remain ahead of our initial expectations. We also will continue our OMT investment in Valves & Controls in the second half. We're expecting the top line to grow 2% to 3% for the full year, operating income to grow roughly 12%, operating margin expansion of 120 basis points to just over 14% and EPS growth of roughly 20%. We believe we are on track to generate free cash flow greater than 110% of net income.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John L. Stauch","Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide #19, titled EPS Impact on 2015 $5 Per Share Target. As Randy mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are updating our 2015 EPS target to $4.50. While the $5 target is a number that we have been committed to, both internally and externally, the current economic backdrop is just not strong enough to overcome the impact of moving Water Transport to discontinued operations. We are still very excited in the value creation capability from this transformational deal and continue to expect strong organic growth rates, double-digit operating information for the base, plus the benefit of synergies and the balance sheet, just not quite at the levels necessary to offset the ongoing deferrals in Energy CapEx and lingering economic uncertainties.","We're quite pleased with our ability to overdrive in synergies, which we believe speaks well to the power of PIMS and our ability to integrate acquisitions and the higher synergies we needed to offset lower core organic growth rates than were originally anticipated.","We have seen continued deferrals in Energy CapEx and a muted Industrial recovery has contributed to grow not quite at the levels of our original expectations.","Our decision to exit our Water Transport business removes $0.25 from our base. And as we highlighted earlier in the call, we believe this is the right strategic decision to allow us to reallocate resources to other platforms that have differentiated profitable growth opportunities. We've seen lower CapEx in many areas, but particularly in the Canadian oil sands. We have seen 2 larger projects continued to be delayed and although we have secured supplier-of-choice contracts for these projects, these are the types of pushouts that we have been experiencing with projects of all sizes. This does not mean that these projects will not eventually become revenue, but rather, we are choosing not to keep focusing on the recurring delays and will welcome the revenue if and when they finally come to fruition. The $4.50 EPS targets still represents a 21% EPS CAGR, which we believe continues to demonstrate the shareowner value creation from this transformation deal.","Please turn to Slide #20 labeled Disciplined Capital Allocation. We've used this slide in the past to remind everyone of the strength of our cash flow and the flexibility our improved balance sheet gives us. We continue to create further opportunities for more value creation, both on the cash we generate and the leverage opportunity from the incremental EBITDA. All in, we expect to have significant capacity for further bolt-on acquisitions and share buybacks as opportunities arise.","We recently raised our dividend for the 38th consecutive year and we still have roughly $700 million left under our current share repurchase authorization. After looking at our current dividend commitment and our buyback authorization, we still have capacity. We've continued operating performance of nearly $1.3 billion to fuel further acquisitions or buybacks. This is nice flexibility to have and we will continue to make smart capital allocations to improve overall shareholder value.","We continue to run the company for the long term and we'll not exhaust our balance sheet flexibility simply to reach a near-term target. We'll continue to optimize our balance sheet strength to create sustained, long-term shareholder value.","Please turn to Slide #21 labeled Deal Economics Overview. We continue to believe in the long-term reasons why this was truly a transformational deal for Pentair. We acquired 2 leading businesses in Valves & Controls and Thermal Management that further diversified our portfolio and strengthened our position globally, particularly with the exposure to Energy. Our portfolio was better-balanced today, not only from a vertical and geographic standpoint, but also with stronger technologies. We still expect Energy to recover, albeit later-than-expected, and the progress we have made on the cost side is expected to read out in strong leverage as this important vertical rebounds. We have made great progress with regards to our standardization and integration efforts, particularly in Lean and sourcing, but there's still a long runway ahead as evidenced by G&A levels that have more room for improvement.","When looking at the value of the transaction after excluding Water Transport, we acquired 2 leading businesses in Valves & Controls and Thermal at less than 9x EBITDA, which is a multiple that cannot be found in today's M&A environments. We believe this deal has demonstrated our ability to create significant value for our shareholders at a very reasonable price.","Please turn to Slide #22 labeled Q3 2014 Pentair Outlook. For the third quarter of 2014, we expect sales to be up approximately 3% to $1.76 billion. Valves & Controls is expected to be up roughly 3% based on our scheduled backlog and seasonal improvement in the shorter-cycle MRO business. Process Technologies is expected to grow nearly 8%, led by Aquatic Systems related to the strong end of the pool season and backlog infiltration and process. We're anticipating Flow Technologies to be flat with tougher comps in ag and continued deemphasis of our lower-margin retail business. And Technical Solutions is expected to be up roughly 4%, as comps at Thermal get a little easier and improved daily order rates and equipment protection continue.","We are expecting adjusted operating income to be up roughly 8% and operating margins to expand 50 basis points to approximately 14.4%. This includes ongoing OMT investments in Valves & Controls, as well as a negative mix in several of our businesses. We expect mix to be more favorable in the fourth quarter, which is factored into our full year forecast.","Our EPS forecast for the third quarter is a range of $0.93 to $0.95, or an increase of roughly 15% versus 2013. We are expecting the tax rate to remain around 23.5% and the share count to be around 193 million shares.","Please turn to Slide #23 labeled Full Year 2014 Pentair Outlook. Our revised 2014 adjusted EPS outlook of $3.65 to $3.70 represents growth of roughly 20%. For the year, we expect the top line to grow approximately 2% to $7.15 billion, which excludes Water Transport. We expect Valves & Controls to be flat for the full year after a slow start to the year, but the second quarter order growth gives us increased visibility that the topline growth rate should accelerate modestly in the second half. Process Technologies is expected to be up roughly 6%, with strength in Aquatics, Beverage Systems and Foodservice.","Flow Technologies is expected to be flat for the year. Technical Solutions is anticipated to grow roughly 3% for the full year, with Electronics remaining strong, equipment Protection growing modestly and Thermal seeing continued slowness in Canada, offset by a seasonal pickup in the business in the fourth quarter.","Adjusted operating income is expected to be up 12% to just over $1 billion, but this does include roughly $20 million of OMT investments within Valves & Controls. Operating margins are anticipated to be up nearly 120 basis points to 14.1%.","For the full year, we expect the tax rate to be around 23.5% and the share count to be about 196 million shares. Free cash flow remains on track to be north of 110% of net income.","Kim, can you please open the line for questions? Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Steve Winoker from Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'm sure it was hard for each a few to come off of the $5 promise, so I understand that. But I'm just now trying to understand, you still got 18% EPS growth in your '15 over '14 plan at the midpoint, I guess. And when I look at that, it'd be hopeful to understand the cost -- the operating margin and cost synergy side again.

Stauch","Well, I think we -- the $310 million, which I do acknowledge, had about $35 million or so that would be moved to discontinued ops along with Water Transport, so I think that would give you roughly a $275 million ongoing synergy rate that we think would apply to the continuing [indiscernible]","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And that's still the same number. You're not changing that at all, the $275 million?","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, Steve, we're not giving -- I mean, it's -- just to put this in perspective, we're not -- we're going to go back to our normal giving actual guidance for the year in -- when we get -- when we talk in December, which is our fair practice. We felt, as all our degrees of freedom began to get pinched away for us against the $5, we felt we owed it to you to tell you. So the way to think about the $4.50 is we know Water Transport goes, but we also looked at all the puts and takes, the overdrive and synergies, the -- frankly, the lack of confidence that we have in these head fix we keep getting from the economy. And we've been counting on those to come through on a positive way. And they're coming through, even though we're getting some growth in line with what looks like everyone else's, it's just not something I have a lot of confidence in right now. So that's -- so think about the $4.50 that way. We don't have a definitive guidance -- we're not giving a definitive guidance. The $5 was a target and it was something that we held out there for everybody; us and you. We had multiple degrees of freedom to get there. It's 6 months before 2015. I...","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, okay. Fair enough. And Randy, I remember the last time we talked about Water Transport, you described it as \"What do you do with an empty bag of groceries?\" And so now, we're putting it over and this is -- it sounds like obviously the right strategic decision over many years to exit this. But what's your confidence in, I guess, even that process moving forward? How are you thinking about it now?","Randall J. Hogan","Well, I mean, we really did feel like we needed to build a backlog. And the business, the people in the business have worked so hard and committed to the brutal activities necessary to keep their nose above water and it's profitable. There's 2 reasons to discuss. One is it really isn't part of our strategic roadmap going forward. And right now, it has been a distraction within Flow Technologies. Flow Technologies without them doesn't look that great, right? And now they can focus, really can -- the Flow Technologies can really focus on driving the growth in the areas that look quite attractive for them and continue the exit of the retail side of residential and really focus on what we believe is the bright future for Flow Technologies. We've moved -- we're moving the business to actually report to our VP of Ops, which reports up to John. And we're just beginning the process, but we believe that there are prospects for the business in someone else's hands. And I don't know who that is. We haven't started the process yet. It's early days. We just went through a rigorous discussion with our Board about the right way forward and we think this is certainly the right way forward. And this -- our platform, I mentioned this in the script, this platform approach is really quite helpful in that regard in terms of really identifying and letting us differentiate who's going to -- where we're going to flow more of our resources, a much more granular approach than the GBU approach.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Right. And I fully appreciate that. Just before I hand it off, last quick thing. Price is less than from a inflation in Flow Tech that you called out. What's going on there? And are you -- is this just a question of timing and catch up on the pricing side?","John L. Stauch","Yes, it is. I mean, the short answer I mean, we are exiting, as Randy mentioned, several product lines within Home Depot in which we did take a large -- within our retail space, which we did take some large concessions on. So that's what we're managing through right now. But that headwind starts to go away in the second half and into next year.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The -- so the restructurings this year, I guess, how much is that going to be? $60 million or something like that, the total?","John L. Stauch","Yes, that's probably about right. Yes.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","How quickly does that -- do you think that pays back?","John L. Stauch","We feel like it -- all in, we're just slightly -- since we've done this and we're sort of concluding our large restructuring actions, we've taken about $200 million of restructuring today. And the expected full year run rate benefit of that is roughly $200 million on an ongoing basis. So I would say that this last grouping is consistent with that. I mean, a little bit delayed in the sense that we notify and then the benefits come a little bit later, but that's what we're really running to is an ongoing run rate of about $200 million since the inception of the merger.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So when we think about the year-over-year increment on that debt has yet to come in 2015, what is that number?","John L. Stauch","It would probably be approximately $30 million.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","For '15?","John L. Stauch","Correct.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then are there any other -- I think there's this OMT benefits. Is that separate and is that also a plus for '15?","John L. Stauch","Again, we would think that the investment continues, so the $20 million we're spending this year, we'll have another $20 million of investment next year. And there would be a slight pickup from the G&A savings that we'd expect once we go live with that program.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, on the balance sheet, I mean, very strong free cash flow in the quarter. If -- the $1.3 billion you guys highlighted as kind of an opportunity and then on the next page or a page before that, whatever, you talked about how well you've kind of integrated this deal. You're buying back a little more stock. Is the priority -- given kind of what's transpired here, is the priority to descend the stock with more buybacks or should we take your comments around how well Tyco Flow has been integrated as we're ready to go on to do another deal and we're going to be opportunistic on something of size if it comes along?","John L. Stauch","Yes. I think the way we look at it now is just really $2 billion of capacity less the $700 million remaining in share authorization. Our goal is to create long-term sustainable value and acquisitions continue to be a big part of that. But right now, there isn't a plethora of significant acquisitions to go get. So short-term, we've been doing what we feel is a disciplined capital allocation model of choosing between all of the options and making sure that we're looking at the one that drives the right long-term value creation.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And sorry, one more question. In terms of the Valves & Controls, the order -- the visibilty on the kind of the order pipeline. Things have been lumpy. Is this the real -- like this 7% growth, did you think there's enough visibility now in the pipeline to say that at least the orders should continue to grow here, acknowledging you're conservative on timing and the revenues and stuff like that?","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, I mean, there's a certain amount of lumpiness, as you say. But the 7% growth in orders this quarter, we think portends more positive things coming. We have the quote log, we track ahead of that and that's up as well. It seems to be legitimate, the -- and the real projects and that's up. I think that, that will be good. And I'm really looking forward to seeing how we clock it in third and fourth quarter. That's really going to tell us a lot. I really like the discipline that the Valves & Controls team has put around the quote following now. I think we're in a much better shape than we were a year ago in terms of tracking and managing that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My first question is on the restructuring. And I think that you're pretty much through it now for the year at $69 million. But I think your original expectation was something closer to the $23 million. You did $46 million this quarter. 2 questions. What surprised you such that you accelerated the restructuring actions this quarter? And the follow-on, is it safe to assume that we are done with the restructuring for the rest of the year?","John L. Stauch","I'll never say we're done. I think we aggressively went to everybody and said, \"Listen, we want to put it behind us and we want to move forward. We want to start having reported and GAAP be the same -- I'm sorry, reporting just be the same number for the rest of the year.\" And on that context, I think we were more aggressive in the quarter based on the fact that we gave that guidance that we needed to put this behind us. But I think, overall, we feel really good about how the teams have stepped up. We feel really good about the productivity actions. And a lot of this is being driven, as Randy mentioned, by PIMS and Lean standardization and all the right things that we're doing to simplify the businesses to be better to deal with from a customer perspective and also to get the standardization in line so that we can be better at acquisitions going forward.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And I guess something that I'm struggling with a little bit is the impact of the Water Transport business. And so I think in Slide 8, you guys mentioned that the impact in 2013 was about $0.16 from Water Transport. And yet you gave us a delta last quarter on Water Transport, expecting to be a $0.13 negative headwind to 2014 results, which implies that the Water Transport business was going to add roughly about $0.03 this year. And so, I guess, help me bridge the gap of that $0.03 versus the $0.20 impact that you guys are talking about in terms of the guidance reduction for this year.","John L. Stauch","Yes. I mean, I think you'll see it in the documents that where we were with Water Transport last year was what we described, which is the fact that the numbers we gave you were last year's 2013 numbers. We expected the business to the roughly flat for '14. When we came out and saw that the projects on pipeline was going to be less and there was going to be less contribution from Water Transport after we gave our original guidance, the goal was to drive the other businesses and hope that we would see back half upside to make up for that difference. And what you're seeing now is what the actual forecast for the business looks like this year, which is significantly less than the way we planned it and significantly less than its contribution last year. The other element that's going through the impact of the EPS is the changing share count from where we were in 2012 at 213.8 million shares to where we expect to be next year, which is sub 190 million. So that if you take that off the contributions, that's where you're seeing the impact.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I mean, maybe trying to slice that up a slightly different way. It seems like the Water Transport business was in a loss position in the first of the year. But in the second half of the year, was it your expectation that you're going to get about $0.20 in benefit in Water Transport in the back half?","John L. Stauch","Well, it was about in a breakeven position for the first half and we thought it would have a slightly larger uptick in the second half. However, we're talking apples and oranges here. Again, the plan was that we'd have contribution in the first half and we'd have contribution in the second half. When we didn't get the contribution in the first half, we adjusted our Water Transport outlook. We tried to overdrive the other businesses to get back on plan. And therefore, we are now telling you, we don't think that, that's...","Randall J. Hogan","That's not happening.","John L. Stauch","That's not going to happen.","Randall J. Hogan","Because of the revenue. I mean, we were encouraged when we saw some of these projects getting released and that's why we're talked about the oil sands. We talked -- we saw some of these things getting released. We were getting excited about them and then we see them all pushed to the right. We just -- it's -- I don't -- just not going to comment on stuff until they happen.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","The 2 questions that I have are when we talked about the step down on the 2005 -- 2015 target, it looks like you're only carving like 1 point or so out of the topline, yet $0.25 a share out of the bottom. Can you maybe walk us through that?","Randall J. Hogan","That's really, as 1.0 out of '14 -- it's a 1.5 out of '14. It's a 1.0 out of '15. It's the general bad news in missing the growth profile for 3 years running and the compounding of it.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's fair. Okay. My only other question was really about the Valves business. So some of your wording, are you suggesting that your 2015 target is really devoid of the project business because you're kind of, I think as you said, kind of tired of waiting for it. Is that gravy to the $4.50?","Randall J. Hogan","Well, I mean, these -- this CapEx pushing to the right affects Valves & Controls. It affects -- it, really, it affects 3 out of our 4 segments. But it really effects Valves & Controls and it really effects Technical Solutions. The big number, the big project that I was referring to really wanting to sort of fill in the upside to what we're saying are the thermal ones. There's some big Valves & Controls ones, too, that are -- would also be a risk of sliding, but Valves & Controls is thousands of projects. And so with the -- the law of large numbers helps us a little bit of that. In Thermal, they've had some really large, large projects that we were all excited about starting on and they're on ice.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's -- I get that. And I actually did have one last one I wanted to squeeze in, just on the -- based on the December Analyst Meeting you guys typically have, maybe it's November, whenever it's going to be, where were you really formalized your next year guidance. Randy, you're suggesting that $4.50 is sort of approximate, the final range that you give at that meeting could be higher, could be lower, or are you saying that your guidance will capture that number?","Randall J. Hogan","That will be my best guess right now. It could be higher. It could be lower. I mean, frankly, as I said, I can't go out and tell you anymore that I'm -- that I have a path to $5. I had to decide -- we had to decide, do we just take it away? Or do we give you some indication of what our best thinking is now? Obviously, our -- we weren't thinking -- it wasn't our best thinking that gave us $5, was it? I mean, so I think that would say that the $4.50 is our best guess right now based on what we know today. That's how I would want you to think about it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond from KeyBanc.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just to kind of a follow on the large project. But Randy, more broadly, you mentioned kind of multiple degrees of freedom to hit the $5 and maybe now to hit the $4.50. And I'm assuming you're kind of talking about added buyback, kind of the $1.3 billion and the large projects and tax. Can you just talk about some of those levers that you can pull to kind of get you to the $4.50, or maybe nudge it above the $4.50 if the macro cooperates?","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, let's -- let me go back. Let me talk about it. I mean, that's exactly -- how we thought about the -- when we said that we were creating a business that had $5 of earnings power in 2015, when announced the merger on March 28, 2012. That was the takeaway on my last page. And when we thought about that $5, we said we believe we can overdrive synergies. We believe we're looking at a market, thought that should have really -- the economy should have rebounded really nicely and that'll be really good for Industrial and really good in Energy and we're going to clock some nice organic growth and we'll get drop through on that. And we have buyback. And we added all that up and we were comfortably above $5, right? And as the buyback, we were grateful that the stock responded to the early performance of the business and so the stock buyback didn't get quite as much impact because the stock price was higher. We did overdrive synergies. That was great. We had big disappointments in Water Transport, which we talked about. But also, Energy. And we really have underrun by 1% to 1.5% in '13 and '14 and now we think '15, what we really needed to have that great headroom above $5. So as we look at $4.50 and we came to that number, it's going to take another 1.5 -- more than 1.5 points of growth on the organic side to really help drive the topline, to drive above that number. Is that possible? I think it's possible. But we need less uncertainty in the world. We need more commitment to capital. We need some of these animal spirits of the economy to come to the floor. And look at the profitability we have. We're building in Valves & Controls and we have in our Technical Solutions business. We need organic growth. We will mint money when we get it. So I'm very focused right now. And that's one of the reasons why Water Transport, God bless the people in it, put them aside and focus everybody else on driving growth. Now we have the $700 million that's already approved in stock buyback. I'm committed to that. And we've got this other $1.3 billion. But how we use that $1.3 billion is to create shareholder value. And it could be stock buyback. It could be acquisitions. And we're going to look at all of it. So that's how we think about it. It's the way we thought about it when we put the businesses together. And I think our prospects as a company are every bit as good as they were. And we're going to exploit the ones we can capture.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Perfect. That's very helpful. Just a couple of clarifications. Process margins in 3Q look a little bit light. What's going on there? And how do think about tax x Water? I'm kind of...","John L. Stauch","The process margins, real quickly, is we do have some systems that we're beginning to ship and especially in our filtration processes. And so when we ship those systems, we generally get a little less margin. We do them for the aftermarket revenue of the membrane annuity stream. So every once in a while, we're going to have some lumpiness with the project margins in that business. Everything else is as is. And on the tax rate side, we continue to do all the right actions to benefit from the global structure that Randy mentioned in the OMT. We also have a similar project that were leading in Technical Solutions.","Randall J. Hogan","And I think, yes, the Water Transport x doesn't affect tax.","John L. Stauch","We're not expecting that to dramatically impact our tax rate, Jeff.","Operator","And you next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","A little more on the process margins. I -- Fourth quarter implies snapping back pretty quickly. So it sounds like the mix impact is pretty localized in the third quarter.","John L. Stauch","Yes. Keep in mind that our product systems business is generally a stronger-margin business right now than the Filtration & Processing. And so they have a strong Q2. They have lighter Q3 and then they usually have a stronger Q4. So the contribution for Aquatic Systems within the Process Technologies side versus the contribution from Filtration & Process also has an impact on the overall segment margins.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And in terms of realizing value for Water Transport, you're exiting it at a pretty high bottom. Could you just comment on the timing a little bit?","Randall J. Hogan","Well, I mean, that was the early comment about the hard to sell an empty bag, an empty shopping bag. It's also not worth carrying around forever. So we showed you the evaluation of the deal economics as we see it today, one of the charts that John showed. And that basically is assuming modest value for that. So those multiples of how everybody, all the shareholders involved here, did very, very well with this acquisition, assumes we get a realistic number for Water Transport. Let me leave it at that.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I heard a fair amount of companies saying the oil sands is picking up. You said sliding to the right, but also said you're seeing some pickup in the orders there. So how would you characterize that?","Randall J. Hogan","It's the releases against the orders that we need because we don't -- until we ship something, we can't bill it. And we can't make it until they release the order. And that's what really has me shaken because I've seen it slip 3 times and it's baseball season.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You folks talked a lot about projects getting pushed to the right. Maybe give us a sense of, within the Energy, as well as in Industrial vertical, how much of your business would you say is tied to growth or discretionary CapEx versus maintenance? Any color around that will be helpful.","John L. Stauch","Yes, I mean, I think we gave you a rough percentage. I mean, our installed base is obviously substantially higher than what our greenfield projects would be. So with any given quarter, we're looking at about 50% to 60% our revenue comes from serving what we would say is the general installed base. And it's not like we're a project-dependent business. We're more CapEx-dependent. And this CapEx in these Energy spaces usually continues to flow. Right now, we're in about 2 or 3 years straight of that amount of capital being reduced or being timed, as Randy said. Our belief is that there's not a great fear of inflation so there's no sense of urgency to put the projects in motion.","Randall J. Hogan","Or in effect, the bids and rebids, they keep getting lower prices. So that's why they keep them in rebid.","John L. Stauch","So what we're really referring to is we're not counting or hoping, because hope is not a great plan, on any large, unique bluebird projects that may or may not be coming into the forecast.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And just a follow-up, any color you can give around North American residential markets? Are you seeing any pause there or continued momentum in your business?","Randall J. Hogan","I would say, we have, we've got the 3 businesses that serve. We have the Aquatics business, we have Residential pump and we have the Residential Filtration business. And in the pro channel, Residential Flow, we've got some modest growth, but nice growth. It's masked by the exit of the retail side that we've talked about. And Residential Filtration is growing, again, single digits. Not exciting, but decent, not quite mid-singles, but -- and then Aquatics continues to do well with the share gain and the energy savings and the leading product lines and the best sales force. So that's pretty high. And that's continued. I see it as pretty steady. And the thing that really drives, certainly, the Residential Filtration and the Aquatics business is people putting money into homes. It isn't just housing starts, it's actually investments, if you will, in the housing stock. And so we -- it's been pretty stable for the 3 or 4 quarters of growth and even for a couple of businesses longer than that. And so we've actually seen in a couple of markets, where we think the markets can be stronger if there were -- if contractors could actually hire skilled labor. There's skilled labor shortage in some of the crafts in some areas of the country. It's affected our pool business and I think it's affected some of the remodeling business as well. On the pump side, it's really good for all of our pump players when -- the well pumps, so homes being built. When communities are being opened up and when larger homes built outside, they have the most pump content. Most of the housing that's being done is multifamily. So it has a more muted benefit to the Residential business when you have multifamily housing tighter to the city. That's probably too long an answer. Sorry.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Coming to just the lock on the free cash flow and the buyback and everything else. You did keep your free cash flow estimate despite the fact that you are taking operating profit down between now and 2015, I think about maybe $100 million. So a little bit less on that income line, but maybe just talk about what the bridge is. Are you getting better working capital performance out of -- versus your original plan? It would be helpful to get some detail there.","John L. Stauch","Yes, the -- I think the original forecast did not include any real contribution from working capital. And yes, we are performing better in working capital. And yes, we continue to feel confident about achieving greater than 110% of net income. So I think it was really more of a conservative first look at the cash flow. And generally our forecast right now is what the see and therefore, what we shared with you.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And that's mostly on the Valves & Controls side of the business or is it coming elsewhere?","Randall J. Hogan","No. Valves & Controls would be the primary contributor.","Randall J. Hogan","Yes. But we have -- in our Process Technologies business, we have a lot of opportunity. We really have opportunity on working capital in all of our businesses, but Valves & Controls is a big one.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. And just secondly, just on the Valves & Controls and the outlook. I mean, we actually have been hearing, I guess it's been mixed, but generally positive data points on orders our pumps related to oil and gas and other projects. And typically, you do see the Valves follow that by a couple of quarters. So most of the pump guys have been, I guess, giving a little bit more confidence that things are starting to happen. I guess, why are you being so conservative in that case if you do see the leading indicators actually starting to improve?","John L. Stauch","I think as Randy mentioned, we're optimistic that we can see a couple more quarters of sustained order growth. Our Q2 reflected a pretty solid order quarter and we're hopeful Q3 and Q4. But we're now in the point of the cycle where if we book the orders and the valve is processed, we're looking at 2015 shipments. So what we're reflecting right now in the 2014 forecast is our shippable backlog, plus what we believe we can get to the book and ship and get out by the end of the year. We're hopeful that -- we looked at that same days that you did and that is the right leading indicator. And we're hopeful that we see those order start to come in Valves space and that would set up a nice 2015.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And can you just touch on the pricing of some of the emerging projects that are coming to market? Is it more competitive, or is it holding fairly stable?","Randall J. Hogan","I don't think there's anything -- there's nothing surprising or any kind of large move that I have seen in pricing. I mentioned earlier about a lot of rebids that are happening in the Energy business. That's really for the whole project. It didn't really affect our scope of the projects. But some of these huge, huge, $10 billion projects, they want to cut $1 billion out. That comes from redesigning the plan and doing things differently. So that's what I was referring to there.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Randall J. Hogan","All right. Thank you, all. You can give the replay.

We also used our strong balance sheet and cash flow to buyback 100 million of shares in the quarter and have purchased 400 million to the first three quarters.","For the full year, we raised our core sales growth expectation by a full point to be 4% to 5% and we are still expecting ROS expansion of approximately 50 basis points to 18%. We are also raising our adjusted EPS guidance to be approximately $2.33, which reflects the third quarter performance as well as the small benefit from share repurchases in the quarter. This marks the second consecutive quarter that we have raised our expectations driven in part by continued healthy end markets as well as continued execution across our portfolio.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss the third quarter results and update you on the details of our full year 2018 outlook before I provide an update on our key strategic growth initiatives.","Mark Borin","Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 5 labeled Q3 \u201818 Pentair performance. As John mentioned, core sales grew 6%. All three segments contributed this quarter with particular strength in Aquatic Systems. We will provide more color on the performance of all three segments shortly. Segment income increased 1%, while ROS contracted 40 basis points to 17.1% in line with expectations as price increases implemented to offset inflation took effect late in the quarter. We will expand on the margin performance when discussing the individual segments.","Adjusted EPS grew 10% to $0.54 per share, which was $0.02 ahead of our prior guidance. Our adjusted tax rate remained 18% and our share count came in at 175.7 million shares benefiting in part from the 150 million in shares we repurchased during the second quarter and an additional 100 million we repurchased during the third quarter. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter at $108 million and we have generated $265 million in free cash flow year-to-date, which is in line with normal seasonal patterns.","Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q3 \u201818 Pentair segment performance. This slide lays out the performance of our three segments. Aquatic Systems delivered a strongest performance of the year with 12% core sales growth in the quarter, income growth of 13% and ROS expansion of 60 basis points. We saw strong demand in the quarter, favorable mix and continued dealer gains. In addition, we implemented our annual price increase in September, while continuing to increase our growth investments in this important segment. We believe the outlook for Aquatic Systems remains very favorable and we continue to believe in the long-term outlook of our franchise business.","Filtration Solutions returned to growth in the quarter, with core sales increasing 2%. We continue to see pockets of strength in our important North American residential and commercial markets. We saw particular strength in our niche industrial businesses, but just as important, our food and beverage business showed signs of stabilizing after first half declines. Segment income decreased and ROS contracted 70 basis points to 16%. We implemented price increases in September to help mitigate increased inflation due in part to tariffs implemented in July, but we do not expect to see the full benefits of the price increase until the fourth quarter.","Flow Technologies reported its third consecutive quarter of core sales growth and it\u2019s 5% core sales growth was its strongest performance of the year. We saw solid performance in our North American residential and irrigation business and our large pump business showed further signs of stabilization, but we would remind everyone that this is the smallest part of our Flow Technologies segment and tends to be longer cycle and therefore a bit lumpier than our other businesses in flow. Segment income was down 7% and ROS contracted 150 basis points to 15.4%. The margin performance was similarly impacted as Filtration Solutions due to the timing of inflationary pressures and the corresponding price realization.","Please turn to Slide 7 labeled balance sheet and cash flow. This continues to be one of our favorite slides as free cash flow remains strong and we have significantly reduced our debt levels during the year. As we pointed out last quarter, our debt is now at a level not seen since 2010. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we believe we are well-positioned to invest in the business, look at attractive strategically aligned tuck-in or bolt-on acquisition targets and continue to return cash to shareholders. We have bought back 400 million in shares year-to-date and we would remind everyone that we have raised our dividend for 42 consecutive years.","Please turn to Slide 8 labeled Q4 \u201818 Pentair outlook. We anticipate fourth quarter core sales to grow 4% to 5% with all three segments contributing. We expect Aquatic Systems be up 10% to 12%, Filtration Solutions up 1% to 2% and Flow Technologies to grow 2% to 3%. Segment income is anticipated to be up approximately 6%, while ROS is expected to expand roughly 30 basis points. Below the line, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be around 18%, net interest and other expense to be approximately $7 million and our share count to be around 176 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $0.59 per share, which would be the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted EPS growth.","Please turn to Slide 9 labeled 2018 Pentair outlook. This slide is one we first introduced at our Investor Day in February and we wanted to provide an update as we enter the homestretch of 2018. Given our strong year-to-date performance, the expected overall sales number is slightly higher than our initial forecast for the year. All three of our businesses implemented price increases in September. Consistent with the second half outlook we discussed in our second quarter earnings call in July, the price implementation is essentially in line with our prior expectations and our full year outlook for inflation has not materially changed. The net result is that our full year segment income expectations have not changed and we will continue to expect to drive productivity in addition to price increases we have implemented.","Please turn to Slide 10 labeled full year 2018 Pentair outlook. For the full year, we have raised our core sales growth forecast by a point and now expect core sales to increase 4% to 5%. We expect Aquatic Systems core sales to grow roughly 10%, Filtration Solutions to be up 1% to 2%, and Flow Technologies to increase 2% to 3%. Segment income is expected to be up around 8%, while ROS is expected to end the year around 18%, which would represent an increase of roughly 50 basis points. Below the line, we expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be around 18%, adjusted net interest and other expense to be roughly $30 million and shares to be around 178 million. For the full year, we now expect adjusted EPS to be around $2.33 per share and we continue to target free cash flow to approximate 100% of adjusted net income.","I would like to turn the call back to John.","John Stauch","Thank you, Mark. Please turn to Slide #11 titled Pentair\u2019s strategy summary. We have used this page consistently in our earnings presentations to remind everyone of our strategy and be the leading residential and commercial water treatment company and to share with you the areas where we are investing in growth. Our focused areas of strategy remain on advancing growth in pool and accelerating residential and commercial water treatment, which requires investment at the business and the enterprise level. Our approach to capital allocation remains disciplined and we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating, reinvesting in our most attractive core businesses, and paying competitive dividend yield. We also look at a balanced approach between M&A and intelligent buybacks with our M&A decisions being informed by overall valuations and the quality of assets available as well as our ability to integrate them successfully.","Please turn to Slide 12 labeled focused strategies. As we prioritize our growth priorities, we believe this allows us the best opportunity to drive differentiated growth in what we believe is a very attractive water quality space. I would like to give you a quick update on our progress regarding our two most important focused strategies. The first strategy is advancing pool growth, one of our biggest opportunities around automation and connected pools and products. We continue to increase our new product introductions, inclusive of smart technologies and have launched two new automation systems. Our IntelliConnect is an entry-level automation system that connects only a few existing pool products and we have also launched our next generation of our more advanced IntelliConnect platform that provides the highest level of automation for our end consumers and pool dealers. Less than 10% of the 5 million installed in-ground pools today have some form of automation system and we believe this represents a continued runway of growth where we will continue to invest.","Our second key growth initiative is accelerating residential and commercial water treatment. We have conducted several consumer surveys to better understand the market, but equally important, we are engaging consumers through digital marketing to build brand strength and drive demand through our dealer network. We are in the early innings of moving up the value chain from being a leading component supplier to introducing smart connected branded products and solutions. We have made several investments in China and Southeast Asia as we see a lot of opportunities in this large market.","Please turn to Slide #13. This is the slide that we publicly introduced at the EPG Conference in May of this year. We wanted to remind everyone of our long-term goals. In the current inflationary environment where price has been easier to get and assuming this continues, we would not be surprised to see core sales growth trending toward the upper end of the range if not slightly better. We are currently expecting the pricing environment, coupled with productivity to generally offset inflation and we will provide more details on the impact to 2019 guidance when we release our fourth quarter earnings at the end of January, but we wanted to remind everyone that our long-term goals have not changed.","I would now like to turn the call over to Crystal for Q&A after which I will have closing comments. Crystal, please open the line for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","John Stauch","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey, start off with congratulations on that pricing power and pool and last quarter it was controversial at the time that you were one of the few companies to hold off on implementing price increases for this one segment, but it certainly came through. Could you give some color as to what that process was, how much price did you get, how much of it stuck, and what you think the underlying growth and pool was in the quarter?","John Stauch","Sure, Deane and thanks for the comments and agree that the pool business certainly has the ability to control their pricing decisions and had a strong result. Pricing was in line with expectations as we have discussed before. The price went in, in mid-September. So, in Q3 when we saw small impact of that for the pool business in the Q3 quarter, but we will see the full benefit of that in Q4 and it\u2019s in line with our expectations overall and is part of the price that you see for the full year expectation on our full year walk. In terms of their growth split between price and core growth, I think most of the growth in Q3 coming from volume rather than price, only maybe 1 point to 2 points of growth coming from price and then as that grows, about double that in Q4.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then just could you clarify the outlook for this IntelliConnect product. This seems to us to be \u2013 have the potential to be one of these revolutionary products similar to the variable speed pump that you introduced. So today what's your expectation for growth in IntelliConnect, and do you have to retrofit pools in order to implement this system?","John Stauch","The answer to the last question is no. I mean, it is an automation system that obviously works off of WiFi or the Internet and then connects to the products to basically giving intelligent pool system, Deane. And yes, we do believe that \u2013 you're talking about 5 million installed pools and less than 10% of them today run on some type of automation capability and that automation capability provides two opportunities, one is for dealers to remotely monitor pools and manage the proper pool for \u2013 composites for people. But the other one is for the consumer themselves to interact with their pool more effectively, lighting, variable speed pumps as you mentioned, salt water pools, the chemistry. So, we see it as a revolutionary product for sure, and this one is an easier one that creates over-the-air software updates and really has a better graphic user interface capability. And its open architecture meaning it will work not only with Pentair products, but it will also work with our competitors\u2019 products as well, which we think is also revolutionary.","Deane Dray","Good to hear. Thank you.","John Stauch","Thank you, Deane.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joe Giordano","Hey, guys, good morning.","John Stauch","Good morning","Mark Borin","Good morning.","Joe Giordano","So, if we look at the other non-pool businesses, how do you feel like you are with your price increases, do you think you are forward thinking enough or were they large enough to deal with your forward expectations for inflation, how do you see that kind of playing out over the next few quarters?","John Stauch","Yes. Yes, we do \u2013 so again similar response for the other two businesses. The price kicked in, in the back half of September and the realization is consistent with expectations and it's \u2013 we see that reading out as expected in Q4. We had a little bit of pull-in in Q3 ahead of the price increase, which we had anticipated. So that reduces a little bit of the price expectation for the full-year, but overall, on a run rate basis, it's consistent with our expectations. And our views on inflation, which price was put into offset or mitigate remain unchanged as well, so you can see the full-year expectation on inflation remains about $80 million.","Joe Giordano","And then as it relates to your China strategy, have you \u2013 have your discussions at least changed a little bit to consider what's going on trade wise and geopolitically there, and do you \u2013 is there any alterations that you need to make to how you deploy that strategy?","John Stauch","It's a great question. I mean, we do about $160 million in China and Southeast Asia overall from a revenue stream and most of that in our filtration businesses. We still are committed to our China strategy primarily because they advanced in the way that the market is evolving, I mean, the rate of pace, they're going to put 3,000 new Starbucks stores in, there is a competitor coffee chain called Luckin doing 1,000 stores this year, 2,000 next year. These are some enormous growth rates. We also have the context of \u2013 we\u2019re working with the Internet there and the way that people buy off the Internet and looking at two to three-hour delivery windows to the product. So, I think it's an area that we're going to continue to participate in, because we\u2019re learning and growing and establishing a lot of the tools and principles that I think ultimately are going to work themselves back into Europe and into North America as well.","Joe Giordano","And then last for me, it's still early days post-split, but maybe can you \u2013 John, can you just talk about maybe what are some of the biggest changes you've seen internally so far and maybe couple of examples something that's taking over a bit longer than you'd like to move forward in the direction you see?","John Stauch","Yes, I am very impatient, so everything takes longer, but I'm very proud of the way the teams leaning in. Obviously, a great result in the quarter as evidenced by dealing with a late announcement of a tariff impact and reacting to it the best we could and managing through those expectations and we\u2019re getting back to consistency and predictability. But what we're most excited about is we're having discussions about winning at the product line level again. We have some 30 major product lines and that's where the way you win. You differentiate your product against the competition in the customers' eyes and we're having good discussions about how to utilize technology and innovation and business model innovation to really differentiate that customer experience and that\u2019s going to take longer time, but that\u2019s ultimately how we are going to get back to the core organic growth that I know we can achieve.","Joe Giordano","Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","Hey, guys. Good morning.","John Stauch","Good morning, Steve.","Mark Borin","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Just on free cash flow, you guys I think are running slightly ahead of net income, I don\u2019t know which net income you use whether it\u2019s adjusted or GAAP or whatever year-to-date and I think fourth quarter is usually relatively strong, anything different about this year or am I just not getting the normal seasonality right?","John Stauch","You got it, right, Steve. I mean, we are still targeting adjusted net income, cash flow to be 100% of adjusted net income and obviously we will work through the normal seasonality patterns and there is nothing really to update at this time.","Steve Tusa","And anything unusual about the performance in the third quarter that stands out, that\u2019s not sustainable on the cash front?","John Stauch","No.","Mark Borin","Third quarter was in line with expectations and we don\u2019t see anything necessarily unusual in the fourth quarter as well.","Steve Tusa","Okay. I don\u2019t know if anybody asked it yet, but tariffs, just kind of give us an update on how you are thinking about that? And maybe just give us an update on \u2013 or some color remind us about your kind of sourcing structure? I think you noticed anything from China is getting it marked up, so how are you guys thinking about it into 2019?","Mark Borin","Sure, Steve. And the overall story on tariffs and inflation in general is as I mentioned before is just the consistency with our previous expectations. So, as we look at the balance of the year, our inflation expectation remains at about $80 million, that includes all the tariffs that have been announced and implemented. So, it includes sort of the people talk about lists 1, 2 and 3 in the different sections that make that up. So that\u2019s all reflected in our expectations, so really no change from what we talked about before as we have already touched on pricing and our expectations there. And we certainly are going to continue to evaluate the overall supply chain and look for opportunities to be able to make changes to reduce the impact of tariffs long-term as those things take a little bit longer obviously, but we are certainly looking at that. We have a factory in Suzhou and so we will evaluate what we do there and how our overall supply chain structure is organized.","Steve Tusa","Yes. I guess just more specifically, I mean there you are only getting hit by part of this year and then there is other list, who knows 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 coming through, what do you see as of today assuming some of these things come through just using a kind of simplified view of what you are sourcing from China and then sticking some sort of an increase in cost on that, what would you expect that headwind in 2019 to be that you could overcome with productivity or whatever else you do?","John Stauch","Yes. So, Steve just to reiterate, the 2018 \u2013 for 2018 reflects everything that we currently get out of China including direct sourcing. When we put the pricing forward on September 15 we assume that we would likely see another couple of points of inflation heading into 2019. That is probably at least a likely scenario given the fact that we are going to continue to see inflationary pressures come from all of these lists that happened. So I think right now we feel like we have got things well contained and we can only deal with what we know, Steve and if there is anything else that comes about, we reserve the right to go back with incremental price increases.","Steve Tusa","Okay. What \u2013 sorry one last question, what is that bucket of cost that you talked about either direct or indirect coming from China?","John Stauch","What do you mean, Steve?","Steve Tusa","What is the total cost of the stuff you are sourcing from over there, so maybe we can just do the math ourselves?","Mark Borin","Think of it as roughly $300 million both direct and indirect.","Steve Tusa","Great. That\u2019s exactly what I am looking for. Alright, thanks a lot. Great color.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets.","Scott Graham","Yes, hi, good morning. I guess I just want to piggyback a little bit on Steve\u2019s question here, because if we look in the third quarter, the waterfall, the inflation is a $24 million number and I know you guys indicated that it\u2019s still in line with your expectations, but the most recent lists, the most recent 2 lists were post your second quarter earnings report and the 24 million does not seem to be yet fully loaded with inflation. So, could you give us an idea is there going to be need to go out with more pricing, let\u2019s say in pool and have your price increases in the other two segments contemplated, what could be over $100 million number next year?","Mark Borin","As we \u2013 as John referenced before, I mean, our expectations haven\u2019t changed and the forecast that we have put forth of approximately $80 million reflects all the tariffs that have been announced and implemented which is there is nothing new that\u2019s out there. This is the list that you are referring to even though they hadn\u2019t been implemented and effective prior to our last quarter\u2019s guidance, there was enough information out there that we had some visibility to that. And as John said, we frankly don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know and so we reserve the ability and the right to be able to go back and adjust and go back for more price if necessary, but the guidance that we have for the year stands on its own and remains unchanged from what we provided previously.","John Stauch","Just to add, Scott, as I said I mean we have put in price increases that not only reflected our 2018 expectations for inflation, but that inflation would continue. And so we are hopeful that we have got enough in there, if not we will adjust accordingly.","Scott Graham","Okay, great. And then maybe this is a quick follow-up to that, I know that the model has been so far as an independent to sort of do the price plus productivity will offset inflation, I am just wondering you have given your answers to the above your thinking on the price increases which you have answered affirmatively that they have contemplated more inflation. Can we get to where we are price cost neutral in the first half of next year, excluding productivity just fewer price cost?","John Stauch","I don\u2019t think so, Scott. And I think we are counting on prices, the majority of it, but we also need productivity and keep in mind our sourcing teams are active every single day seeking alternative sourcing. So we even within the inflation numbers this year have favorable productivity and you see that in the column offsetting that, but I think we are going to need productivity and we are also going to need growth contributions, Scott, I think that\u2019s just the environment we are in right now.","Scott Graham","Got it. And if I could just squeeze one more in if you don\u2019t mind and thank you for that answer. I was very interested in your comments, John about the surveys understanding the market which you and I have discussed before, how you are engaging consumers more, the dealer network the whole thing. I was just wondering if you can give us maybe a couple of win examples, things that you are really excited about that the team actually was able to monetize over the last quarter?","John Stauch","Yes. I think first of all, we really 3 \u2013 go across the segments. I think pool really has a great dealer intimacy. And why I mentioned the dealer, it\u2019s the actual dealer talking to the consumer and working with the consumer. And what we are learning is that, that consumer is becoming more and more educated and as they become more and more educated we are able to create more content, because as you put your pool in or you think about your retrofits to the pool you are very excited about all of the other products that you can bring to the table. So, we are clearly getting more content through to the aftermarket and I do think that that\u2019s a result of learning that the consumer is important in helping to influence that and stay. In infiltration, what we are learning is as you would expect, it\u2019s not a national or global issue it\u2019s more local. Your city and where you live, your water quality varies and obviously I have shared this with you, New York City is not a problem for water. As you start to move into other particular regions, you have challenges and getting more specific around the challenges to each region allows us to have the right products to our dealer channel to solve those issues, so very excited about your growth there. And then flow, I think we are starting to realize that we have a good brand across to what we have major brands that we are very well respected and that we need to continue to work to get those products and make those available to the end customers and we have to work through various distribution channels to do that since there isn\u2019t a large distributor, a large dealer that covers nationally. And in China and Southeast Asia, as I mentioned, people want to buy on the Internet. They want ready-now products. They want an experience center. And I do think all of those things we\u2019re doing in China that we\u2019ve learned from connecting with the consumer, we\u2019ll work that way in the North American market as well. So, thanks for asking, Scott.","Scott Graham","Thanks a lot for that answer. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird.","Mike Halloran","Hey, good morning, guys.","John Stauch","Good morning.","Mike Halloran","So, on the food and beverage side, you\u2019re starting to see some stabilization there. Maybe just dig a little bit more granularly into what you're seeing in the market, why the stabilization is occurring, and how you're thinking about that as we move into the fourth quarter next year?","Mark Borin","Yes, sure. As we\u2019ve talked before as that business has experienced challenges and has been shrinking for quite a while, frankly, it\u2019s gotten to a point where it's a smaller portion of the portfolio and it's really not something that that\u2019s going to drive our overall performance. And so it's \u2013 feel like it\u2019s sort of hit the bottom and we\u2019re seeing some signs of life and decent order rates. And it's something frankly that hope to not have to continue talking about because it's just a small piece of the overall picture and we\u2019re focused on \u2013 more importantly on our residential, commercial side of the business.","John Stauch","And Mike just to remind you the market is growing and we\u2019re growing with the market, but we have a very high value membrane and we have products that are really helpful in the overall food and beverage processing. What we are no longer doing is building the systems and the skids around them and just assembling other people's products to go forward. So that\u2019s what really drove the decline. And we feel confident that we have a product that other people combine, assemble and put into the process and that's really where we think we should be long-term. It\u2019s also better margins for us and better predictability and consistency as our future revenue streams. So, it was all conscious and it was all an effort that we put in this year.","Mike Halloran","Makes sense. And then on the capital deployment side, obviously, been running the buybacks through pretty aggressively last few quarters, I know balance is what you are thinking about on a forward basis, but it takes time to build the funnel backup, how are you thinking about that M&A funnel and how are you thinking about balancing the two M&A verse buybacks, obviously dividends are a core part, but that's been pretty consistent?","John Stauch","Yes, I think our first goal is get back to predictable and consistent results and I'm pleased that we are making progress on that. I think we've got three quarters now where we're starting to build that consistency and we're starting to also understand strategically where our best businesses are and how those businesses are positioned and we're really aligned not only as a management team, but with our Board of where we'd like to make those acquisitions, the tuck-ins and cores like basically bolt-ons. And so, I do think we're starting to build a really robust funnel and I really \u2013 I\u2019m hopeful that we'll be able to get some things done over the next year.","Mike Halloran","Great. Appreciate it. Thank you.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with UBS.","Steven Winoker","Thanks. Good morning, all.","John Stauch","Hi, Steve.","Mark Borin","Good morning.","Steven Winoker","Hey, so just on the thoughts around holding, I think you still expect ROS to be about 50 basis points up, but why not more given the additional point of growth and particularly the concentration in Aquatics. I think I \u2013 if you can just talk through the puts and takes there a little bit that explain why there's not more ROS coming in?","Mark Borin","Sure. I mentioned it earlier. As we were coming through September, we did see some pull-in to beat the price increase, so we do have slightly less price benefiting the year than we had previously forecasted. I mean, and we're continuing to see sort of the ramp in our growth investments as we move through the balance of the year. So, when you think of those two things on balance, overall, that's where we've landed at maintaining our guidance on income.","Steven Winoker","How much do you think that took away from, if you were to quantify the impact that you would have otherwise had?","Mark Borin","Well, the price change was about $3 million, $2 million to $3 million, and the investment is probably couple of million dollars.","Steven Winoker","Okay, great. And just as you guys were thinking about that growth for the fourth quarter also coming off at 6 to 4 to 5, these are exceptional growth rates. But just any thoughts on slowing mostly comps other factors here?","Mark Borin","No, I mean, part of it is as I ventured it\u2019s the price increase acceleration that we experienced in Q3. So Q3 was higher than expected driven maybe half of that increase was driven by the pull-in to be priced, and so we don't see that continuing into the fourth quarter.","Steven Winoker","And John\u2026","John Stauch","You\u2019re talking about a point of \u2013 we are going from 6% to 4% to 5% on the Q4. And right now, we don\u2019t see as you ask \u2013 we don\u2019t see markets slowing. I mean, we still feel good. I remind you Steve you know this, but in our residential commercial businesses, this is primarily an installed base that we serve. It isn\u2019t a new housing start really phenomenon or anything. As a matter of fact we shared this before a lot of new housing starts are actually urban, which don\u2019t utilize our water systems as much as they do out in the rural areas. So we really just believe there is a consumer pull on demand on the aftermarket channel and we see consistency so far on those outlooks.","Steven Winoker","Great. John, that\u2019s actually leading to my follow-up, which was within that all of this great pool growth, more than three quarters or roughly the business is usually aftermarket, I suppose. So, maybe just anyway chance you can breakdown your thoughts around how much is coming from new installation versus the existing installed base on this growth and the new product introductions are connected that you mentioned?","John Stauch","Yes. I mean, we have seen \u2013 this is general rule of thumb for that business. If you take housing starts which it\u2019s somewhere around 1.2 million housing starts and about 10% or 11% of those are generally point pool permits. And I think it\u2019s just the way the demographics generally work out, so think about 120,000 to 130,000 new pools, which if you really think about what that\u2019s up versus last year, it\u2019s not ups very much, you would be talking out single digits. So, we continually work the dealers in the installed base to convince people that more larger systems and more capability in their pool is the way for them to reduce their energy costs both in LED lighting and also the efficiencies that they can get on the variable speed pump. And then as I mentioned in my comments giving them easier ways, like their iPhone and\/or remote monitoring to actually manage their pool and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving a lot of the content and capability and so a really growing content on the pad fairly significantly and then taking more share through our dealer channel within that growing content. That\u2019s been our [indiscernible].","Steven Winoker","And you said converting dealers as well right?","John Stauch","Correct. Absolutely, yes.","Steven Winoker","Any percentage or any numbers around that?","John Stauch","No.","Steven Winoker","Alright. Thanks a lot.","John Stauch","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Jones","Good morning everyone.","John Stauch","Good morning.","Mark Borin","Good morning.","Nathan Jones","I would like to pickup the productivity side of the price cost productivity equation, you guys had $20 million of productivity improvements in the first half, dropped to 1 in the third quarter and I think the implication is about 5 in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about the things that have driven those gains down in the back half is there comp issues, timing of projects whatever color you can shed on that?","John Stauch","Yes. So, I mean I\u2019d start with as Mark mentioned that we are ramping up the growth investments. In the beginning of the year, we are identifying where we should place our bets working on our strategies and making sure we are all aligned. And as we went through the year, we are starting to see our innovation centers per technology certainly, our digital marketing, our consumer insights and putting more spending in first of all and that\u2019s really what you are seeing is generally offset in the productivity, Nathan.","Nathan Jones","Okay. So growth investments count against your productivity number?","John Stauch","Correct.","Nathan Jones","Underlying that has the productivity number improved declined, stayed about the same as we have gone through the year, if you excluded the growth investments?","John Stauch","It\u2019s improving primarily because we started the year with significant inflationary pressures on the material side as we mentioned and then we have begun to work sourcing alternatives and opportunities which tend to take time and those have started to ramp up here as we head into the back half of the year.","Nathan Jones","If you think a little bit longer time as a percentage of revenue, what kind of number would you expect to be able to get out in terms of productivity every year, is it 1 point, 2 points if we exclude growth investments from the equation?","John Stauch","I mean, it\u2019s a question that I don\u2019t want to dance around. I mean, in a normal environment, we would we would seek for productivity less in inflation on a gross margin basis to drive 100 to 150 basis points of expansion and then we would look to offset with somewhere around 50 to 100 basis points of growth investment that\u2019s a normalized model. Obviously, we are not in normal times. And so I think we are still thinking we can get continued margin expansion and still invest.","Nathan Jones","And then just want to follow-up on some of these revenue numbers. I think Mark you said about half of the organic growth rate in 3Q \u201818 you thought was pull-forward from 4Q \u201818?","John Stauch","No, that\u2019s not true, but \u2013 ","Mark Borin","Yes, and I\u2019ll start to clarify that. Half of the beat in the third quarter, so we were higher than expected by about $10 million, about half of that came from the pull-in [Technical Difficulty]","Nathan Jones","Got it. That makes sense.","Mark Borin","Yes.","Nathan Jones","Okay. Thanks very much.","Mark Borin","Clarifying question. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Lee","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe staying on the revenue topic here for a moment just, when you think about the pool business, I know this may be tough to quantify. But can you give us some sense of how much of the strength in Aquatics was just broader volume based versus how much was maybe driven by mix of new products and increased share that\u2019s specific to you. Just trying to get a sense for maybe what the market's underlying growth is versus how much share expansion you guys are seeing right now?","John Stauch","I mean, we think we're taking somewhere in the 1% to 2% share range and the rest would represent the market growth that we think broadly others are experiencing as well.","Brian Lee","And then when you think about the new product introductions and sort of the vitality index, if you will, as you look into next year. Is that still the same range of target share outcomes you'd be hoping for or does that start to accelerate even further?","John Stauch","I mean, if you took kind of where we are, if you take double-digit growth, we think about half of that is coming from new content ads, that we're going out and creating more content on what we call the pad. So, what used to be a pump and a filter gets expanded into the automation, gets expanded to the lighting, gets expanded to a chlorinator, saltwater pool, those types of things, and we think that adds about half of the growth, and then as I mentioned, the rest is share.","Brian Lee","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just last one from me, I will pass it on. The \u2013 I guess specific to China, some of your industrial peers have alluded to weaker volumes in various end-markets and the macro recently. Can you level set us a bit on your China exposure and then how you're comping there versus maybe some of the more cautious commentary that's been starting to pop up as of late?","John Stauch","Yes, I will start with the fact that we are not as big as some of those peers. I mean, keep in mind, as I mentioned, we're $160 million total in the China and Southeast Asia region. So, we're not anywhere \u2013 some of our competitors are two times our size and those comps get harder. I also think that we are definitely growing double-digit, but we're also working through changing channels over there in China as well and making sure we're controlling our own destiny. As I said, most of the consumers want to deal directly with the Internet and then they want to connect directly with the experience center and the company themselves. And so I think our comps are a little easier from where we're starting from, but I also very excited about what the teams doing over there and I really like how we're going about winning and just the innovation and the excitement that we have for our new products and new product introductions.","Brian Lee","Okay, fair enough. Thanks guys.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jeff Hammond","Hey, good morning, guys.","John Stauch","Good morning, Jeff.","Mark Borin","Good morning.","Jeff Hammond","Hey, just on the \u2013 it looks like your divestiture number was about 2%. Is that \u2013 were there discrete divestitures in there, is that just run-off of product lines that you're ramping down and how does that look kind of into 4Q and into \u201819?","Mark Borin","Yes, that really is \u2013 there\u2019s no new discrete divestitures there, it\u2019s the product line exits that we have talked about previously.","Jeff Hammond","Okay. And when do we \u2013 when are we done seeing those?","Mark Borin","It completes in Q4 and survive a little bit of that in the first half of the year, but then it will lap itself.","Jeff Hammond","Okay. And then what went on with the interest expense, it was a little bit lower and how should we run rate that going forward? Thanks.","John Stauch","Well, we gave you the Q4 number.","Mark Borin","Yes, I mean, we\u2019re still thinking around $7 million, it\u2019s become \u2013 frankly, it's a relatively small number given our overall debt levels, and so it can bounce around a little bit really mainly driven by how much interest income we had. So that's why it was a little bit lower in Q3.","Jeff Hammond","Okay, thanks, guys.","John Stauch","Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair.","John Stauch","Hey, Brian.","Mark Borin","Brian?","John Stauch","Brian? Brian, mute button.","Brian Drab","There we go. Alright.","John Stauch","Welcome back.","Mark Borin","Good morning.","Brian Drab","Yes. My kids were running around in the background. So I forgot I pressed that button. I just have one question at this point, the aquaculture and agriculture end-markets, I don\u2019t believe we are mentioned on the call here at least not significantly, I joined a little bit late. But what percentage of revenue roughly do those account for today and are you seeing any growth off the bottom here in ag and just any update on aquaculture, which I think has been good growth market for you?","John Stauch","Yes. I mean, it\u2019s those two things total somewhere around $150 million of total revenue, so not really a big piece of the overall Pentair and not really worth mentioning to be honest, but I think ultimately those are cyclical markets and they have been performing well lately.","Brian Drab","Okay. I will follow-up more later then. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global.","Walter Liptak","Thanks for taking my question and good morning, guys.","John Stauch","Good morning.","Walter Liptak","I have a question about weather. We haven\u2019t talked about that at all in this call, but there has been a couple of big storms and I wonder about any third quarter impact and if you are seeing any pipeline for renovation pools, especially in the fourth quarter?","John Stauch","No, I will say it\u2019s just a really thank you to our team and I am sure a lot of companies had this as well, but we do have our pool businesses in Cary, North Carolina. And I can\u2019t thank the team enough for how they stepped in and we have lost a few days of deliveries due to the hurricane, but they were able to recover all those shipments in Q3 and did a marvelous job just protecting the plant, protecting the assets, protecting the people and then also protecting the products out, but other than that, there is no meaningful amount of revenue one way or the other that we can track to weather.","Walter Liptak","Okay. And then in the fourth quarter, track pools that were damaged by flooding pumps filters, any of that replaced?","John Stauch","Not on a real-time basis, no, I mean we usually expect and do see a little uptick in the aftermarket repair business there and we will see that in the order rate as it comes through Q4, but not able to track this specific amount.","Walter Liptak","Okay, great. And then staying in aquatics and the price increase, I wonder if you could walk us through the pricing that you guys did and the competitive situation, do your competitors pickup pricing earlier in the year and so you are just playing catch up, how would \u2013 where is your supply chain I guess versus some of your competitors?","John Stauch","We did our price increase on cycle, which was in mid-September. Our competitors did do some targeted price increases earlier for various reasons, but we chose to continue to stick with our standard timeline. We implemented 5.5% price increase and that\u2019s been consistent with what we have communicated previously and it\u2019s our expectations have been consistent.","Walter Liptak","Okay. Are your competitors in the same kind of supply chain situation with you where tariffs impact them and they have to react?","John Stauch","Some of our competitors have similar supply chain, some of them don\u2019t, I mean, everybody looks a little bit different than us, but as we have talked about, it\u2019s not just the direct impact, it\u2019s ultimately and maybe more importantly just seeing what the indirect impact ends up being as tariff start to impact the overall pricing not just from China suppliers, but others as well.","Walter Liptak","Okay, great. Alright, thanks for taking my questions.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research.","Brett Linzey","Hi good morning all.","John Stauch","Good morning.","Brett Linzey","So just want to talk about some of the regional growth, I mean obviously, U.S. was strong mostly driven by pool, you talked a little bit about China. Could you just maybe walk around some of the major international markets you serve and then any concern or on the pace or tenor within your European business?","John Stauch","Yes, I mean, we just generally overall you have got it, North America have been relatively strong this year, China as I mentioned has been a growth area for us. We have selectively chosen to get out of lot of geographies, which is part of the product line exits that Mark has referenced in our divestiture line, geographies, where it\u2019s not so much a geography call, we just didn\u2019t have scale or didn\u2019t have the appropriate presence in those areas to compete long-term. And then Europe has not been of a robust growth environment, it\u2019s been relatively muted most of the year. And so we don\u2019t see that picking up in the back half of the year, but we also don\u2019t see it declining in the back half of the year.","Brett Linzey","Okay. And then maybe just back to growth investments, I think you had previously said this year your incremental investment was around $20 million, what have you spent year-to-date, how Q3 look and then as we look into 2019 you broaden out the China and Southeast Asia strategy, does that incremental number step up 2019 versus 2018?","John Stauch","Yes, I don\u2019t know, if we are just certainly not going to give it in detail by quarter, but for the full year, we expect still to be in that range for 2018. And I would say as we think about going forward, maybe $5 million to $10 million incremental next year is the way we are thinking about it for primarily digital investment and also our R&D and innovation activities we have identified this year, but not a meaningful step up from where we are currently.","Brett Linzey","Okay, great. I appreciate the color.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Jason Carr","Hi, guys. This is Jason on for Julian. Just looking at the aquatic systems demand and taking into account that the 1% to 2% of share gain is roughly consistent with the color given on Q2 backing out the demand you saw as a result of pre-buy, does this imply given the tougher year-over-year comp in Q3 versus Q2 that there was sort of a end market demand acceleration here and then what was the cadence of that demand acceleration going to the quarter? Was it stronger in September etcetera?","Mark Borin","No, I don\u2019t think there was anything unusual about the end-market demand in the quarter, it was strong in September, but that\u2019s not unusual and some of that was driven by the price increase timing. And when you are seeing the guidance for Q4 we don\u2019t see a significant slowdown as we look at the Q4 run-rate and expectation on growth in pool.","Jason Carr","Understood. And just going back to the pricing increases you did \u2013 there was sort of an acknowledgment that if there was further inflation sourcing in the pipeline there would be \u2013 there would have to be pricing increases put into net that out, sort of just on the pace of those increases, what would be the lag post the acknowledgment of further inflation, i.e., like 30 to 60 days or maybe a quarter in terms of how long it would take for those pricing increases to be effective?","Mark Borin","Sure. And then maybe to clarify we said that we will continue to use price as a lever, but we didn\u2019t say that we would have to do that in light of inflation.","Jason Carr","Right, right, sorry.","Mark Borin","To lever in and it would take approximately 90 days to get that price fully implemented. That being said, it\u2019s also about 90 days for us to see the impact of increases from our suppliers as well. So what was the news about Q3 if you recall was the timing of the tariff announcement and the increase of that coming pretty quickly and not having the time to react.","Jason Carr","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","And presenters, did you have any closing remarks?","John Stauch","Yes, I do. So, thank you everybody for joining us today. And I hope you agree that we delivered a solid third quarter and that we are demonstrating our ability to use agility and prioritization to meet our commitments. By building up a track record of meeting and exceeding commitments, we hope to earn the trust and right to pursue a compounding strategy that allows us not only achieve core growth in earnings, but to also utilize our strong cash flow and capital structure to pursue strategic targeted and accretive bolt-on and tuck-in acquisitions.

Thank you.","Jim Lucas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategic Planning, you may begin your conference, sir.","Jim Lucas - Vice President-Investor Relations & Strategic Planning","Thanks, Kim, and welcome to Pentair's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning. And joining me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our third quarter 2015 performance as well as our fourth quarter and full year 2015 outlook as outlined in this morning's release.","Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-K and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jim. And good morning, everyone. As you saw in this morning's release, Pentair achieved earnings at the high end of the range, driven by core growth in two of our segments, plus solid margin expansion in three of our four segments: Flow & Filtration Solutions, Water Quality Systems, and Technical Solutions.","We achieved this despite the energy market challenges we expected and a weakening in industrial short cycle sales towards the end of the quarter. So while our Energy and now Industrial verticals are presenting challenges, we have seen both Food & Beverage and Residential & Commercial sales growth buoy up results throughout the year.","Our efforts to right-size the cost structure in Valves & Controls are well underway and we expect to execute all of our planned actions by the end of the year. These initiatives are expected to drive $135 million in gross cost savings in 2016. We'll provide more details on these actions later in the call.","During the quarter, we closed on our acquisition of ERICO. As a reminder, ERICO's a leading manufacturer of highly-engineered electrical and fastening products that complement the equipment protection business within our Technical Solutions segment. ERICO has an annual revenue of approximately $600 million in very healthy margins. Our integration efforts are accelerating. We remain committed to our previously communicated synergies target of $10 million in 2016 and still expect the deal to be accretive to adjusted earnings by $0.40 in 2016.","We're tightening our full year 2015 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $3.84 to $3.86 from a range of $3.80 to $3.90. while John will give more details on our fourth quarter and full year guidance later in the call, the updated guidance reflects a more cautious outlook on our short cycle Industrial and Energy businesses in the fourth quarter. This is primarily because we're not expecting to see the normal levels of maintenance and year-end budget spending that typically occur in most fourth quarters, given how September looked.","We expect about $0.05 of accretion from ERICO in the fourth quarter, which is expected to offset any softness in these fourth quarter short cycle sales as we continue to focus on delivering the midpoint of our guidance or better. We expect to deliver cash flow of about 100% of adjusted net income for the full year. Now, let's turn to slide five for a discussion of our third quarter results.","Third quarter core sales declined 5%, which follows a core sales decline of 2% in the second quarter and a 4% core sales decline in the first quarter. Valves & Controls had an acceleration in the rate of decline in its core sales, which was consistent with our outlook for the business entering the second half of the year.","Both Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions delivered core sales growth, while Flow & Filtration Solutions have stabilization in the top line, with core sales declining only 1%. Overall, FX remained a significant headwind in the quarter.","Adjusted operating income, which adds back intangible amortization, was down 16%, and adjusted operating margins were down 70 basis points to 16.1%. The income decline and margin contraction came solely from our Valves & Control segment as the other three segments delivered healthy margin expansion. Free cash flow has been impacted this year by working capital timing due to the top line softness we've experienced, but we expect to deliver free cash flow approximating 100% of adjusted net income.","Now, let's turn to slide six for a more detailed look at the third quarter with our standard sales and income walks. During the quarter, we saw a growth in two verticals: Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage, while both Energy and Industrial declined. As a reminder, we include process industries such as chemicals in our Industrial vertical.","Infrastructure was down 5%. This was a mixed as we saw a turn to growth in the Flow & Filtration Solutions businesses serving Infrastructure, while Technical Solutions saw a slowdown in its telecom sales.","As you can see on the right-hand side of this page, our adjusted operating income adds back intangible amortization, which we believe more accurately reflects the operating performance of our overall business. Productivity and price once again more than offset inflation, but this was not nearly enough to offset the top line contraction being experienced by our Valves & Controls business.","Our cost-out actions are gaining traction in Valves & Controls, which we expect to benefit the segment's results in 2016. We've also adjusted the cost structure in our Flow & Filtration Solutions and Technical Solutions segments, with benefits expected starting in the fourth quarter of this year.","Now, let's turn to slide seven for a view of our largest segment, Valves & Controls. In the third quarter, Valves & Controls' core sales declined 18%, which showed further deterioration from the 11% decline in the second quarter. FX remained a considerable headwind at 10%. Backlog was down 3% sequentially, which includes the negative FX translation. Core orders declined 12%, the same rate of decline experienced last quarter.","Core sales in all four Valves & Controls sub-verticals were down double digits with the steepest declines in mining. We also saw weakness in our short cycle business, which is further evidence that customers will not only cut capital expenditures this year but are also deferring some maintenance turnarounds and operational expenses. We do not believe these deferrals can last long and expect to see some stabilization or return to some growth in the short cycle business next year. We continue to see customers' delayed shipments, but order cancellations have been rare.","The right half of the page shows third quarter Valves & Controls segment income and margins. We continue to drive productivity, and price was flat in the quarter. The abrupt and sharp volumes declines experienced this year, coupled with the time delay it takes for cost structure adjustments to read out, has contributed a higher than average margin contraction. While we are seeing pricing pressures on project orders, we're encouraged as standard pricing remain stable for now.","Now, let's turn to slide eight for a look at the backlog and orders for Valves & Controls. As you can see on slide eight, Valves & Controls backlog is broken down in four key sub-verticals; three of which fall into our Energy vertical: oil & gas, power, and mining; and one on our Industrial vertical which is the process industries.","Orders were down in three of the four sub-verticals, with power being an exception for the second consecutive quarter, with power orders growing 6%. While we continue to see activity in LNG and received a few orders in the quarter, it was not nearly enough to offset the lower orders across the rest of the oil & gas value chain. As mentioned earlier, in addition to weaker project sales, we've also seen lower MRO sales this year. Given that we have some products such as pressure relief valves that are using critical applications and are highly-serviced, we believe this is an indicator that deferral of maintenance is occurring more broadly this year.","While the overall rate of order decline was consistent for the second consecutive quarter, it's too early to call a bottom. We continue to expect ongoing weakness in the longer cycle project business, but we do expect to see the short cycle business return to growth in 2016. We continue to believe in the long-term prospects for Valves & Controls.","Now let's move to slide nine to review the actions we're taking to right-size our Valves & Controls segment. Last quarter, we discussed the acceleration of more dramatic cost-out actions within Valves & Controls. I asked John Stauch to lean in and drive the actions needed to right-size the cost structure of the business, given the ongoing industry challenges.","I'm pleased to report that the team has rallied with a great sense of urgency and has stepped up to the challenge. As a reminder, we've targeted $130 million in gross cost-out actions. That is $115 million of permanent cost structure adjustment and $20 million of accelerated sourcing savings to help offset anticipated project pricing challenges next year. Of the $135 million identified so far, we've executed actions targeting 2016 savings of $125 million, and expect to execute the remainder during the fourth quarter.","While we're not in a position to provide 2016 guidance yet, it's worth noting that we expect there to be incremental costs do return next year. Pricing on larger projects has seen continued pressure, and we do not expect this to moderate next year. We'll have virtually no incentive pay in 2015, and we want to build a plan to earn those back next year. In addition, we expect additional cost-out actions and there will likely be incremental spending that target savings in 2017. Further, the project push-outs that we have experienced this year are expected to continue.","So, these $130 million worth of actions should be seen as gross savings. And they will be key to putting the Valves & Controls segment in a position to grow income in 2006 despite the ongoing top-line uncertainty.","Now, let's move to slide 12 (sic) [10] (10:51) for a look at our Flow & Filtration Solutions segment. Flow & Filtration Solutions had an 8% top-line decline with core sales down 1% and FX translation a 7% headwind. This is a solid showing for Flow & Filtration Solutions as the core business showed further signs of stabilization and we believe it is on track to return to growth in the coming quarters.","Food & Beverage was up 11% in the quarter, led by growth in our global beer and dairy businesses. Our agriculture-related businesses were down modestly, which is encouraging given the industry as a whole is down double-digit. Residential & Commercial was down 5%. It would have been up modestly if we exclude our previously communicated big box exit.","Industrial was down once again as we saw a delay in some of our pump and filtration sales serving OEMs and tough year-over-year comps in our industrial fire business.","Encouragingly, our Infrastructure business grew 6%. This was one quarter earlier than we expected to see growth in this vertical. Both the municipal flood control pumps and water reuse projects contributed to the infrastructure growth.","Segment income was flat, and margins expanded a healthy 100 basis points to 14.6%. Productivity was especially strong this quarter, and the decision to exit low margin products also helped the profitability of the segment. The focus for the segment in 2015 has been to stabilize the business and drive margin expansion. And the third-quarter performance was validation that the business continues to move in the right direction.","I also want to mention that we had a leadership change in Flow & Filtration Solutions at the end of the quarter. We recently hired Beth Wozniak to lead the business. Beth joins us after a long and successful career at Honeywell, where most recently she was President of its Environment and Combustion Controls business. Beth brings a strong track record of growth, and we're excited to have her join the Pentair team.","Now, let's move to slide 11 for a look at Water Quality Systems. Water Quality Systems once again had a solid quarter with 3% core sales growth, though lower than the 6% core growth last quarter. During the quarter, our water purification and food service businesses both saw destocking in China as the correction there led to numerous customers being more cautious. We're monitoring the situation closely since we still expect growing demand for our water filtration products in China.","Further, our aquatics business saw some timing impact in shipments due to flooding in Texas during the second quarter that delayed a number of installations, and dealers as a result managed their inventory levels very closely in the quarter. Despite the China inventory destocking and channel purchasing delays, Water Quality Systems' Residential & Commercial core sales grew 4%, while Food & Beverage was flat.","Segment income grew 8% and margin expanded 150 basis points to 18.8%. Price offset inflation, and productivity was strong. In addition, mix was favorable. Segment continued to invest both in new products and in selling and marketing. We continue to expect good growth and margin expansion for the full year.","Let's now turn to slide 12 for a look at Technical Solutions results. Technical Solutions reported a 1% decline in sales, comprised of a 2% core sales growth, a three-point contribution from ERICO and an FX headwind offset of 6%. Industrial sales were down 1% as our enclosures business saw continued softness in the short cycle Industrial business and further destocking in some of its distribution channels.","Energy grew 9% as our thermal management business continued to ship two projects. Residential & commercial grew 9% as demand for our thermal building solutions products was strong. Infrastructure was the one negative in the quarter with a 17% decline, as our electronics business faced tough comps and overall sales to telecoms softened.","Segment income was flat and margins expanded 30 basis points to a strong 23.4%. Mix has been negative this year as more of the thermal growth has come from lower margin large projects than higher margin MRO product sales, which have been soft.","Price and productivity offset inflation for the quarter. Given the near-term headwinds in the short cycle Industrial business, we're addressing the cost structure accordingly. The fourth quarter will have a full quarter of contribution from ERICO which we expect to help offset Industrial softness and the continued tougher comparisons on the Energy side of the business.","Now let's turn to slide 13 for a view of how we're closing out 2015. Before I turn the call over to John to discuss our fourth quarter and full year outlook in more detail, I want to discuss how we feel our portfolio's positioned entering the fourth quarter and as we exit 2015. We'll provide more color on our long-term strategy in our November 6 Investor Day Meeting in New York, and we'll provide our initial outlook for 2016 in mid-December.","With the closing of the ERICO acquisition and the integration efforts well underway, we now expect approximately $0.05 of net accretion in the fourth quarter after accelerated integration costs. This accretion is expected to be partially offset by the expected weaker fourth quarter short cycle sales than we saw a year ago with our Energy and Industrial verticals.","The right-sizing of the cost structure for Valves & Controls is on track and underway, and the benefits are expected to readout meaningfully in 2016. Sales into the Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage verticals remain healthy. Infrastructure, while our smallest vertical, is also positioned to deliver growth primarily within Flow & Filtration Solutions, while Technical Solutions continues to expect to see ongoing weak demand in telecom sales.","Cash flow continues to be a focus, and we expect to benefit from year-end working capital improvement especially within Valves & Controls and Flow & Filtration Solutions. Our full-year target of delivering free cash flow of approximately 100% of adjusted net income remains unchanged.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John who will provide additional color on our outlook. John?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Randy. Please turn to slide number 14 titled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Our balance sheet changed significantly with the closing of the ERICO acquisition as our debt ended the quarter at $5 billion on a net debt basis, inclusive of cash on hand. We were able to successfully complete two bond offerings during the quarter. And while our balance sheet leveraged at 3.75 times, a little higher than our targeted 2.5 times leverage ratio, we have a detailed plan in place to bring that leverage ratio to around 3 times by the end of 2016.","Our ROIC ended the quarter at 10.1% as our operating income has come under pressure with the top line challenges experienced with our Valves & Controls segment. Free cash flow did improve once again but as we indicated last quarter, our working capital performance is not where we would like it to be given our top line challenges this year. The fourth quarter is a seasonally strong free cash flow generation quarter and we expect to deliver free cash flow approximating 100% of adjusted net income for the year.","Please turn to slide number 15 labeled Improved Cash Generating Capabilities. The left-hand chart shows how dramatically our free cash generating capabilities have changed over the past few years. We have a long successful track record of converting 100% of adjusted net income into free cash flow. Given the working capital opportunities over the next few years, we expect our free cash flow conversion to remain at these higher levels.","The right-hand side of the page highlights our capital allocation strategy which has remained consistent in recent years. While our balance sheet leverage has increased with the ERICO acquisition, we remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade rating. We had raised our dividend for 39 consecutive years and our dividend yield remains at over 2%. We have invested in organic growth and expect to see three of our four segments positioned to deliver organic growth entering the new year. Given the increased leverage on the balance sheet, our near-term use of cash will be of paying down debt.","Please turn to slide number 16, labeled Q4 2015 Pentair Outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect core sales to decline 5% and total sales to decline approximately 3%, inclusive of foreign exchange headwinds and the ERICO acquisition. On a core basis, we expect Valves & Controls to be down roughly 16% as we anticipate continued declines in the short cycle business and further customer push outs as we experienced in Q3. Flow & Filtration systems' core sales are expected to be down 5% on slower Industrial sales and lower distributor stocking.","Water Quality Systems' core sales are anticipated to increase approximately 8% by continued strength in aquatics and favorable comparables for our water purification business. Finally, Technical Solutions' core sales are expected to decrease 2% as we expect sales from closures to remain sluggish exiting the year. Due to pullbacks and capital spending and distributor year-end stocking, as well as tougher comparisons for our thermal business as two large projects in Canada anniversary.","The inclusion of ERICO in Q4 will help both the top line and adjusted operating income, but we are accelerating integration costs into Q4 from 2016 to get a head start on integration activities. We are expecting adjusted operating income to decrease roughly 7% and adjusted operating margins to contract 80 basis points. Below the operating line, our tax rates should remain around 23%. Net interest and others are expected to be around $34 million, including approximately $16 million of new debt from the ERICO acquisition. And the share count should end the year around 183 million. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS guidance is $1.03 to $1.05 which is a roughly 10% year-over-year decline. We expect free cash flow to end the year strong with continued focus on improving our working capital performance.","Please turn to slide number 17 labeled Full Year 2015 Pentair Outlook. We are tightening our full-year adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $3.84 to $3.86. For the full year, we're expecting core sales to decline approximately 4%, and foreign exchange to remain around at 6% headwind. Valves & Controls' core sales are anticipated to be down 14%. We expect Flow & Filtration core sales to decline roughly 4% for the full year. Water Quality Systems' core sales are anticipated to grow approximately 5%, and Technical Solutions' core sales are expected to grow approximately 2% for the full year.","We expect adjusted operating income to be down 12% for the year and we anticipate adjusted operating margins to contract 50 basis points to 15.6%. We are working aggressively to right-size the cost structure in Valves & Controls, while we believe our other three segments are positioned to deliver margin expansion.","We expect overall corporate costs to be approximately $90 million, net interest and other to be around $91 million, our full-year tax rate to be around 23%, and the share count for the full year to be around 183 million shares. Adjusted EPS is expected to be down 9% at the midpoint of the range which remains unchanged. Finally, we expect another strong year of free cash flow into, once again, approximate 100% of adjusted net income.","Kim, can you please open the line for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Deane Dray, RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hello. Morning, everyone.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Deane.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, I'd like to start in Valves & Controls and maybe some more color on the pricing dynamics. It was interesting to see that last call out on page seven where standard pricing is stable, but you have a pressure on project orders. And I'm betting the project orders is where you're seeing competitors looking to fill up their factories; that's kind of the playbook that they will run. But be curious how is it that standard is holding up so well.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, you're right. I mean, obviously, on the larger projects and there isn't a lot of large projects, but larger projects are the most price pressured. Even some of the smaller projects are receiving a fair amount of price pressure. But the like-for-like highly-sensitive safety-related valve applications in the standard product have not yet seen a price deterioration. I mean, we are anticipating some, but it's kind of \u2013 as of Q3, it's generally held on the price-to-price. We have visibility of that in the systems.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Can you give some specifics in terms of how much pricing pressure you've seen on those \u2013 on the project orders?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean I would say in general, I mean, we're seeing anywhere from \u2013 on a standard larger project, we're seeing 10 points to 15 points of pricing pressure. Now...","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","With a lot of standard product.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Now, some of that is foreign exchange. Some of that is recoverable through the material and the sourcing lines and some of that we're asking our partners to participate. But it's generally in that range on the larger projects. It's probably in the 5 points to 10 points range on the midsized projects. And as I said, it's relatively holding on standard.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And that sounds like an absolute price difference because you had some adjustments if you're going to go after your partners as well to share in that.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. That would be what the customer is asking for, and then, obviously, we're trying to...","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That would be the headline price and then the issue is how much of that can you recapture in terms of source product and others. So, that's \u2013 in other words, that's \u2013 really, the comment is about net \u2013 what nets to the margin, right.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then just staying in the Valves & Controls side, maybe some perspective from you, John, and you can answer the question either as CFO or as the Head of Valves & Controls, either one is fine. But the idea is how have you retold the workforce? You've talked about maybe converting or, not maybe, but converting the workforce in more contingent labors. So, is that still the plan? Where does that stand, and is that something that's built into 2016?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, real quick. Our customer buys from us either in a short cycle, I need it quickly, I want it for a installed based or MRO aftermarket application, or I'm seeking an engineer to order application or a project. So, our sales force has been working to meet those customer needs in that regard.","So, what we've done is we've aligned the two value streams to support that within the business around those two buying proposals, which starts to identify the needs to serve the short cycle, which means I need local inventory, I need to get it to you in 24 to 48 hours, I have to have service centers to be able to give you the service you need. And then on longer projects, I can generally ship that from anywhere in the world, and I can begin to work and then engineer the order to the customers' needs.","The standard is obviously a higher margin, and you're buying something that you need on a like-for-like basis. The engineer, we have options, and the first option is, where do we want to play? And where do we want to build our annuity base over the next 10 years? And as I mentioned, I think it was at your conference, Deane, that we have to look at our variable nature of that project business. So, can we buy some of the products that we're making today? Can we source in some of the products that are lower margin. And then ultimately, as we build that business back over time, we don't want to carry the large fixed cost structure that we had when we were $2.5 billion to $3 billion business.","So, I think as we shape this into 2016 and 2017, those will be the priorities. The team is rallying behind that, as Randy said. It is the right way to shape the business. And we think when we do this, we're going to be in a great position to capture share and to serve our customers better.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let's talk a lot more about that at the Analyst Day.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Pleasure. (27:16)","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Deane.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Andrew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","This is Drew on for Nigel. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about Tech Solutions and just what you're seeing on the general industrial cycle? I think it sort of come up on every call that an industrial recession is potentially in the cards. Just whether or not you're seeing that and what you're looking for?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Drew, I think \u2013 I mean, as you recall, we saw what we were characterizing as a pause in industrial spending, I'd say really starting in the first quarter, went into the second quarter. We saw it really roll over into a decline with the short cycle which we really see in our Hoffman business. North America Hoffman which is high share in the industrial world, but broad-based industrial, right? And we saw that, in particular, September; we saw a deceleration. Now, a part of that is uncertainty, how much of it is destocking. But it is what informs us into \u2013 you usually see an Industrial \u2013 in Energy, you would see a fourth quarter catch-up on spending. And what we're saying is we don't think it's smart to think that will happen in the fourth quarter this year as a result.","Andrew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And then we don't know how long it will last, but we do think there's a bit of a knock-on effect. We talked about it before from Energy into the Industrial. I think that's really what this is.","Andrew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And just as a follow-up, on ERICO, I know not really industrially exposed, more resi-commercial. But just how you're thinking about top line trends for that business into next year and should we think about the historical rate of growth is in that sort of low-single digit, 4%, zone is the right way to sort of model top line?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're thinking about 2% to 3% next year for the ERICO. And you're right, it is skewed commercial; 75% of the sales is commercial, which we like that exposure. Our share is low in the rest of our Technical Solutions offering with the exception of the thermal building. We're one of the key players there on the thermal side. But on the closures and related equipment side, our share is lowest in commercial. And so, we see some opportunities there and we're \u2013 we don't have any \u2013 we know there are synergistic opportunities, but that 2% to 3% wouldn't include whatever synergy to growth we can get on the Hoffman brand.","Andrew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. All right. I'll pass along. Thanks, guys.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Morning, guys.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning, Steve.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Just a little bit of clarification. What's the thinking behind moving amortization back from corporate to the segments?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean we had done it from a standpoint of moving to adjusted EPS last quarter. And with the inclusion of ERICO, it didn't seem proper to leave $130-ish million or $140 million in amortization just down below the line. And so, by moving it back to the segments, it more appropriates where that amortization is held and gives a relative margin range excluding that amortization, which then makes it more relative to the industries in which they compete.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We thought ultimately it would be more helpful. The $0.40 of accretion we talked about for 2016 is on an adjusted income basis. So, we felt that that was more parallel to do \u2013 to pass that back down (30:53).","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And as you guys are starting to think about and build your plans, your operating plans, for 2016 across the different segments, are you baking into that an assumption about a return to growth within 2016 for Flow & Filtration, or how are you \u2013 if you sort of think about a couple of the business units, maybe help us understand \u2013 granted it's early, but you still must be already building those operating plans or starting to think about it. So, how are you positioning on that front for an inflection point?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're going to go into that framework in a fair bit of detail at the Investor Meeting. But the way to think about it is that we talked it \u2013 what I talked about it on the script is, and I'll just walk through segment-by-segment, we are going to control our own destiny in Valves & Controls. That's why we're taking the $135 million out because we want to build a plan that has income growth next year even if revenue is softer. So, that's sort of the planning effort there.","On Flow & Filtration, as I mentioned also on the script, we really are making progress back towards growth. We will have no more of this lapping of the exit of the large but unprofitable big box segment for us, plus we're seeing \u2013 we are seeing Infrastructure, as I mentioned, a quarter earlier in growth there and the backlog supports \u2013 our order rate supports that to continue.","So we do think Flow & Filtration's heading in the right direction and we'll have a lot more background on that. And in Residential & Commercial, the third quarter was a little lower but we think that was more ephemeral than anything structural. So -- but that's how we're thinking about it.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. I'll pass it on. Thanks.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning, Joe.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, my first question, clearly, you guys reduced the 4Q guide slightly on this weakness in short cycle Industrial and Energy. I'm just curious -- how bad was \u2013 and how weak was September? Is there any commentary that you guys can give us on just cadence as the quarter progressed?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, I think we saw the Industrial short cycle down double-digits as we exited the quarter, and we're assuming that, as Randy mentioned, we're not expecting restocking to occur. And usually in the Q4, we're helped in that segment by people buying ahead of what's anticipated to be price increases next year. And also, we're assuming there's uncertainty in their buying pattern. So, we're adjusting Q4 to reflect September levels carrying through Q4, and we think that's appropriate given where we are in the understanding of the markets that we're participating in today.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I mean, what are your customers or distributors saying right now regarding inventory that's in the channel? I know you guys made some comment about inventory destocking continuing, but I'm just curious on how you guys are thinking about the outlook there.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, really, it's part and parcel of what John just talked about. I mean, there are \u2013 the double-digit decline in September, we think, has a big component of destocking, but it has some real end market decline as well. And that's that maintenance \u2013 deferred maintenance, there's lower operating expenses, lower capital spending on a broader base than just oil and gas in the other industries.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then maybe one last question. As you kind of look into 2016 again, you clearly \u2013 you guys stepped up the restructuring spending and specifically as it relates to Valves. I'm just curious: where is the additional restructuring spending going? And then can you tell us how much benefit we should expect to see, specifically in the Valves segment, as we get into 2016? Because clearly, there may be some pricing pressure in that segment as well, so I'm just trying to get a sense for how you guys are thinking about it initially from a margin perspective.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, we'll be addressing incremental actions in Q4 as we suggest, and obviously some of those are the identified Valves & Controls actions which will be actioned in Q4, and we'll have benefit next year. We'll also be taking a look at the Technical Solutions business as it relates to the industrial footprint and taking some actions there to right-size that cost structure to be competitive with the market conditions we mentioned.","Clearly, from Valves & Controls perspective, we are very targeted long term to be at that 18% ROS margin range which we thought was a competitive benchmark. And then, you look at that in the new adjusted operating income, somewhere 20% over the next five years. So, we think we see margin expansion next year regardless of what the top line is in Valves & Controls and that's a huge benchmark for us to continue to work back the cost model. So, when growth returns, and it will return, we start leveraging nicely up and really start to benefit from all the cost actions that we're putting behind us.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","On the Valves & Controls side, the seasonality has kind of been all over the place from the last couple years. I know you guys had that kind of the change in the year-end around the business in 2012 and then 2013. I think, sequentially, you're up a decent amount, the revenue guide is, in the fourth quarter. Can you maybe just talk about what supports that? Because I think you talked about being more conservative for the fourth quarter, not assuming stuff comes back.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, we saw a fairly significant push-out of revenue from Q3 to Q4. We're assuming that gets pushed out all the way into 2016. The only real difference between Q3 and Q4 is that Q3 has the August which is generally a shutdown month in its entirety, and we have an extra shipping day in Q4. But there's not a big expected seasonality jump for Q3 to Q4. We're just assuming the same level of push-outs and what our existing shippable backlog is, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And on the incentive comp front. I mean, is that a meaningful number next year? You talked about dialing some of that back in. Is there a number you could give us on what that could be, what \u2013 how much of an offset that would be to the growth? It's clearly a lot of good growth cost out on your front.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, I think if you took a look at Valves & Controls incentives and the total GBU opportunity paid at 100% target, we have no idea what those targets will be after 2016, that would be about a $30 million number. And you can assume that not much of that's being paid this year. So, that gives you a kind of an idea. Now, obviously, we're going to expect some growth next year. We're going to expect some effort, and we'll align those targets appropriately.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, what's...","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We'll also see wage inflation, Steve. I mean, we won't \u2013 we don't expect to see much on the material side. Definitely, we're seeing commodity prices weakening. But we are still having wage inflation to keep good talent around.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then one last question just on the free cash flow. I mean, I think the number, the 100% number refers to the \u2013 around \u2013 is that around $700 million for the year?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's correct. It would be 120% on the old base and 100% on the new adjusted income base. Yes.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, I mean, that's such a huge number in the fourth quarter. Are there discreet things that you're looking to pull through? Are there certain big projects that are coming through on that front? And I guess if volumes are weaker than expected, is that a \u2013 does that turn into a positive? How do you kind of \u2013 how do you judge the risks around that and what should we think about it as we move to the quarter about kind of the levers that we should be watching to make sure that that come through?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. As we said, both in Randy's remarks and my remarks, we're behind in working capital and we don't want to give up yet. I mean, there's clearly probably a $50 million risk associated with that. But we feel like that working capital is ours to go get, and we don't want to give up on it yet and we feel like there's path and actions to go get it . So, we'll work with the GBUs. We also have capital. We've seen our customers adjust their capital spending; we're adjusting ours as well.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We identified the inventory was heading in the wrong direction to support growth in a number of places where the growth wasn't there to get. So, that reversed. I mean, we got good focus on it and we made some progress in the third quarter. We expect a lot more progress in the fourth on...","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is open.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Morning, guys.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Just on Valves & Controls, can you give us a sort of a geographic look at how that business is doing? Any key geographies that are weaker or stronger than others?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean, the weakest geography is not a big geography for us. But the weakest on a percentage basis will be Brazil. Clearly, everybody is seeing that. China has not been a strong environment this year, but it's starting to see some power benefits. And for the most part then, it's just a broad-based \u2013 as you stop these larger projects globally, it's affecting all regions. The only strength that we've had this year is North America.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's LNG deposit.(40:56)","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.

Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Petrochem.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Petrochem. Okay. And then, John, just as you've dug in a little bit more into Valves & Controls, other than adjusting the cost structure to the lower volume environment, any kind of things that has grabbed you as you've gotten in there that are kind of the two or three things you think really you guys need to get working better on that business?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, it's a good organization, first of all. It's been always customer-centric. And what we needed to do and what we have done as a leadership team and certainly with Randy's sponsorship is addressing the way that the customer or we go to the customer in these value streams. And when you get the simplicity of how the customer wants to be served either short cycle or long cycle, it gives you the clarity to build your SIOP processes and really reduce the complexity in the back office to support it. And so, the team has embraced it. It's a seasoned team who understands the industry, understands the customer needs, and we're excited about the game changer that I think that's going to be.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","And you're just starting that? When did that \u2013 the shifts begin, I guess, and how long does it take to (42:13)","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Within the last 90 days.

Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Nathan.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I guess I'll just hit Valves & Controls for something different. You talked about the $30 million incentive potential coming back next year. There's also a couple of other offsets. So, I'm hoping you could shed some more color on \u2013 there's a pay-as-you-go restructuring. I assume that's going to be some restructuring expense that you're not planning on excluding next year. Any color you can give us on where that'll be focus and what kind of number we could be looking for?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I'll hold back in the number until we identify it specifically. But we have to address \u2013 as I mentioned, we have a short cycle of footprint that we need to optimize around which is where our customers' installed base is and how do we serve that most effectively. And then we also have the long cycle or the project-based engineer-to-order footprint that we have to address.","I, as the Valves & Controls leader, owe both of those plans to Randy and we'll be taking a look at some footprint actions and beginning to right-size primarily that project side to make sure we got the right cost structure to compete on those larger projects which, again, we'll be prioritizing those types of things that we think grows our installed base over time.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So, you're not planning on excluding those charges? They will be included in your adjusted results?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","These are the things about the cost of transitioning one factory to another factory or the downsizing of those particular...","Randall J.

Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","(44:17) always had that duplicative cost while you're ramping up and then ramping down.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Understood. And then there was another comment, I think, Randy, you made in your prepared remarks that you expect short-cycle growth in 2016. I understand this deferred maintenance on the short cycle going on this year. You also have had like, I think, a deterioration of the macro environment. I'm just wondering if you could give us some more color on what gives you confidence that you can see short cycle growth in 2016.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let's just talk about oil and gas. You can't defer maintenance forever. They're actually running pretty flat out. Usually, they have refinery turnarounds right about now. A lot of them haven't happened because they have a lot of end market demand and they are maximizing crack spreads. They can't continue that forever. I mean, it's a very safety-sensitive, safety-focused industry. And we also think that a lot of the short \u2013 there's been \u2013 the capital \u2013 the spending reductions in oil and gas and now industrials has been rapid and it has been blunt as opposed to precise.","We believe that the planning that's going on right now in the oil and gas industry from the window we have is that there's no intention to keep maintenance down and \u2013 unless they're a factory. Yeah. So, for upstream ongoing maintenance, clearly, will be lower. But most of what we're talking about is really refining petrochemical gas plants, industrial factories. Those \u2013 unless you're shutting down a factory, you're still doing that. And so, we \u2013 history says that you can do it for a short time, but you can't do it forever. So, that's our core planning assumption. We haven't seen anything to tell us different.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's helpful. Could you just give us some color on what the refining turnaround maintenance season is down this year?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I don't have a number. I'll be pulling it out anecdotally, and I'd rather \u2013 I don't have a specific number. I can't give it to you.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's fair enough. Thanks very much.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Can you hear me?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Jeff.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Jeff.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Sorry about that.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's all right.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Can you just go through the rationale of the management change on Flow & Filtration? You talked about that. And then also just how you're thinking about timing for kind of a permanent replacement for Valves & Controls.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Beth is someone that I had known by reputation for a while. And we're \u2013 we may be dealing with some short-term issues in terms of end markets that we don't control, but we do control our own destinies. You've known us a long time. And we intend to continue to build the company. And to build the company, you need great people. So the opportunity to have Beth join the team was one that we were quite excited about. And so she is, so she's on the team.","Valves & Controls, we're actively searching right now. And I'm not going to put a date or tell you, but we have a legitimate candidate. I know at least one person in this room that's anxious to get the person onboard; maybe two.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, it won't be quarters. Okay.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Morning.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Brian.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I just wanted to touch, sorry, one more time, just on Valves & Controls. But the bridge that you guys provided. So effectively, you've had no price impact, seems, to-date. It hasn't at the revenue line at least. So I assume it's not in the OP as well, given that it's not in revenue. But when would you expect that to start to impact?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Brian, Brian, can I just clarify.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Sure.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Obviously, we would measure prices the way most companies do, which is I have the like product last year and I have the same like product this year. And when I compare those two prices, I've got a year-over-year price impact. And as I've said earlier, we're not seeing a price negativity yet on the standard side where that would show up.","Where we are seeing the pricing is on booked margin, when we go off to win a job and we would've won that at maybe 44% gross margin, and then we're down to 42% gross margin because of the effective price pressure that's in the engineered components. And again, that would be a brand new product that we don't have compared against new product today (49:01).","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right. They're not like-for-like, so you don't put it in price. It ends up hitting productivity.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Got it. Yeah. And I don't know if you could provide any increments (49:12) color on this but for 2016, you're still assuming that you're going to have operating profit higher. I mean, how \u2013 so what's the assumption that price is going to get away and offset by productivity and restructuring?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So we've shared that we think it's at least a couple more points of headwind that you see on that booked margin.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then just separately, I know you touched on the working capital and the opportunity but mostly on the inventory side, but can you comment on receivables? There's been some incremental reports recently that customers are holding back on payment especially in the Middle East with Aramco. What has your experience been there? And what's the expectation and are you seeing stress among other customers where that could be a concern?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm going to answer this even though you think the CFO would, because I would like to give John and his team credit.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Sure.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We have really good disciplines around receivables and really conservative practices in terms of watching for late payments and the like. And John and his finance team have been watching it like a hawk. We also have heard some of these reports, and so we're active \u2013 we're proactively making sure that we are not hurt by that. And we're not seeing it. We're not seeing anything meaningful in that regard.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is open.","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","Morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to drill in a little bit more on Tech Solutions and talk about the 9% growth that you saw in the Energy vertical there. Can you talk a little bit about why the energy market's holding up so well in that segment, especially relative to Valves & Controls, and maybe comment on the activity that you're seeing within that segment in the petrochem market?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. First of all, if you recall, the biggest part of Energy, oil & gas in (51:24) specifics in Technical Solutions is the thermal business. The thermal business Industrial business saw a huge decline in opportunity. If you recall, things like Voyager up in Canada got cancelled. We had won that. We were seeing those declines back in 2013. I mean 2013, 2014. So we had already sort of seen a decline and, if you want, this is sort of a positive off that bottom, because two large projects are going forward and we won them both.","So, we're shipping those now. We're enjoying those now. When I talked about the margin pressures in Technical Solutions, it's the margins on those large projects versus the product margins specifically. So, those \u2013 we're actively winning other projects. They're not that size. So, that'll be a headwind but that's a headwind we're planning on managing through. So, that's those projects. So, it's really not \u2013 it's not whistling through the graveyard. It's those specific projects.","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And can you comment on what geographies, end markets those projects are in? Those in the oil sands?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Canada. Canada.","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Okay. And can you comment on what you're seeing in the petrochem market? I guess specifically within that thermal controls heat tracing market.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there is opportunities there. They're not as large as some of those ones there, we're actively looking at and bidding on some, particularly in North America where a lot of that activity is. We think we'll do fine there and we've actually got a good backlog on the industrial thermal side. So \u2013 and a lot of is non-oil sands. And that's where the activity is, so...","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Chris.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey. So, sounds like $125 million or so of the $135 million cost-out's already been executed. I think you...","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The actions taken. They're not reading out yet, right? I mean let's just be clear. (53:37)","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So I think the general framework is sort of a January 1 starting line for readout, but that's a little bit simplistic. How would you advise for a little more nuanced view of how the benefits start to ramp into the run rates?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So Chris, we obviously are getting the cost out this year. But as you know, that gets hung up in the inventory side in what we call deferred productivity or capitalized variance in the manufacturing side. So the costs we got on the manufacturing, we won't start to recognize till next year, and that's a big piece of the cost that we've been after this year. We are getting a little bit of benefit from what we're doing in the G&A in the selling and marketing sides, and we'll experience some of that in Q4. But the main goal here is that we are hitting the ground on January 1 with a full run rate of those savings to offset the types of things that Randy mentioned in his prepared remarks.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks for that. And then on the capital allocation side, the Valves & Controls angle maybe rethinking, I think, a year or two ago that was probably a focus for long-term capital allocation. How much has that been supplanted by a view towards scalability around ERICO and Technical Solutions? And even with a little bit of a near-term color with debt paydown, would capital allocation optionality still be part of the plan?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I'll tackle (55:09) Valves & Controls real quick. And first of all, we are committed to what we call the operating model transformation, which is putting our company \u2013 our valves business headquartered in Switzerland and benefiting from the global cash advantaged structure that we have. And so, we'll continue doing that. Obviously, we'll tweak it a little bit to mirror the value streams that I mentioned. But we are \u2013 three of those major ERP migrations are behind us, and then we'll continue to right-size the factory structure. But I think you should expect a little less capital spent in Valves & Controls primarily because the volume's down.","ERICO itself was not a capital-intensive purchase. Matter of fact, very cash rich and spent less than $10 million...","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Except the purchase price.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Except the purchase price. We spent less than $10 million a year on capital. So not a hugely capital-intensive play. Where we've been spending the money in Technical Solutions has been primarily automating our enclosure lines, obviously reducing labor and improving quality, reducing warranty. So we continue to do that because the payback and the IRR was quite high.","So, again, mindful on capital. We always say creativity before capital, something Randy's taught the organization. We'll continue to implement that.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski. Your line is open.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Josh. Are you there?","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Just \u2013 yeah. Can you hear me?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Got you.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","So, just on the Valves & Controls outlook into next year, obviously, all the costs coming out. I would presume, though, that some of this is part of kind of normal PIMS operation and decremental margin management. If you had to put a thought on kind of the core decremental margin on volume declines that we can add these cost-outs as an offset against, how should we think about that next year? I mean, you're talking about price being a bit more of a headwind. Obviously, that's going to be detrimental to that. Any puts and takes we should think about kind of the core decremental before the cost-outs.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, I'll handle the first one, then I'll let Randy clarify it. But right now, material in Valves & Controls is roughly 33% to 35% of sales. So, it gives you an indication when you lose $1 of revenue what the impact is if you can't mobilize the cost-out. And after several cost-out plans, you could assume that we have a fair amount of fixed cost to the business.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would just say two things, Josh. Number one, the level of complexity that \u2013 we have made goods strides, particularly in the Four-Wall Lean, reducing the complexity in the business. But in terms of the business complexity, it's still enormous. And so, really, John and the team have gotten a really good focus on that. So, there's a lot more structure to take out. But I would also ask you to \u2013 I mean, I know \u2013 I'm anxious to get to those answers, too, and more fully, and we'll be better prepared to give you more insights on November 6.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got you. I'll stay tuned. And then, just one question on ERICO. How does pricing typically function for them? Does it end up being list pricing, job specific? How does that work in kind of a go-to-market?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Most of what they sell is sold through distribution, so it'd be a classic discount to a book list. And then, they have a sales force very much like our pool (58:47) sales force which, even though our product goes through distribution, we have a sales force on the other side that helps sell it through and sells through the applications. There also is some project pricing. But think of it more along \u2013 more akin to like a Hoffman structure.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got you. All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is open.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Joe.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Just a question on share. Given the magnitude of the declines in Valves across the space broadly, how do you guys think you're doing in terms of maintaining your growing share in that market?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We think we're maintaining, not growing, not losing. We think we're maintaining.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Particularly in the product lines we care the most about.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And on the Infrastructure side, you mentioned a little bit more positive view. Maybe you can flesh it out a little bit, like where \u2013 is that more of a municipal call?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Yeah. Municipal, it's not just in the U.S., it's more broadly than that. I think it's a recovery of municipal spending. Our backlog \u2013 or excuse me, our order rate has been improving the last several quarters and as I mentioned, we figured we were going to turn to growth in Flow & Filtration in the fourth quarter and we actually got growth in the third quarter. So, it's a little bit early.","Now, we also put telecom in Infrastructure.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Right.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And that's in Technical Solutions and that's \u2013 we talked about that in the call; I mean on the script.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","And John, just one quick one for you. On the tax rate, how should we be thinking about that directionally going forward over the next couple of years?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, we expect to finish this year 23% as we shared, and I think we believe this point of opportunity into the next several years.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks. The last question.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line with David Rose with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Morning. Thank you for taking my call.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, David.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Just a couple last ones. Just to be clear on the accretion \u2013 net accretion from ERICO, you say that $0.05 of net accretion after accelerated integration costs. So, is it $0.05 you're adding back the amortization? Are there any other things that we should think about?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's on an adjusted basis, right? So, it's ex-amortization. The things like it's rebranding, re-signing, all the startup costs, if you will, that we'd like to get them out of the way quickly, as opposed to, less quickly.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. So sort of we might expect sort of a kitchen sink dump in the fourth quarter on that part, like we did with Tyco.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't like that characterization.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Sorry, I didn't mean it in a pejorative sense.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's expenses that might have been realized overall a -- within 2016 that we're going to get done and behind us in the fourth quarter.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay, perfect. And then lastly, just as we start to think about \u2013 you had some comments about destocking in the channel, and I think you addressed some of the receivables issue. But maybe you can provide a little bit more commentary about the strength in the channel. Do you see some channel partners weak that might get even weaker and you might have to, I guess, reshuffle some of the partnerships where you might see some impact? And then lastly, just sort of a little bit more emerging market color. You touched upon Brazil and China on the Valve side, but maybe you can kind of talk about the rest of the business.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The first part, no, we don't see any of this causing disruption in our channels, certainly not at the moment. And obviously, we'll be closely watching that as we enter into 2016 and help (1:02:36) sustain this capital spending pauses. As far as the other geographies, I mean, as I mentioned, I mean, North America was doing well and then we saw the currency change, and we saw pullback in the overall North American model. And now we've seen a global malaise, I guess.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, in fast food we have fast growth. I mean, China and Brazil gets a lot of attention, but actually Southeast Asia is growing for us.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm talking about at the Pentair level. Latin America, ex Brazil, has grown for us, actually the Middle East overall has grown for us. So, we still have opportunities and promise in those markets even as those larger countries struggle a bit.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Randall J.

My name is Sasha, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q3 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Jim Lucas, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may go ahead.","James C. Lucas","Thanks, Sasha, and welcome to Pentair's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our third quarter 2012 performance, as well as some color on the early days of our merger with Tyco's Flow Control business that closed on September 28, as outlined in this morning's release.","Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results.","Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. All references today will be on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated, for which the non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation.","We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randall J. Hogan","Thanks, Jim. And good morning, everyone. Before we discuss our third quarter results, I want to extend our thoughts and prayers to those who have been affected by the devastation from Hurricane Sandy. We know that a large portion of those participating in the call have been directly impacted by Sandy, and we hope for a quick recovery for each of you and everyone else affected.","On Slide 3, let me begin the Pentair discussion by sharing some thoughts following the successful closing at the end of the third quarter of our merger with Tyco's Flow Control business. 4 weeks ago, we successfully completed the first step in an exciting new journey for Pentair. By combining Pentair and Tyco's Flow Control businesses, we've strengthened our leadership positions in the markets we serve. And by all accounts, Day 1 of the new Pentair was a great success, with all businesses and functions reporting smooth transitions. Consistent with our initial discussions around the deal, we begun $400 million in share repurchases and have authorization for the other $800 million in place already. We also announced the increase in our first quarter 2013 dividend, and as a result, 2013 will mark our 37th consecutive year of increasing our dividend.","We continue to spend a significant amount of time visiting employees around the world. We visited over 30 of the Flow Control sites and seen approximately 25% of our new employees. I'm extremely impressed with the tremendous talent we have and are now 30,000 person-strong organization. Together, we have even more capabilities to go after expanded growth opportunities and aggressively pursue efficiencies. Integration activities, which led to the success of Day 1, were exciting. But they were just the beginning. The real work has just started. Let me share with you how we're moving forward.","First, it's imperative that our 8 Global Business Units drive strong business performance to achieve their operating and financial targets. Additionally, each of these business units is pursuing growth and cost synergies that align with the vision and expectations inherent in our merger. Each business unit is developing robust project funnels to ensure we realize strong synergy capture, not only over the next 100 days but through 2013, 2014 and 2015. The integration and standardization team, or IST for short, will continue to drive Pentair-wide program management of synergy capture and the rollout of our standardization initiative. The IST was designed and built to be an ongoing organization, not just the team to get us through Day 1. The IST will drive critical standardization programs, which involve taking the best practices from both organizations to create one enterprise-wide standard. One example is the Pentair Integrated Management System, and of course, rolling out the Lean Enterprise element of PIMS throughout the entire organization. Nearly 10% of the Flow Control employees have taken part in Lean Enterprise training already. In addition, functions in finance, HR, legal, compliance, marketing and communications will be implementing standardization programs as well.","With the 8 business units working in close connection with the IST, we're gaining even more confidence in the synergy targets we communicated over 6 months ago, when the transaction was first announced. And by driving PIMS and functional standardizations through our organization, we will have the operating processes to ensure consistent and strong performance.","While we're in the early stages of looking at revenue synergies, we've seen some examples that we're very excited about. Whether it is leveraging Flow Control's strong relationships and energy, or Pentair's reach into the global food and beverage channel, we look forward to sharing more about these opportunities, as our teams come together and identify how to leverage the new combined company for growth.","We have a tremendous company with extremely talented people. I've seen in my many visits around the company that our Win Right culture is being exhibited everyday. With a successful Day 1 behind us, we now have a significant work to do to ensure we meet and exceed the commitments we have made to our employees, our customers and our shareholders.","Now let's turn to Slide 4 to discuss legacy Pentair's third quarter results. The third quarter marks the last quarter for legacy Pentair as the transaction closed on the final day of the quarter. The key point that I want to make about our core business is that the third quarter, once again, demonstrated our strong operating performance as seen by a 7% improvement in adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin expansion of 110 basis points to 12.4%, driven by strong price and productivity. Sales declined 3% on a reported basis owing to FX translation headwinds as volume and price grew 1% in the quarter.","We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.64 cents, up 10% from $0.58 cents, and at the top of our range before including a $0.01 benefit from a favorable tax rate. Unfavorable foreign currency translation continues to mask our strong pricing, and we continue to see volume gains in many verticals such as Industrial, Agriculture, Pool and Energy. There are headwinds that remain, including in telecom, Western Europe and China, but overall, fast growth region sales were up low double-digits in local currencies as the Middle East, Latin America and India are seeing strength, showing our investments continue to pay off in these regions.","Despite constrained volume gains due to the market headwinds, we continue to see strong productivity. Further, our pricing is gaining momentum and lower material inflation is allowing those pricing actions to flow more quickly to the bottom line.","We delivered $62 million in free cash flow during the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $203 million, and putting us well on our way to convert more than 100% of net income to free cash flow once again, something we've done consistently over the last 12 years. All in, we delivered another quarter of solid operating performance with well-executed productivity initiatives, good price realization and continued growth investments. This great execution comes on top of the momentous effort expended in finalizing this transformational merger, while delivering on our legacy business targets.","Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a review of our Water & Fluid Solutions segment performance. Water & Fluid Solutions sales declined 1% on a reported basis, increasing 2% when excluding the negative impact of FX. Despite the flat volume, we delivered 2 points of price in the quarter, consistent with what we have seen in the past few quarters. Excluding FX, Aquatic Systems delivered 7% sales growth. Treatment\/Process grew 6%, and Flow Technologies declined modestly, owing to tough year-over-year comparisons.","Let me begin with Aquatic Systems, where once again we saw another great performance. Sales were up 7% in the quarter, reflecting continued share gains and good pricing. Aquatic Systems ended their pool season with inventories in good shape and continued pricing momentum. Building off good secular trends around sustainability, efficiency and automation, we continued to see strong gains in sales of our IntelliFlo pumps, up 7% in the quarter and nearly 30% year-to-date, as well as in heat pumps, which grew 41% in the quarter and are up a comparable amount year-to-date.","The gains are not just coming on the residential side of Pool, as we saw almost 20% growth in our commercial business the quarter. We continue to expand coverage and penetration, growing our dealer base over 10% year-to-date. Within Treatment\/Process, water purification sales grew 6% year-over-year on local currency, comparable to the growth rate experienced last quarter. Fast growth region sales continue to grow at double-digit rates, with India up 60% on expanded coverage and added new products. In contrast, sales in the U.S. were up only modestly and Europe was relatively flat, largely in line with our expectations and continuing the trend we saw in the first half of the year.","We discussed the pending launch of our industry-changing innovation, Hybrid DI, which combines the benefits of reverse osmosis filtration with those of a water softener, using capacitive electrodes to remove hardness and total dissolved solids from water without employing salt. The Hybrid DI is shipping for field trials and there continues to be growing interest in this new technology, particularly with commercial customers.","We continue to see signs of strength among our filtration and purification systems businesses, while our water treatment valves and tanks business is showing signs of bouncing off the bottom in North America and stabilizing in Western Europe. Within North America, we're seeing share gains due to improved delivery performance and more feet on the street. Last quarter, we discussed the U.S.A. builder, alpha test, as part of our rapid growth process. This program targets a select group of homebuilders that are growing in areas such as Denver, Houston, San Antonio and Tampa. We've seen great success early on with 70% -- 75% close rates versus 30% with our traditional programs. As we look forward, we expect to triple the size of this initiative by the end of next year.","Water purification continues to make progress towards our next proof of concept, as this business has driven PIMS throughout the entire GBU. And despite the ongoing challenges resulting from a depressed residential market these past 6 years, the team has continued to improve operationally, driving gains in delivery and productivity, and resulting in dramatic improvements in operating margins and ROIC, and equally important, supporting investments in innovation and global expansion.","In the other part of Treatment\/Process, which is process technologies, that business grew top line 5% on an organic basis, as continued gains in Energy were partially offset by delayed projects in both water and beverage. We are now past the 1-year anniversary of our acquisition of CPT, and we continue to focus on the integrations and standardization efforts within process technologies. The beverage business, while experiencing some project delays during the quarter, is setting up nicely to end the year with several expected shipments.","As we brought together Pentair and Flow Control, we've already experienced an early win in the food and beverage space. A major beverage company has combined its purchase of hygienic valves from Pentair and food process valves from our new Valves & Controls business. While this is just one example, it illustrates the breadth of the combined product portfolio and strength of our brands. Finally, let me discuss our Flow Technologies business, where sales declined 3% in local currencies during the quarter.","While our residential pump business had a tough comp in the third quarter, with the absence of any major weather-related activities, we continued to see strength in our agriculture business and growth in our municipal and Industrial backlogs. Agriculture saw its growth moderate to high single-digits, as there were some impact to buying patterns in September from the drought experienced in much of the country over the summer. The outlook for our agriculture business remains strong entering next year. We highlighted last quarter that our municipal business experienced an uptick in orders and backlog, and the third quarter saw that trend continue. We've seen our municipal backlog grow for the last 5 quarters and our year-to-date backlog is up 14% compared, and at the levels last seen in 2010. The growth in our municipal backlog is signaling some increase in sales in this vertical starting in the fourth quarter and into the first half of 2013.","Based on what we've seen, it does not appear that municipal market itself is bottom, but we're seeing signs of activity in the traditional break and fix category and it appears that our investments in customer service the past couple of years may be contributing to our order's success.","The right half of the page show second quarter Water & Fluid operating profits and margins. Water & Fluid adjusted operating margins increased 60 basis points to 11.6% in the quarter. Successful pricing actions and strong productivity helped to offset inflation in foreign exchange headwinds. And we continue to make progress at CPT as the adoption of PIMS has contributed to improvements in quality, delivery and cost.","In summary, the Water & Fluid Solutions segment has experienced a number of headwinds in 2012. We have continued making investments and we are seeing improvements in key markets, such as North American residential, which bodes well for 2013.","Now let's move to Slide 6 for a review of Technical Solutions. Technical Solutions, by the way, is the new name of the segment, so we've gone to that now. This is still the Technical Products business you know. Technical Solutions remains a bifurcated story with the top line, once again, showing a modest decline, down 2.5% in local currencies, while robust price and productivity contributed to operating margins exceeding 20% for the second consecutive quarter. While the Datacom and telecom markets experienced over 20% sales declines each, Industrial continues to grow albeit at a moderating pace. General Electronics showed gains in the quarter, and other markets, such as security and defense and Medical, are also experiencing some growth.","Enclosures & Cabinets, which represents nearly 60% of Technical Solutions, grew sales 2% in the quarter, as strong pricing help mitigate small volume declines. As mentioned previously, growth in Industrial continued to be a beacon of light for the top line in Technical Solutions, as the group continues to identify opportunities to expand in the catalog channels, where new distributors continue to be added. We continue to make good progress in building out our stainless steel watershed enclosures, particularly within the food and beverage vertical. For example, a major food producer has spec-ed in [ph] these enclosures into all equipment and wash-down areas in an effort to reduce the risk of contamination.","Cooling, approximately 10% of Technical Solutions sales was flat this quarter, following mid single-digit growth last quarter. The sequential decrease in the growth rate was due to slower communications markets. While cooling is a smaller piece of Technical Solutions today, we continue to see attractive long-term growth characteristics for this business, and are investing accordingly as we tailor product design to meet local needs, localize production and train fast growth region sales teams to expand globally.","In North America, we continue to build out our MRO strategy and have launched a couple of alpha tests as part of our rapid growth process to test ideas there. Systems & Solutions, approximately 20% of Technical Solutions sales, has seen the sharpest decline this year, and that trend continued in the third quarter as a result of the greater than 20% declines experienced in the Datacom and telecom markets. While we expect the top line to remain challenged for Technical Solutions exiting 2012, we continue to invest in new products and global expansion, while driving price and productivity to grow operating income.","Let us now turn to Slide 7. Before we look at the new Pentair, we want to assure you that the legacy Pentair business remains on track towards our previously communicated expectation for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we will continue to see the top line challenges and headwinds that we've experienced this year, such as the challenging Western Europe markets and the shrinkage in Datacom and telecom markets. Counterbalancing these challenges however, we are seeing growing backlogs in our municipal business and beverage, and beverage is entering its typically strongest season for shipments. In local currencies, we have seen ongoing strength in fast growth regions with the exception of China, and we expect this trend to continue.","As demonstrated by our strong price contribution in the first 3 quarters of the year, pricing is a discipline at Pentair and a trend we expect to continue. Operating margins have benefited from price and productivity, 2 elements within our control. We have seen some moderation on the inflation front, which has helped, but we continue to drive productivity. For legacy Pentair, we are on track to deliver adjusted operating margin expansion of 80 basis points for the year and low double-digit adjusted EPS growth.","Now let's turn to Slide 8. In summary, our legacy business performed in line with our expectations, and we successfully closed our transformational merger with Tyco's Flow Control business. This year has not been without challenges, but we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive strong operating performance through elements within our control. We are doing this while still investing in the long term, as evidenced by our continued expansion into new areas such as Energy and agriculture and a strong new product pipeline like Hybrid DI. In addition, we're starting to see some tailwinds emerge as we begin to look ahead to next year. Energy and agriculture remain areas of growth for us. But at long last, we're seeing signs of a long-awaited improvement in the North American residential market. As mentioned previously, municipal is seeing good growth in its backlog, which is a sign that another long beleaguered market is showing some signs of bouncing off the bottom.","We've seen great execution led by PIMS, as evidenced by our strong margin performance. The integration of Flow Control is well under way, as we have our corporate structure in place. We've identified projects for over half of our sourcing targets, and we have quickly identified revenue synergies, opportunities in Energy and food and beverage. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John L. Stauch","Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide #9, labeled Q4 2012 Legacy Pentair Outlook. We want to share with you what we anticipate our fourth quarter results were going to be in the base Pentair business, so that you have an indication of how we feel we'll be exiting 2012, and how we are setting ourselves up in the base to deliver within our legacy portfolio.","We expect sales of approximately $890 million, or up about 2% to 3% versus 2011, inclusive of currency, and up 4% to 5%, excluding the impact of currency. Water & Fluid sales are expected to be up around 3% to 4%, driven by accelerating CPT performance and easier year-over-year comparisons regarding foreign exchange and distributor stocks in our water purification business. Excluding the impact of FX, sales are expected to be up 5% to 6%. Trends in Technical Solutions are expected to remain consistent with third quarter results, reflecting lower capital spending and cautiousness in the channels regarding uncertainties related to fiscal cliff and the overall economy.","Sales in Technical Solutions are expected to be down 3% with FX, having less of a headwind year-over-year versus Q3 results. Excluding FX, Technical Solutions revenue is expected to be roughly flat with last year in the fourth quarter.","Legacy operating income is expected to be around $106 million or up around 11% to 13% versus the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted operating margins are expected to be around 12% for all of legacy Pentair, up 90 basis points year-over-year. Operating margins for Water & Fluid Solutions should approximate 12.5%, and Technical Solutions margins should be around 17%. Price and productivity continue to be the theme, and execution utilizing our Pentair Integrated Management System continues to build momentum and deliver consistent operating results.","Adjusted EPS for legacy Pentair is anticipated to be up double-digit year-over-year, with the estimated adjusted tax rate in line with previous expectations of around 28% to 29%. Interest of around $16 million and a share count of around 102 million. Legacy Pentair adjusted EPS would be expected at roughly $0.62 for the fourth quarter, putting us in the middle of our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $2.70 to $2.76. Cash flow, once again, would have exceeded 100% of net income.","While the overall economy has clearly softened, solid productivity and disciplined investments have allowed us to continue to meet expectations for Pentair. Please turn to Slide #10, labeled Full Year 2012 Legacy Pentair Outlook.","Again, we thought it would be helpful to share with you the projected legacy Pentair results for the full year. We are expecting revenue of around $3.6 billion, or up about 3% versus 2011. We expect operating income to be around $445 million or up greater than 10% year-over-year, and operating margins to be around 12.5%, or up about 80 basis points versus full year 2011 margins. We anticipate achieving 12.5% margins in Water & Fluid Solutions even as we continue to integrate last year's acquisition of CPT, demonstrating the power of the PIMS operating model, and the commitment to functional excellence and standardization throughout all of our Water & Fluid businesses.","The commitment to Lean Enterprise is paying dividends and giving us a lot of confidence in further margin expansion, as well as utilizing these same tools across all of the new Flow Control entities. We expect Technical Solutions margins will be just north of 19% as we continue to benefit from price, productivity and PIMS.","Legacy Pentair adjusted EPS, as I previously mentioned, is expected to come in at the midpoint of the previous guidance range of $2.70 to $2.76, or up 13% versus full year 2011. Again, excluding the impact of deal costs, we expect cash flow to easily exceed more than 100% of net income.","Please turn to Slide #11, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Cash flow for legacy Pentair this year remains strong. And our recent debt and revolver offerings are in place, giving us a healthy capital structure heading into 2013. The current debt levels in Q3 do not reflect the previously announced and completed redemption of the private placement debt funded by borrowings under the revolver capacity, which will yield an even better overall interest rate and give us a better balance between fixed and variable debt. We have worked hard at improving our #1 metric, ROIC, and at the end of the third quarter, we knocked on the door of double-digit ROIC again, and under the legacy Pentair, would have easily cleared it on the way to our longer-term goal of 15%. Obviously, the inclusion of the Flow Control entities will give us a lower short-term result, but we expect it will provide ample opportunity for us to expand ROIC rapidly to achieve our goals.","Please turn to my last slide, labeled Q4 2012 Pentair Outlook. This slide is an attempt to give you an initial snapshot of the combined new Pentair fourth quarter outlook. We expect the Flow Control acquisition to add nearly $900 million of revenue to the fourth quarter, driving our revenue to nearly $1.8 billion. This would be up, obviously, greater than 100%, versus our $866 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011. We anticipate the Flow Control businesses will add about $100 million of operating income to the fourth quarter, prior to the expected incremental amortization of $23 million related to the deal. Also, we anticipate roughly $5 million per quarter of incremental corporate costs, and roughly $5 million per quarter related to the investment in the integration and standardization team, which consists of roughly 40 full-time members, ensuring that we realize the expected GBU-based operating synergies.","Also included in the fourth quarter projection are roughly $25 million of expected onetime transition costs. These costs relate to the acceleration of sign changes, painting of service trucks, brand migration, getting the single images in standard software and PCs, ensuring that we are leveraging global contracts related to indirect spend, and finally, LEAN training in the businesses.","We are inheriting a new record backlog in the Valves & Controls business and coming off a record performance in the thermal business. We are integrating these businesses at a very good time for Pentair. The Australian water business has undergone significant restructuring throughout 2011 and continues to improve its performance despite a challenged economy related to its primary market, mining. We are confident that these businesses understand their respective strategies that are aligned on their expectations regarding standardization opportunities.","We feel good, as Randy mentioned, about how we have started, the people that are coming with the businesses and their excitement about the value that standardization of PIMS can have on their businesses. As we comment in the bottom right-hand corner around the EPS assumptions, currently, there are many moving pieces. A few of those will be the outstanding shares, currently at approximately 250 million shares on a fully diluted basis, and the tax rate, which is estimated at around 30%. Both of these will improve as we head into 2013. The shares will be reduced by the already-in-motion $400 million buyback program, and the tax rate will improve when we implement the tax strategies related to our new Swiss-based structure.","We are initiating guidance for adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter at $0.40 to $0.45. However, this result is not reflective of the earning power we expect in 2013 and beyond. We are excited to share with you our outlook for 2013 on November 27, and we will be prepared to provide you the appropriate pro forma information, including segment, vertical and geographical revenue, and respective growth outlooks. We will also provide you with a detailed update around our cost synergies, detailed cost-out plans, how we plan to implement PIMS across the enterprise, our actions for fast growth markets, and an early look at revenue synergies, and finally, all of the details related to capital structure assumptions and why we are confident in our goal of $5 per share for 2015.","I would now like to turn the call back to Randy for some closing comments before we take your questions. Randy?","Randall J. Hogan","Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide #13, labeled Summary. To close, it was a very busy quarter for Pentair. But just as important, it is a quarter that marked the beginning of the latest chapter in our company's history. Our third quarter base performance met our expectations, as we continue to navigate through a challenging top line environment and highlighted the price and productivity, are truly hallmarks of Pentair's operational discipline. Day 1 execution went smoother than expected, and that has allowed us to accelerate some of the integration and standardization efforts. We've already completed our corporate staffing, we've identified over half of our sourcing target, and our teams are making progress in changing signs, websites, brand transitions, to name just a few.","We continue to get more excited about the potential for revenue synergies, based on some early reads we have seen. Pentair has been on the journey with PIMS for well over a decade, and we're excited about expanding PIMS to the new Flow Control GBUs. We have already trained 10% of the Flow Control employees in Lean Enterprise. And that's a good beginning. We remain on track to deliver legacy Pentair 2012 results. We're also starting to see some market tailwinds emerge, particularly in the North American residential market where it appears we are no longer just bouncing along the bottom, but are now rebounding albeit at a moderate pace. We begun to see signs of a similar rebound in commercial markets. Municipal has grown its backlog, and we continue to see strength in Energy and Agriculture. We'll be hosting our 2012 Investor and Analyst Day on November 27 in New York, at which time, we will look forward to sharing our optimism regarding synergies, in addition to providing more detailed guidance for 2013, for the new Pentair.","Operator, we can take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steven Winoker [ph].","Unknown Analyst","I actually want to start, on behalf of everybody, all the families that were affected by Sandy, including my own, a thank you guys for postponing the earnings call for a couple of days. It definitely helps and I appreciate it. Let's see, first question, just if you guys can give us some color on, again, on the Tyco Flow Control portion in terms of your thoughts for fourth quarter. You're talking about $900 million, and I think you were referring to the fourth quarter. And if that's true, it's certainly a little bit lower than I thought, orders. The last time I was looking at orders, you were leading us to believe, for the fourth quarter. So can you talk a little bit about the front log or -- and the backlog, which I know the backlog is up a bit and I'm not sure if that's order-driven or just shipment deferral or what, maybe a little more color around that would be really helpful.","John L. Stauch","Yes, Steve, a couple of things. This is John. First of all, yes, I mean, I think you know that revenue guidance is our view of kind of where the business is going. We haven't had the opportunity, but we will be, in the next 30 days, just scrubbing the backlog, understanding all those order takes, and be able to be very confident in what we see. Relying on what was provided though, and this was a company responsible for providing the same types of guidelines and the same types of systems we do, it is a near record backlog in Valves & Controls. It continues to build  orders, at probably the mid single-digit rate growth, and we're very optimistic that we're getting to set a pretty good time in the Energy cycle. Also in the Q4 numbers, we've put in, as I mentioned in my script, about $25 million of transition costs associated with the things that Randy and I were mentioning. We want to accelerate and start in January 1, with great momentum on what we're going to do with the new Pentair. And there's also about $8 million to $10 million of costs in the base numbers of Flow Control related to the segment costs, which will go into the GBU, coming to corporate will be eliminated. So I think when you take that out and you put the share count and tax rate back to where we had -- where we think it'll be at the start of next year, you'll get close basically neutral to what would have been the Pentair guidance. There's a lot of moving pieces in Q4. We don't know what purchase accounting in final is, we don't know what the amortization is, and we've got a lot of things and a lot of work left in the next 30 days.","Randall J. Hogan","But we will soon.","John L. Stauch","But we will soon.","Randall J. Hogan","The other thing that's going on, they were on a September fiscal, and we're shifting the Flow Control over to the calendar fiscal that Pentair has been on traditionally. So this is kind of a stub quarter. And so I don't think that there's -- there's certainly nothing in the outlook that shows any kind of discontinuous change in their sales rate.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And so the op income comment on Page 12, that talked about the New D&A, Corp, IST, those are all showing up in reported op income, but you'll back them out of adjusted, correct?","John L. Stauch","Well, those are actually all in adjusted, Steve. Some of those reflect what the full year run rates would be on an ongoing basis. And obviously, we're ramping up to those numbers.","Randall J. Hogan","And I think, just to be clear, the things that were in the script, John's script, those are ongoing, the 5 and the -- the $5 million of corporate add, the $5 million of IST, but what isn't is, is the $35 million or so, right, of additional costs that is just sort of transitional-related. Taken down, we're changing all the signs and some of this one-off intense training that's going on around LEAN, et cetera. That will -- that is not sustaining.","John L. Stauch","Actually, those are hitting adjusted results.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. So the fourth quarter impact of those items, can you tell us what that is, then?","Randall J. Hogan","Roughly $35 million in aggregate.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, great. And then -- and maybe just a quick comment. I'll leave it to others for the other things, but just Sandy, just what's the sort of net -- what are you expecting for an impact on the company?","Randall J. Hogan","Our focus right now is to chip everything that everyone asks for and it impacts our residential pump business. That's where we see the impact the most. And as we said, through the first 3 quarters, we had no weather-related sales. So we will see what it is. But I mean, our focus is on shipping right now and that with expediting and all, we haven't really tried to quantify a financial impact yet.","Unknown Analyst","But Randy, could you talk about like with -- it's part of a business that's X% of the company?","Randall J. Hogan","Well, there's probably -- there's probably $10 million of extra sales that are going to happen, and maybe more, and what -- I just don't know what the profit will be on that because we're expedite -- we spooled [ph] up our plants and we're shipping out all the inventory we have, so our focus is on getting the pumps there and we're in a position to do it. So...","John L. Stauch","The good news, Steve, is we do ramp-up for the anticipated weather seasons. We had a lot of inventory to be able to ship and the downside is it's a 20%-ish margin and you're dividing by 200 million shares, so I mean...","Randall J. Hogan","And we're expediting shipment because we're trying to get them there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question is just on pricing. You guys are doing a good job pushing that through. Maybe speak about your confidence level and continuing to push price given the demand environment you're seeing out there. You spoke of pricing discipline, maybe you ought to speak to how much of your product is less commoditized where you can really get pricing through?","Randall J. Hogan","Well, one of the reasons that we have good pricing disciplines is we sell a lot on the Pentair side, and about 80% of what we sold, we sold through distribution. And most distribution is priced in a virtuous way. And so we expect that to continue. There's some of that on the Flow Control side, but there's also a lot of premium products and a lot of specification activity on that side. So we'd like to bring some of those pricing disciplines over to Flow Control. And it's one of the training activities that we have going on. But the ability to get price to stick is a function of market discipline. So we think we're in good businesses. So that's -- those are the kind of businesses where you can get price. And John, you want to add anything?","John L. Stauch","No, I agree with Randy. I think we got to remember, there's $1.5 billion installed base on the Flow Control side, with, as Randy mentioned, premium products. That's where the biggest opportunity in the short run would be, is making sure that we're pricing those effectively and we're not entering into discussions with customers, packaged between the installed base and the new opportunities. And I think we break that out, and think about its installed base, and treating that more like what we do in the Pentair side.","Randall J. Hogan","Project service.","John L. Stauch","Right, project service, and then looking at the original equipment or the brand new orders, differently, I think that's the biggest opportunity.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got you. And then just a question on the Water business. How much of that business right now for you, just that segment, is replacement or consumables? And then maybe just speak about your leverage to the U.S. housing market recovery. It seems like you're beginning to see that in your numbers. Do you think there's a lag that needs to happen, or we're just coming off of a small base here, and yours already seeing some of that?","Randall J. Hogan","Well, in -- for the whole new Pentair, residential is still 20% of our sales, and the U.S. is probably 12% out of the total, right? So it's over 50% of the -- a little higher, 15 -- okay, 15% of -- between 12% and 15% of total new Pentair sales. So we still have a substantial exposure to that market. There is always a lag -- and where we're seeing the residential improvement is things -- for instance, we talked about the flood-related SKUs that are getting shipped now, those we didn't see anything. The place we saw them was in the pumps that are related to building out subdivisions and those -- or in the water softener area we mentioned. Those are the places we're beginning to see the signs of stabilization, or return to normal. But we do see a lag on that, particularly on, well, really on the pump side and on the filtration side. It is going to be 6 months to a year.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got you. And just last question for me. On the Tyco merger, you talked about some of the revenue synergies that you're beginning to see already. When do you think you'll be in a position to sort of give an order of magnitude of what you think that number could look like or maybe more detail? Is that on the analyst day or is that more on next year?","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, our intent is to talk in more detail just about -- not just about the idea of synergies, but give you some specific examples of ones that are being worked. What we did in the pre -- the reason -- what we've done prior to close is we had a Clean team looking at revenue, we had a Clean team looking sourcing. And so we've been able -- we've hit the ground running as we look at some of those. And we'll -- we have to get permission to use as a case study, the one that I referenced in my -- we don't have permission from the customer yet to talk about it, so -- but we intend to on this 27th. And so we'll give you specific examples and then also how we'll go after it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Barry.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I actually wanted to circle back to the discussion about the 4Q EBIT for the Flow business. If you start in your buildup with what I think is about $105 million even before considering amortization or corporate cost bias, et cetera, the $105 million on the $910 million that I think you're expecting for revenue is about 11.5% operating margin, which seems kind of low versus where the business has been tracking. I think Tyco is even guiding to a 14% margin in this current quarter. And so I'm just wondering is that conservatism, some seasonality or [indiscernible] seasonal stronger quarter?","John L. Stauch","I think if you take a look at the $900 million and you average somewhere around a 13%-ish margin, that's where we see it coming in on prior. And as Randy mentioned, we are doing a lot of things in those businesses to accelerate getting to January 1 in a very clean position as the new Pentair.","So I think you're seeing a red hit really on those businesses.","Randall J. Hogan","The other thing is we're shifting it to talk about it on the basis that we talk about it. And it's probably about 100 basis point difference between corporate cost, and we push more cost down, I think, than Tyco did. I'm not sure about that but...","John L. Stauch","Does that answer your question, Rob?","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. So okay, the $105 million where you started your buildup is your segment disclosure basis, which is different from the way Tyco was disclosing at the segment level and maybe that delta is worth about 100 basis points of margin?","Randall J. Hogan","That's correct. Yes, yes.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Yes, perfect. No, that's very helpful. I was wondering also if you could just dig a little bit into the Flow business and give a little color on, I think the 2 main pieces in there are your legacy Resi Flow and Engineered Flow. So was the Engineered Flow business kind of down a fair amount this quarter and the Resi Flow up? Any color directionally there would be helpful.","Randall J. Hogan","Well, the Resi Flow was actually down because there was no weather-related activities in the third quarter. But there's good trends in the Residential Flow. And there's actually good trends in the Engineered Flow side. I referenced in my script that customer service has improved and that's why we think we're getting higher wins. Frankly, I'm not sure it's the market. I think we're correcting some -- now that we've combined them, we frankly are having better focus on execution. And our deliveries have improved, our overdue backlog is down and as a result, I think we're winning more. So that's what's helping in the Engineered Flow side.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. So in the quarter though, both were down maybe a little bit? Is that fair?","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, yes.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So -- and when you' talk about them, your backlog building, I mean, we've been having very easy comps here for a while with -- off a low base. I mean, would you expect to see some pretty substantial growth then when that backlog starts converting to revenue just even the -- in a base off of which we're starting?","John L. Stauch","Yes. I mean, I think we're feeling good about plus 15% to 19-ish percent growth in backlog. And as we start to ship that, as you mentioned, we get some pretty easy comparisons. So I think the tailwinds for Flow are set nicely as we head into 2013.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. Is that what your expectation would be for that flight, is kind of mid- to high teens growth off those easy comps?","John L. Stauch","Well, I mean in that section of the business, I think your mid-single-digits growth for Flow is the way we probably look at next year.","Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And then just finally on the Technical Products business or Technical Solutions business, I know you talked a little bit about mix. I assume that's in that product price bar. I was wondering, are you actually kind of on an apples-to-apples basis raising price or is a lot of that kind of productivity priced tailwind coming from the mix? I know I think the telecom stuff is lower margin.","John L. Stauch","We are getting price increases. That's one big piece of the component that Randy mentioned. And the other one is as we're challenged in the Datacom and telecom, that was fairly low-margin business. And what's still growing is in the North American Industrial segment, which is very high margins. So we're getting a margin lift from losing the revenue in the areas that are low and gaining it in the areas that are high.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Mike Wherley.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about the sourcing where you said you already found like 1\/2 of the target? And I was just wondering if that's on track, with what you were thinking you'd see already or if that's ahead of pace?","John L. Stauch","It's ahead. I think we felt that we gave a reasonable estimate out there with about $60 million. And just to remind everyone, that was about $40 million of indirect and $20 million of direct. Just from experiences, previously, it takes a while to get to direct because you got to turn the existing inventory levels, you got to re-quote everything, got to redesign some things. So when we take a look at where we're at now, we're slightly ahead of schedule and feeling good about the incremental pipeline that we have. I think if you think about the nature of these businesses, there's some natural purchasing points where if you think about the valves purchases overall and the benefit that, that can have to Pentair, and you think what we do on the Pentair side, the benefit it can have over the Valves & Controls and the thermal side. So we feel very good about where we're at and we're building the commodity organizations to make sure we go after and get it.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the North American rebound, I mean, obviously, you're being pretty cautious about that rebound. But how do you feel differently about that versus 3 months ago? Like what have you seen to sort of reinforce your thinking there?","John L. Stauch","We love the data. I think all of the indications of the data mirror up to what we're feeling and hearing as optimism in the channel. I think each of our thirds of the business that we play in the North America residential, and as Randy mentioned, we have a Flow component, we have a Water Purification component and we have a Pool component, all 3 play into the industry different. And now I'm going to have Randy add some color, but I think what we need is in each of those elements, obviously, warm weather build certainly helps the Pool business. Urban sales are delayed and when we see the Water Purifications go in, and that's where a lot of the new housing starts have been more in the urban centers. And when we get more rural builds, we get both Flow products, which are bringing the water to the homes, and we also get the Purification plays. Randy, on the rural?","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, I mean, the more rural, the greater the Flow intensity. A rural home would have 5 pumps in it, a multifamily would have less than 1 per unit. So it really depends on how it comes forward. As John said, the data is very promising. The orders are slow in coming. But we look at housing sales because as money goes into houses, that's when people fix their water softeners. That's when people add filtration systems. That's really good for the Filtration business. And then on the pump side, it's either break or fix or it's new homes. That basically drives that. And then Pool is, well, Pool's been growing despite the fact that new pools aren't being built. So there -- as Sun Belt housing picks up again, the Pool business will pick up again. And we don't think that, that we'll diminish at all the greater content and the sustainable trend going to a variable speed and higher levels of control and elimination of chlorine, et cetera. All these trends that we're -- that our business are leaders in.","John L. Stauch","But we clearly think that this is a high single digit growth over the next several years. And we believe that if you take the drought-related SKUs out of 2012, and obviously, some of that will level off with the shipments that Randy mentioned in Q4, we're going to be at that level this year.","Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","All right. That's very helpful. If you could just give a little bit of commentary on what you're seeing in China, that would be -- that's my last question.","Randall J. Hogan","It's interesting. In China, that hurt both Tech products and our Water Purification business the most, Water Purification, where we've enjoyed a lot of growth in our Residential Filtration business as we serve China. As you know, what's happened with China housing, that slowed down. So that's pretty much flat. And some of the telecom and Datacom downturn is actually in China. So....","John L. Stauch","We did grow high single digits in Q3 in China, which is the first quarter this year that we saw that type of growth.","Randall J. Hogan","But that's not -- that's coming from process and industry as opposed to a hit.","John L. Stauch","Okay?","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just as pertains to the legacy Pentair, what's the level of restructuring you're anticipating in the fourth quarter?","John L. Stauch","Legacy Pentair? I think I don't have the exact number on that, Chris. I can tell you that we're looking at taking a fairly sizable cost out action as we head into 2013, and we're looking at somewhere around $60 million to $75 million of cost out that we want and that's consistent with what we said. We're looking at those actions, about 50% on the Pentair side and 50% on the new Flow Control businesses. So that's our targets right now and working to the actual details, but that kind of helps quantify it. And we look at $0.50 on the dollar from a cost perspective. That's a reasonable estimate at the moment.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what you do on each side kind of takes into consideration the other side and how they fit together, I take it?","John L. Stauch","Yes, there's obviously areas will come together like fast-growth markets, where we look to have one common -- face the market on a Pentair and there's obviously some back-office consolidation opportunities there. That would be a kind of a cross company view. Clearly, some of the systems that we put in across the entire enterprise would be a cross company view. And then it's really about the standardization opportunity in each GBU or each business. And those are just as abundant on the Water & Fluid side at Pentair as it is on the valves and control side of Flow Control. And obviously, we're looking to maximize payback here Chris so...","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Right. Right. And then just on the food and -- or the beverage sale synergy that you already got, maybe as an anecdotal, it could be used to -- so we can get a complexion on the revenue synergy opportunity. And do you look at that as a life of program type of win? Because the customers, it's a long-term relationship or annualized. Could you add some -- just complexion on this particular one?","Randall J. Hogan","Well, I mean, in this particular case, we're talking about a $2 million win becoming a $4 million win. It was double that and it's relationships that should go beyond the project. But it'll still be, as they build out, it will become a standard approach, we would hope. Not that they won't compete big projects every time, but...","John L. Stauch","It was a great space for the customer as far as going forward and offering the different valves between the 2 different units, which we're allowed to capture more of the share, right? So we make, on the CPT side, some very high-end valves. But we sometimes pass it up, some of the other...","Randall J. Hogan","No, we -- yes, we don't even make some of it. So...","John L. Stauch","We don't even make the...","Randall J. Hogan","And vice versa, the Valves & Controls valve, they don't -- they didn't qualify with this customer, so...","John L. Stauch","Right. It was a nice complementary, our product set we're able to offer the customer.","Randall J. Hogan","That's the equipment ones. The equipment ones are the Pentair one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I saw some good news coming from Pentair this morning here and it takes me to the first question is, you set some ambitious goals back in March about cost synergies, revenue synergies, the $5 dollar earnings power in 2015, $0.40 cents of accretion in 2013. And here we are today, you got the deal closed and you're reaffirming what a lot of people thought were very ambitious targets, especially considering the macro has worsened. So maybe, Randy, I know we're going to wait until November 27 to get some more details, but just if you could take some broadbrush commentary, macro top line was weaker but sounds like you're a lot more enthusiastic about your cost synergies. But if you could just step us through those issues, that would be helpful.","Randall J. Hogan","As we -- and it's a great question because the reason we affirm what we said is because we -- the macro is worse, and we'll talk about this on a lot more detail. But you can expect us to come back with a more moderate outlook for what the markets are going to do for us. But we feel better about the synergies that we can drive and bring home. And it's really that. It's really the fact that we believe more strongly that the synergies are going to read out. We have more insights into them. So even though the top line in the -- is going to be lower, the bottom line should be still a reasonable goal for us to deliver to shareholders. And it's -- the revenue synergies are becoming more real. As we get belly-to-belly, I mean, this job we talked about, not just impressive that the client sought this out, but the fact that these 2 teams came together the first time they met and made it happen. Pretty -- it was something that we're very proud of. And then -- so it's really those things. Yes, remember, when we set those goals, it was basically top-to-top dialogue between 6 people on their side and 6 people on our side. So there was a, I would say, a proper scaling of how it would all come together then. And now, while the pieces will be different, we still think the objectives are good.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And one of the surprises from us was, and we heard John speak about this at our Citi Industrial Conference, is the complexity that Tyco arrived with. And maybe just a comment about the ERP systems. Originally -- I thought the number was 37?","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, I mean, actually, we -- as I mentioned, we've been out to see 30 -- we've been out to 30 of the facilities, the Flow Control facilities. And these are high-quality facilities. These are operating people and we're having a really good time getting to know the businesses. But the investments and -- Tyco knew this. I mean, a lot of the investments, if you will, hadn't been gotten to a lot of the investments required to eliminate some of the complexity. When I go around the Valves & Controls, it feels like walking around Enclosures 14 years ago to me. It -- all that promise and too much complexity. They have 43 factories, 37 ERPs, incredibly strong brands, great quality, people that are embracing PIMS faster than -- not just in Valves & Controls, but I was in Redwood City last week and touring that. It's a Raychem facility, that's in Thermal Management. And there were folks from our Pool. They're LEAN rangers from our Moorpark Pool facility, were up there working with them, doing 5S [ph] Kaizens. It's just really exciting to see these kind of -- the way the teams come together. Yes, it's honeymoon and I'm a CEO and all CEOs are optimists, so -- but nevertheless, I look at Valves & Controls and I'd say that there -- whatever there, 12%, 13%, Enclosures was at 9% in 1998, a profitability of 9%. Now it's 20%. And it won't take us 14 years for this. We know how to do it now. Well, I mean that's kind of why I'm optimistic. Not kind of -- that is why I'm optimistic.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's good to hear and we'll hear more color on the 27th. And I know we're running to the top of the hour here. Just a couple other questions on the hurricane cleanup with -- you commented that it was mostly where you're shipping the sump pumps, that's the Residential side. And this is, obviously, not a Katrina event with New Orleans and a lot of the bigger pumps that were involved there. But is there anything beyond on the dewatering side beyond the residential pumps that...","Randall J. Hogan","We -- yes, we have -- they have combined sewer and rainwater systems over there. And I think we're in about -- of the main 18 or 19 stations in New York City, I think we have the pumps in 16 or 17 of them. So we expect those pumps are working away right now to help pump out the city. And ultimately, what that would mean in terms of follow-on service, or parts, I don't know. The -- and I'm sure we have other pumps that are flown through our distribution side as the larger pumps, split case pumps, whatever, going into service right now. I don't have as good a window on that right now.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just last one on the buybacks, John, can you just give us some color about the amount -- I know that was the as planned, but just in terms of how active you expect to be in the market?","John L. Stauch","Yes, the first 400 million was placed in and we're obviously subject to rules around average trading volumes or whatever, so you can assume that, that's being done on some type of average basis over the first 4 months, which would be October through January. As it pertains to the remaining 800 million on approval, I'm obviously will be in a position to share more of that with you later. But obviously, we would like to get the capital structure in line as rapidly as our debt levels allow us to.","Randall J. Hogan","So I think we have 7 more, so we'll do our best to be brief with the answers. But I'd like to get through all the 7 questions if we could.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just kind of a follow-up on the first question from Deane. This might be a small nuance, but you were saying that you're still confident in $5 by 2015. Before, you were saying $5 plus. Is there anything to read into that or is that really just kind of...","Randall J. Hogan","No. That's a nuance beyond my intent. No.","John L. Stauch","The goal is to hit $5 and hopefully, things will allow us to do better.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. Great. And just on -- most of my questions have been answered, but just on the municipal side. So it sounds like the break and fix component is really kind of driving the opportunity going forward. But maybe just talk about the capital project side. It sounds like that might still be pretty weak in the near term, but I'm curious of your expectation as far as some bigger projects that may be building up in the pipeline [indiscernible]?","Randall J. Hogan","We continue to invest in gaining position in the infrastructure space outside of -- outside the United States and we have a decent position in process technologies in that. We've seen some slowdowns in projects there. But we'd like to grow our share in pumps. And we think one of the opportunities synergistically between -- in the new Pentair is larger pumps in Australia, which is a nice market; large pumps in the Middle East, which is a nice market. So we -- we're -- that's one of the synergies that we are exploring right now. But the U.S. still remains -- it -- I submit until the U.S. government and local governments are able to put more money into water, it's a break and fix world. And it's been that way for 40 years and it's going to be that way until something changes. And I don't think that is going to happen anytime soon.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. I do have a lot -- more questions here. I just want -- if I could sneak one last in. Just on the North American Resi, is it your expectation that the Pool business will be the last to benefit from an increase in residential activity and maybe changing buying patterns from consumers? Maybe just a quick comment on that would be good.","John L. Stauch","No, actually, I think that's the one we're probably the most confident in because we've done a lot new product content in there, drive energy efficiency. And what we've said constantly is the pool builder or the pool owner today tends to be on the higher end or more affluent buyer. And most of those pools are purchased more cash base. And you're looking at about a 10% new pool permits to the housing starts number because just the way the patterns get built. So I actually think that's the one we're most confident in. The ones that we have to do a little bit more work with, which we're still confident in, are the rural versus urban builds and how that impacts our particular sales into those housing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Just I don't know if you guys went over this already, but I wanted to make sure what you guys were specifically looking for on an organic basis. So inclusive -- I'm sorry, exclusive of currency or Tyco in the fourth quarter, just so we're on the same page.","John L. Stauch","Josh, I did everything not to give you that number and I don't feel comfortable giving you that number right now, and I will give you that on November 27 because there are things like acquisitions, divestitures, those types of components that I would need to do a full reconciliation on to share that with you. I think you can look at organic order trend rates and sort of where we were in prior quarters and get a pretty good indication that we don't see things are slowing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab.","Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","This is Brian Drab. So just one question for you. Can you -- you raised the guidance for the operating margin for 2012 and you talked about some of those issues, but can you kind of rank order the things that are impacting that? Obviously, better performance than expected in the third quarter on margins, but product mix, steel cost and other commodities coming down, productivity initiatives, which is most important to talk about...","Randall J. Hogan","You're talking about legacy Pentair business.","Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","In the legacy Pentair business, yes.","John L. Stauch","We really have a seasonality that's fairly predictable and normal, and it kind of falls around the fact that you take a look at equipment protection or Technical Solutions, there's a couple less weeks of buying due to the Christmas holiday and kind of how the season unfolds. So it's just a little bit less contribution on top of the fact that this is the only reason that, that margin really turns downward. In the legacy Water -- and Fluid businesses, it's more of just where the contribution is coming from in terms of the seasonality. And we do really well in the North American residential side. And that season begins to end throughout Q3. It's a little trend, so I think you see in the margin expansion year-over-year, it's generally in line.","Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then your forecast for revenue growth, you gave the overall number. Can you give me what you're expecting for organic in the fourth quarter for the legacy Pentair business?","John L. Stauch","Legacy Pentair business, I think we've shared that but I'll be read it here. It's...","Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I just see on the slide, you have 3% for legacy Pentair.","John L. Stauch","Correct.","Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And I may have missed it if you gave the breakdown between FX and organic.","John L. Stauch","FX is a couple of points.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is a really well-done earnings presentation, the handout. So everything is very clear. A couple of things though. I just have sort of just a couple of these little items here in the operating income on Page 12. Could you tell us what the incremental amortization of intangibles is for the fourth quarter? For the [indiscernible] of the deal?","John L. Stauch","Yes, it's -- that's $23 million that you see on the -- under the op income. The majority of that is the incremental amortization.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So like $18 million to $20 million or...","John L. Stauch","No, no, no. That's like $22 million to $23 million.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","$22 million, really? Okay.","John L. Stauch","Yes. Well, the depreciation remains in the business because most of those -- most of the depreciation isn't really adjusted because of the timing. Yes, and what happens is all of the other...","Randall J. Hogan","And within their base, that's the incremental.","John L. Stauch","This is incremental. All the other assets get revalued and that becomes the incremental amortization.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right, all right. Yes, that makes sense. Okay. And then the $10 million of New Corp and IST, are you saying that, that's Tyco Flow corporate expenditures that we should expect in the fourth quarter?","John L. Stauch","No, we would expect to add -- yes. On an ongoing rate next year, we would expect $20 million incremental IST cost and roughly $20 million of incremental Corp cost that would come into Pentair primarily around tax, treasury and the addition of other functions to support the new Swiss structure. And so that's a full run rate is what that's expecting. And then there is some segment cost, which I mentioned is still in that contribution from Flow Control, which should be part of the business unit operation synergies over time.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right. But that's going to be rolled up into the segments, right?","John L. Stauch","That's correct.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, I'm talking about just the corporate piece of Tyco Flow. That's what this number is, right, the $10 million?","John L. Stauch","Yes, yes.","Randall J. Hogan","The way to think about it is, it's incremental to Pentair corporate.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, exactly, exactly. So last question is this. If you would take a step back and look at the Pentair legacy business with the talk that you have on the muni, the Resi and how well the Technical Products business is holding up, plus your typical margin expansion initiatives, it seems to suggest that 2013 Pentair's legacy earnings would rise based on where we stand today. Would you agree with that statement?","John L. Stauch","I agree it would rise. I know where you're going with this, Scott. I'm not -- I don't know what the legacy EPS guidance for next year would be, but I think we would expect some growth, absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey.","Brett L. Linzey - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Could you just touch on the 4Q tax rate of 30%? You suggest in the release, it doesn't reflect some of the tax saving synergies and the strategies. I mean, is this just more timing or have expectations changed from your initial expectations there?","John L. Stauch","It's totally timing right now. The biggest piece of the reduction will come in the form of a debt pushdown structure. And once we choose that interest rate to push down at, we are locking in for a long term on that interest rate. And obviously, we want to choose that carefully. So we will have it in place, we'll be ready to fully go, but we're trying to get to the right answer for the ongoing Pentair.","Brett L. Linzey - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And we should expect by 1Q, that should be pushed down and it should normalize to that kind of 25% rate?","John L. Stauch","That's correct.","Randall J. Hogan","By January 1. By January 1.","Brett L. Linzey - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Sure, January 1. Okay. And then, I guess, the last question. Just on the cost synergies, you pointed to $40 million you've been able to achieve thus far. I mean, were you able to parse that out into different buckets? And then, I guess, how does that compare to your initial expectations?","John L. Stauch","I mean just to remind you, the corporate cost that we were receiving in Tyco Flow was more of a $2 billion standalone. And we were able to do this deal before most of those people were put in place, which is good news for the people and good news for us. So we're really adding to the Pentair corporate cost, and you'll see those there as about $40 million of incremental cost that we expect to put in.","Randall J. Hogan","Versus the $85 million to the $100 million that they were going to add.","Randall J. Hogan","So we really realized the entire corporate synergy, if you will, already.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of David Rose.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","The last 2 questions hit on line, but maybe we can clarify a little bit on the $40 million integration corporate investments. We're talking about $5 million each per quarter for corporate and ITS. You also have the $25 million piece. So the $10 million per quarter accounts for the $40 million. But was the $25 million onetime branding cost part of your $40 million integration corporate investment that you've outlined in the earlier presentations? Or is that something relatively new?","John L. Stauch","I wouldn't say it's new. I think it was something that normally would've been done over time. We're trying to get as much as possible behind us before we hit the ground on January 1. So we're taking a look at every single one of those decisions in the context of the IST and saying, how do we feel about this brand, how do we feel about the investments, how do we feel about the marketing, what we're doing, and accelerating those decisions as quickly as possible.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Now part of the $40 million includes in the ITS and over time, I would imagine that declines after the first year or 2. Is that fair?","Randall J. Hogan","Yes. The way we've thought about it is sort of it will fall off after maybe a couple of years, start falling off by the end of '15. It should be pretty much integrated into other things, I would think.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair. And then lastly, on the tax issue, you put out in the slide presentation, day 1 savings, 24% to 26%. I understand that there are some debt pushdown that you have to do. Is there anything else that could potentially change the tax rate guidance that might delay things a bit or increase the taxes?","John L. Stauch","The tax is based upon what is the ongoing rate of Tyco Flow, and the rate that we're experiencing is slightly higher than what we would have anticipated. At the same time, the synergies, the tax synergies that we're going after at this point exceed what we originally thought. So at this particular point in time, I am pretty confident with the 25%. And we're also confident that long term, we can get closer to 20% or below 20% like most Swiss-based companies. And those things will require from the 25% on down, incremental strategic actions beyond the debt pushdown. And we're prioritizing those right now because a lot of those align perfectly with what the business wants to do anyway around driving functional excellence or headquartering in certain locations. So I feel right now, we're on pace to do what we said.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the debt pushdown, are we talking about additional legal costs associated with this?","John L. Stauch","No, no, no.","Randall J. Hogan","No, It's just choose and go.","John L. Stauch","Yes, the interest rate is lower than what we would've anticipated. And we want to make sure whatever interest rate we choose and put in, we can live with for the next 10 years.","Randall J. Hogan","Last question.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Garik Shmois.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Just my question is on Western Europe, just real quick. It's been soft here for quite some time, but I believe you said that it's stabilizing. I know that you started to see declines on a year-over-year basis last year. So are we -- should we think about Western Europe as stabilizing off of this lower base or is it truly stabilizing?","John L. Stauch","Well, I think it's stabilizing off our lower base.","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, it's not recovering.","John L. Stauch","We, on a volume basis, were down low single digits in Q3. And that compares to being down double digits in Q1 and Q2. So we're starting to anniversary some of the easier comparisons and we're not expecting it to get much better. I mean, we're flattish in Q4. But we saw a pretty steady correction or pretty sharp correction, I should say, last Q4, primarily in Water Purification. And right now, we're not feeling that level of distributor destocking that we saw last year. And that's why we feel fairly comfortable to say it's stabilizing. I don't think it's recovering. I don't think we're trying to...","Randall J. Hogan","Well, and the things where, really, we saw a decline was Germany. In our Technical Products and our Flow Technologies business, Germany is a really important market. And so Germany went late into this decline, but they're in it. So -- and I'm not sure Germany has bottomed yet.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And you've done a good job getting pricing. Can you talk about pricing in Western Europe, Germany, if you saw incremental pressure here over the last quarter?","John L. Stauch","Nothing material. I mean, I think, keep in mind that these are fairly local purchases with pretty steady channels. And I don't think people are chasing volume right now. So I think you're seeing the pricing in line with what we've seen prior, in line with expectations.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then just a last question on that. Just as you look at the new Pentair, what does Western Europe make up as a total?","John L. Stauch","20% to 25% of new Pentair.","Randall J. Hogan","All right. Thank you, all.

After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Jim Lucas, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Mr. Lucas.","Jim Lucas","Thanks, Katie and welcome to Pentair\u2019s second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. We\u2019re glad you could join us. I\u2019m Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and John Stauch our Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call we will provide details on our second quarter 2012 performance, as well as our full year 2012 outlook as outlined in this morning\u2019s release.","Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company\u2019s anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair\u2019s 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2011 and today\u2019s release.","Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results.","Today\u2019s webcast is accompanied by a presentation which can be found in the investor\u2019s section of Pentair\u2019s website. We will reference these slides throughout the prepared remarks. All references today will be on an adjusted basis unless otherwise indicated, for which the non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation.","I would like to also point out that the third quarter and full year outlook does not include any future impact related to the pending Tyco Flow deal that we announced on March 28 as stated in this morning\u2019s release. We will be sure to reserve time for questions-and-answers after our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randy Hogan","Thanks, Jim and welcome. And good morning to everybody. Let me begin with second quarter results as shown on slide three. We had another strong operating performance in the quarter driven by our focus on the three Ps that we can control.","PIMS, price and productivity. We grew sales 3% on a reported basis. We drove operating profits up 11% expanding adjusted operating margins by 100 basis points and we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.83, which is up 11%.","While a combination of unfavorable foreign currency translation, continued softness in Western Europe, and the last quarter of an end-of-life telecom project tempered top line growth, we saw continued strength in many of the sectors we serve.","Industrial, agriculture, pool and energy all contributed solid gains in the quarter and we saw strong pricing across the portfolio with total price favorable by 2.4%. Fast growth region sales were slower but still grew faster than overall Pentair.","We continue to expect double-digit growth for the full year in fast growth regions as we execute our expansion plans. Adjusted margins increased 100 basis points to 14.3% in the second quarter as we continue to drive greater productivity and execute the pricing actions to offset material inflation while funding growth investments. While we have seen some easing in commodity inflation, our pricing initiatives remain sound.","In the second quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.83 compared to the $0.75 in the prior year driven by our strong operational execution in the quarter, which helps somewhat mitigate the areas out of our control, such as softer Western European volumes and continued headwinds from foreign currency.","On cash flow, we saw the seasonal rebound in free cash of $222 million in the second quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 140 million, putting us well on our way to converting more than 100% of net income to free cash flow, something we\u2019ve done consistently eight out of the last 10 years.","As Western Europe continues to be a headwind and uncertainty persists, we accelerated several repositioning actions during the quarter. This is not dissimilar to the approach we\u2019ve taken during other challenging times in the past.","All in, we delivered another quarter of solid operating performance with well executed productivity initiatives, good price realization, while continuing our growth investments, which we believe position us well for the balance of 2012 and beyond.","Now, let\u2019s turn to slide four for a review of our Water & Fluid Solutions segment performance. Water & Fluid Solutions sales grew 7% year-over-year in the quarter largely driven by the CPT acquisition, which added $40 million in sales. Excluding CPT, Water & Fluid sales grew 3% in local currency as price realization remains favorable.","Aquatic Systems delivered solid results in its seasonally strongest quarter and treatment process continues to benefit from a strong backlog and a healthy pipeline of new product introductions.","Let me begin with the flow business, where sales were essentially flat in the quarter, an improvement from the decline seen in the first quarter. The business continues to see softness in residential pumps through the absence of any major weather related activity this year. Municipal was flat, but the project business saw a healthy, double digit increase in orders and the backlog continues to build, signaling some increases in sales in this vertical starting in the fourth quarter this year and into the first half of 2013.","We are not prepared to call a bottom in Municipal, but we are seeing signs of stabilization and an increase in quoting activity in the traditional break and fix activity, which may signal a return to more normal demand.","Agriculture grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter, as we continue to see strong share gains in this vertical. The integration of Nijhuis into Flow is progressing nicely. Cross training of the sales force is well along and we\u2019ve begun to combine product offerings in some verticals, such as Fire. In the first quarter, we mentioned several joint sales calls that have made \u2013 that we\u2019ve made and this continued into the second quarter, most recently in Canada to promote the new fish friendly pump.","Within Treatment and Process water purification sales grew 4% year-over-year in local currency. Fast growth region sales continued to grow at double-digit rates, with India doubling once again on expanded coverage and added new products.","In contrast, sales in the U.S. were up modestly and Europe was relatively flat, largely in line with our expectations. Importantly we did see U.S. inventory levels stabilize and Europe distributors some sentiment improved from the October and November low points.","New product launches remain on track, including our industry changing innovation Hybrid DI, which combines the benefits of reverse osmosis filtration with those of a water softener using capacitive electrodes to remove hardness and total dissolved solids from the water, all without employing any salt.","In addition to residential use, this groundbreaking system could be used in a wide range of applications, including in hotels and restaurants and the broader commercial sector. We\u2019re very excited about all these applications and look forward to winning a lot.","As part of our rapid growth process, we\u2019ve had some success with programs first introduced in China and then launched globally. Most recently we\u2019ve begun our USA Builder initiative that targets a select group of builders that are still growing in areas such as Denver, Houston, San Antonio and even Tampa. This is based off a program that we had success with in China targeting large housing complexes. The USA builder initiative has had some early wins and we\u2019re looking to expand into other regions entering next year.","In China, we recently launched the POU Homespring product, which is exceeding our initial expectations. This product has been well received in China and we\u2019re looking to roll this out globally later this year. Both of these initiatives, the Builder program and the Homespring product, demonstrate our ability to not only develop programs locally in fast growth regions, specifically China in this case, but to also take this knowledge and transfer it globally.","In the other part of Treatment and Process, process technology sales were up 29%, or up 3% including CPT and a 6% foreign exchange headwind. Advanced Water Systems and Energy both grew double digits in the quarter. Within Advanced Water Systems we continue to see growth in desalination through the distribution channel along with some project work.","Energy grew double digit once again. We continue to pursue larger system sales and penetrate new applications within refineries and natural gas production, while growing recurring revenue and maintaining above average margins.","Our second quarter performance once again demonstrated the great strides we are making with our Polarex Extractive Separation Systems. Our technology and systems expertise provide alternatives to conventional natural gas treatment methods at a fraction of the cost with better efficiency and a much better environmental footprint.","We secured several new orders in the quarter, which highlights the growing acceptance of this technology. Food Service remains steady as we expand into new customers, such as convenience stores. We reached the one-year anniversary with CPT in mid-May, so only half of the results were included in acquisitions during the quarter. CPT added $35 million in acquired sales in Q2 contributing to both flow and treatment process. Backlog grew once again, particularly in beverage, which we believe sets us up nicely for 2013.","Process Technologies had several strategic wins during the quarter. First, we\u2019ve established a framework agreement with the major brewer for all filtration projects through 2015 including BMF projects underway in England and China.","We continue to win contracts for dairy applications as well. Next we won our single largest code line order to date for a desal project in Saudi Arabia. Finally, we won a large membrane systems order in France and see opportunities to expand our global Anaerobic MBR reach in the future.","Turning to Aquatic systems, once again it was another great performance. Sales were up 8% in the quarter, reflecting continued share gains and good pricing. Growth fundamentals remain strong in Pool with continued investment and significant installed base growing energy rebates and good secular trends around sustainability, efficiency and automation.","As result, in IntelliFlo pump sales remained impressive growing another 30% in the quarter. We continue to expand coverage and penetration adding another 132 dealers in the quarter and add new products to the lineup, such as the IntelliZone Ozone Generator system that helps sanitize pool water and reduce chlorine use by as much as 50%.","The right half of the page shows second quarter Water & Fluid operating profit margins. Water & Fluid adjusted operating margins increased 50 basis points to 14.7% in the quarter. Successful pricing actions and strong productivity helped to offset persistent inflation and we continue to make progress at CPT as the adoption of PIMS has contributed to improvements in quality, delivery and cost. Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with the Water & Fluid segment performance this quarter.","Now, let\u2019s move to slide five for a review of Technical Products. Technical Product\u2019s sales were down modestly compared to prior year in local currency, while adjusted operating profits grew 5%. Price realization was good, but volumes were down year-over-year due to an expected end-of-life telecom project. This is the last quarter of that particular project headwind. Even with the reported sales decline, Technical Products delivered 11% operating income growth and adjusted operating margins expanded 290 basis points to 20.2%. This marks another record margin performance for the segment.","We believe we are well positioned to deliver the expected 100 plus basis point margin expansion in 2012 as pricing initiated in March reads through along with continued productivity, repositioning benefits and better growth in the second half.","In our focus verticals Industrial, Energy and Infrastructure, we grew sales a combined 5% globally and 9% in North America in the quarter as we fill in our global product portfolio, add coverage, particularly in Energy, and launch our new accelerate program that highlights better lead times and ease of doing business.","This quarter we also launched PCF stainless steel wall mount enclosure line, which was designed and produced in China. This targets petrochem, pharmaceutical, and food and beverage applications.","In contrast, Communications, which accounts for roughly 19% of sales was down nearly 30%, reflecting the anticipated negative impact from the end-of-life program as well as softness overall in telecommunications orders.","Cooling was up 6% excluding FX, and continues to be a key focus as we expand coverage in innovation globally. This quarter we launched a Direct Air Cooling System, an energy efficient cooling platform for electronics. This new systems offers flexible effective heat removal for outdoor enclosures. Looking ahead, we have an exciting innovation calendar in Cooling with the expected launch of a compact cooling offering, added controller and communication capabilities and expanded offerings specifically for fast growth regions.","We are also seeing early successes of integrated cabinet and cooling solutions, for example a tow-way project in Brazil with each controller requiring three cabinets plus a cooling unit. This is in the testing phase now, but we see great potential for it after the testing phase is over.","Fast-growth region technical product sales grew 8% in local currencies as we add distribution and expand our product portfolio to meet local needs. In China, sales improved quarter-over-quarter with some stabilization, and importantly good traction on our distribution expansion efforts, adding nearly 20 more distributors this quarter and yielding 30% sales growth through distribution.","In Latin America, Tech Products largest fast growth region, sales were up nearly 20% in local currency with infrastructure a bright spot. Middle East, albeit small today, was up 17% in the quarter. I believe we\u2019ve only just begun to see the benefits of our expanded distribution and product offerings in fast-growth regions for Tech Products.","Bottom line, in Technical Products is that while volumes are more challenged in the second half of the year, we continue to invest in new products and global expansion, while driving productivity and Lean to grow operating profits and advance margins.","Let\u2019s now turn to slide six. Now that we\u2019re past the halfway point for the year, I wanted to spend a few moments updating you on our key geographies and verticals. Starting with our largest region, the U.S. and Canada, year-to-date sales were up 5% if we exclude the previously mentioned end of life telecom contracts in tech products.","Industrial, Agriculture and Energy have been the three strongest sectors. And while we are seeing some moderation in Industrial, Agriculture remains strong. And we\u2019re making good inroads into energy, which is growing off a smaller base. Western Europe remains an important area and we have not been immune to the challenges throughout the region. Excluding FX translation, volume were down 8% in the first half.","While we anticipate translation headwinds to continue, the rate of decline in volumes appears to be moderating in Europe. Within fast growth regions, there are several moving pieces. China was flat on an organic basis in the first half of the total enterprise, but we saw over 20% growth in other key regions such as the Middle East, Latin America and India.","As I mentioned previously, Industrial and Ag \u2013 agriculture \u2013 aquaculture are up double digits year-to-date. We have seen modest gains in Commercial and Infrastructure and Residential has been flat. While we continue to bounce along the bottom in Residential and Commercial, Infrastructure recently had seen some pick up in orders and backlog.","Our investments in strategic growth platforms continue to pay dividends in the form of increased orders. Energy, water reuse, industrialization, and agriculture are all areas where Pentair is positioned in the new, new world.","Let\u2019s turn to slide seven for a look forward at the second half of the year. After posting 5% top line growth in the first half, with acquisition contributing from CPT, we would expect modest reported top line growth in the second half as FX translation remains a headwind. We are not alone in this, but we are focused on elements within our control.","For example, our strong price contribution in the first half is not a short-term phenomena and we have strong price actions carrying through into the back half of the year. In addition, improving backlogs in Municipal and Beverage portend an improvement for these verticals. Fast growth remains on track for double-digit growth this year even as China\u2019s growth has been muted.","Operating margins have benefited from price and productivity, two of the elements within our control. We\u2019ve seen some moderation on the inflation crunch, which has helped and we continue to drive productivity. Given the ongoing challenges with the macro environment we did accelerate some repositioning spending in the quarter. Overall, we are on track to deliver adjusted operating margin expansion of 100 basis points and double-digit EPS growth for the year.","Before I wrap up my comments, on slide eight I would like to provide an update on our announcement \u2013 announced merger with Tyco Flow Control. We continue to be excited about the merger announced at the end of March. We believe this transaction is a great strategic fit increasing our global presence and exposure to high growth and attractive sectors.","Let me first provide an update on the transaction timeline, what we\u2019ve done in the last 118 days and what\u2019s still to come. From a regulatory perspective we received U.S. and EU clearance with regulatory filings underway in other foreign jurisdictions. We\u2019ve established an Integrated Planning Management office, led by a proven Pentair executive, which is fully staffed with a team of 40 functional and business unit team leaders to drive the global integration planning.","These initial integration planning efforts will be critical as we ramp up towards the expected close at the end of September. We filed a preliminary proxy statement and Form S-4 for SEC review, which is progressing. Still to come are a few more foreign regulatory approvals, and of course Pentair and Tyco International shareholder approvals. As we work through regulatory approvals and SEC filings we are limited in further commenting on the transaction, but we wanted to provide an update on what we\u2019ve accomplished to-date.","Now let\u2019s turn to slide nine. In summary we\u2019re off to a solid start. First half was not without its challenges, nor will be the second half. But we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive strong operating performance through the elements within our control. We are doing this while still investing in the long-term as evidenced by our continued expansion into new areas, such as energy and agriculture, and a strong new pipeline like with the Hybrid DI.","We are well aligned with the biggest mega trends that, I believe, are driving the world today and in the future. The population and wealth growth of what we call the new, new world will continue putting incredible pressure and demands on food, water, energy and industrial infrastructure. From CPT to the transformational Tyco Flow deal, we continue to better position Pentair to serve this new world.","In addition, we remain committed to organic investments for growth in serving these attractive trends, sustaining higher R&D investments to deliver customers what they need, including better efficiency, sustainability, automation and safety.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John.","John Stauch","Thank you, Randy. Please turn to slide number 10, labeled first half and full year operating margins. Let me begin on the left hand side of the chart. As Randy mentioned previously, we expanded Pentair adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points in the second quarter versus last year. Tech Products led the way with 290 basis points of margin expansion, while Water delivered 50 basis points of expansion. Adjusting for the last quarter of the CPT acquisition headwind, which was 70 basis points, Water delivered around 120 basis points of margin expansion.","Both Water and Technical Products benefited from acceleration of PIMS and Lean initiatives, proactive pricing actions, lower raw material costs, value engineering efforts, prioritized investments and previously taken repositioning actions. We continue to focus on four wall accountability and we are raising the expectations of the plants and businesses and they are responding with thoughtful projects that are yielding significant results.","Also a benefit in the quarter in both segment were more significant contributions in income from fast growth regions. Our efforts to localize sales, marketing, engineering, sourcing and manufacturing in these regions is being rewarded.","As we look at the full year expectations for 2012, we see most of the trends from Q2 remaining consistent into the second half of the year. We expect the top-line contribution to be a little lighter than previously anticipated due to FX translation, not just in Europe, but also in Brazil, Canada and India back to the U.S. dollar. While the top-line impact of FX was nearly 27 million in the second quarter, the estimated impact of the bottom-line was only about $0.02 of EPS due to the fact that we benefited from transactional FX, in some cases, as well as we were proactive in taking out costs in most regions affected.","For the full year, the impact of FX on year-over-year basis is forecasted around $90 million or about 2.5 points of top-line impact. In addition to FX, Western Europe represents just under 15% of our overall revenue. In total, we are now forecasting Western European volumes to be down around 6% to 7% for the full year affecting the top line for Pentair by just under a point.","While China has received a lot of attention for slowing, and no doubt it has, we continue to make progress in fast growth regions with year-to-date revenue in total fast growth, up just over 20%, and anticipated to grow 20% for the year and finish greater than 20% of Pentair\u2019s total revenue base.","We still believe fast growth regions long-term are the right place to be positioned, and while one or two geographies every year may not experience double digit growth, because of our product offering, lower share position and investments locally; we believe we are well positioned to grow double digit and fast growth as a whole for the next several years.","So, in summary for operating margins, we have done nicely for the first half. We expect Europe and China to be sluggish into the second half, FX to continue as a headwind, price to be maintained, and raw material inflation to be moderate. We feel we can control our own destiny and deliver a second half and full year operating performance, while we anticipate the closing and integration of the Tyco Flow businesses.","Please turn to slide number 11, labeled balance sheet and cash flow. We had a strong cash flow quarter, as anticipated. We delivered $222 million in cash flow for the quarter, which is about $40 million more cash than we delivered in the second quarter of 2011.","Working capital was strong, as is typical in our second quarter, which is when we collect unreceivables from the early buy season in our pool business. Net debt ended the second quarter at about $1.35 billion slightly better than forecasted. It\u2019s setting us up nicely for the anticipated closing of our proposed merger with Tyco Flow. ROIC improved to 9.3%, still below our long-term expectations of 15%, but on pace for double digit by the end of the year.","Please turn to slide number 12, labeled third quarter Pentair outlook. Our third quarter Pentair outlook assumes that the overall economy does not get much better. Volume growth in Europe in the second quarter was down about 10%, which was consistent with the first quarter. Sequentially the second quarter is about the same as the first quarter, so it did not really deteriorate. It just did not get better.","Our forecast for the third and fourth quarter assumes the same general global economic picture with the only deterioration, a moderating North American industrial outlook as capital spending tightens. With that as a backdrop, we expect third quarter sales to be up around 1% to 3% organically or close to up 3% to 5%, excluding the impact of 2 to 3 points of FX headwind.","Increases in volume are expected in Water, where CPT is now contributing to organic sales and a healthy backlog of global industrial projects related to CO2 recovery and Beer Membrane filtration systems, as well as water reuse projects for large industrial customers. Also accelerating are energy separation projects, aquaculture applications, and global agriculture systems. Easier comparisons in Europe will also help Water, primarily in the water purification business.","Order trends and building backlog in municipal infrastructure should result in revenue growth in that segment in the second half, versus declines in the first half. For technical products we expect top line growth to continue to be challenging as North American industrial revenue expansion slows from plus 7% in the first half of the year to plus 3% to 4% for the second half of the year, as well as datacom, communications, and general electronics globally experiencing close to double-digit declines on lower capital investment.","European headwinds are expected to continue through the third quarter and should ease a little as we close out the year. Overall, Pentair adjusted operating income, before any impact of the Tyco Flow merger, is expected to be up 4% to 8%, and adjusted operating margins should be up around 60 basis points year-over-year as productivity continues to contribute to bottom line expansion.","Overall adjusted EPS is expected to be between $0.61 to $0.63, reflecting lower contributions, as is normal, from Aquatics due to the end of season sell-through and the typical impact of Western European shutdowns for the month of August. Third quarter performance should set us up nicely for closing out the year and achieving our full year expectations.","Please turn to my last slide, labeled full year 2012 outlook. For the full year, we have tweaked our guidance by raising the bottom of the range by a nickel to $2.70, reflecting second quarter performance and our current outlook for the second half. We have adjusted the top end of the range to $2.76 from $2.80, reflecting impact from FX.","Overall, our new adjusted EPS outlook is $2.70 to $2.76, reflecting a full year EPS expansion of 12% to 15%. Driven by top line expansion of four to five points, and overall margin expansion about 70 basis points, or around 100 basis points excluding impact of CPT, and in line with our productivity expectations and previous performance history. Free cash flow is expected to exceed 100% of net income and be greater than 270 million for the year.","Katie, can we please take our first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Absolutely. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Jim Lucas","Brian?","Randy Hogan","We cannot hear you, Brian.","John Stauch","Brian?","Operator","Mr. Konigsberg, if your line is on mute, would you please un-mute.","Brian Konigsberg \u2013 Vertical Research","Can you hear me? Hello?","Randy Hogan","Yes, we can now.","Brian Konigsberg \u2013 Vertical Research","Okay. Sorry about that.","Randy Hogan","No problem.","Brian Konigsberg \u2013 Vertical Research","Just first question on Technical Products, great quarter. Margins at 20%, I think that is a record from what I could tell. I\u2019m just curious, with the volumes under a bit of pressure, what are the chances you get push back from your distributor base asking for a price concessions, given that also some of the commodities are seeing some relief.","Randy Hogan","There is always a risk of that in major project settings. But one of the great things about the structure of our industry is when you sell through distribution the prices kind of roll through. We don\u2019t do surcharging. Everything goes into the base. So we always assume that in our \u2013 that there will be some erosion due to the larger projects. But in terms of the flow business, stuff that really just flows through distribution, it\u2019s a virtuous situation. Distributors benefit from price increases as well.","Brian Konigsberg \u2013 Vertical Research","Got it. And just moving over to Europe, what gives you confidence that you should see stabilization in the second half of the year? And I think you made a comment that the weakening Euro is spurring a little bit of a demand. Can you maybe just give some color on how much benefit you are seeing from that and what do you expect in the second half?","Randy Hogan","Yes. The biggest factor in the second half for Europe is that a lot of our European business saw the decline last year, saw some precipitous declines in the third and fourth quarter. So the comps are easier. So we are not saying that things get better. We just said that year-over-year it doesn\u2019t look as bad, I would say the biggest factor there. That\u2019s particularly true in Water Purification. And you want to talk about the lower Euro helps our exports, right?","John Stauch","Yeah. I mean \u2013 we are not yet at a point where the Euro is low enough where I think we see the benefit. I mean, when we saw it under 120 last time, we saw a pretty significant pick up in exports. So we\u2019re not calling for that or planning for that in the second half. But we do buy projects or buy products from Europe and we are absolutely seeing a transactional benefit of purchasing, drives for instance, and our IntelliFlo pumps come from Europe. And we also cross ship and sell into the U.S. technical products.","So I think we\u2019ve got the foreign exchange, although it\u2019s a headline on the top line. I think we\u2019ve got it managed on the cost position well. And just to reiterate what Randy said, I mean, we\u2019re not looking for a pick up. Matter of fact, Q3 will be down sequentially as normal because of the August shut down, which is typical in Europe. And then as Randy mentioned, starting in September of last year, we saw a significant decline in our water businesses. So I think we\u2019ve framed it appropriately and obviously we\u2019re not looking for a pick up.","Randy Hogan","And if I could just add one more thing, China and Europe or Western Europe are pretty light, I mean, Western Europe is the largest \u2013 a very large export market for China, which is affecting China. And a lot of the European exports, particularly the German exports, go into China to help drive manufacturing investment, or to support manufacturing investment. So weaker China, even with a lower Euro, it doesn\u2019t mean that there will be a huge demand increase for European \u2013 for the OEMs that we serve in Europe. So anyway that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it.","Brian Konigsberg \u2013 Vertical Research","Great. Thank you very much.","Randy Hogan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Brett Lindsay \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hi, good morning, this is Brett Lindsay stepping in for Jeff.","Randy Hogan","Hey, Brett.","Brett Lindsay \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hey, just on the restructuring plans, which businesses in the quarter were most impacted from some of these initiatives weighted between Water and Technical Products?","John Stauch","Yes. We took, if you think about it, it\u2019s a third roughly in Tech Products where we took some actions in Europe based upon proactively assessing where the volumes were at. And two thirds of it would be Water and we again more heavily weighted to Europe and the sense of rightsizing the volume on anticipated lower demand.","Brett Lindsay \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. And then you mentioned in your comments about moderation in North America. Could you just talk in a little bit more detail around the puts and takes domestically where you might be seeing signs of deceleration within the business?","Randy Hogan","Yes. Industrial is the place where we are seeing deceleration and which we see a little bit in the Water and more in Tech Products. At the same time we think Residential, and Municipal, and Commercial have \u2013 we see some encouraging signs in that. Not huge volume necessarily. But certainly as we mentioned in Municipal, we expect to see actually an increase in volume sales in the fourth quarter. But some of the programs that we have in Residential I think are quite promising to help us drive growth and Residential is clearly coming off the bottom now.","John Stauch","I mean, just to put some context there. I mean, we are really saying that high single-digits in North American industrial slows to 3 to 4 points of growth, which I think is a probably more normalized long term growth rate. In Residential, if you really look at it, we\u2019ve got two businesses Water Purification and our Pool business that are in the high single-digits and we\u2019ve been impacted on the retail side of flood related products to the tune of down 30% year-over-year. So, we have seen a recovery in the Residential in two of our three businesses. And we\u2019re expecting those year-over-year comparisons in the retail side to mitigate at some point here, and I think you\u2019ll see the residential growth start to accelerate.","Brett Lindsay \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, great. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning. Thank you. The first question...","Randy Hogan","Hi.","Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hey. The first question is just on repositioning actions and spend. Maybe if you could talk about get into some more detail on what are some of the actions you are taking? How much are you spending there? And how that ramps up through the balance of the year?","Randy Hogan","Yeah. If you look at the two charts, you can see the $7 million on the Water chart and the $3 million, and it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s all about people. It\u2019s basically to pay for the reduction in force, which is as you know more expensive in Europe. But we expect, John, the benefits would start reading out fairly quickly.","John Stauch","Yeah. Q3, Q4 next year and think of the pay back being 40% to 50% of the expected reduction. I think \u2013 to put it in context, we look at delivering the long-term goals with the type of merger is delivering the base. Making sure that the synergies are additive to that base and then our bolt-on acquisitions would be additive to those numbers and think of this as securing the base in wake of what is now a slightly slower Europe than expected, and making sure that we\u2019re staying out ahead of the cost actions to stay competitive.","Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse","All right. And just on the Tyco deal, you know that deal obviously closes in Q3. But maybe if you could share when you think you will be in a position to talk more in detail on revenue synergies and sort of the top-line opportunity out of that deal. I know you\u2019ve already highlighted the cost side.","Randy Hogan","Yeah. We \u2013as we\u2019ve been allowed \u2013 to the extent we\u2019ve been able to work together and get into the details we still feel very good about our plan, we still feel very good about the strategy. What I\u2019d like to \u2013 what we are planning to doing is bringing the teams from both sides together as soon after closing \u2013 like that first week. And then probably back to you in terms of \u2013 in terms of detailed guidance and then probably have an analyst meeting probably pull it into November-December somewhere in there where we will bring everyone together and we\u2019ll go through things in detail.","Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great. And just the last question. On weather, maybe if you could remind us on how that\u2019s impacted your business this year. You mentioned the flood side, flood being slower. Maybe any other businesses where you saw pull forward due to weather or any other impact as we think about your business next year?","Randy Hogan","In terms of the \u2013 as you know the Pool business got off to an early season in the first quarter, the first quarter was \u2013 it came out like we thought. The first quarter was stronger and we got the 8% growth in the second quarter here and as we look at the first half it was just what we thought it would be. So we feel good about that. We had floods both in Europe and in the U.S. in the spring last year, in 2011, and didn\u2019t have either this year. So, I don\u2019t John how much is...","John Stauch","I mean, our flood related SKUs, put in context, are down 30% year-over-year. So that gives you a context. I mean, it\u2019s hitting our Water business by roughly 2 to 3 points on a year-over-year basis. We don\u2019t have any anticipated weather in the second half. We\u2019re not weather forecasters here. So we\u2019ve kept things consistent with where they\u2019ve been sequentially.","Randy Hogan","Price sold pumps in Minnesota this morning, early this afternoon. They had three inches of rain this morning.","Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse","All right. Perfect. That\u2019s good color. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Thank you. Just wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on how the sales trends progressed as you moved through the second quarter, April, May and June, that would be helpful.","John Stauch","We track them all along, I mean, we didn\u2019t see any different or uniqueness. June finished fairly strong. April and May were consistent with what our expectations were. So as far as color, I mean, we anticipated some challenges and things played out pretty much as expected except for the currency and Europe not getting better versus Q1.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay. So there wasn\u2019t any market deceleration as you moved through the second quarter.","John Stauch","Not as we see it.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Great. And then just secondly, you identified a number of new projects looking out over the next several years. As a result of CPT, the desal project in Saudi Arabia. I was wondering if you can maybe put some numbers around these new project opportunities, maybe on annual basis, anticipated revenue growth just so we can get an idea of the order of magnitude that we\u2019re looking at from these projects that you\u2019ve highlighted.","John Stauch","I\u2019ll just give you the numbers piece first and then I\u2019ll let Randy kind of fill in the color. I mean, we\u2019ve got a really growing robust backlog in our CPT related project businesses. And as we mentioned on the last several calls we\u2019ve been in the transition of moving away from the muni projects, except for desel where we have a really nice product offering, and transitioning into more water reuse and CO2 recovery and Beer Membrane filtration industrial side.","We are targeting north of 10% growth on what is now north of $300 million annual basis and you should think of the backlog or the project deck being multiple times that as you would expect leakage in that project and the push out of the projects. So that gives you an idea of what we are targeting and kind of where our backlog is. And I will let Randy put in the color where we...","Randy Hogan","Yes. And the way I like to think about it is we bought CPT to have double-digit growth, $240 million in sales, that double-digit growth would be $24 million a year. I think a lot of that is from the new applications and it\u2019s in the $20 million to $30 million range.","We are making a lot of progress in Dairy. We were making a lot of progress in as \u2013 we mentioned \u2013 we mentioned a framework agreement, which is kind of interesting it\u2019s the same sort of approach that Tyco Flow Control uses in the energy side using big frame agreements to look at multiyear relationships. We see some real opportunities to do that in food and beverage. We see some real opportunities to do that in what I would call industrial water. So and that\u2019s where, as John mentioned, water reuse.","Water reuse is \u2013 we have the technology. We have systems. We believe water reuse. We just look at the droughts and look at the issues being caused by lack of water. People \u2013 the industrials are going to be the first people that are serious about taking care of water, so we really see that technology being useful there. So I think about it in terms of $20 million to $30 million kind of a growth a year. On top of that, I believe there is at least that \u2013 there is another $20 million or so that\u2019s in the water purification area. That\u2019s why we focus so much on the filtration side. We are very \u2013 I\u2019m very bullish on Hybrid DI. I think, I said before it\u2019s not an iPad, but we\u2019re going to work like hell to make it one. It really can be a game changer in terms of Residential and Commercial.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay, great. Thank you for the color.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Barry from UBS. Your line is now open.","Robert Barry \u2013 UBS","Hi, guys, good morning.","John Stauch","Good morning.","Randy Hogan","Good morning.","Robert Barry \u2013 UBS","Question on the Technical Products margins. Is that communications revenue that\u2019s been weak especially low margin?","John Stauch","Yes.","Randy Hogan","Yes.","John Stauch","There is a mix benefit, no doubt about it.","Robert Barry \u2013 UBS","I guess that was my question, I\u2019m trying to unpack like where in the walk the mix comes in, is it under productivity price, and how big is it?","Randy Hogan","It would show up in productivity, yeah.","John Stauch","If I was estimating it, you can\u2019t be precise on that, but I would say it\u2019s anywhere from 70 to 80 basis points of mixed benefit. If you think of it in areas that we\u2019ve been challenged, I mean, our European businesses don\u2019t have the margins that our North American business does in Technical Products. And the communications side, which is OEM and project related work, especially towards the tail end of those projects where the volumes aren\u2019t where they used to be, tend to be very low margin.","Robert Barry \u2013 UBS","Got you. So it sounds like there is still some room that you\u2019re actually raising price on kind of a like-for-like product basis?","Randy Hogan","Yeah. There was definitely price and there was definitely productivity. And that was 270 basis points...","John Stauch","220 net.","Randy Hogan","To 220 net. You take out the 80 and we\u2019re still up 140. So price plus...","John Stauch","It\u2019s 290 minus 80 would be about 210 and that would reflect the ongoing price.","Robert Barry \u2013 UBS","And then I just wanted...","John Stauch","But I think \u2013 just to follow up on that. I mean, one of the things Randy is challenging this business for sometime about is, we don\u2019t need to continue to chase these large telecommunication businesses. So as we build the factories and start to fill the international locations, we\u2019re looking more for that steady margin, industrial energy and infrastructure.","Randy Hogan","And that\u2019s what exciting about when you see we are adding 20 distributors in China and we are getting 30% distribution growth in China. That telecom project that we are finally getting out of was one we took back during the financial crisis to fill the factory. I mean, so this is what happens when you don\u2019t have lane discipline, and by the way we were on board with that decision at that time.","Robert Barry \u2013 UBS","Yeah. So it\u2019s not like \u2013 it\u2019s a benefit that unwinds?","Randy Hogan","Correct. Right.","Robert Barry \u2013 UBS","Yeah. And I just also just wanted to follow-up on Pool and you touched on it little bit earlier. The growth decelerated quarter-to-quarter still good, but decelerated a lot versus a much easier comp. I mean \u2013 and you also had that deal, I think the Brazil acquisition in there. I\u2019m curious how much that added and how you are thinking about Pool given the deceleration from quarter-to-quarter.","John Stauch","Brazil was a rounding error, Rob. I mean, with the time you take to add in the revenue less the foreign exchange in the Real, I mean, maybe less than a $1 million.","Randy Hogan","(Inaudible) the inventory...","John Stauch","We are just getting it up and then we\u2019ve got an inventory impact. Yeah, I mean, I think it\u2019s hard to call upper-single digit 8% growth in a business that\u2019s not seeing an increase in installed base, and our Pool permits today are 80% or down 80% from where they were at the peak. So we are not seeing a substantial amount of increase in Pool builds, but we are seeing an increase in content from the energy efficiency line that we are adding.","Randy Hogan","Yeah. The point about the good secular trends that I talked about in my script remains true. I mean, it actually as housing stabilizes particularly as the Florida market has stabilized and houses start to turn and people start fixing their pools. I\u2019m not worried about Pool at all.","Robert Barry \u2013 UBS","Yeah, do you think the second quarter growth is (inaudible).","John Stauch","Well, as I said, I kind of looked at the first quarter as the weather was so good that had to be \u2013 couldn\u2019t continue that we thought there was (inaudible) from second quarter. We planned, we thought that way and in fact it was. So we kind of look at the first half and say, yeah, it was about like we thought it should be.","Robert Barry \u2013 UBS","Got you. Okay. Thank you.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from Citi Research. Your line is now open.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","John Stauch","Good morning.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","And also best wishes to Jim and his new role. First question on the Pool, just to follow-up on Rob\u2019s questions on the Pool side, in adding these new dealers, was there any channel fill benefit that was meaningful in the quarter?","Randy Hogan","Not really. Our dealers are really pool builders and so they basically pull through Pool Corp or whatever distributor they work with, as they do a service on a pool, rebuild or build an actual pool. So there aren\u2019t that many of them that stock and they are particularly \u2013 the ones we added are smaller ones, so they particularly don\u2019t really stock.","John Stauch","But we do look at it as way to gain more content in the overall market Deane, and so we hope that that has a sustainable impact on the growth rate long-term.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","And then do you have a sense of how much the \u2013 some of these green products, the IntelliFlo, have contributed to the top line. And just if you kind of parse out what the year-over-year is? How much of that are these green products?","Randy Hogan","The IntelliFlo grew 30% in the quarter. It\u2019s now...","John Stauch","35% of the overall...","Randy Hogan","The whole Eco Select product line, all of what we call the green Eco Select bottom line is 35% of our growth, and it\u2019s been growing at least twice the rate of the overall business. So it\u2019s been a big part of it.","John Stauch","And Deane, just as we shared with you or shared with everyone earlier, the overall market is not growing. So we definitely think that this Eco Select line is helping us grow double-digit, high single-digits in what is not necessarily a robust market.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Great. And then over on the CPT side, it sounds as though you have got some new products or some new business on the beverage side in China. So we were at the Singapore water tradeshow a few weeks ago and there was a lot of buzz about what the opportunities are for CPT in China, and specifically on the beverage side. So how does that business look? Are you displacing competitors there? Or is it just better distribution into China? Just give us an update if you could?","Randy Hogan","I think it\u2019s the advancement of the technology as they continue to build out what I would call more world class food and beverage capability. As you know, their dairy business is going through quite a cathartic change and so bringing in more world class technology is where we see it. Also, Beer Membranes versus the (inaudible) approach and getting these relationships with these brewers and these dairies are really the opportunities. I think less of it as takeaway as terms of just getting the growth.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Great. And then I might have missed this, but on the repositioning actions, can you comment on what the payback period is? If you\u2019re doing this in Europe, typically that\u2019s a little bit more extended than North America. But what can you quantify the payback?","John Stauch","Yeah. It\u2019s about 4 million to 5 million total payback. And we expect it to start \u2013 annually \u2013 so we expect to start within Q3, Q4, so (inaudible).","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","So we would start seeing the savings in what quarter?","John Stauch","Starting in Q3.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Of this year?","John Stauch","Yes.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Okay. Thank you.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wherley from Janney Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Mike Wherley \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Good morning, guys. I was just wondering, if you could give us a little more detail on what you\u2019re seeing in muni, you said that you\u2019re getting some improvements there, and I just wonder if you could give a little bit more detail.","John Stauch","Yeah. Let me, just give the first piece and then I\u2019ll let Randy share with you. For the first half of the year to put in context, our overall global infrastructure in muni was down about 5% to 7% year-over-year, and so what we\u2019re now \u2013 sales. So now what we\u2019re heading into is a growing backlog in order rate in which we think that at least is not negative in the back half of the year.","Randy Hogan","When we look at it, we look at orders when we look at backlog. The backlog is actually up 32% as we exit the quarter versus a year ago, which is good. And the first half orders are up 6%. The second quarter was up 20%. So \u2013 and if we look at \u2013 if you will, the quote activity right now, it\u2019s up over two times. So, we view that as all good signs. We secured everything that\u2019s in order. We secured and we know when that ships, that\u2019s why we feel like the fourth quarter we\u2019ll be up in municipal and the first half of next year. So as I said, is this another dead cat bounce in this market? And that\u2019s why we\u2019re not saying it\u2019s \u2013 we feel good about it, but I am not calling the bottom yet.","Mike Wherley \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Do you \u2013 what do you attribute this big pick up to? I mean, do you think that these cities have just put this off too long?","Randy Hogan","No. I view it as break and fix. What happened was the stimulus \u2013 we are \u2013 this is primarily in the pump business and it\u2019s primarily North America. We are making progress outside North America in this business, but the big changes \u2013 the stimulus package that the government \u2013U.S. government had pulled ahead a bunch of investments. It basically paid for stuff and as soon as that money ran out, everything stopped. And then what happens is in the municipal world \u2013 I mean, our strategy has always been in municipal in U.S. is a break and fix world. It\u2019s not \u2013 they\u2019ve never priced to the point where they do what we would call state-of-the-art kind of investment and maintenance. They just don\u2019t price water that way in the U.S. So what they do is when things break they fix it. And so it\u2019s a break and fix world and they can only put that off for so long. So that\u2019s what we believe is \u2013 they pulled ahead of a bunch of stuff when the U.S. government was paying and then it stopped, and now they can\u2019t put it off any more.","Mike Wherley \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks a lot guys.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair. Your line is now open.","Randy Hogan","Hey, Brian.","Brian Drab \u2013 William Blair","Good morning. I just have one question at this point. On the Ag space, can you talk a little bit more about that business? And Randy said you\u2019re gaining share there at 13% growth. What\u2019s that market then growing and as secondary question, are you seeing any pressure on that business given some of the restrictions around irrigation given the drought?","Randy Hogan","The answer to the second question is yes. In certain areas of the Midwest, which are big irrigation areas, there are some restrictions, which haven\u2019t read through to our order rate yet, but could do. Although it could favor more wells, well pumps as opposed to surface water pumps. The reason we think the business is up maybe around 10, so up around 13.","We think the share gain \u2013 we know that we have added distributors and we\u2019re up a lot with those distributors in some areas in the Midwest where we\u2019re frankly under penetrated and under covered in the Midwest and Texas. We\u2019ve also raised our service levels in California so we know our order rate there is very good. So those are the sources of why we feel good about the share gain because we can see it in different regions where we\u2019ve had lower market share.","Brian Drab \u2013 William Blair","Okay. And roughly what is the revenue in that business quarterly at this point?","John Stauch","It represents about 5% to 6% of our overall Pentair revenues.","Brian Drab \u2013 William Blair","Of total company rev.","John Stauch","Correct.","Brian Drab \u2013 William Blair","Okay. All right. Thank you.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","Good morning.","John Stauch","Hey, Scott.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","Just wanted to see if you would share with us kind of the same type of analysis that you just did on muni with respect to resi. Maybe kind of how orders progress during the quarter? What are you seeing out there because there is a lot of distribution out there? What are your distributors telling you? Resi looks like it\u2019s picking up in some of the macro data, but is it starting to pick up in your business as well?","John Stauch","As I mentioned earlier, Scott, I will break into the three components and think of this as roughly a third, a third, a third. You know, a third being our water purification business, which is seeing definitely a pickup in orders and shipments in North American residential. And I would put that more in the mid- to high single-digit range.","Pool as we mentioned earlier experienced double-digit for the first half and eight in the Q2 and we have it in sort of the 5% to 7% range for the rest of the year. Now that is a season that starts to dwindle off here, so it\u2019s not really an indicator.","And then we are experiencing this headwind in the flood side of residential flow, but if you take the pump business that goes into well, which benefits from the drought season, again, we are seeing an uptick in the orders somewhere in that 5% to 7% range. So definitely movement in residential, certainly a long way from the top, but starting to feel like we are seeing some recovery.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","True. And I probably should have been more specific on that. The water purification business is certainly the one that\u2019s certainly most intriguing. That is a little bit of a higher margin business for you as well, is that correct than some of your other businesses in water?","John Stauch","Correct.","Randy Hogan","Correct.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. Very good. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you.","John Stauch","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","(Operator Instructions).","Randy Hogan","Go ahead.","Operator","(Operator Instructions).","Jim Lucas","Any questions left, operator?","Operator","Yes, we do have a few more questions.","Jim Lucas","Okay, Katie.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Randy Hogan","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Hey. Wanted to look at reuse from a high level, a couple years ago you talked about the Twins stadium installation as a reference site. We\u2019re hearing about a lot of new regulations in fracking, you mentioned industrial reuse. Can you comment on the market opportunity you see there and the traction that you\u2019re seeing?","Randy Hogan","Yeah. I mean, we are very small in fracking, but we have had a win there in terms of pumps and treatment. We are working on gaining better access to that market because we do have technology. The big opportunities we see are where we are strong in food and beverage. Where we can get \u2013 we can reduce there \u2013 that\u2019s one of the exciting parts of dairy is to actually reduce their water use.","And the other one is in the produced water area, again and that\u2019s regarding fracking when this stuff comes back up, it\u2019s taking that water and cleaning it and reusing it. That\u2019s a very promising area for us.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Great. Thank you.","Randy Hogan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Rose from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked. I do have a follow-up on CPT. Just trying to get a better idea of sort of the pricing discipline and overall discipline when you put in CPT and what we can expect for margin improvement in 2013, given that you have a lot of system orders in place, you start to benefit from the consumable side at some point. Do we see any benefit in pricing discipline to some of the actions you\u2019ve taken at Lean? And then three, any benefit from consumable sales in 2013 or \u201814? And as a corollary to all of this, is there any distraction from Tyco\u2019s merger as it relates to the integration process with CPT.","Randy Hogan","Let me start with that one, because I didn\u2019t put this in the script. But I\u2019m very proud of how well the Pentair team has stayed focused on execution, while all of this other work is going on in terms of the Tyco integration. It\u2019s very impressive and I thank everybody at Pentair for the great job they have done with that.","There will be a time when there is going to be more. Right now we don\u2019t have a lot of discussions going on for legal reasons between go-to-market sides of the Tyco and the Pentair, because that has to wait until proper regulatory approvals. So there will be a time when there is going to be more of that and we are very watchful to make sure we don\u2019t take our eye either off the Tyco core business or the Pentair core business. That\u2019s why, as John said, that\u2019s why our focus is on firming up our core.","In terms of CPT, we have instituted different pricing mechanisms in pricing. There was an approach to basically make money on the membrane and sell the system at cost and just make the money on the membrane. We don\u2019t take that approach. We want to make money on the systems too and so we winning with better pricing, so that\u2019s going to read through as we ship those.","And in terms of productivity, some of the restructuring we did actually is related to CPT as we\u2019ve gotten to the point where Lean is having an impact. We either fill the factories with additional business or we take costs out, so some of the repositioning is actually related to CPT, so we can get some of the benefits from Lean to actually go to the bottom-line. I don\u2019t know John if you want to...","John Stauch","Yeah. I would just add. I mean, to answer your question, I think of it is 200 to 250 basis points a year for the next couple of years, and that\u2019s both from the integration of the back office, the pricing disciplines that Randy mentioned, the better positioning of products into industrial versus muni. And then just a lot of the Lean activities that are really starting to read out and as they embrace it.","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Okay. Thanks. And then lastly, can you provide us with the backlog figure for CPT? You did I think in the last quarter.","Randy Hogan","I don\u2019t have that right here.","John Stauch","I don\u2019t have it with me either.","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Okay. Well, I can follow-up afterwards.","John Stauch","I will follow up with you off-line.","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Okay. Thank you both.","Randy Hogan","Thank you.","Operator","We have no further questions in queue. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the presenters.","Randy Hogan","All right. Thank you very much.

With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer.","On today's call, we will provide details on our fourth quarter and full year 2013 performance, as well as our first quarter and full year 2014 outlook as outlined in this morning's release.","Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-K and 10-Q, and today's release.","Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results.","Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. All references today will be on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated, for which the non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the Appendix of the presentation.","We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randall J. Hogan","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. 2013 was very good for Pentair and its shareholders. We had a successful year 1 of integration, delivering 4% organic sales growth, 19% adjusted operating income growth, 170 basis points of margin expansion, adjusted 26% EPS growth and record free cash flow of $751 million.","We feel we've clearly demonstrated the power of the Pentair Integrated Management System in delivering these results and we now look forward to year 2 of the new Pentair.","Before I go through the results in detail, as has been our practice since the Flow Control merger, I want to note that we again will be discussing our operating results on an adjusted basis to better address the core operating performance of our businesses and will be referring to 2012 on a pro forma adjusted basis to provide a more accurate apples-to-apples comparison that includes Flow Control in the results.","With that, let's turn to our fourth quarter performance on Slide 4. The fourth quarter was great, organic sales grew 11%, adjusted operating income was up 50%, operating margins expanded 350 basis points to 13% and EPS grew over 60%. We saw growth in 4 of our 5 verticals, with the exception being infrastructure, which is seeing continued headwinds in Australia. While we will discuss each of the segments in more detail, the bottom line is we ended 2013 on a very positive note and feel we're entering the new year in a stronger position than we have seen in the past several quarters, if not years.","We completed just over $1 billion in share repurchases since the merger. And as we indicated last month, the board has authorized a new $1 billion repurchase program, since our current authorization has only $150 million remaining on it. We continue to build momentum with more positive outlook for the top line and expect to see strong drop-through on sales growth in addition to the productivity and synergies we've delivered and expect to continue to deliver.","Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a performance review of our largest segment, Water & Fluid Solutions. Water & Fluid Solutions had organic sales growth of 8% and we've delivered double-digit growth if not for the ongoing headwinds in Australia. We expect tough comps in Australia to persist through the first half of 2014, as there was 1 nonrecurring project that shipped in the first half of 2013. But we continue to rightsize the cost structure, positioning this business for better times.","During the fourth quarter, Water & Fluid Solutions sales in the Residential & Commercial vertical grew 9% and Food & Beverage was up 16%. Within Residential & Commercial, our North American Pool business ended 2013 with its third consecutive year of double-digit growth and it's finally started to get help from North American new pool construction and topped with the continued adoption of energy-efficient products.","Our Residential Filtration business not only saw a continued growth in North America, but Europe returned to positive growth in the quarter. This is an encouraging sign as European Residential Filtration is one of the more profitable businesses in Water & Fluid Solutions.","Within the Food & Beverage vertical, we saw a strong finish to the year in beverage systems, particularly with the continued adoption of our Beer Membrane Filtration systems by breweries around the globe. Food Service had a very good year, as we saw growth in serving our large install base in addition to adding new customers and global expansion. Agriculture grew 8% in the quarter and was up double digits for the third consecutive year.","The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Water & Fluid Solutions operating profits and margins. Adjusted operating income grew 28% and operating margins expanded 190 basis points to 11.3%. This was shy of our forecast as mix was not as favorable as it has been in prior quarters.","In summary, Water & Fluid Solutions ended 2013 on a positive note, with robust top line growth, strong operating margin expansion and solid overall performance despite a few tough headwinds.","Now let's turn to Slide 6 for a review of our Valves & Controls segment performance. The fourth quarter performance in Valves & Controls was its best of the year, with sales up 20% organically, orders up 11% year-over-year, while backlog declined sequentially. In the quarter, we shipped the majority of a 0-margin project that was booked prior to the merger closing. There's still a small amount of this no-margin business scheduled to ship in the first half of 2014.","Excluding that no-margin business, sales in the quarter were up 13%. Valves & Controls oil and gas and power businesses were both in excess of 20%, process grew 15% and mining was down modestly as this particular piece of the energy vertical faced difficult comps and a lack of new orders.","As we continue to build focus on the install base, we saw the MRO business grow 15% and experienced mid single-digit growth in services.","The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Valves & Controls operating profits and margins. Adjusted operating income nearly doubled in the quarter and margins expanded 450 basis points to 12.2%. If we've not shipped the 0-margin project in the quarter, the operating margins would have been at 13% as we've forecast. Margin improvement was helped in large part by the implementation of PIMS and strong execution during year 1 of the integration. The adoption of PIMS is spread throughout Valves & Controls, which is also evidenced by a 60% reduction in past due shipments.","In summary, Valves & Controls made great progress in 2013. While the quarter-on-quarter growth rate shows some variability, the top line grew 5% for the year and operating margins expanded 250 basis points to 12.3%. It's very nice progress.","Now let's move to Slide 7 for a look at the orders and backlog for Valves & Controls.","As you can see on Slide 7, the Valves & Controls backlog is broken down in 4 key industries, 3 of which fall into our energy vertical: oil and gas; power and mining; and 1 in our industrial vertical, which is the process business. Backlog did show a modest decrease and ended the year just under $1.4 billion. Within the energy vertical, oil and gas and power showed robust orders growth, while the smaller mining business saw further declines in orders. Industrial process saw modest order growth in the quarter, as strength in North America was offset by continued weakness in Europe. We expect oil and gas global capital expenditures to be up in 2014 and key EPCs tell us they're more optimistic for projects in 2014, particularly LNG and North American pipelines. We expect power capital expenditures to be down in the U.S. and Europe, but we're seeing return of activity in fast-growth regions, including solid fourth quarter orders growth in China.","Now let's move to Slide 8 for a review of Technical Solutions.","Technical Solutions delivered fourth quarter sales growth of 6%, which represented the first year-over-year sales growth for the segment since the first quarter of 2012. North America was up mid single digits, while Europe was up double digits in both our Thermal Management and Equipment Protection businesses.","The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Technical Solutions operating profits and margins. Technical Solutions delivered adjusted operating income growth of nearly 30% and operating margins expanded an impressive 380 basis points to 22%, which represents a record performance for the segment. Both Thermal Management and Equipment Protection businesses delivered operating margins north of 20%, which reflects strong adoption of PIMS within Thermal Management and strong contribution margins within Equipment Protection.","Let's now turn to Slide 9 for a look at our full year results. For 2013, we have strong financial results across the board. For the full year, organic growth of 4% was encouraging given the absence of large project activity in a few of our businesses and an expected second half industrial recovery that did not fully materialize. Our adjusted operating income grew nearly 20% and our operating margins expanded 170 basis points to 12.6%, with 2 of our 3 segments expanding margins 200 basis points or better.","Our adjusted EPS grew 26% and we generated record free cash flow of $751 million or 115% of net income. From a strategic standpoint, we're very pleased with the first year of integration in the building of our one Pentair culture. Many of the headwinds that we experienced in the first half of 2013 have dissipated and we're entering 2014 with encouraging signs for more consistency and top line growth while continuing to expect to deliver on productivity and synergies, positioning ourselves for another year of EPS growth in excess of 20%.","Let's now turn to Slide 10 for a closer look at the total Pentair growth profile. The fourth quarter showed great top line performance as 4 of our 5 verticals delivered strong sales growth. Both Energy and Food & Beverage were up mid teens, with Industrial and Residential & Commercial grew almost 10% in the quarter. Infrastructure was the only vertical that posted a decline, as ongoing strength in North America break and fix pump business and recovering equipment protections European electronics business were offset by tough conditions in Australia.","As has been the case throughout 2013, North America benefited from the ongoing residential recovery and the beginning of commercial and municipal recoveries. Canada continues to be slow with energy project delays, but we have not seen any cancellations. Western Europe was a bright spot in the fourth quarter with strong double-digit growth. This marked the third consecutive quarter of growth for us in Western Europe. While we remain cautious about this growth rate, the good news is that Europe does appear to have cleared the bottom. We saw improvements in our profitable European residential business. And as we mentioned previously, Equipment Protection has seen a recovery with its electronics customers.","Fast-growth regions ended the year on a positive note, with very strong double-digit growth in the fourth quarter following what has been mixed results in the first 3 quarters of 2013. The Middle East and Africa led the way, with China also showing healthy growth. We have made strategic investments in the Middle East and Africa and we believe we will continue to see strong growth in those 2 regions.","Latin America, excluding Brazil, also saw growth.","Looking in our 5 verticals, we expect continued growth in 2014 in the 4 verticals that have been growing. We expect infrastructure to be flat in 2014 as the rate of decline continues to moderate following a near double-digit decline in 2013. Energy ended 2013 on a positive note. Oil and gas investments continue to grow around the globe and our fourth quarter orders, particularly in Valves & Controls, offer us confidence to expect low to mid single-digit growth within energy in 2014.","Industrial also had a strong finish to 2013 and the recovery we saw in the fourth quarter in our key North American electrical distribution channel is encouraging entering 2014.","We're also encouraged by the ongoing strength in quoting activity with North American process customers. Residential & Commercial is expected to remain a bright spot, led by North American residential. In addition to the strong growth we've seen in China residential the past 2 quarters, the stabilization of European residential is a positive sign and commercial is also seeing signs of improvement.","We've discussed our mixed views on infrastructure earlier in this call and while Australia will have tough comps in the first half of 2014, our other infrastructure businesses are expected to continue to grow.","Finally, Food & Beverage is expected to remain a great story for Pentair. After 3 straight years of double-digit gains in agriculture, we still expect some growth in spite of a slowdown in the U.S. Within Food Service, we believe we are well positioned with key customers that are expanding globally and we continue to serve our growing install base.","Beverage systems have a healthy order book as we continue to see growth in beer and global dairy.","Now please turn to Slide 11, labeled Summary. Before turning the call over to John to review our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2014, I wanted to offer a summary of why we are optimistic about Pentair's long-term prospects. Our strong performance in 2013 and successful first year of the new Pentair reinforces our strategy to put these 2 businesses together and is a testament to our ability to execute. With our 2 largest verticals, energy and industrial, appearing to have turned the corner, coupled with continued strength expected in Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage, we're feeling better about our ability to deliver a more consistent top line growth in 2014. We have action plans in place to drive additional productivity goals in 2014 and our targeted top line is expected to yield strong drop-through to the bottom line. We remain committed to our goal of delivering $5 in EPS in 2015 while positioning Pentair to be the next great industrial company.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John?","John L. Stauch","Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide #12, titled Q4 2013 Reported to Adjusted. As you would expect after a large merger of this size, we still had a few nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter that we wanted to provide some additional clarity around so you can better understand our adjusted operating performance.","Restructuring in the fourth quarter totaled $62 million or $0.24 in EPS. The majority of the restructuring related to the elimination of the COO role and the combining of the GBUs that we recently announced. In addition, we also took steps to reduce our operating capacity, primarily in Europe, as well as look at our global G&A support coverage and reduce as necessary, especially in the areas of IT, finance and regional support.","We also incurred $5 million or roughly $0.02 of EPS related to our proposed redomicile to Ireland. This included legal fees as well as one-time costs related to SEC filings. We also took the opportunity to further advance our global branding initiatives and we had $11 million non-cash brand impairment or $0.04 in EPS related to a brand reduction in our cooling business in Technical Solutions that we will no longer use.","The other big adjustment at year end related to our move last year to a more preferable method of accounting for pension and postretirement benefits. We recognized a $63 million gain or $0.24 in EPS that related to a once-a-year mark-to-market adjustment. As a reminder, this is the annual adjustment that will come in the fourth quarter of every year related to the movement of discount rates.","Finally, we had a small gain on a sale of business and a few adjustments to tax as we trued up the books at year end.","Please turn to Slide #13, labeled Segment Dictionary. As we discussed in our investor event in Houston this last November, we have realigned our business from 7 GBUs to 5 GBUs. As a result, we will now be reporting in 4 reporting segments. Our Technical Solutions and Valves & Controls segments remain the same and will be both GBUs and reporting segments, but we'll now break out Water & Fluid Solutions in the 2 segments, Flow Technologies and Process Technologies. As a reminder, Flow Technologies combines our legacy flow business with our Australian water business and is both our new Flow Technologies GBU and reporting segment. The Process Technology segment is represented by our Filtration & Process and Aquatic Systems businesses. Our presentation includes a table in the appendix providing the new 4 reporting segments for each of the 4 quarters in 2013 to help with your models.","We will now be updating our history for these reporting segments in the next several months and expect to get you 2012 adjusted pro forma results for these reporting segments, as well as key information such as verticals, geographical sales and channels by our Q1 2014 earnings release. We appreciate your patience.","Please turn to Slide #14, labeled Q1 2014 Pentair Outlook. For the first quarter of 2014, we expect sales to be flat to up 2% to approximately $1.8 billion. Valves & Controls is anticipated to be flat to up modestly, as the first quarter is a seasonally slow period for the business and we are following record shipments in Q4, as well as the significant reduction in past due orders. Process Technologies is expected to grow 5% to 7% on continued strength in Filtration and in the North American Pool channel. Flow Technologies is expected to be down approximately 10%, mostly due to a tough comp in Australia due to FX and larger project headwinds. Finally, Technical Solutions is expected to grow modestly, again related to seasonality in the business related to global weather trends and also reflecting an improving North American industrial outlook.","We are expecting adjusted operating income to grow nearly 15% and adjusted operating margins to expand 140 basis points to approximately 11.5%. Free cash flow is historically a usage in the first quarter, inline with what we have seen in the past. We're expecting the tax rate to be roughly 23.5%, net interest of approximately $17.5 million, and the share count to be around 200 million shares.","Please turn to Slide #15, labeled Integration and Standardization Update. This slide has become standard work and it briefly brings you up to speed on our synergies by quarter and our forecasted synergies for the full year 2014. We ended our first year delivering $130 million of synergies, which was well ahead of our original forecast of $90 million. The adoption of PIMS has led to better-than-expected results with Lean and we continue to build the funnels in both Lean and sourcing that give us confidence in our goal to deliver once again in 2014.","We exited 2013 in a $208 million annual run rate or nearly 70% of our $310 million synergy target. As a reminder, 2014 includes $20 million of operating model transformation, or OMT investments in Valves & Controls, that will drive operating income savings and an overall tax benefit due to the optimization of the global GBU structure.","Please turn to Slide 16, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. 2013 was a good free cash flow year for Pentair. For the full year 2013, we generated $751 million of free cash flow or 115% of net income. We made some progress on the working capital front with the legacy Flow Control businesses, particularly with inventory past dues in Valves & Controls. There are still plenty of room for improvement and we expect to do better in 2014.","Ending debt was just under $2.6 billion or $2.4 billion on a net debt basis, inclusive of global cash on hand. In 2013, we returned over $900 million to share owners in the form of dividends and share repurchases. At the end of the year, we have approximately $150 million left under our initial $1.2 billion share buyback authorization. As a reminder, the board approved a new $1 billion authorization in December for further share buybacks.","Please turn to my final slide, Slide #17, labeled Full Year 2014 Pentair Outlook. We are reiterating our full year guidance of $3.85 to $4 on approximately $7.7 billion in sales. Overall, revenue is expected to grow 3% to 5%. Valves & Controls is expected to grow 2% to 3%, as healthy backlogs in oil and gas and short cycle MRO business, along with expanding backlogs in industrial, helped to offset continued expected headwinds in mining.","Power is better positioned, but we'd like to see orders turn into shipments before turning more optimistic. Process Technologies is expected to grow 5% to 7%, with continued strength in Aquatics, Beverage Systems, energy and an improving Residential & Commercial filtration business. Flow Technologies is anticipated to be down 1% to 3%, related principally to tough comps in Australia in the first half of the year related to FX and the lack of project activity in that business.","Technical Solutions is expected to grow 3% to 5% as we are seeing further signs of the North American electrical distribution business improving and easier comps for our Thermal Management business.","We do not expect much in the way of mega project activity in 2014. But as we have stated in the past, we will update accordingly at the appropriate time if any mega projects entered the backlog.","Adjusted operating income is expected to expand to approximately $1.1 billion or 16% year-over-year increase. This does include $20 million of OMT investment, which is an important component of reducing the overall complexity of our Valves & Controls business and lower G&A while also contributing to long-term improvement in the overall tax rate of the Pentair enterprise. Excluding this investment, adjusted operating income growth will be close to 18% or in line with the 18% to 19% annual expectations we laid out during our announcement of the merger.","Overall adjusted operating margins is expected to expand 150 basis points to 14.1%, which will mark a record performance for Pentair. We expect all 4 segments to contribute margin expansion of at least 100 basis points in 2014. Overall corporate costs are expected to be down slightly due to lower corporate integration costs.","For the full year, we expect the tax rate to be around 23.5%, net interest expense to approximate $70 million and share count to be around 198.5 million, which is inclusive of our recently announced incremental share buyback program. We expect EPS to expand around 23% to $3.93, at the midpoint of the guidance range. We're expecting another strong free cash flow year of at least $850 million of free cash flow or greater than 105% of net income.","Melissa, can you please open the lines for questions? Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura Securities.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So you mentioned the pickup in North American industrial in the fourth quarter as being pretty encouraging. I mean, can you give a little more color where you saw that across the businesses and how you view the sustainability?","Randall J. Hogan","Well, the most important -- in North America, the most important business serving that market is our Hoffman-branded equipment protection business, which is the enclosure franchise in the North American electrical distribution industry. And we saw some good pickups there. And that -- they usually -- those are investments that usually come later in a project cycle. And it's a short-cycled business but sort of a long wave order pattern. So it's been dragging -- it's been lagging the ISM for a while and now we're beginning to see the pickups. So we would view it, even though it is short-cycled business, we would view that as a very encouraging sign. And as I mentioned, going into 2014, that we saw inventories being built by the channel.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful, unless John has anything to add, but that helps. On the Valves & Controls orders, I mean, they were -- I know you were shipping some past dues and you had the 0-margin backlog. But the orders, up 11%, were pretty strong. What's the timing like in terms of when you expect those to ship? And how do you feel about the margin in that backlog versus some of the stuff you're getting rid off?","Randall J. Hogan","Let me start with the second. We've put in place, we believe, better disciplines around the as-bid margins going out, so we feel good about the orders we're taking. In fact, we've passed on some orders because of the margins required. So we think that discipline has remained intact through that 11% growth. One of the reasons Valves & Controls in the first quarter, we don't expect a lot of growth, is those orders are really loading into the second half of 2014 and even a few into 2015. Which is, they're not huge projects but they're bigger projects, so they take a little bit longer time. What we call and I mentioned in the script, 15% growth in MRO, MRO is basically standard Valves & Controls that ship out of stock or with only minor modifications. And that was up 15%. That's the kind of stuff that we can book and turn in a 90-day kind of a window and that was up as well. But the 11% was really -- overall, was really driven by a lot of oil and gas that's going to ship later in the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John (sic) [Josh] Pokrzywinski of MKM Partners.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","So just on the 0-margin backlog first, I guess, are we done with that at this point? Or are there any lingering surprises that can still bleed out into 2014?","John L. Stauch","Two questions, but we think we're down with it. The project that we shipped in Q4 has a small remainder left in Q1, but it's very small. So we don't think we'll mention it as we ship in Q1. And to Randy's question -- or Randy's comments, I mean, we look at the margin and backlog, this was the only one of its type and we scrubbed that backlog prior to closing. And as Randy mentioned, this was an order book prior to the merger completed. So as of this type, we don't think there's any more in the backlog.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the reclass here, with the extra segment coming in. Should we think about that as starting to go align some of these businesses to the extent that you may want to get out of a few? I know you've talked about some non-core divestitures in the past. Are we looking at this as maybe an opportunity to bring that a little bit forward? Or is there anything beyond the just trying to get more detail on Australia.","Randall J. Hogan","Well, no. This isn't about Australia at all. I mean, this is about the continuing to build Pentair, we've made great leaps forward. We wanted to get into larger, manageable businesses, with the retirement of Mike Schrock, now those presidents report directly to me. So it's a matter of getting larger, if you will, fighting units in the officer suite and so that we can, one, optimize cost structure; but, two, really flow resources from our best -- our best resources to our best opportunities. So it has nothing to do with anything about divestitures or acquisitions.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then if I can just sneak in 1 last one. Just on the margin guidance by segment, obviously, the implied incrementals across the board vary a lot depending on what synergy you have baked in there. Flow especially has a pretty healthy uptick in margins with the well revenue and I understand the mix is an issue as well. Could you just maybe parse out what segments have more or less synergy capture in them? And to the extent that you have some numbers that you'd like to share, that would be helpful as well.","John L. Stauch","Yes. I think absent the headwind that we'll experience in Flow Technologies because of the Australian project and foreign exchange in Q1, what we're going to see is a nice, healthy roll forward of the Q4 synergies coming into Q1. If you recall last year, we roughly had about $10 million of synergies. We're exiting the year at a much higher rate, so we've gotten a really nice year-over-year carryforward from those synergies, primarily around the sourcing and the Lean savings, which are going to be more skewed to the businesses that were in the Flow Controls side, Josh.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I just want to take a very quick walk down the various moving parts for the first quarter profit guide. I guess, core volume, your sales are kind of 0 to 2. I don't really think that, that should be that big of a factor in your guide. Is price and inflation, are they -- is that still a negative? I think it was a negative this quarter. Is that still like a $15 million negative-ish price versus inflation?","John L. Stauch","Well, I mean, we still see modest inflation somewhere between 160 and 180 basis points. And we get good price on the install base and the distribution side of the business, which is roughly half of our business. And obviously, on the project side, there's not really a way to externally measure the price, but we're trying to make sure that we're getting the right bid rates to offset expected inflation that could build throughout the year.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. So the first quarter, is it negative? It's a -- say it's a negative in the first quarter, is what you're saying?","John L. Stauch","Slight negative, a little bit better.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So then we're basically left with productivity and synergies, that kind of combined bucket. And you talked about the synergies being a pretty nice year-over-year compare. I mean, even at just a $52 million run rate, you've got $40 million kind of a loan locked-in, if you do make a little bit of progress. I mean, you should have a very nice number there. You did $80 million in the combined productivity and synergies in the fourth quarter year-over-year. Is there a lot of OMT coming in the first quarter? I'm just kind of -- it just seems like this productivity synergy number is significantly lower than where it was year-over-year in the fourth quarter.","John L. Stauch","Yes, I mean, I think you're doing the math right. We do have about $6.5 million to $7 million of OMT investment in Q1. We have started that project. It's ramping up. And that's the business process, reengineering of the overall enterprise at Valves & Controls, so that's a pretty healthy investment number. And then what we also see in Q1 is stock comp true-ups and things of nature, which goes into the FICA and expenses, that become a little heavier in Q1 than they are throughout the rest of the year.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Is that a year-over-year impact? What's the year-over-year impact of that?","John L. Stauch","That's not as much of a year-over-year as it is versus a Q4 impact.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I mean basically, productivity and synergies alone this quarter drove a $0.30 year-over-year V, I don't really see a ton other than maybe stock comp to impact that, I mean, that gets you significantly higher than where you're guiding to for the first quarter on EPS.","John L. Stauch","Yes. And the only thing you're missing in that, Steve, is that we do get a different set of mix. Right? Because our Aquatic Systems business is going to be much stronger in the seasonal pieces of that. So there's an early buy -- sell-through in Q4. And then you're also going to see a thermal downtick from the cold kind of winter stocking months coming into Q1. So those are seasonably lower.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So those are what impact productivity is what you're saying, year-over-year?","Randall J. Hogan","It's a mixed impact.","John L. Stauch","A slight mixed impact year-over-year, correct.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, still seems reasonably conservative. Just one other question. What -- how do we think about normal seasonality in the core technical business, fourth quarter to first quarter? And then how bad is thermal going to be, fourth quarter to first quarter? Again, it just seems like Technical Solutions being down as much fourth quarter to first quarter, 450 to kind of 410, it seems like it's a more significant kind of seasonal fall off. Maybe that's just a new seasonality of thermal.","John L. Stauch","Yes. The seasonality there will be almost entirely Thermal for the drop-off.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So how much do you think thermal is going to be down quarter-over-quarter?","John L. Stauch","Roughly $40 million to $50 million of revenue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","One of the growth drivers for 2014 and hopefully beyond is going to be the impact of the uptick in resi and how that translates into pool, both new pool construction. And then -- so I was hoping you'd put some numbers around this. What's the early read? How do you track it? And then, you also comment on the energy savings piece for pool owners as they transition to like the IntelliFlo pump and where are you in that penetration so far?","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, let me start, then I'll turn it over to John. We -- our team in Aquatics has built an incredibly good model, where they track the install base, they track basically the replacement rate of same-same and then they do the upgrades on the energy side and we're going to start with that. Basically, when you take a look at the home install base, I think we're only -- we're still less than 10% penetrated of what we consider to be the install base that is ripe for switching to variable speed and get the energy savings. And that part of the question -- the energy savings can be as much as 90% on the pump. And in the pump, in areas where it's warm, which are -- it was minus 20 at my house this morning, so I have to think conceptually here. Where places that air-conditioning is more expensive than heat, the pool pump is the second largest user of electricity. So it's a huge opportunity, as you know, there's some over 30 utilities now that are rebating conversion to variable speed pump. And we have the leading solution in variable speed pumps. So we're not even 10% penetrated there. So we think that what we call our Eco Select set of products have an incredible future in terms of penetrating that. And now we have new pools construction, new pool construction. I don't have the numbers right at my fingertips, but it's up in California, it's up in Arizona, it's up in Florida. It's flattish in Texas, but Texas never really went down. So I mean -- and those are -- probably more than half of the pools in America are in just those 4 states. So I don't know if you'd add anything, John.","John L. Stauch","Yes, the only thing I'd tell you is that we track the pool permits and they are around about 9% to 10% of the new housing starts in the U.S., single-family housing starts. And we are definitely seeing an increase in pool permits and we're definitely excited about the incremental content and revenue that should be driven from those pool permits in the new construction side. There's a lag, as you know, but ultimately, we feel that's going to be a help to the market upside.","Randall J. Hogan","And one of the other ones, the pumps are also switching from incandescent to LED lights, which saves a lot of power. In fact, that's -- right now, that's a big conversion going on in commercial pools. And as you know, we have a nice position in controls and lighting for commercial pool as well, so it's -- I would say, it's all good in Aquatics.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And was there an impact on the early buy that you typically see in the fourth quarter?","Randall J. Hogan","Well, early buy was strong, which indicated -- and there wasn't anything exceptional about the early buy program. So it is indicative that the pool dealers and the distributors are expecting a good year.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then last one for me and I'll still stay in the pool side, is if you had to gauge for 2014 the new product vitality of Pool, what percent of your revenues would come from products introduced in the last 3 years?","John L. Stauch","Almost 30%, Deane. It's our highest vitality index that we have currently. We're starting to build a nice pipeline in filtration process as well. But pool leads the way with the technology and the innovation. And we're seeing a lot of nice new product content coming through that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So I guess in light of the 11% core growth here, I would've expected more margin coming through, even excluding the 0-margin backlog. And therefore, that mix headwind that you're talking about, I've got to believe it's a bigger deal or there was something else going on in the incrementals kind of x synergies that I'm just not getting here. So maybe where were you surprised, you're excluding that whole 0-margin backlog discussion, was it -- is it all mix, or is there something else going on around the portfolio? Or just a little more color there would be helpful.","John L. Stauch","I think it's a little bit of mix. I do also think that as you complete Q4, you look at distributor-dealer rebates, sales incentives, truing up of incentives related to overdrive for the year end sales. I do also think that there's always, when you have strong performance at the end of the year, things like warranty, E&O, et cetera, seem to become more of a discussion item.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And what gives you confidence, as you're sort of looking at guidance, therefore, in 2014 that your ability to forecast some of those things, I guess, is more maybe higher conviction?","John L. Stauch","It's a great question, it's the blue chip of our operating model right now, which is more predictable and consistent results. As you know, we're getting better in Valves & Controls, but we're still learning. And it really comes around standardization and process understanding. And that's part of what all Lean is about. And so I think we feel better today, but there still are a lot of ways to go from the predictability side. But I do think we understand it better. We know where our top-focused factories are and we've got our arms around how to improve it.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And your biggest surprise positively on the volume front was where? I mean, obviously, there's a lot of positive numbers here but...","Randall J. Hogan","Valves & Controls. Valves & Controls.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes, but within Valves & Controls, which vertical or region was the most?","Randall J. Hogan","Oh, energy, oil and gas.","John L. Stauch","It was energy. Oil and gas and energy.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. All right. Great. And then just finally, so I guess we're looking at a $10 million after-tax cost or something for that redomicile. I assume that's all in. And is it worth it at this point, in terms of what are you getting out of it, how should investors think about it?","John L. Stauch","Yes, it will be a little less than the 10 and we will have a better governance structure in our views. And we also do pick up a little incremental tax benefit on a go-forward basis associated with the opportunity to do things that we'll have in the U.K. versus what we had in Switzerland.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham of Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to go into the restructuring and OMT cost a little bit. If you could maybe just answer 2 questions on the restructuring. That consolidation of -- to pull the presidents closer to you, Randy, could you kind of unbundle the $62 million a little bit? It just seems like a big number to do that. And my follow-up would be, which of the benefits from these expenses or how do the benefits from these expenses sort of accrete you? Which bucket, is it productivity or does it move you -- does it give you assurance on the 320?","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, let me start, then I'm going to turn it over to John with the specifics. What John mentioned, if you will, the delayering and the simplification of the organization as the first one, it's a relatively minor part of the $62 million. And just the leadership pieces is a small part. There was also structure underneath that, which is SG&A that came out, which had really less to do with the, if you will, the change in leadership structure and more to do with our view of what was required. We kept more cost in. We weren't -- we were careful not to break anything we didn't understand. We didn't want to do that in the merger, since this is a merger of equals. And so once we spent 1 year at it, we realized where we could be more efficient. So there was a tranche of that. And then there was a bunch of other pieces in it, too. So John, why don't you go through those pieces in a little more detail.","John L. Stauch","Yes, real quickly, Scott, just to frame it. The $62 million will yield close to $40 million in annualized savings when complete. I mean, obviously, we'll get maybe $30 million or $35 million of that in 2014 and then we'd have that annualized rate going into '15. As Randy mentioned, a lot of it was the structure associated with standardized global process around sourcing, manufacturing, IT, finance support, some regional structure alignment. And then we have a few small factories that were higher cost and some higher difficult -- or higher degree of difficulty areas to get after it and we had an opportunity to downsize a couple of those factors in Europe. And that's remained about half of the charge. And we feel like long term, that's going to position us in '15 and beyond for a much better operating structure. But it is part of the synergies, the 310, that we're going for. But at the same time, I think we feel like that funnel continues to grow and we're really focused on our end operating model and not a number related to a synergy.","Randall J. Hogan","And just to finish it out in the terms of the benefits of the change in structure. Right now, my focus is on building the best winning culture that we can. And to do that, I want to make sure that we have very, very tight alignment up and down the company, from John and I, through the presidents, all the way down. So to have 5 presidents who are now sitting at the table, talking to us directly about the opportunities and to get them to think not just about running Valves & Controls, get them thinking about being an officer within Pentair, thinking about how to optimize Pentair, that's a huge change. And it's a change that is going to be extraordinarily beneficial as we build Pentair to its next crescendo.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough, on the 310, I said 320, I misspoke. But I guess my question would be, if you kind of said the 310 last call and then we have these restructuring charges, this call gives us all of these savings. That's a good chunk of change in savings. Is there a reason why the 310 didn't go up?","John L. Stauch","I think you should feel confident that we have a richer funnel to achieve it. And when we feel confident of flowing through the 310, we will definitely share that with you, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Fair enough, John. On the OMT, is that a productivity bucket or is that a synergy bucket as well?","John L. Stauch","It is long term both the single, biggest driver of the tax rate coming forward because we're creating a global structure around that Switzerland principle. But it's also the business getting off the 29 different disparate ERPs and 29 different processes that are run at 80 sales and distribution centers from, to getting 1 common model that optimizes the product design technology into the manufacture and delivery to the customer. So it's a major re-business engineering, which we think is going to yield value, both in delivery, quality, operations performance and G&A support structure. As I highlighted in Analyst Day, we try to drive about a 4% G&A target per GBU. Most of our GBUs are coming close to that number. We're still about 3.5 to 4 points higher in Valves & Controls. So this OMT is a big driver to getting that efficiency out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple of follow-up questions. So just to understand, on Q4 versus Q1 year-over-year growth comparison, there was no pull back into Q4 from Q1, right? There were no timing issues in oil and gas or anything like that?","Randall J. Hogan","No, not that we're aware of.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just as I think about sort of oil and gas outflow, you sort of stated that you still have not seen any megaprojects and that you will announce them when you see them. Can you give us, though, some color as to where the negotiations are headed, what does the timeline look? Just because the orders were just so strong in Q4 and I just want to understand what happens to this momentum going to the first half of the year? And I know you've said second half, but just what's going to happen in the first half? What are we going to see in terms of orders and revenues?","Randall J. Hogan","Well, just speaking about megaprojects, there are some large things in Canada that are still being looked at and worked on and there are certainly large developments to support oil and gas developments around the world. We just don't ever want to build -- we don't want to build plans counting on those things, that's why we want to be clear about them and we'll talk about them when they happen. We feel good about our position on them. But there are still a lot of other projects that are still big, $10 million, $15 million, they can still be big, but they're not what we would call megaprojects. And we see CapEx -- there were a lot of delays in the oil and gas industry, just deferrals, just things are going slower. And we saw a pick up in the fourth quarter, and we hope it's the beginning of what's going to be a sustained pick up, to yield probably an oil and gas spend in the mid 5-ish percent kind of range growth in 2014. We also saw some large power plant orders finally get placed that we've been working on for a year, over a year in China related to their new development program. And so that's -- that also helped.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But it sounds like you don't have push-outs and delays you have seen last year, you just don't want to commit to anything this early, is that fair?","Randall J. Hogan","On megaprojects, yes. That's fair.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just a follow-up, let me try to sneak one in. This earnings season has been very interesting in the sense that some companies, you're sort of not seeing a lot of evidence of a pick up. You guys are a lot more positive. Whether you guys generally come out on the pace of the global economic recovery and economic recovery in the U.S., what's your take?","Randall J. Hogan","Well, I think the U.S. -- I mean, we all would like to see the U.S., overall, we love to see GNP get up over 3%. And I think, I'm not an economist, but I think it's got a better shot at that because we're starting to see industrial come along and residential seems to be solid. And there's a lot of things positively moving in the U.S. The brightest change is -- I don't go to Davos, but coming out of Davos, it's pretty clear that people are feeling like Europe really has, I call it, clearing the bottom. Europe seems to have some mode of force going forward and that's a big deal to us. As I mentioned, it's one of our most profitable residential markets and it's also a great thermal market and we have a lot of operations there. So and our focus has been on where we can drive growth. I'm really pleased with our progress in Africa and the Middle East. And a lot of that is the initiatives that we're taking. So I think that, that will continue. And so I think we are more positive. I can't speak for why others aren't.","Operator","Your next question comes the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just as you split these process and flow segments, can you just talk about where -- what you think the long-term margin opportunities are in each of those businesses? I mean, Flow certainly seems like a pretty notable laggard as we look at it today.","John L. Stauch","Yes, I think Flow has opportunity on both sides, both the Australia and water business, which right now were in historically low revenue levels. That business has been mid 15%-ish margins when it gets to normalized shipping rates, it is pretty profitable when it gets to those levels, as an example. And then we still have opportunity as we build the infrastructure side and the engineered components of Flow Technologies, which is more mid-teens types of margins. So I think as both of those grow, you can see some significant ROS opportunity in Flow Technologies. When you look at Process Technologies, obviously, we've got a super high-performing Aquatics business and we've got a really high-growth Process Technologies filtration process business, which is starting to be gaining momentum. And we're starting to really see the benefit and power of Lean and sourcing activities driving that margin upward. So I, right now, always look at where we are opportunity-wise versus where we're sitting. And both of the businesses have significant opportunity to move forward.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just your qualitative commentary on industrial and some of the momentum just doesn't seem to point to 1% to 3% growth. So are there some headwinds we're not talking about? Or is that maybe clearly a source of upside as we move through the year and see this visibility continue?","John L. Stauch","As a vertical market for industrial, we grew nearly 10% in Q4, 9%. It is the only time this year we grew in industrial, globally. Right? So we had the easier comparison year-over-year. That pie makes up half of it. And then we saw about a mid-single-digit on a more normalized basis. So as we head to this year, we're cautiously optimistic that we're finally going to see the capital spending and the investments and the productivity that we thought would happen last year, Jeff. That's the way we're looking at it. So we're hoping to earn what we're forecasting. But I think right now, it feels appropriate.","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, just 1 quarter doesn't feel like a trend to us is basically, I guess, what the short answer would be. I'd rather plan a conservative and beat it than plan an aggressive and miss it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just following up on a previous question about incremental margins, I know it was asked in Valves. The incremental margins in the fourth quarter on organic growth, so x the synergies and other stuff in there, was also pretty soft. And Randy, again, you talked about strong drop-through in 2014. Can you talk about maybe what held those incrementals down in the fourth quarter and what gives you confidence that it will improve in 2014?","Randall J. Hogan","I'll just say one thing. We talked a little bit earlier, when the growth to price is -- we had to true-up our sales incentives, our distribution incentives and some of our other reserves because we haven't been accruing at that rate because we didn't expect it. So part of that is just truing-up some things that were more than the quarter. But John, do you want to add anything to that?","John L. Stauch","Yes, I just want to say that I think there's 2 ways to look at it. I mean, one is if you take a look at the drop-through year-over-year on the incremental revenue, from 2012 to '13, I still think you're in the mid-40s of the conversion rate. When you take a look at it as the incremental versus forecast, you're going to see a little less of a drop-through. And some of that might be our conservatism on the way that we expected what the revenue should be and more confident on the income side. And then as Randy mentioned, we had some true-ups that we had to do on the incentive side.","Randall J. Hogan","We also in the Food & Beverage space, we shipped more systems than products. And the systems have lower margins. So there was, within the Process -- what we call the Process Technologies, or in the first quarters of Water & Fluid, there was some mix going against us there. But we still like those systems.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Speaking about Food & Beverage, obviously been an area of real strength for you guys over the last year or 2, forecasting the growth rate to go down. Have we seen kind of the peak through the pipe on there? Is this 5% to 7% kind of what you would think of as a long-term growth rate for you guys in that area?","Randall J. Hogan","Yes. That's what we believe is maybe long term, could be more in the 6% to 8%, but 5% to 7% is close enough. We have double-digit growth. We had a lot of shipments in the membrane, the Beer Membrane Filtration business, the coal block. We had a lot of shipments this year. I don't know, if you go back and you look at 2012, we had a bunch of projects that we had won that just were delayed. We got what we thought we get in '13 and some of the things that got delayed from '12, we got those shipped. But still very positive trends in that industry. So we think it's -- high single-digits is a reasonable expectation for Food & Beverage. 2 things are happening. In the developed world, some of our newer technologies really offer opportunities for more sustainable food production, more energy-efficient food production, more environmentally-friendly food production. So we think we play into the capital spending in the developed world, which doesn't really need to pass Food & Beverage. And then of course, as we look at the middle class and building out the food manufacturing capability in dairy, in soft drinks and beer, that's why we're active in Africa, that's why we're active in Southeast Asia, these are places that all of these need to be built out. So and we believe we're -- we have great technology and great teams to do it.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. If I could just sneak one in on the balance sheet. Can you talk about where you are in terms of working capital in Valves & Controls and where you would target to get to and kind of what level of capital that still is to free up?","John L. Stauch","Right now, we're still sub-3 in a working capital returns basis in Valves & Controls. I mean, we believe we can be at least 5. As a company, we used to be closer to 6. So there's opportunity there and certainly, a key focus in 2014 and '15 is unlocking that cash value.","Randall J. Hogan","Well, the -- and the OMT project is a big piece of that. John mentioned, it's going to help our efficiency, it's going to help us be one Valves & Controls player to the customer. It's going to give us a huge benefit in terms of managing our inventories, our receivables, our payables, much, much more effectively.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And if you did get from sub-3 just to say 5, what would that free up in terms of capital?","Randall J. Hogan","It'd free up enough money for me to buy another company.","John L. Stauch","Your figure of 5 would be 20% of sales. Today, we're well over 33% of sales. So 13% times the revenue basis will give you your mathematical opportunity there.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just following up on the working capital question, I mean, the 105% conversion for this year, are you assuming any progress on those initiatives? Or is it really just kind of the core business and any progress would be incremental?","John L. Stauch","I think that 105% does not yet anticipate substantial or significant working capital progress. I think when you take a look at the net operating profit after tax and you take a look at the amortization plus depreciation minus capital, you'll see there's not a significant improvement in working capital assumed in the 105%.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Then I would assume you would expect to get some of that progress this year.","John L. Stauch","Yes, it's a focus of ours.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And on the 0-margin revenue, can you just tell us how much was recognized in 2013? I think you said it will bleed a small amount into '14, but I'm just curious what the year-over-year would be.","John L. Stauch","There will be another $12 million of shipments to go on that particular project.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And how much did you recognize in total in '13?","John L. Stauch","Roughly $35 million.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","$35 million. Okay. And actually just on the large projects side, so you talked about not incorporating it into the plans. We've seen a couple of -- I think we have 3 large ethane crackers in North America. We've had a large LNG plant authorized at Freeport, a couple of Canadian projects. 1 large Canadian project has been authorized. You talked about lead times for valve orders being between, I think, 12 and 36 months. I mean, these are particularly large projects. Would you -- I know you're not big in NIM, but conceptually, would you anticipate you will start seeing the orders start surfacing from some of these EPC awards?","Randall J. Hogan","Yes. I mean, the valve package usually goes out later in the -- later in those kind of projects. But you can count on us pursuing all those mentioned.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","So '14 will reflect some of that.","Randall J. Hogan","Orders.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","On the orders front, right.","John L. Stauch","There's been some significant analysis on these megaprojects that suggest that the delay time increases based upon how large the project is. There is often also a series of requotes that happen when they don't hit the price points, the target points. So we have to be patient. And as you know, Randy and I are extremely patient people. I think when it starts to unlock, I think maybe they'll be a little longer on the megas as far as the shipment rates or shipment timing. But overall, we should start to see that come through in the tail end of '14, heading aggressively into '15.","Randall J. Hogan","Well, the nice thing about the ones you mentioned, given a lot of them are in the U.S., we do feel some of the complexities around the large projects will be easier to manage on those U.S. -- the ethane crackers, LNG terminals, we like LNG plants.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Do you feel you're more competitively advantaged that these are domestically-based rather than international, or does that not matter too much?","Randall J. Hogan","Well, we have very -- we have global coverage. So we don't feel like we're disadvantaged anywhere in the world. Those applications are ones that we have particularly good quality offerings for.","Operator","And I now turn the call over to Mr. Jim Lucas for closing comments.","James C. Lucas","Thanks.

","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randy Hogan ","Thanks, Jim. And good morning, everyone. Let me just begin with the summary of 2014 on Slide 4. As we highlighted during our outlook call in December, we are very pleased with the integration of Flow Control and our progress for last two years demonstrates the power the Pentair integrated management system or PIMS as a differentiating tool for integrating acquisitions. We are very pleased with how the company has come together and one Pentair culture has been firmly established. Yes, we know the best is still to come. In 2014, we delivered 2% core sales growth which we recognize as mid- pack at best. But our 160 basis points the margin expansion, 24% adjusted EPS growth and very strong free cash flow clearly places us in the upper quartile of performance last year compared to our peer group. In addition, we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, a very solid year indeed.","While the market environment remains challenging, we further simplified the business and consolidated GBU. We are more closely aligned around channels solutions than ever, we have structured our four business units as reporting segments allowing even more strategic alignment. 2014 was another good year for Pentair. We built momentum on our internal execution to drive shareholder value in 2015 and beyond.","Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a quick look at our key 2015 forecast assumptions. Lots changed in the world since we provided initial 2015 outlook just last December. In our initially EPS guidance we provided a list of key variables that could impact the low, mid and high end of the range. Some of these have gotten better but unfortunately some more critical factors have gotten more negative. The further fall in oil prices is rightly came under the lot of attention with many other companies have indicated the ongoing strengthening dollar has created substantial foreign exchange headwinds as well. In mid December we forecasted an FX headwind of roughly $0.10 per share. This headwind is now doubled as the dollar further strengthened against most currencies. We've not sat by idly, and have continue to go after further cost structure resulting in recognizing additional restructuring in the fourth quarter as we've positioned for a continued push to achieve top line growth. These external challenges are also reflected in our core sales growth outlook, which is now targeted to be 2% to 3% down from 2% to 4%. To point out the top line is a response to the reality of substantial uncertainty in our energy vertical due to oil and gas. We've forecasted $200 million also buyback for 2015 and that is already been completed. Our balance sheet capacity remains over $1 billion and we will continue to remain disciplined in our capital allocation as we build an active M&A pipeline.","Taking all these into consideration, we are adjusting our 2015 EPS guidance to a range of $4.10 to $4.25 from a range of $4.20 to $4.35, with a dime adjustments being solely related to the increase FX headwind. John will cover the 2015 outlook in greater detail later in the call. It is important for us to be realistic about the economic environment of the world day while we continue to execute on the elements within our control at a very high level.","Now let's turn to Slide 6 for discussion of our fourth quarter results. We delivered a strong fourth quarter with the core sales growth of 2% which is in line with our forecast. We saw continued strength in our Residential and Commercial and Food & Beverage vertical while Industrial improved in the second half and appeared to build momentum entering the new year. Technical Solutions had another strong quarter with 7% core sales growth and Process Technologies also delivered strong core sales growth of 5%. We delivered 10% adjusted operating income growth, 160 basis points of margin expansion and 23% adjusted EPS growth. Free cash flow was very strong in the quarter and a full year as we generated nearly $900 million of full year free cash flow. We've represented 121% conversion of adjusted net income. This is a large part of Pentair's ongoing value proposition.","Now let's turn to Slide 7 for more detail look at the fourth quarter results. Our 2% core sales growth consisted of one point of volume growth and one point of price. But FX was 4% headwind as a dollar strengthened later in the year. We are expecting this type of foreign exchange headwind to persist in 2015 with the first quarter facing a particularly tough comparison. The quarter's 10% adjusted operating income growth is also consistent with our long-term value proposition with price and productivity offsetting inflation. We saw inflation run fairly consistent throughout 2014 and raw material inflation may moderate, wage inflation is expected to persist. Our lean sourcing and standardization efforts continue to deliver, contributing to our 160 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. The fourth quarter showed solid core sales growth which we believe demonstrates the diversification in our portfolio and our strong internal execution highlights our unwavering focus to over deliver on the elements within our control.","Now let's turn to Slide 8 for review of our largest segment, Valves & Controls. Values & Controls' fourth quarter sales declined 1% as we faced the very tough year-over-year comparison since the prior year Q4 included over $30 million of loan margin shipments out of the backlog. Including significant adjustments due to currency translation the quarter ending backlog declined 7% sequentially with over half of the decline a result of FX headwinds. Given the backlog is generally shippable in the next 6 to 12 months; we feel it's prudent to adjust backlog for FX to give the most appropriate view of the business. Core orders declined 6% which we will discuss in more detail in the next slide. Once again the sales results were mix for Valves & Controls with process up modestly, oil and gas down and power and mining both flat in the quarter. The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Valves & Controls' operating profit end margins. Although the top line had its fair share of volatility, the operating income performance within Valves & Controls has been very strong. Operating income grew 30% and operating margin expanded 470 basis points to 16.9%. While the comparable quarter's results were dragged down by the low margin shipments last year, Valves & Controls make tremendous progress in driving productivity as they build momentum in lean sourcing and standardization all part of PIMS.","Now let's turn to Slide 9 for look at the orders and backlog for Valves & Controls. As you can see on slide 9, Valves & Controls' backlog is broken down in four key industries, three of which fall under our energy vertical, those are oil and gas, power and mining and one in our industrial vertical which the process business is. It's clearly been a lot of focus on our Valves & Controls business particularly its oil and gas exposure, 65% of the Valves & Controls is not oil and gas related. Orders remain volatile, core is growing in process and mining while they decline double digits in both oil and gas and power. The decline in oil and gas orders follow two quarters of orders growth was not unexpected given the dramatic decline in oil prices throughout the fourth quarter. Power and mining both continue to see evolved order pattern but excluding the negative impact of FX, backlog in these two smaller sub verticals appears to be stabilizing. Process orders showed small growth in the quarter and we continue to expect orders to grow in 2015 as the North American chemical build out continues. Valves & Controls' orders come later in the procurement cycle and projects that have already been commissioned continue to move forward, giving us confidence and some order momentum building in 2015. ","Now let's move to Slide 10 for look at our Process Technologies segment. Process Technologies achieved another strong quarter growth with 5% core sales growth overall with all key verticals contributing. Food and Beverage growth is 7% and spread across both our beverage and food services businesses and residential and commercial saw growth from both pool and residential filtration. The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Process Technologies' operating profit and margins. So while the top line showed strength once again, this is the second quarter in a row where incoming margin performances were challenged. We continue to see opportunities to drive lean and standardization within many of our filtration businesses and have combined these businesses with flow to focus on accelerating the pace of change. While price and productivity were not enough to offset inflation this quarter, we've taken the necessary root cause counter measures and are focused on driving the type of income growth and margin expansion we expect on the strong core sales growth performance. ","Now to move to Slide 11 for look at Flow Technologies. Flow Technology reported a core sales decline of 4%, half of which was attributable to our strategic decision to exit the big box channel and focus on a profitable pro channel. Despite this headwind our residential and commercial business showed a modest increase in the quarter. We are now pleased with our performance in industrial and infrastructure in the fourth quarter. We believe backlog is stabilized. While we do not anticipate this would read out fully in the first half of 2015, we do expect continuing improvement in both of these verticals within the segment as 2015 progresses. The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Flow Technologies' operating profits and margins. Operating income grew 5% and operating margins expand at 110 basis points to 10.3%. Flow Technologies delivered strong price and productivity while differentiating growth and improving mix should help continue the momentum we built to drive margins to higher performance level. ","Let's now turn to Slide 12 for look at Technical Solutions results. Technical Solutions had another fantastic quarter with 7% core sales growth led by energy and residential and commercial. For the first time this year Technical Solutions posted a small decline in infrastructure as comparisons for the electronics business began to get more challenging. Within energy, we saw strength once again in the Canadian oil and sand shipping and projects currently in the backlog. Our heat management solutions business is more than just oil and gas and we saw strong orders and backlog growth in the fourth quarter driven by two large projects. Residential and commercial benefited from continued growth in Europe and North America. Industrial growth of 6% was led by our North American equipment protection and North American heat management solutions businesses. The right half of the page shows third quarter Technical Solutions' operating profits and margins. Operating income grew 7% in the quarter and operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 22.9%. Our price and productivity initiatives continue to outpace inflation while core sales growth leverage is partially offset by increased FX headwinds during the quarter. ","Now let's turn to Slide 13 for review of 2014 full year results. In 2014, we delivered 2% core sales growth led by our Process Technologies and Technical Solutions segment. We completed our previous share buyback program during 2014. Adjusted operating income for the full year increased 13% and adjusted operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 14.5%. We made a lot of progress for last year's improving our operating margins but many opportunities remain to drive overall margin even higher. Free cash flow was nearly $900 million and represented 121% conversion of adjusted net income. I am pleased with our operating performance in 2014 and recognized we must continue to drive more consistent, predictable organic growth. ","Let's now turn to Slide 14 for look at our Oil and Gas profile. Pentair has narrowly diversified industrial company operating in five verticals. Just under 20% of our business is exposed to global oil and gas market and over 80% of the portfolio participates in other verticals where we believe growth exist today. We highlighted this part of our portfolio in December outlook call and wanted to remind our shareholders that even within oil and gas we are diversified, specifically we are 5% exposed to upstream, 5% midstream and 9% downstream on a total Pentair's sales basis. Our upstream and midstream exposure is mostly in our Valves & Controls segment and are split roughly 60:40 between new constructions and install base. The upstream portion is where we believe the greatest uncertainty exists today. Our downstream exposures will involve Valves & Controls and Technical Solutions. During the fourth quarter, we mentioned previously we saw strong orders and backlog growth in our heat management solutions business within Technical Solutions. While there has been some focus recently on the outlook for refining, we continue to see strong MRO activity that I have not seen any slowing in maintenance spending as our focus on the install base continues to gain traction. The continued volatility in oil prices which remain below $50 per barrel does create a level of uncertainty within 19% of our portfolio. So our focus for our growth is squarely on the other 81% of our portfolio where we have several areas of opportunity entering 2015.","As shown on Slide 15, our overall 2015 core sales growth profile by vertical. As you can see on 15 starting with industrial, our largest vertical representing roughly 29% of sales. We are forecasting 3% to 5% core sales growth in 2015. Our Valves & Controls business is expected to see improving orders during the year in North America as expansion and process industries continues. Within Technical Solutions our North American equipment protection business saw improving order trends in the second half of 2014 and globalize ISM report remain positive and support our expectations in industrial will remain solid. Our second largest vertical, residential and commercial has been our bright spot for past couple of years. In 2015 should see momentum that momentum continues. This vertical represents approximately 27% of our sales with large portion of our residential and commercial business exposed replacing spending which remains positive. We've recognized that our big box exit within Flow Technologies creates some modest headwind for this vertical but overall we are forecasting 46% core sales growth in residential and commercial. Roughly 10% of our sales are within food and beverage vertical. Our agriculture related businesses are facing markets that are likely to be down overall again in 2015. But both or irrigation and crop spray businesses are expected to deliver differentiated growth to mitigate some of the market related headwinds. Our food service business is expected to continue to perform well expanding with customers globally while also further penetrating areas such as grocery stores and convenient stores. We believe our beverage business is well positioned with global customers in the beer industry and we expect to see more growth as our dairy business gains momentum. Within our infrastructure vertical which accounts for less than 10% of our overall sales, we are forecasting modest growth in 2015. Our electronics business and Technical Solutions faces tough comparison in the first half of the year but the business is focused on winning new opportunities. Within our advanced filtration business it appears to global desalination markets and water treatment and finally reached a bottom after prolonged hibernation. And we are encouraged to see order in the fourth quarter of 2014. Within our engineered flow business, our infrastructure backlog improved in the back half for 2014. And leads us to believe that after challenging first quarter this business should see growth return in the second half. In addition to our 19% in oil and gas, we have another 8% of our sales in power and mining within our energy vertical. For 2015, we now expect core sales in energy to be down 5% to 7% on a core basis. With the momentum we are seeing in a majority of our portfolio there is non energy related is expected to drive low single digit overall core sales growth in 2015. ","Let's now turn to Slide 16 for look at how we believe will driving shareholder value. Before I hand off the call to John, I wanted to focus on what we believe we are doing to drive shareholder value. Simply put, we remain focused on three areas. Organic growth, margin expansion and free cash flow and capital allocation. We've recognized in the last couple of years when the second and third performance quartile in organic growth. That's why we continue to sharpen the growth tools within our PIMS tools box. At the beginning of last year, we organized into 18 growth platforms under our four reporting segments, which provide us a better mechanism to prioritize investments across the enterprise. The platform focus allows us the ability to differentially fund and track growth actions on a more granular level within the businesses. While we cannot control the external economic environment, we are focused on driving differentiated growth in our most attractive businesses in our portfolio. That's already reading out in spots.","Regarding margin expansion and free cash flow and capital allocation, we believe we have proven track record of success that places in the first quartile of performance, top of class. Over the last two years, we've expanded our adjusted operating margins over 300 basis points and we believe we have the proven play book to continue driving productivity and cost structure. Our free cash generation has increased dramatically for the last two years. We returned $2.3 billion to our shareholders through buyback and dividends for last two years. We remained disciplined in our capital allocation and our free cash flow is nearing $1 billion per year on an annual basis, allowing us more degrees of freedom than any other time in Pentair. All three components are important to driving shareholder value. We are doing very well in two areas and are focused on improving the third area, organic growth which we know is important to driving long-term shareholder value and we are committed to delivering that. ","So with that I'll turn it over to John.","John Stauch ","Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide number 17 titled 2014 Free Cash Flow Generation. Cash flow was strong 2014 as free cash flow for the year was $889 million, which represented 121% of net income. This is the second consecutive year that free cash flow exceeded a 120% of net income. Just as important, ROIC increased over 11%. Free cash flow is an important component of our value creation story and we remain committed to delivering strong free cash flow on a consistent basis. Please turn to Slide number 18 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. As I mentioned on the previous slide, ROIC ended the year just over 11%, which we believe demonstrate the value creation from the Flow Control acquisition. We returned $1.4 billion to shareholders in 2014 through share repurchases and dividends. Our capital expenditures were lower last year to $130 million as we focused on fewer, higher return investments. But we expect that number to increase in 2015 as we continue to invest in growth and productivity initiatives across the company. Ending debt was $3 billion or $2.9 billion on a net debt basis inclusive of over cash on hand.","Please turn to Slide number 19 labeled 2015 Forecasted Cash Flow Usage and Capital Allocation. We expect another strong year of free cash flow in 2015. With free cash expected to be around $925 million or greater than 115% of net income. We anticipate returning at least $440 million through share repurchases and dividends. Through January 2015, we completed $200 million of share repurchases under our current $1 billion authorization. And we've recently announced a dividend increase for the 39th consecutive year. We remained disciplined in our capital allocation approach which starts with our investment grade upgrading. We continue to fund organic growth opportunities and expect capital expenditures to be slightly ahead of depreciation. We are building our M&A funnel and expect to see acquisition activity return as the year progresses. We've made great strides in our standardization efforts and many of our businesses have earned the right to make strategic acquisitions. If we do not see deals materialize as we get later into the year, we will consider incremental share repurchases. ","Please turn to Slide number 20 labeled New Pentair Segmentation. As Randy mentioned earlier in the call, we are further streamlined the organization and have eliminated a GBU. This means that each of our four remaining GBUs will now also be an external reporting segment. We expect this new alignment to help optimize the revenue expansion of our growth platforms while also driving standardization to PIMS within the platforms and GBUs. We have moved our former filtration and processed platforms and combined them with our former flow technologies business to create flow and filtration solution. The Process Technologies segment has been renamed Water Quality Systems and includes our product systems, water purification, food service and environmental systems platforms. Valves & Controls and Technical Solutions remains the same. For your modeling purposes we have included restated segment numbers in the appendix in today's presentation. ","Please turn to Slide number 21 labeled Q1, 2015 Pentair Outlook. For the first quarter we expect core sales to increase 2% to 3% with the FX anticipated to be large 4% to 5% headwinds. On a core basis, we expect Valves & Controls sales to be flat based on their shippable backlog. Flow and filtration solutions sales are anticipated to be down 2% to 3% on a core basis which includes the big box exit. Water quality system sales are anticipated to grow 6% to 7% on a core basis with pool energy efficient penetration and continued growth in food service. ","Finally, Technical Solutions sales are expected to be up 2% to 3% on a core basis with strength in both industrial and energy. We are expecting adjusted operating income to be flat and adjusted operating margins to expand 40 basis points to 12.6%. Below the last operating line we anticipate our tax rates to be approximately 23%, net interest and other to be around $18 million and share count to be approximately 180 million. Our first quarter adjusted EPS range of $0.75 to $0.77 represents 7% growth to the mid point. As a reminder, free cash flow is historically run negative in the first quarter. ","Please turn to Slide number 22 labeled Full Year 2015 Outlook. As Randy mentioned earlier in the call, we are lowering our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance by a dime to range at $4.10 to $4.25. This reduction is solely attributable to the anticipated increased FX headwinds that we and most others are expecting. We continue to focus on the elements within our control and are working to deliver another year of double digit adjusted EPS growth. For the full year we expect core sales to grow 2% to 3% which we anticipate will be more than offset by 4% to 5% FX headwinds. Valves & Controls sales are anticipated to be flat to down 2% on core basis. We'll watch orders closely and continue to drive the short cycle business. Flow and filtrations solutions sales are expected to be up 3% to 5% on a core basis inclusive of the big box exit. Water quality system sales are anticipated to be up 5% to 7% on a core basis and technical solutions sales are expected to be up 3% to 5% on a core basis. We anticipate growth in our residential and commercial, industrial and food and beverage verticals while infrastructure is expected to improve as the year progresses. We expect adjusted operating income to be up 5% for the year and adjusted operating margins to expand 90 basis points to 15.4%. We continue to drive lean sourcing and standardization, expecting growth leverage to materialize within our businesses that are growing although FX headwinds will mitigate some of their leverage. We expect overall corporate cost to be approximately $105 million, net interest and other to be around $71 million. Our full year tax rate amount to 23% and the share count for the full year to be approximately 183 million. EPS growth is anticipated to increase 10% at the mid point of the range.","Finally, we expect another strong year of free cash flow at approximately $925 million or greater than 115% of net income.","Elisa, can you please open the line for questions. Thank you. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Steve Tusa","What are you assuming on the raw materials dynamics for this year? ","John Stauch ","We are seeing -- we are expecting to see little inflation if no inflation is there, Steve. I mean clearly we are going to expect especially in Valves & Controls more difficult pricing environment with our large customers and they are going to ask us to work with our channel partners and suppliers to keep cost down. So we are basically assuming no inflation right in material. ","Steve Tusa","Okay. And is there anything that you kind of marked to market, is there any kind of benefit or anything like that?","Randy Hogan","Not really that. We are looking for -- how do we turn the FX change and doing advantage from a sourcing standpoint, yes. That's one of the active actions we have on; we don't have anything quantified yet, so Europe on sale and some other countries are too.","Steve Tusa","Right. On the oil and gas weakness in the fourth quarter. Where exactly could you maybe little more precise that where you saw that? The orders? ","John Stauch ","We are downstream for sure. So what we saw was -- what we are recalling earlier, Steve is we saw those orders being delayed in Q2 and Q3. And in fact they just continued to push out so most of the weakness was in the downstream and the capital expenditure models of our customers. ","Steve Tusa","Sorry downstream or upstream?","John Stauch ","No, upstream.","Steve Tusa","Yes, too many streams. ","Randy Hogan","Yes. You are already seeing rig counts declining. Projects that are committed the downstream once refining and other profit-- those committed ones are we think are moving ahead and we are seeing releases on those. What it means for downstream in 2016, we will figure out but we are seeing a much faster change in the upstream activity. Midstream, they look good.","Steve Tusa","Within your upstream, I know the business is pretty diverse globally. Within your upstream, is there any geography that you know I know this kind of parses it again but any geography that you are seeing that in? I mean it's pretty obvious the North America rate of changes obviously pretty dramatic keeping even though there were some companies that didn't really see it in the fourth quarter yet. Is it a global thing? Is it North America?","Randy Hogan","Well, yes, North America clearly is a lot of coverage on that. But North Sea offshore which is obviously North Sea even Middle East.","Steve Tusa","Okay, so it's in global stuff and then -- ","Randy Hogan","Really the -- on the upstream side they are rapidly looking at all the budgets globally so -- ","Steve Tusa","And then just one last comment. I mean this re-segmenting, I understand that there's a degree of perhaps cost saves associated with realignments and stuff. But this constant re-segmenting just breed's skepticism, I think, in the investment community. Hopefully, this is the last one. It really does not help, especially in an environment like this where there's a lot of stuff moving around. It does not help people gain confidence in the numbers.","Randy Hogan","I appreciate that. And we didn't do it to make anyone's life difficult or to make things opaque when we merge the companies two years ago; we have seven GBU that wasn't sustainable. We got down to five GBUs and what this alignment was we have some under performance in one of the GBUs, we are getting cost structure that's easy and fast but the real focus is to get -- we now have all of -- in water we have all of our standard product sold through distribution in one business and now we move the engineer solution or filtration together with the engineered solutions or flow particularly with the exit of the big box so we have more consistency of end market and channel this way. And hopefully get some leverage.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Steven Winoker","Thanks and good morning, all. Randy, it sure sounds like you were declaring victory on Tyco Flow at the beginning of this call. And we are two years in, obviously some great margin expansion. But could you maybe expand a little bit on that and where you are headed? And what does that imply for your thinking about M&A going forward?","Randy Hogan","Yes. We feel pleased about where we are, we are two years in. I hesitate to call and declaring victory but we are pleased with our progress and I put it that way. And we are pleased because we believed in going in there, there were some very good businesses, they were not performing at the level they could perform if you apply good operating discipline. And this two years has proven that number one, yes, they are good businesses. Number two, our approach which we call PIMS was fundamental to bringing operating disciplines to those businesses very quickly. It raises our confidence and raises the Board's confidence; it raises many of shareholders' confidence that we can do it again. Our capacity is larger and what I mean by that our capacity and our expertise and the talent base we build to do it again. And we believe that we created a lot of value through doing it. And we talked before that the biggest myth in Tyco was the fact that if you go back to the Form -10 forecasted growth that they would see in those businesses was at least 3x higher than in all of the segments than what the world really delivered on that two years so we over delivered on what we controlled in an environment that turned out to be not as good. So what's the implication for M&A, we believe we have capability and we should put it to work. But we are going to remain discipline. We have the capacity, we mentioned in a $1 billion worth of capacity and but we are going to remain disciplined. We wanted to fit our five -- our five questions we always go through which is how does it fit our strategy? Number two, how is the financials work? Number three, why we the right buyer? Where is the value? And actually we have more offered there now with our capital structure and tax structure and our domicile. We actually have more unique opportunities to bring to play there. And then what's the integration plan importantly and what's the integration team? And we really got that right on Tyco. And we are not going to rush anything but we certainly up on our toes, on our balls of our feet looking out.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And on the oil and gas topic, let's assume for a minute that oil prices stabilize maybe even get a little bit better from here. In terms of -- I don't want to -- maybe I shouldn't use this word. Well, in terms of the damage that has already been done to this point right as this just -- the time -- can you help me with the pacing through orders and revenues and earnings, assuming things were to get a little bit better from here on the commodity side? Does that still -- how would that maybe change your outlook or how you're thinking about everything flowing through the business?","Randy Hogan","Well, I'll ask John to give you a little more detail on the forecast. As we look at our forecast -- our forecast is we restart valves to basically be flat year-over-year and it is going to work to be there because we are seeing some price pressures. Our base case of how we are looking at this is where our underlying base case is that oil is going to be in turmoil for at least another 9 to 10 months. And even when it gets back up to more what let's call it sustainable level of $70 a barrel. The spending in the oil companies isn't going to snap back as quickly and snapped away. And I think they remain cautious. But it is basically supply demand in balance. So the price went lower than people expected, so they weren't forecasting the six months ago, I tend to be cautious about the forecast they make now. That's why we are assuming -- we are not assuming that there is any kind of snap back. ","Steven Winoker","Okay. And when you mentioned downstream and petro -- and North America process build out on page 15 in industrial, the North America process build out, are you talking about petrochem and everything or do you include -- ","Randy Hogan","We put process industries and petrochemical not in a sort of after the refinery, petrochemical and other chemicals that aren't just petrol related. We put that in our industrial category. There are still a lot of attractive economics to most of those projects and we are not seeing cancellations there. Some of the ones that are on the deep planning board may have a little bit of doubt to them now but even the LNG facilities, all the ones that FERC has approved and we expect those to go forward. We still have the opportunities to ship natural gas overseas to other countries. We have in North America; we still have an advantage if not an even more advantaged situation. ","Steven Winoker","Okay and just building on Steve, just one last question. That page 10, process technology, is the only place where you had inflation not offsetting productivity and price. So is that part of having function of this additional segmentation? Is that what you're saying?","Randy Hogan","Yes. Our performance on productivity and managing inflation and actually price realization wasn't very good in that GBU. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Appreciate all the calibration you are providing on your oil exposure. And I know it's 19% of your portfolio, but that's where we're seeing most of the changes, and that's why you're getting all of these questions. So let me just chime in with mine. Just for clarification on slide 9, the energy backlog, the sequential decline. I believe you said that you had re-priced your backlog for FX. So how much of that sequential decline was in FX versus push-outs?","Randy Hogan","Yes. It is about half. What we did there as we -- that's the reality if you price it today and revalue it with FX today, so we just think that's like the better way to do it because if you sold it today that's what sort of would be add and Valves & Controls business we have fairly large book of business actually in Europe is booked in euros but to change that more in dollars, it is work to be done yet. So that's what we are doing there. ","Deane Dray","Have any of those backlogs been re-priced, customers coming back to you?","Randy Hogan","No. We are hearing from customers as John mentioned customers asking us to look hard at price and on what's being lack, what's being worked but not in what's in the backlog.","Deane Dray","Okay. And then if we go back to slide 5 which was very helpful in saying, look at the changes since the December outlook call, maybe just clarify on the restructuring comment, where in December there was modest, and then saying more aggressive. But it says 2014 restructuring. Does that suggest you did more in the quarter? And what about -- can you give us some color on the restructuring actions for 2015?","John Stauch ","Yes. We did more in the quarter. It's really what we were referring to as we started to see some of the currency challenges and the oil and gas headwinds we went to the businesses and took incremental restructuring. So far up to 2015 we are not anticipating any more so our current guidance reflects net adjusted end reported are equal there. If we need to do more we will do more. ","Deane Dray","And then last question, John, since I've got you here. On FX, just refresh us on what types of natural hedges that you have, the currency exposure; might you be doing any translational hedging? We're seeing companies like GE and Honeywell talking about that. We're in an unprecedented FX headwind right now. Might you be doing anything additional on the hedging front? And especially if it ties to your foreign domicile, whether that's an advantage or a disadvantage?","Randy Hogan","Yes. So this number here represents the translational impact of the dollar against global currencies. It is unprecedented and being that the dollar strengthens against every currency generally in the world. I mean usually there are natural hedges where the dollar weakens against some and strengthens against others. There is as Randy mentioned also the transactional benefit that we would expect and that would come through the sourcing line where the lower currency is actually giving us productivity and less expensive purchases. I would think that somewhere in the 40% of this number range. And that we will see to the sourcing benefit. As far as what everybody else is doing a hedging, I remain interested and curious. We are looking at some of those options but quite frankly we got to find a way to make them work into our reporting and as you know you can hedge sequentially but you can't hedge year-over-year. So we have to be comfortable that if we were to do that everybody would understand what we are doing and I think right now there is -- it is anybody's call what's going to happen and so I am not a genius at hedging so we have to look at the upside and downside. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question is on V&C. The margins were incredibly strong this quarter. And I basically wanted to just get a sense from you on the long-term trajectory of these margins. I think we've talked historically that this could be a high-teens type business. But just in light of your commentary on wage inflation, pricing could be a little bit more difficult in 2015. I'm just trying to understand the trajectory of that business moving forward.","John Stauch ","Yes. I'll start with just framing and I mean we still think we are roughly 400 to 500 basis points behind what we call a peer group that continues to perform and improve their margins as well. And so we still haven't -- I look at this as opportunity but we acquired some 20 ERP systems and lots of global back offices and lots of entities that we never integrated, and so what we are doing and we are launching this year is OMT initiative which is our operating model transformation and as we go live we will be able to put all these businesses on a common framework and really believe that there is enormous potential that still remains on the margin side. I'll let Randy comment on incremental value for them.","Randy Hogan","Well, I mean really and we wanted to turn some of that increased capability to improving our differential growth. But we actually haven't touched the go to market side of Valves & Controls, so we are focusing on the operating side so that we can keep growth going but frankly I am disappointed with the performance on the growth side of Valves & Controls, so I think we need to leverage that to get better connected and leveraged and gain share on -- based on the execution improvements we've had in things like pressure management where we have moved situations very difficult up to being almost high performing in terms of delivery and quality. We should be gaining a lot more share from that. ","Joe Ritchie","Now that makes sense. But maybe following up on OMT, did you guys start to see some of the benefit already this quarter? And can you just remind us what your expectation is for the benefit in 2015?","John Stauch ","A lot of the benefits that we have been getting in 2013 and 2014 were lean sourcing, lowering operational fruit, fixing quality delivery and over time and premium freight -- ","Randy Hogan","Then a few plant shutdown ","John Stauch ","And then a few small plant closures as Randy mentioned. Also fixing some low margin product mix challenges, so a lot more of the operational prioritization side and what we realized in 2013 and 2014. What we are going to see now coming in 2015 and beyond will be the benefits of related to OMT is we would see coming through primarily the G&A side as well as more operational efficiencies and working capital improvement.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. And is there a number that you guys have quantified that is embedded in your guidance?","Randy Hogan","It is probably 200 -300 basis points more on that regarding over the next couple of years. ","Randy Hogan","That's couple of years not this year. ","Joe Ritchie","Okay. And maybe one last question. John, you mentioned earlier -- clearly you guys bought back about $200 million this quarter. You've got about $1 billion left. And I think you mentioned earlier that you'd consider incremental share repurchases if M&A didn't come to fruition. So is it fair to say that you are going to put the buyback on hold for now just based on what you see in your pipeline, and then could get more aggressive in the back half of the year? Is that how we should interpret your comments?","John Stauch ","That's a fair assessment, correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is open.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Good morning, guys. Well, I do have one non oil questions.","Randy Hogan","Thank you. You win the prize. How many minutes in are we?","Shannon O'Callaghan","On tech solutions, this industrial strength that you started to see the last couple quarters, could you may be fill that out a little bit in terms of what you're seeing, and your confidence that that's real, sustained momentum? And then also on kind of on the flip side there of -- I guess I'm not totally avoiding -- is the energy piece on Canadian oil sands. Where does that head from here?","Randy Hogan","Sure. On the first one, a lot of that strength in industrial is North America, is the North American investments and you can see the ISM numbers. We've also had -- one of the reasons we are up energy there is that we've launched a new line of product that is finding good promise particularly in the downstream refining and really very well received by customers. So we believe we are gaining share in that product line. So it's end market it is North America and it is both the discrete and process manufacturing so that's why we feel like second half bodes well for the industrial part of technical solutions there. On the oil sand, the oil sand there is small projects are going forward the MRO, it is a hostile environment that requires money to be spent to keep it going. And we think it will, that money the MRO the short cycle will keep going. Couple of larger projects have been affirmed and going forward. And I think all the other projects are probably -- all the projects that haven't been given the go ahead are questionable at this point. That would be my conjecture. ","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. And then on the re-segmentation again, could you just fill out a little bit more what you expect the benefits to be? Is it more of a -- you think it's going to show up -- you mentioned where you are in quartiles on growth, versus things like cash or margins. Do you expect this re-segmentation to benefit more on the growth side or margins? Or what was exactly not working?","Randy Hogan","Yes. Let me start with -- seven GBU was too many, I think four was just right. We are really driving towards a simpler structure that is more intimate for John and I in particular to deal with the presidents on the opportunities and challenges that they each have. We had a mix, we had two in the process technologies we had the water quality businesses which included pool and residential filtration. These are products that were -- they are largely standard, they are engineered but they are standard set of products largely sold through distribution. And it is a different go-to-market model than the engineered bespoke filtration systems that was at the high end. And it is closer to the infrastructure and industrial kind of things that flow does particular as flow is moved away from the big box business. So we have the opportunity to get cost but we have a simpler organization, they are each well over a $1 billion in size so we have scale and we have expectations on those four presidents that are higher, clear and more demanding. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Scott Graham","Hey, good morning. And thanks for all this clarity. The one thing I would hope that maybe you can bring a little bit more to bear on would be the Valves & Controls 2015 outlook, which actually looks like was upgraded from what you said a month ago, month and a half ago, of down 2% to 4%, to flat to down to 2%, in an oil environment that has obviously deteriorated. So could you give us your thinking on that?","John Stauch ","Yes. I think just to clarify to you Scott, I think the update we probably gave last time included the foreign exchange impact and the flat to down 2% that we are looking at now which is core, if you look at them on a FX or the same basis we think it is maybe two points worse on the top line -- ","Randy Hogan","And on same, same basis.","John Stauch ","On same, same basis.","Scott Graham","So you're saying that within your 2015 outlook, that was a grossed up number?","John Stauch ","Yes. I think we definitely adjusted two points down on the top line. As you know, there is piece every single year that you head into the year and shippable backlog, so we've FX adjusted as shippable backlog and that makes up almost 50% of the shipments we expect this year and then the rest is what orders you take in and the booking ship nature of those orders within the year. So I think we are really talking as Randy mentioned earlier what is the impact to 2016 and 2017 as we kind of go to through the year with Valves & Controls and what happens with oil prices and what happens with this end market that we are facing. ","Scott Graham","Okay, got you. On the adjusted margins, no change there, but obviously a little bit lower on the operating leverage. And you are essentially saying and obviously a little bit off on the FX but you're saying that the restructuring kind of fills a lot of that gap, yes?","John Stauch ","Yes. I mean I think we took out the translational impact of foreign exchange; it still seems double digit operating income across most of these segments. ","Scott Graham","Okay, great. Thank you. Last question. How skewed towards the second half of the year is the share repurchase going to be? Could you maybe be a little bit more specific on that prior question?","Randy Hogan","We've already finished it. ","John Stauch ","We've already finished the $200 million -- ","Randy Hogan","$200 million out of the $1 billion. The original approval was the $1 billion over multiple years and first $200 million was what we intended to do this year -- we finished it already. ","Scott Graham","I was referring to the 2015 within the guidance.","John Stauch ","Yes, Scott, I think we really -- we are seeing a richer funnel of M&A activity right now and we think that our business that we mentioned that are more standardized and certainly the ones that are growing organically you could certainly benefit from adding some content to their customers. And I think this could be a year where we complete several transactions. And if those don't materialize and we feel like they are fading away from the funnel then we would look at our capital allocation strategy again and certainly buyback is a smart thing to do if you don't have any use of the capital. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Hammond","Hi, guys, good morning. Just to clarify so what's the offset to the oil and gas top line weakness? Is that the additional restructuring within the guide?","John Stauch ","Yes. ","Jeff Hammond","Okay. And then just on the new segments, how should we think about the long-term margin trajectory in the two segments? You have one that sticks out as very good margins and one as much lower. Where can those go?","John Stauch ","I would just say you are going to see a higher level of basis point improvement in Valves & Controls and flow and filtration solutions. Both have significant standardization opportunities in front of them. And both obviously Valves & Controls because they started lot later but both have more lean opportunities. What I call the systems and technical solutions, they have pretty nice margins. And the majority of their platforms but some of their platforms still substantial opportunities as well. So we see margin improvement across all of them. But you are going to see the majority of the opportunity in flow and filtration solutions and Valves & Controls. ","Randy Hogan","And I just add also those higher margin ones, water quality systems and technical solutions, they have really good growth opportunities and we want to make sure that we are taking that high profitability and high grading with they are going after so that we can continue to drive that. You see that in a technical solutions performance in the fourth quarter where we had good quarter growth and we got significant margin expansion on top of that which is the operating leverage. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Brian Konigsberg","Yes, hi, good morning, guys. Just actually one clarification. On the guidance, it just looks like you reset the base a little bit both on the Q1 comparison also the full year. Is that just purely the water transport business that is being reflected there?","Randy Hogan","No. Water transport we took out -- we had no water transport in for the year. ","John Stauch ","Yes. That's in discontinued operations, Brian. So there is no impact of water transport. The full year guidance was just adjusted $0.10 on a lower end and $0.10 on a higher end for further foreign exchange. And when -- as the currency moved probably just the year ago from the mid $1.20 all the way down $1.13, so that's really what we are adjusting for this Q -- sorry Q1 is little bit more FX on a year-on-year basis of headwind and then there is plus shipping days in the quarter and it is just overall not the strongest quarter of the year. ","Brian Konigsberg","Actually, I guess I was asking a different question. I was just looking at your Q1 2015 guidance. You're looking -- the comparison is $1.64 billion. When you reported it, it just was $1.725 billion in the first quarter of last year.","John Stauch ","I have to follow up with you; I'll find Brian on that. ","Brian Konigsberg","Okay. And I think actually the full year 2014 number -- well, actually I'm sorry. The full year 2013 number is a little bit different too. Anyway we'll follow up on that.","John Stauch ","Just to clear, I mean last year's shipments were $1.644 billion Q1 on a continued operation basis. ","Randy Hogan","So probably is water transport ","Brian Konigsberg","Okay, so it was the water transport. It was just in disc ops.","Randy Hogan","Yes. You are probably right. ","Brian Konigsberg","The base was just -- okay, got it. Separately, just on working capital, so you kept the free cash flow assumption. I think when you gave the outlook for 2015, you only anticipated about $10 million of working capital benefit. Is that still the same in the outlook? And maybe separately, just maybe comment on the lower CapEx, where you're cutting and --","John Stauch ","I mean roughly yes we do still have significant working capital improvement in front of us. We are not forecasting a lot of improvement in 2015. But it remains our largest opportunity and so really on a cash flow to net income basis we are somewhere that $1.15 to $1.20 range I mean you can like collect cash once, so we had a strong cash performance in 2014 and we are expecting a strong gain in 2015. Not really cutting capital, we are prioritizing it. And we are prioritizing it to program that have the highest level of return. And right now we've always generally had a concept here that we have creativity for capital. And that's part of lean and a lot of our businesses are realizing that through the lean adoption especially our newer businesses they have less capital are required. So where we have opportunities to upgrade for automated purposes or driving significant productivity, we continue to fund those projects as they generate substantial returns. ","Brian Konigsberg","If I could sneak one last in, just on the FX. So obviously with the stronger dollar and the weaker euro, would you anticipate that to translate actually into greater demand within the European region? Is that in the plan at all or maybe just general thoughts on -- ","Randy Hogan","I mean we would expect that the European business is -- European base businesses will be more competitive globally and so that over time macroeconomics would say that would favor economic growth there, economic growth there -- it would be good for the world unless it comes with the expense of another region like -- ","Brian Konigsberg","But not in the 2015 plan?","Randy Hogan","No.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Andrew Obin","Yes, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of clarifications. Did I hear right on Valves & Controls pricing that you are renegotiating with the customers given the current environment?","Randy Hogan","No. We said -- what we said was that customers are asking us to participate in the difficulties they are facing. But nothing has been renegotiated. This is on new things. So just what I would characterize, I would characterize it is tougher pricing environment on the horizon. ","Andrew Obin","So, do you think pricing could turn negative?","John Stauch ","In Valves & Controls, yes, I mean obviously it is anticipated pricing so it's not anything to do with margin and backlog. So these are projects that on horizon so you don't usually score keep price but the competitive dynamics will be tougher. And so therefore we will have to get tougher in our cost reductions to be competitive on those projects.","Andrew Obin","And just another clarification on Valves & Controls backlog. Did I hear you right that you guys think that it will start going up in the second half? I'm just questioning, where does the confidence come from given that so far I think it has been somewhat below expectations?","John Stauch ","Yes. I don't -- I think we don't want to interpret; there is a lot of confidence in the backlog increasing. I mean what we are suggesting is that the orders throughout the year will reflect the projects in the market that we are participating in. And so I am not suggesting that we are going to raise backlog substantially for the year. We are actually saying -- ","Andrew Obin","But did I hear right that the expectation is that sometimes this year backlog will turn positive?","Randy Hogan","No. What we said specifically was that we think that the process segment which is an industrial, order will go forward and we expect that we will get orders. We didn't read that across the backlog at all. Do some more work on us, okay?","Andrew Obin","Okay. Then just a last question on M&A. It sounds like you said certain businesses have earned their right to do business, to do deals. And clearly you guys are very happy with underlying performance at Tyco. You also highlighted that I think I heard a comment that Europe is on sale. Private equity guys are pulling back due to regulations. Does that mean that energy is probably the most likely place where you guys are going to look for M&A? Just a little bit more color there.","Randy Hogan","Our performance on the integration of Tyco is what I said it has been very, very good and we have one company now, it is not Tyco, it is not Pentair, it is one new Pentair -","Andrew Obin","Yes, I apologize, yes. ","Randy Hogan","We are -- we have demonstrated with our performance and we have lots of happy shareholders as a result. The M&A -- I would not rule out oil and gas but I wouldn't say if that was necessarily the priority. I wouldn't say anything in particular to priority, we will apply our disciplines, we will apply our four questions or five questions and if we find things that are -- that meet our screen we will be active. If we don't -- ","Andrew Obin","So what are the other businesses that earned their right to do M&A, then? You were very, obviously and deservedly so highlighting very strong underlying execution. So what other businesses should I think about?","Randy Hogan","Well, Technical Solutions and water quality systems are our highest performing businesses. We like those a lot but all four of the businesses do have opportunities in one or more of their 18 platforms, but I won't in the interest of competitive thus -- ","Andrew Obin","No, sure. I appreciate. Thank you so much.","Randy Hogan","All right. That was last question. About the replay information. Operator?

We're glad you could join us today. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer.

I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions.","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Thanks, Jim. First quarter of 2017 was a solid start to the year, as both of our segments came in ahead of their commitments. Our adjusted core sales increased 3%. We saw margins expand 50 basis points, and adjusted EPS grew 7% and exceeded the high-end of our previous guidance.","The sale of our Valves & Controls business to Emerson is in the final stages of regulatory review and we expect the deal to close in the coming days. We're pleased with the progress we're making on our productivity actions, including our previously disclosed cost actions. We have seen some additional material inflation, so many of our businesses are exploring additional price and productivity actions to help mitigate this higher than planned material inflation.","We're maintaining our full-year adjusted EPS forecast of $3.45 to $3.55, reflecting the first quarter beat and the delayed closing of the Valves & Controls sale. While the first quarter was better than expected, we want to watch the all-important second quarter to see if these trends continue.","Now, let's turn to slide 5 for a discussion of our first quarter 2017 results. Our first quarter sales results came in better than our forecast, as both Water and Electrical delivered solid low-single-digit adjusted core sales growth. Segment income grew 3%, yet the usual leverage did not drop through.","We believe this is solely a timing issue. First, our cost out actions are still ramping, so we did not get the full benefit of those actions during the quarter. Second, as mentioned, a few of our businesses have experienced higher material inflation. There is a one to two quarter lag we experience before additional price increases offset any inflation.","Return on sales expanded 50 basis points to 15.5% and adjusted EPS grew 7%. All below the line items were in line with our forecast, including our 20% tax rate and our share count. First quarter free cash flow was a usage, in line with normal seasonal patterns, and we again expect full year free cash flow to equal adjusted net income.","Overall, the first quarter was a good start to the year, but one quarter does not make a trend. As we enter our seasonally strong second quarter, order trends remain solid and we're monitoring progress throughout the quarter before revisiting our full year expectations.","Now, let's turn to slide 6 for a look at Water performance in Q1. Our Water segment delivered adjusted core sales growth of 4%. Segment income grew 15% and return on sales expanded 180 basis points to 17%. Within our Filtration & Process business, core sales were flat. Our Residential & Commercial business showed solid mid-single-digit growth, as we saw the negative trends of the back half of 2016 reverse course.","In particular, China experienced strong double-digit growth as both residential and commercial filtration returned to growth. Within our Process Filtration businesses, results remain mixed. We've seen some capital beginning to flow again in the beer sector following the pause in 2016 as the industry went through a round of consolidations. We've faced some tough comparisons within industrial and infrastructure but we continue to see nice gains in our growing Biogas business, which we further strengthened earlier this year with the acquisition of Union Engineering.","Flow Technologies saw core sales decline 3% as we continue to focus on reducing complexity to drive margin and cash flow improvement. Our Residential and Irrigation Pump businesses experienced nice gains, but we saw continued headwinds within our commercial, industrial and infrastructure sales. In our Precision Spray business that largely serves agriculture, we saw another quarter of growth.","Aquatic & Environmental Systems had a great quarter, with 13% core sales growth. This was driven by yet another double-digit quarter of growth from our Aquatics business. We do not believe that this strong a growth rate is the norm, but we do expect growth to continue on the heels of industry strength, continued dealer wins, and strong new product innovations.","Now, let's move to slide 7 for a look at Electrical performance in Q1. Electrical performed better than expected as we saw several long challenged industries return to growth. The segment overall grew adjusted core sales 3%, segment income declined 8% and margins contracted 90 basis points to 20.6%. The margin contraction was due in part to a challenging year-over-year comparison and also some higher than anticipated material inflation.","Our Enclosures business grew core sales 1% in the quarter. Our Industrial business increased mid-single-digits and experienced growth for the first time in nine quarters.","The smaller Telecom business experienced a mid-single-digit decline, but we anticipate only one more tough year-over-year comparison in the second quarter before comps get easier in the back half of the year for Telecom. Core sales in our Thermal business declined 17% as a result of the three large jobs in 2016 not repeating. We are encouraged however to see MRO growth for the first time in two years. This does not mean that there is a recovery in the short cycle but it is a positive sign to see growth in this profitable part of the business. We continue to be focused on sizing the business to a smaller order size world and Thermal is making progress in building that order funnel, with activity in the smaller jobs that are out there to be secured.","Our Electrical & Fastening Solutions business had a strong quarter with 7% core sales growth. We saw continued strength in our Commercial business and saw some signs of improvement in the electrical grounding product line. This business experienced a fair amount of material inflation in the quarter and we're looking at additional price increases to help mitigate the higher inflation.","After a challenging second half of 2016, we're encouraged to see signs that the worst may be over for our Electrical segment. And although order trends remained solid to start April, we'd like to see another quarter or two of improvement before declaring that we're in a new world.","Now, let's turn to slide 8. Before turning the call over to John to discuss the financial outlook in more detail, I wanted to provide a status update on the pending sale of our Valves & Controls business to Emerson. We have only two more regulatory approvals to receive and have an expectation that both should be arriving in the coming days.","As a reminder, following the closure of the transaction, we plan to use the proceeds to retire debt, at which point we'll have a fair amount of balance sheet capacity again. As this balance sheet optionality returns, we will be disciplined in our capital allocation strategy.","I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our second quarter and updated full year 2017 outlook. John?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you, Randy. Please turn to slide number 9 labeled balance sheet and cash flow. Our free cash flow for Q1 was a usage of $112 million, consistent with expectations, and reflects our seasonal Q1 cash usage. This was higher than 2016, mainly due to timing of previous year tax payments and a working capital build in our Aquatic & Environmental Systems business, reflecting their strength at the beginning of the pool season. We tend to collect that cash in Q2 consistent with our business model. Our debt balance ended Q1 at $4.53 billion, reflecting the slight delay of collecting the expected proceeds from the V&C sale. ROIC ended Q1 at 10.6%.","Please turn to slide 10 titled, expected impact of V&C delay. Slide 10 attempts to make three points. The first point is the $0.04 of operational beat in Q1 covers the $0.04 impact expected in Q2 for the delay of the receipt of the V&C proceeds and, therefore, not been able to restructure the debt in line with previous expectations. Point two is that we have not updated our Q2 through Q4 performance versus previous expectations and we will do so after we see the results from Q2 operations.","This means we are still holding our full year guidance at $3.45 to $3.55 or a midpoint of $3.50 for the full year. And the third point is that while we had a slight delay in our debt restructuring for 2017, we want to remind you that this means we will see a four-month benefit in 2018 where we carry higher interest in the comparable period in 2017 or about $0.15 of incremental benefits in 2018 results.","Please turn to slide 11 labeled cost out update. Due to the sale of V&C, we quickly got after our organizational structure and streamlined into two reporting segments and a leaner Pentair enterprise support organization. We did this to produce more standard business structures with clearer functional expectations, designed to serve our customers better at a lower cost structure.","We are pleased to update that we are more than 95% complete against the previously stated cost out expectations and expect that all actions will be fully implemented by the end of Q2. These efforts results in over $75 million of net cost benefits realized in 2017 with an exit rate in Q4 that yields $100 million of net cost out heading into 2018. These costs include labor, manufacturing and operational overhead reductions designed to make us more consistent, predictable and higher performing.","They do not include the net impact of material and inflation and are before the previously communicated headwinds related to higher expected employee bonuses and compensation adjustments in 2017 versus 2016 results. This is a great progress and it's good to put the reorganization behind us and allow us to focus on driving organic growth and leaner manufacturing and shared service support.","Please turn to slide 12 labeled Q2 2017 Pentair outlook. As previously shared, we have kept Q2 operationally in line with previous expectations and only adjusted our Q2 EPS for the higher debt levels expected for the delay in our debt restructuring efforts. While we experienced much higher volume performance in Q1, we have not yet reflected that in Q2 results.","We feel it's prudent to see how our important seasonally stronger second quarter plays out before declaring that revenue and operating results will be higher for the year. While we expect some of the Q1 sales momentum to continue, we're also monitoring increasingly higher material inflation and our ability to offset that inflation through a material negotiations or incremental pricing actions.","Overall, for Q2, we expect that our adjusted core sales to be roughly flat, segment income to be up roughly 4%, ROS to expand nearly 150 basis points to around 20% and adjusted EPS to be up 14% reflecting a 20% tax rate and slightly better interest and a share count of around 183 million shares.","Please turn to slide 13 labeled full year 2017 Pentair outlook. For the full year, we expect our overall adjusted core sales to be up slightly. We expect segment income to be up 5%, ROS to expand greater than 100 basis points to around 18%, and adjusted EPS to grow approximately 15% to around $3.50 at the midpoint. We expect cash flow to be 100% of adjusted net income.","As previously mentioned, we will update our full year outlook after we see how Q2 growth and operational performance plays out. We have the V&C cash in hand and have a better view of our capital allocation decisions for 2017.","I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A, after which, Randy will have a few closing remarks. Beth, please open the line for questions. Thank you.","Jim Lucas - Pentair Plc","Hello, Beth? We're ready for Q&A.

So, just on the kind of core trends through the rest of the year. Just remind us of in the second quarter what the large jobs headwind is.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. So, it's consistent with what we previously shared, Steve. I mean, there's no incremental impact on the year-over-year basis versus what we guided to earlier. So, we said it would be roughly $33 million and that's what we're counting on.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","For the second quarter?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","For the second quarter, correct.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. So that doesn't really \u2013 it actually gets a little bit better relative to the first quarter?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. And the other thing that happens there, too, Steve, is the profitability gets a little bit better as we go through the year. Meaning the year-over-year profit impact isn't as bad because in Q1 last year we had a lot of product sales on that project in thermal and those bring higher margins. So, the margin pressures ease as we go through the year as well.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And so when you guys had given your guidance in the fourth quarter, you would've shown a seasonality chart on EPS that was about 30% in the second quarter. I think my math gets to me to like $1.05 just using 30%. It doesn't seem like anything is getting worse. Maybe there's a little bit of price\/cost or something like that. But adjusted for the timing of Valves & Controls is \u2013 what's kind of the difference between that? What changed between kind of that implied number and your kind of $0.97 to whatever it is, $0.99 today, or is that just conservatism?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Well, I mean I think \u2013 I don't know if I can reconcile with a $1.05, but I think clearly, if we saw the volume continue at the 3% to 4% level that we saw in Q1, continue in Q2, we would expect that to produce incremental drop-throughs associated with it. At the same time, we did have a little bit more material inflation in Q1. It wasn't significantly meaningful to the Q1 results, but we're starting to watch some of the inflation on some of the key components like copper, et cetera, start to rise.","And as you probably saw from some of the distributor releases, the ability to get priced right now in the end markets isn't necessarily consistent in all markets. And that's what we're watching, is what happens to that end price and the material inflation squeeze and how does it affect us throughout the quarter, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just to remind us, is there anything else in the second half of the year that stands out that should be getting worse? It seems that with such a tough end to last year, the comps should get, I mean, just like materially easier even excluding the large projects?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","I'd say generally no. Nothing we expect to get worse. As I said, we'll update our full year guidance after we see second quarter because it is so important to us.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then one last question just on the capital allocation now that we're \u2013 hopefully, we're towards the end of the tunnel on this Valves process. Just remind us again what kind of the aim is with the proceeds. I think your guys had said \u2013 it was John. You had said in March that there'd be kind of a split between debt reduction, maybe a little bit of buyback, some acquisitions. Maybe just your latest thinking on how you kind of chop up the proceeds into those three buckets?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Well, I think that still holds. We certainly will take a lot of debt off the table, but we have acquisitions. We've continued to fill the funnel on acquisitions. To the extent the prices are too high then we'll put money to work on stock buyback. But we have work to do to decide on that split, and we will be disciplined. We want to get back to creating the shareholder value we did in the first part of this.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sorry, one more question for you. Randy, you've had a really nice run. The stock has done really well under your leadership. Where are you on succession planning here?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Well, look, it's direct, right. One of the most important things boards do is to ensure proper succession. And I think we have a robust plan and we have one that we're comfortable with. So, when there's something to announce, I'm sure the board will.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray, RBC. Your line is open.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Hey, Deane.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. So much for the one question, one follow-up, but I got \u2013 let me start off on the...","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","The script for the prepared remarks early, Deane. That's what we get.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Maybe start with Aquatic, up 13%. Randy, I think, your comment was you weren't expecting quite to see this amount of strength. You called out dealer wins. You called out some new product introductions. But how would you parse out that 13% upside between those or other factors?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","I think the market \u2013 I do think the market is strong. I think everyone is experienced. And I think we had an earlier year. I think a lot of \u2013 what we might have seen in April last year, we might have seen a lot of that in March, that's \u2013 March and April, you can see things swing back and forth. But, by and large, we've got some exciting new products in controls and in heating and lighting coming out. And we continue to gain new dealers. So, the playbook keeps working.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And was weather at all a factor? February was fairly warm in the Northeast. Did that trigger any particular pull-in from maybe what you'd have seen in the second quarter?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Well, I think, right now, the industry is really optimistic. And they clearly were laying inventory in in the quarter, because they're expecting a good year. And I think weather probably helped that some.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then, over on Electrical, Hoffman ending its drought of growth after nine quarters. Which end markets were driving the uptick? Was it just easy comps? And can you comment on orders?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Yeah. When you take a look at the core Hoffman, it's really general industrial. Energy stabilized. They're part of energy, but it's just general industrial across the whole product range. And, again, I think, optimism played a role and distributors getting back to more normal stocking levels. But I don't think it was a pure stock up. I think it was selling through as well. And so, we exited with an order rate that was still sound and consistent with the first quarter.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Did you put a number on the order rate?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Mid-single-digits.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Thank you, Deane.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell, Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Hi. Good morning.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Just my first question is around the price of raw material topic which you mentioned a couple of times. Maybe just give us some historical context about how large that impact had been, say, six years ago, the last time input costs were a big factor. And how you look at the ability to get pricing in the context of what your competitors are doing.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. So, overall, I mean, we got about 1% price in Q1 and that's generally in line with what we expect to get. But what's more important is the predictability of the raw materials earlier than the pricing model works, right. So you go out with price increases and then you've got to figure out what's going to happen to materials. The materials are rising at a fairly quick rate. Steel, nickel, copper, those are our three main inputs to our material view.","And it's just a matter of can we go out with another round of material \u2013 or pricing increases. Now, I think we were planning on about $50 million (23:02) of favorability from material as we \u2013 material and inflation as we headed into the year. And I think now, we're taking a look at maybe is that flattish. So given the upside in the revenue and also the acceleration of the cost out, we feel we're fine. But before we declare victory, we like to see it through Q2.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Understood. Thank you. And then if we look at the Electrical & Fastening business, you had a very nice kind of snapback, it looked like, in the first quarter versus what happened late 2016. Maybe give us some sense of how the cadence of that business moved through Q1 and how you look at things today in terms of the visibility there, because that business has been so volatile.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Yeah. The fourth quarter certainly was \u2013 it was not expected. And I do believe, looking back on it in hindsight, I think a lot of distributors were just \u2013 with the uncertainty around a number of things in our economy, they just didn't stock up, whereas that optimism returns and it returns pretty quickly. We saw as early as January that we have returned to a more normal state. And 7% growth is better than any quarter growth last year. So, we have some really differentiated products there and that helped with productivity in construction \u2013 in commercial construction. And I think we're getting good uptake on those products.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Thank you. And then just a last quick boring one. The adjustment to the GAAP earnings guidance \u2013 is that just due to those stock comp type issues and the restructuring that you'd mentioned?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","The main one we have is amortization. So, we show that to you both on operating income and then what we call EBITDA which puts the amortization back in. That's the main one.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","The cash earnings.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","And then, occasionally, we have restructuring that flows through that as well, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Okay. So, the change from before on the GAAP side is the restructuring?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Correct.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Okay. Thank you.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran, Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning, guys.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Hey, Mike.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","So, on the cost out update, obviously, good execution so far in what you've laid out. What's the next step for you guys? Obviously, the two pieces are \u2013 it's now two segments and historically there's been some pieces within each segment you've been focused on. Is it more the same in driving the improvement in those pieces? Is there some other program that you guys are contemplating, maybe just thoughts on the next step from here?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Well, we really \u2013 the going into two segments was \u2013 as John said, it was to allow us and give us leverage to take the cost out and more than the stranded cost of the exit of Valves & Controls. And it let us really to streamline and simplify a lot. And so now we still have the same priorities we have on the Electrical side, some very attractive high profitability businesses that all have opportunities to grow.","We want to get the organic growth and then we can augment that with bolt-ons. And then particularly in the Filtration area and the Aquatics area of Water, same thing. And we really have been more on the sidelines on a lot of that acquisition because of where we were with Valves & Controls in our debt levels. So, we'll be disciplined. We're not going to rush to the trough but we're excited to get back to growth because we want to show you. We know we can and we want to show you we will.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","On that acquisition side, maybe just talk about the quality of the funnel out there. Obviously, you had to start rebuilding it a little bit or at least to some extent after the V&C sale. What's it look like today? How full is it? I know you said it was filling up from a multiple perspective. Are you shut out at this point? Are there enough attractive things out there?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Well, shut out, we have \u2013 when we say disciplined, we don't believe in doing a deal just because it's quote strategic. We have to be able to make financial sense. And so on the Water side, things are pricey. On the Electrical side not so much. But we can be creative. We still have our ownerships, our European structure that's helpful. So, we still have some bullets in the gun or we're putting bullets back in the gun.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Appreciate the time, guys. Thanks.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Graham, BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning. Nice quarter.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Good morning, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, could you give us a little bit more end-market detail on Flow as well as \u2013 Flow Technologies that is, as well as the Electrical & Fastening? You gave us the pluses in Flow. Can you give us the larger minuses, obviously, ag and then on the Electrical & Fastening side sort of the puts and takes there as well?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","No. Actually ag was up in Flow for us, both in the Spray side and Irrigation side. It's really the larger pumps. That's the industrial pumps, fire protection, and the break and fix municipal that are the slow pieces both in Europe and the U.S.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. And that's slightly down is the way I would answer that, Scott. Obviously, Residential & Commercial is doing well. I think it's doing well everywhere but what we would call rural pump, rural submersible. We're seeing much more urban development and we're seeing that to the Water Filtration business. We're seeing that to our food service offerings. So Residential & Commercial, as Randy mentioned, even Electrical, CADDY very strong which is in the EFS business that we have. Municipal, it's okay. I mean I think everybody expected a big push in the infrastructure. We're not seeing headwinds there but we're not seeing the tailwinds of growth either.","And then industrial, through what Randy mentioned in our Hoffman order take up mid to high-single-digits on orders, which we haven't seen growth in that space in a while. So that was nice to see, the recovery. So, overall, I would say food and beverage continues to get better. We had the large headwinds last year as we saw the mergers take place and some of the capital be delayed but that's returned. So, overall, right now, the verticals are moving forward in a very positive way and our only caution is that we have a lot of work to do this year. And one quarter behind us is good, but we have to now deliver on the commitments for the next three and that's what we're working on.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Good progression. The other question I have for you was essentially on pricing and obviously there's a couple questions here on price\/cost and you guys called it out. I'm a little curious about that because steel prices really start to rise last summer and then kind of reaccelerated several months back. And copper\/nickel for sure have been more recent inflation issues. But you have market-leading businesses across most of portfolio. A lot of your business is shorter cycle. Is there any reason why you're not out with price increases maybe more broadly already?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yes, Scott. I mean real quick and I'll let Randy answer. I mean, I think, first of all, we have good discipline around locking material. We don't like to gamble or play the hedge bets here, right. So we go out and we lock our material in a disciplined way. What we're up against a little bit though and we shared this before is euro. And, certainly, the stronger dollar allows for potentially European-based competitors into the market and they're getting the benefits of their weaker currency. And that's a dynamic we haven't seen in the last several years. So it came about last year and we're monitoring that. Now, where we think we have the opportunity to raise price, we will, but at the same time, we're not going to lose share. And we're going to manage the sourcing end of the material inflation as well.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","And I would just add. One of the marks of an attractive business to us is \u2013 and it's a true tell, is do you have any kind of pricing leverage in your industry. If you do, then you probably have some differentiation. If you don't, they you probably don't. And it's a simple test that we use. And so yes, we in all of our businesses have pricing capability. What we want to do is make sure that we don't get out of whack with market share. And so we're trying to be more nuanced about it because we haven't grown enough.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Understood Thanks a lot.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","All right. Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys. Since we've abandoned the one question, one follow-up, I've got five questions here.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Well, we've got three answers for you.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just kidding. Only four questions. So, John, you mentioned the municipals soft, not getting worse, not getting better. But if you look at the (32:57) data, it does feel like water\/wastewater is significantly weaker since the election. I know it's not that big for you guys, but is that one reason why you're a little bit more cautious perhaps than perhaps 1Q would suggest or is that too small to really move the needle?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah, too small to really move the needle, Nigel. I just think that we're not counting on any huge tailwind there from any reinvestments in the government, et cetera. We never have. Even when we've seen the big programs being invested on, we've not yet \u2013 we never really saw the realization of those investments. So, it's not a big enough of matter, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, Randy, you alluded that there was some channel rebuilds in driving that Electrical plus 7% performance. Is that based on just sort of conversations with the customers or is it based on POS data? I'm wondering was inventory a factor elsewhere across the portfolio?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Yeah. I think we need to do a better job of getting real sell-through from a lot of distributor \u2013 in all of our businesses. But from the indications we have, it is selling through. But I think \u2013 there was a real sense of \u2013 real surge of optimism, frankly, after the election, if you look at the timing of it. It didn't really hit in December. It was certainly when people got back from Christmas. You just saw business start to flow again. And some of that was restocking but most of it we believe was flowing through. Distributors are much more effective at keeping their stocks low and counting on manufacturers to deliver quickly to refill. And that's across the board. That's in every industry.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. And then just finally, we've shut a box around this already but on the refi post V&C close, John, can you maybe just gives us any additional color in terms of gross proceeds that you're planning to pay down debt with and any kind of breakage fees that you would expect on the refis?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. So, we'll be approaching somewhere around $3 billion in net proceeds, is what we think we'll be bringing in. And, obviously, our breakage will be minimal, so let's say less than a $100 million. And so we've got a lot of cash to work with on the refinancing and we'll run out of \u2013 in some cases with our cash generation this year what we're saying is we'll run out of debt to actually pay down. And so that forces us to...","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","So high quality problems.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","So high quality problem but that's where the M&A and the buyback discussion start to come in because we wouldn't want to be sitting on cash and not putting it to work. But we have to do it in a disciplined way and we have to monitor the right acquisitions or is it time to go out and buy back a little bit of stock.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Let's be clear. Your guidance doesn't assume any buybacks?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","That's correct.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Good morning, Joe.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Hey, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. So just a quick question. Look, your sales number was better than we expected this quarter. But this thought process around giving an adjusted core sales number, are you guys trying to signal that the large project business is basically going to de minimis or what is kind of like the thought process behind giving that number?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","I've told our businesses, no more. There's no more of this \u2013 this is the last time.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","These are three large oil sand projects that were won and it really represents the end of the reset in the energy market. And they completed in 2016 and this year we have a headwind. But really what we're trying to do is give you both, right. So, we're giving you the volume, the price, and then we're sharing with you what those jobs are. And what we want to do is make sure that we take a look at what we're going to be exiting from an organic growth rate and what we should expect in these businesses as we go forward into 2018.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then I may have missed it earlier, but the impact from large projects for the rest of the year, clearly it was a big impact in Q1, but what's the impact for Q2 to Q4?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. As we said, Q2 was around $33 million, which is $30 million in Electrical. And then we're about $27 million in Q3 and we're $10 million in Q4. And all of that was listed in the Q4 earnings where we gave the guidance for 2017.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Cool. Thanks, no, that's helpful. And then I guess just a couple quick ones. The Electrical margins got off to a little bit of a slower start than we expected. I know there's been a lot of discussion here on price\/cost. But you have that ramping back up to 23% for the full year. And so, maybe talk a little bit about some of the puts this quarter and then where you really start to see a pick-up in Q2 through Q4?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","It's the ramp of the cost and it's in the first quarter. And it was really \u2013 John mentioned it earlier, the big projects we just talked about. It was shipping all products and so the margins on that were very high, in Q1. And then the margins fell off in Q2, Q3, and Q4. So that was really the two \u2013 that was the pressures in the Electrical side and we expect them to get better. So we expect the margins to look better going forward.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. So you just have easier comps as you kind of head through the year and \u2013 okay.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Yeah.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That seems to make sense.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","And the cost out will read out.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And the cost out. Okay. And then I guess maybe just lastly, you touched on V&C, but maybe just a real quick update on untangling those assets and your confidence on being able to close by month end?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","I have great confidence. I'm really grateful of the Pentair team and the Emerson people who've worked on it too. I'm grateful. I'm proud of the work they did. We've been ready to close this for a while, so \u2013 both sides. So I have high confidence that we can close when they tell us we can close.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. But is it \u2013 I mean, are you guys still planning to close this week or is this something that can push out a little bit further into May, June?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","In the coming days; we're waiting for two \u2013 we're waiting for Mexico and the United States and we feel good about them, but we can't close until we get the official word.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got you. Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Hammond, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just on the Electrical 2Q guide. I just want to get a better sense of kind of where the caution still lies. Just, it sounds like the order rates in Hoffman are better, MROs picking up in Thermal, and it seems like ERICO, 1Q is maybe the better trend versus 4Q. So, what gives you the most pause?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Just execution, Jeff. I mean I think \u2013 we want to see \u2013 we haven't grown at the mid-single-digit rate, as Randy mentioned, in a couple years. And when that happens, you've got to get your delivery and your execution done. We were moving a factory and we still are moving a factory. And we've received significant volume into that factory. And so, we delayed it from Q1 into Q2 and we're in the process of closing that factory, exiting it. And so, we're managing a lot of things simultaneously. That's all it is, Jeff.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. But there is no indication that there's any delivery issues or...","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","No.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","No.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then, just on the Water guide for 2Q, does that reflect any kind of timing or pull forward that you think might have happened in the 1Q results?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. It does. I mean, I think we usually know the pool season. But we can't always time it by the precision of the month. And so, we did have a strong Q1 and, therefore, we think it will be a slightly less strong Q2, still strong, but a little less strong, as we see how that sell-through gets managed and that inventory gets managed by distributors.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Walsh, Vertical Research.

Stauch - Pentair Plc","Good morning.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","A lot of ground covered, so just kind of two quick cleanup ones from me. In terms of the $21 million of restructuring, does that all have at least a 1 for 1 payback, and maybe you can characterize what those actions are?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. That $21 million is reflecting what we're talking about as the $75 million. So, it's better than 1 to 1, and that's the cost efforts \u2013 or that's the restructuring actions that are leading to the net cost out that we're referring to.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got you. Understood. And then as we think about the ability for additional capital allocation maybe kind of level set us what the number of capacity you have is? I mean if you go back \u2013 you used to talk about running the business 3 time levered. Is that still right? Is it closer to 2? How should we think about that just to kind of level set us all on what the actual capacity you're thinking about?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","I think about 2.5 is the steady state. We can go above 3 occasionally, but 2.5, 3 at the top.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","All right. Great.

Hogan - Pentair Plc","Good morning, Nathan.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","You guys took the organic sales number up a point. Can you maybe split that out between the impact of raw material inflation and assumed price increases and volume increases?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","I don't know if I understand it. I mean you said...","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Price and volume.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Price and volume. Okay. I mean, all we did was take the Q1 number and we let it ride through the year. We kept Q2, Q3, and Q4 exactly the same, adjusting only for the debt in V&C. So, I think, I would answer your question it was all volume.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So, in your guidance for the rest of the year for the top-line, there's no impact from assumed price increases in response to these raw material increases?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","No, there is none.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And then, on the 4Q call, you guys had guided to $39 million of large project headwinds and that shook out at $49 million. Can you reconcile those two numbers?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. There's an incremental $10 million related to project accruals that we took in Q1 that were anticipated project settlement cost that we had related to those projects last year. So, it took down the revenue number in Q1 by approximately $10 million.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. That's all I had. Thank you. I'll stick to my two questions.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Drab, William Blair. Your line is open.","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask on the raw materials again. I don't know, John, if you could give us any sort of sense or how cost breaks down in terms of raws, overhead, labor? And then within the materials, how big a percentage is steel versus copper? And the main thing that I am still just trying to figure out is how do you deal with 50%-ish increase in steel and these other raws and only increase \u2013 have to increase price 1 to 2 points to stay flat in terms of that headwind or tailwind that you mentioned that went from 15 to flat on raws?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. So real quick, I think we don't want to overdo this. I think our material is 38% of sales, right, roughly for Pentair. And our largest commodity purchase is around $200 million and most of the other clients we're talking to is about $100 million, $150 million on an annual basis. So, the big increases are also mitigated by the locks that we talked about earlier, but the timing of when we lock versus the timing when we price is sometimes disconnected. So, we're identifying maybe $10 million to $12 million material risks in the back half of the year.","And if the volumes continue, we feel like we've got enough to offset that right now, even if we didn't get incremental price increases. But we're monitoring all this as we go through the year and we're listening to the same earnings call as you are. And we're hearing that price isn't easy to come by in the end markets. And that's why we're not as confident that we can just push through another price increase. So that's what we're managing. And right now I just want to clarify. We have not adjusted Q2, Q3 and Q4. And we're admitting that there might be some upside volume but we're also sharing with you that there could be some upside material risk \u2013 or downside material risk.","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay. Got it. And then, I think I just missed this earlier but did you talk about pre-buy activity in the Aquatics business first quarter 2017 versus first quarter 2016 and maybe what the difference in incentives were between those period?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","There was really no difference, actually. The higher growth was really just normal business. It wasn't early buy.","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Product going though.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Which is \u2013 yeah, just standard order, which is a bullish sign on us in a bullish business.","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","All right. Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Good morning.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Good morning.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Would you mind giving us some color on how you expect each of these sub-segments to track this year within Water and within Electrical?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Well, we talk about the segments, is that what you're asking about?","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Like the general outlook for growth in Enclosures versus Thermal versus Electrical and Filtration versus Flow versus Aquatic?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. I think that's a little more granular than we'd want to go to at this point for a forecast. I mean, what I said was what we gave on the \u2013 whatever we gave for guidance in Q4, into Q1 the only thing that's changed is Q1 performance and we haven't assumed any updates to the forecast of any of these throughout the year. And that's why we're waiting, is to see how Q2 comes out and then we would update all this information.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. And the $15 million of favorability on price or cost \u2013 was that \u2013 that went to flat. Is that a net number, price net of cost?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","That's material source net of inflation.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. And then just to \u2013 yeah, I'm sorry.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","$15 million was assumed and what I'm saying is a worst-case scenario would be close to flat.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. So, flat is not in the outlook?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Flat is not currently in this outlook, no.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","I see. And then just finally, earlier, John, I think you'd made a comment that it's kind of easier or harder to get price in some places than others, I guess just depending on that end market dynamics. And where are the areas that are a little more challenging to get price now?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Basically fast growth markets is always a challenge. That's the most challenging place. And, as John said, we're dollar-denominated in most \u2013 to the most part and so the dollar is strong, so any place where we're competing with the euro-based competitors.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. Thank you.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Didn't we hear from you? Hey, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Yeah. Just with Deane taking a shot at me, I just wanted to clarify that you guys didn't feel about sort of like some other companies do. So it was a very trend intro. And the fact that I'm getting a follow-up here means that we could end the call 10 minutes early but I just wanted to clarify something. On the proceeds, you had said $3 billion or something like that. Is there any change in the amount of net proceeds you're going to pull in here or is it still the same? I think you had initially said $2.6 billion, maybe just rounding.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Hi, Steve. You're listening. It was originally $2.7 billion. We are approaching closer to the $3 billion mark. We believe the taxes are going to be a little bit more favorable to us than originally estimated. And then we also have timings of the accruals and the working capital and the cash performance of the business.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I'll leave the small talk \u2013 the rest of small talks for offline with Jim. Thanks a lot, guys.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","This ends the Q&A session of the call. And we'll now turn it back over to Randy Hogan for final comments.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","All right. Thank you. Thanks all for your interest and all the questions. As we communicated last quarter, 2017 is a transition year for Pentair. And we believe that our first quarter performance is a solid start. We're days away from the expected closing of our sales of Valves & Controls and look forward to regaining a stronger balance sheet.","Of course we're going to remain disciplined in our capital allocation strategies. When we have more on that, we will announce it. We're even more confident in our ability to drive double-digit EPS growth for full year 2017.

Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased with our first quarter result, beating the expectation set at the beginning of the year. The top line was consistent with expectations, and we saw a strong execution in all businesses led by three segments delivering over 100 basis points of margin expansion each.","We recently announced a new leader for our Valves & Controls segment. We're all glad to have Dennis Cassidy join us most recently from AlixPartners. I appreciate John Stauch leaning in and leading Valves & Controls the past few quarters; and Valves & Controls business delivered first quarter results in line with our guidance.","Integration of ERICO is meeting our expectations, and we believe we're on track to meet or exceed the $10 million in synergies we targeted.","Free cash flow, while a seasonally usage during the quarter, was much better than the comparable period last year. Given the strong start to free cash flow this year, we feel good about our ability to deliver approximately $750 million in free cash this year.","We're maintaining our 2016 full-year adjusted EPS outlook of $4.05 to $4.25 per share. Execution for cash and earnings remain our key focus in the first quarter given the good start to the year.","Now, let's turn to slide 5 for a discussion of our Q1 2016 results in more detail. First quarter core sales grew 1%, which is an improvement from the declines we saw the past couple of quarters. Three over four segments met or beat their top-line commitments with Flow & Filtration Solutions being negatively impacted by timing of beverage shipments.","ERICO contributed positively with sales in line with our expectations. Segment income increased 5% and return on sales contracted 20 basis points to 13.3%. Three segments delivered margin expansion greater than 100 basis points, and Valves & Controls met its first quarter income and margin commitments.","Adjusted EPS was flat at $0.76 per share and was ahead of our guidance of $0.70 to $0.72 per share. As I mentioned previously, free cash flow started much better this year with a small usage in the quarter, and it was over a $100 million improvement year-over-year.","Now, let's turn to slide 6 for more details on Pentair's Q1 2016 performance. Our sales performance by vertical was mixed with strong growth in Residential & Commercial and in Infrastructure, which helped partially offset continued sluggishness in Energy. We saw some signs of stabilization in our Industrial businesses. And while Food & Beverage was down in the quarter, we continue to believe this vertical will deliver full year growth, as shipments in our Beverage business can be choppy.","Our largest vertical, Residential & Commercial, saw 11% sales growth to start the year led by double-digit growth in Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions and solid growth in Flow & Filtration Solutions.","Infrastructure did turn positive on strength in both North American Municipal Pumps and improved project activity in our Process Filtration business globally. The rate of decline within Industrial moderated for the quarter, and we're encouraged by what we believe are signs of stabilization in this, our second largest vertical.","Food & Beverage started the year slowly, impacting our Flow & Filtration Solution results, that is principally the result of timing around Beverage shipments I mentioned and ongoing weakness in Irrigation.","It's no surprise that Energy remains weak. And while we expected this vertical to continue to be down this year, we believe our non-Energy businesses are positioned to more than compensate for this weakness. Energy now represents just over 20% of our sales and an even smaller percentage of our profits. We continue to believe the remaining 80% of our portfolio is well positioned particularly, within Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage verticals.","As you can see on the right-hand side of the page, productivity remains strong and more than offset inflation. Price was a modest positive in the quarter, and ERICO contributed strength to the bottom line on strong underlying performance and synergies.","Now, let's turn to slide seven for a review of our segment and major platform structure. We want to remind everyone of the alignment of our businesses which we introduced at our Investor Day last November. Underneath, are four segments, we've grouped activities into 10 strategic business groups or SBGs to better prioritize our resource allocation across the company.","We'll discuss the SBG performance within each segment. For a more detailed look at each SBG, please refer to our presentation on our website from the 2015 Investor Day. Our Water business is split between two segments, with Flow & Filtration Solutions focused around a solutions approach and Water Quality Systems business, aligned by product distribution.","Technical Solutions has three well-positioned electrical businesses. And we've realigned our Valves & Controls business around two key selling motions: aftermarket and projects. The key distinction in all of these SBGs is that we can differentiate any investments more clearly between them.","Now, let's turn to slide eight for a look at Water Quality Systems performance in Q1. Water Quality Systems delivered another strong quarter with 9% core sales growth. The Aquatic & Environmental Systems business grew 13% organically as the North American pool season got off to a strong start and aquaculture continued to grow nicely. Water Filtration grew core sales 5% with particular strength continuing in our residential filtration business.","Segment income grew an impressive 19% and return on sales expanded 170 basis points to 18.6%. Robust operating leverage was a key contributor in margin expansion in the quarter even as we increased our growth investments to maintain the strong momentum that Water Quality Systems has delivered the past several years.","Now, let's move to slide nine for a look at Flow & Filtration Solutions performance in Q1. Flow & Filtration saw revenue decline 4%, with core sales down 2% and negative FX translation of another 2%. We had anticipated the segment's return to growth in the first quarter and while the infrastructure growth was as expected, the Food & Beverage performance was negatively impacted by the timing of those beverage shipments.","We were encouraged with double-digit order growth in beverage still. But given the current state of consolidation in the beer industry in particular, choppiness in sales is expected to be a trend quarter-to-quarter in the near term.","Water Technologies saw core sales declined 1% as strength in Residential & Commercial and infrastructure pump shipments were more than offset by double-digit declines in irrigation pump shipments. We believe the strength in Residential & Commercial will continue into the seasonally strong second quarter and the longer cycle Infrastructure business will continue to grow based on a solid backlog and a strong quote funnel.","Core sales in Fluid Solutions declined 5% due to the previously mentioned delays in Beverage shipments but our precision spray business grew in the quarter. Process Filtration had good core sales growth of 4% as we continue to see momentum build from our focus on industrial water reuse solutions and some improvement in infrastructure which includes a couple of desalination projects.","Segment income grew 9% and return on sales expanded 130 basis points to 11.7%. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of margin expansion as our execution has improved within the segment. Still, we believe there's a long runway ahead for further margin improvement particularly when the top line returns to growth.","Now, let's turn to slide 10 to discuss how Technical Solutions performed in Q1. Technical Solutions reported 33% sales growth for the quarter consisting of 5% core sales growth, a 2% headwind from FX and a 30% positive contribution from ERICO.","Core sales on Enclosures declined 5% as the pressure we saw on our short cycle industrial business late last year persisted. While the year-over-year comparisons we expected remain challenging in the second quarter, we were encouraged to see stabilization in the daily order rate in the quarter and continue to expect easier comparisons in the back half of the year as a result.","Thermal Management experienced impressive core sales growth of 22% as two projects in Canada are nearing completion. The Industrial Heat Tracing business continues to see wins in its smaller project business while its more profitable products business remains weak. The Thermal Building business also had a strong quarter.","While the results of ERICO are captured as acquisition contribution, the business performed in line with our expectations. As a reminder, over 75% of ERICO's sales are into commercial end markets, which remain very healthy in the quarter. We believe we are on track to deliver over $10 million in synergies for the year on top of the base business' attractive profitability.","Segment income grew 45% and return on sales expanded an impressive 190 basis points to 21.5%. Despite negative mix in Thermal Management and some price pressures in Enclosures, strong productivity and the positive contribution from ERICO helped drive margin expansion in the quarter.","While core sales are expected to turn negative for the remainder of the year due to the two large Thermal projects ending, we believe Technical Solutions is well positioned to deliver strong income growth and margin expansion due, in large part, to strong execution with the ERICO integration and a strong culture around productivity across the whole segment.","Now, let's move to slide 11 to discuss the Valves & Controls' performance in Q1. Valves & Controls reported a 10% decline in revenue with core sales down 7% and a 3% headwind from FX. Most importantly, the top line was in line with our expectations. Backlog was down 2% sequentially, which includes negative FX translation. Core orders were down 11% year-over-year, consistent with the double-digit rate of decline that's been experienced the past several quarters.","Core sales were down 9% in Aftermarket and down 4% on projects, as the business continues to ship out of backlog. We expected Aftermarket to start the year slowly as customers were finalizing their budgets, and OpEx continues to be constrained right along with CapEx at many customers. In the second quarter, we'll watch closely both Aftermarket sales and orders but we remain very cautious since it's not clear whether energy markets have found bottom.","The right half of the page shows first quarter Segment income and return on sales, which both met our forecast. It was just under one year ago when we saw an acceleration in the rate of decline in the business, and I asked John to step in and lead the business on an interim basis, as we searched for a new leader of the segment, which, of course, we just recently filled. I'm very pleased with the entire Valves & Controls leadership team's resilience during these difficult times. And I want to personally thank them for their tenacious leadership. While the business continues watching for signs of stabilization on orders, they've accomplished a lot the past several quarters in rightsizing the business to today's hard reality.","We've believed for some time that the downturn in energy is more than cyclical and we've acted accordingly. Over the past 12 months, we've realigned the business to reflect the energy industry decline resulting in head count reductions of over 20%. It hasn't been easy but it was necessary. I would also like to point out that these rightsizing actions were started a year ago and are on top of what we've already accomplished since we acquired the business three-and-a-half years ago.","To put it in perspective, we reduced the number of ERPs, accounting centers and other back-office functions by over 40% and the manufacturing footprint is 30% smaller. While these are steps in the right direction, there's still more opportunity and work to be done.","Under Dennis' leadership and with a strong team in place, we believe that Valves & Controls will be well-positioned for an eventual recovery in its end markets. While we expect revenue to recover to be a couple of years away yet, we continue to take actions aimed at improving profitability even this year.","So, the 6.5% return on sales in Q1 is not indicative of our current cost structure. We expect improved margins each quarter this year as 2015 higher cost inventory works its way through the income statement in the first half. Our prior communication of $100 million in cost-out benefit in 2016 is on track, and we continue to expect to exit the year with margins in the teens and full year margins just north of 10%, even on muted sales.","Now, let's turn to slide 12 for a look at the Valves & Controls backlog. As you can see on this slide, short cycle orders were down 5% and long cycle orders declined 18%. The short cycle weakness was more acute in Europe, but the U.S. also was weak as customers continue to defer maintenance. This was not just in oil and gas, but also in power and mining. We'll watch orders closely to see when customers begin to start spending OpEx once again.","The weakness on the project side was broad based with CapEx budgets being cut across the board. The quoting funnel appears to be slowly improving, particularly in LNG and petrochem, but we're not expecting a big increase in orders. We continue to believe there is potential for orders to find a bottom in the second half in projects though.","Second quarter orders will be instructive in seeing if the quote funnel begins to bear fruit, and we'll remain cautious and interested to see if there are signs of stabilization in the short cycle business. We will continue to focus on capitalizing on opportunities, particularly where we can leverage the breadth of the entire Valves & Controls portfolio.","Now, let's move to slide 13 to provide an update in our segment positioning. Before I turn the call over to John to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year, I wanted to provide an update on our segment positioning and comment on the reordering of the segments.","While Valves & Controls has received a lot of attention the past 18 months, the business has worked to aggressively reposition itself in the face of the significant reset in the energy industry. And now the segment is expected to contribute only 15% of this year's Pentair income. We believe the other 85% of the portfolio is well-positioned, and we remain excited about the opportunities in these other three segments.","We have two high-performing segments today in Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions. Flow & Filtration Solutions has made good progress in improving its margin and cash flow while positioning for a return to growth. This chart shows the progress against each segment's priorities. We introduced these priorities at our Investor Day last November, and highlighted them once again in our 2016 outlook call last December. Both Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions have continued to perform, and we believe they're well-positioned to build on their momentum.","We're encouraged with the improvements in margin and cash flow at Flow & Filtration Solutions. And as the business continues to gain traction in moving to a solutions provider from a manufacturer of components, we expect organic growth to not only return, but to become more consistent and predictable, given their portfolio is well-aligned to grow with macro trends, particularly in Food and Beverage.","So, 2016 has started off as we expected. We believe our Water and Electrical businesses are well-positioned to continue delivering strong results, and Valves & Controls has become a smaller piece of the portfolio as a result of the energy industry reset, and we're making good progress in stabilizing and right-sizing that business. Cash and earnings execution remain the mantra for 2016, and we're focused on delivering our commitments to our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Randy. Please turn to slide number 14, titled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. We ended the first quarter with $4.8 billion of net debt inclusive of cash on hand. This is a slight increase from our year-end debt levels due to seasonal working capital build, particularly in our residential and commercial businesses. As Randy mentioned earlier, our free cash flow was over $100 million better to start the year versus the comparable period last year. While we did consume minimal cash in the quarter, in line with historical patterns, we continue to expect to deliver our free cash flow target of approximately $750 million for the year.","Our ROIC ended the quarter at 9.6%. Our capital expenditure forecast remains unchanged at approximately $150 million as we continue to invest in the businesses that have earned the right to grow, especially Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions and drive deeper disciplines into our Valves & Controls factories.","Please turn to slide 15 labeled Q2 2016 Pentair outlook. For the second quarter, we expect core sales to decline approximately 3% and total sales to increase 4% inclusive of FX headwinds and a positive contribution from ERICO. On a core sales basis, we expect Water Quality Systems to grow approximately 5% as the segment enters its seasonally strongest period. Flow & Filtration Solutions' core sales are expected to be up modestly as the business continues to reposition itself and comparisons become easier.","Technical Solutions is expected to have a core sales decline of roughly 3% as two projects in the Thermal Management business are completed and Enclosures faces another tough year-over-year comparison. Finally, Valves & Controls core sales are expected to decline approximately 13% as the project backlog remains weak and we remain cautious in the short term as to whether the Aftermarket business will accelerate after the slow start to the year. We are expecting segment income to increase approximately 5% and return on sales to be roughly flat at 16.5%.","Below the operating income line, we continue to expect the tax rate to remain around 20.5%. Net interest and other to approximate $35 million and shares outstanding to be just over 182 million. Our second quarter adjusted EPS guidance is $1.08 to $1.11, which is an increase of approximately 2% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect a seasonal ramp-up in free cash flow and further improvement in our working capital performance.","Please turn to slide 16 labeled Full Year 2016 Pentair Outlook. We are maintaining our full-year adjusted EPS outlook of $4.05 to $4.25 with very few changes to our prior forecast. For the full year, we still expect total Pentair core sales to decline approximately 1%. Water Quality Systems full-year core sales are anticipated to be up approximately 5% as both its Aquatic and Environmental Systems and Water Filtration businesses are well positioned to continue driving the growth rates experienced the last several years.","Flow & Filtration Solutions core sales are expected to be up approximately 2% for the full year, led by stabilization in Water Technologies and growth in both Fluid Solutions and Process Filtration. Technical Solutions is expected to see core sales decline roughly 2%, which is slightly better than our prior forecast, as the Thermal Management backlog has grown and we have seen stabilization in Enclosures daily order rates. Finally, Valves & Controls core sales are still expected to decline roughly 8% given our current view of orders for the full year.","We expect segment income to grow roughly 9% and return on sales to expand approximately 90 basis points to 16.5% with three of our four segments delivering full-year margin expansion. We continue to anticipate full-year corporate cost to be just over $90 million, net interest and other roughly $140 million and the share count to be just over 182 million; all essentially in line with previous expectations. Adjusted EPS is expected to be up approximately 5% to midpoint of the range. Finally, we expect a strong year of free cash flow at approximately $750 million, which represents roughly 100% of our adjusted net income.","Steve, can you please open the line for questions? Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. And your first question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys, and good morning.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Just a couple of quick questions. The first one is can you maybe comment on the treasury rules and regulations that came out, particularly regarding earnings stripping and the impact you see on Pentair's tax rate over time?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Steve. Still obviously, processing, it's a very generic rule now. We've got to look into the specificity of all of it. But in the next several years or at least the longer term, for however long we have the debt in place, we don't see any impact to our overall tax rate. But clearly, the rules would challenge acquiring North American businesses and layering on new debt onto those businesses.","So, we would have to take advantage of our operational synergies to get to those tax synergies that we would have. And, clearly, any acquisition in the future needs to strategically fit and be an operational synergistic acquisition, and then we would look to utilize our advantaged structure to still gain the cash fluidity and then, ultimately, advance the cash strategies on a more permanent basis.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then there's been quite a lot of speculation, Randy, about how you're positioning Valves & Controls. Clearly, you've been improving the business and we can see that. But part of that debate is whether Pentair is a consolidator or consolidatee in this business over time or what your desire is? Can you maybe comment on how you're thinking about it?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, yeah, I think there's been some confusion about that. I think it was not a secret that we saw ourselves with our structure and with this really great business that we have in Valves & Controls. And in a fragmented industry like Valves & Controls, or in Flow in general, as a likely consolidator. And what I've said is right now, we're not focused on being a consolidator. We're focused on fixing what we got.","So, our focus really is on continuing to get our margins back. And we believe, as I've mentioned in the prepared remarks, we believe we are on the road to do that. We'd like to see the first quarter be the natter, if you will, on return on sales for the business, and continue to execute, because the business has a lot of headroom. Even without revenue, as I've said, even without revenue recovery, I believe we can get back to teens. And we want to prove that.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And just when...","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't want to be laying stuff over it at this point.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. That's clear. And just a quick one, organic growth ex those large projects, the large thermal projects in the quarter, what was that if you took those out, the big one?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Flattish.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. I'll pass it on.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC. Your line is now open.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Deane.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, in Water Quality specifically Aquatics, that's impressive core revenue growth of 13%. So, it looks like you got off to a strong spring selling season in pool. Anything regarding like a pre-buy that happened? Are there going to be any comp issues? And how does this business set up for the second quarter, because that's also seasonally important?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Deane. Our dealers are the pool builders. They exited last year with a pretty good backlog of pools unbuilt. So they entered the year with a backlog of business to do, plus we have all the rebate programs and all the advanced equipment, the Eco Select line we have.","So we really think it's \u2013 there's share gain, but it's generally market. There's not a lot of pre-buy. The early-buy program we had was not remarkable. And so a lot of this is not the big early-buy product but real \u2013 if you will, stocking to sell through or normal seasonal stocking to sell through. So we've had a lot of momentum in that business and we continue to invest in that business in sales and in new product development in order to keep the momentum going.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Do you have a sense of the product vitality of your pool equipment recently? I know you had the IntelliFlo, but just how much of that product line is new in the last three years?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think I'll get the number wrong. It's close to 30% right now. And it's not just the IntelliFlo \u2013 in fact, we have a new \u2013 the next versions of IntelliFlo are coming now. But there's new controls, there's new LED lighting, there's new heaters. There's really a complete new suite of product, all aimed at fitting that Eco Select sustainability mark.","And as you \u2013 I think as you saw we just got the third ENERGY STAR award from the EPA which makes us a sustained sustainer. I don't think they call it. So, we feel really good about that business, and we got a lot more growth. And, as you know, that was the basis, it was our strength there, that was the basis of foundation of our aquaculture business, which is, again, just managing bodies of water.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Understood. And then, over on the Valves & Controls side, so you've added Dennis Cassidy to the team. And I'm interested in hearing, as you bring him onboard, he's coming in midstream and that's an unfortunate pun, but he's onboard when you already have an existing restructuring plan, existing commitments and just what's the continuity in terms of leadership there? Was John going to be still part-time there? Does he roll off? And should we expect any tweaking to the plan and the commitments because you said you're going to exit 2016 which will be if the math works in the teens in margins. I just want to know what kind of variability there might be with the change in leadership?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, it took us a while to find the right person for the reason that the business is facing some challenges and we needed someone who's up to it. I'm quite excited to have Dennis. Dennis from AlixPartners, I know AlixPartners has a reputation for transformations and restructuring. And he has some of that experience, but he also has some extraordinarily deep and successful experience doing value stream transformations in the oilfield services business. And he's deeply engaged in the energy field.","So, as we \u2013 well, let me back up. He spent a lot of time getting to know the business and the programs that are in place, and he's totally onboard with them. And he'll tweak them, and he certainly has \u2013 as president, he has full right to do that. But, it's again, tweak to, tweak, it'll be tweaks to get us to the objectives we have.","One area where he will be very focused is on these two value streams, Aftermarket and Projects and tuning, if you will, the business, so that we can really focus on the Aftermarket so that as it comes back, we can gain share there. I think, as we've said before, we really didn't differentiate the way we served Aftermarket versus Project. And by tuning the system, we believe that we can get growth in that market. And the fact that he's intimate with the industry is really, really beneficial and that he's done things like this before. As for John, he's back to being CFO full time and Dennis doesn't need his help anymore than, what he'll get with John as CFO.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And that's plenty.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great to hear. Thank you.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Joe.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Joe.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. So, I heard a few times in your script, you guys mentioned the word stabilization. And so, I want to touch on that a little bit, specifically is it relates to the order rates what you're seeing in your front log in Industrials. And, I guess, what implication, if anything, did that have to the guidance range \u2013 did the guidance raise you had in Tech Solutions?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I can answer that, Joe. I mean, very little. I think the word stabilization is really related to the fact that when we exited Q4, we saw double-digit declines in our North American Industrial space. And clearly, Q1 became a big quarter to see if that was going to continue or start to recover in. Clearly, we had achieved our expectation in Q1, but we also saw order rates on a daily basis start to, as we said, stabilize, which means becoming less worse and starting to improve on a day-to-day basis.","A long way to what we'd say is a growth recovery but certainly gives us more confidence of the Enclosures business and also the North American Industrial hitting its expectations for the year.","The tweaks to Technical Solutions are really around, we continue to build a project backlog in the Industrial Heat Trace business. We feel really good about that backlog. It is impacting margins slightly, but we ultimately feel that that project backlog will shift this year, and that was our tweak to the revenue numbers in Technical Solutions.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And just was there any change to the kind of $30 million to $40 million headwind that you guys expected to see from the megaprojects rolling down?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, there isn't. It's the same.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then, I guess, maybe my follow-up question, just touching V&C. So, you hit your margin target for the first quarter. And clearly, there's a ramp in your guidance for the remainder of the year. Can you just kind of touch on the key factors that are going to help you get to that ramp? I think, last quarter, we touched on short-cycle mix. There was something related to your inventories as well. Maybe touch on the factors that are going to allow you to get from the 6.5% to teens margin in V&C as we progress through the year.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think Randy said it very eloquently in his script on last year's higher inventory rolling off this year. And to help you quantify that, let's think of somewhere around $25 million of cost that needs to roll into the first half of the year. And you can think about that split between Q1 and Q2. And if you think about that as last year's coming in and we've got our cost base now in line with what we're shipping and building, you kind of see the headwinds that we're factoring in Q1 and Q2 that are no longer there in Q3 and Q4. Plus, we see the acceleration of a lot of the head count actions and people-related cost-out actions come into the benefit to Q3 and Q4 as well. So, very little revenue expectations from a standpoint of anything beyond what's in the backlog and still assuming double-digit declines in aftermarket in Q2. And it's really about the actions we took last year and the timing of how those actions flow through between Q2, Q3 and Q4.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, I just wanted to be clear on the tax question. So, is there \u2013 like, is there risk that the tax rate is going up or what are you kind of messaging here? That there's kind of TBDs that need to be worked out? What is kind of the final message on that for now?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The simple answer is everything they've announced has nothing to do with anyone who's already got the structure, and we already got the structure. That's point one. Point two is we have to figure out what it means for things we do in the future. But right now, we're not doing anything because we're focused on cash and earnings execution.","But when we get back to doing acquisitions, we're going to have to look to see what the impact is in terms of what's called the debt pushdown strategy, what they called earnings stripping. We still \u2013 on whatever we do, we'll still have the opportunities to focus on operating synergies, as John said. And we still have the ability to move cash around freely which is an extraordinary advantage that doesn't get focused on as much in our tax structure versus our former tax structure.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. And you don't have to keep as you grow earnings, you don't have to keep adding inter-company debt to kind of make sure that that extra income is shielded, for lack of a better term?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. On the Valves, I think, you made \u2013 I joined the call a little bit late, but I think you called the Valves recovery two years out. Can you just maybe expand on that a little more? Does that mean you don't expect growth until really 2018, is that a simple way of saying that?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. What we said was that we \u2013 and it was an imprecise comment. It was actually an adlib off the script. We think there's a chance that project orders will bottom out in the second half this year which wouldn't give us growth until next year, second part of 2017 \u2013 so, maybe 18 months. Right now, we're not clairvoyant. But if we saw projects start to recover in the second half then ultimately it will give us growth about (36:16).","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, can you grow in 2017 do you think at this stage?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think we can grow in 2017.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Particularly, Aftermarket has to come back. I mean, the fact that Aftermarket is down and short cycle. Basically, there's a continuum of ongoing maintenance. There's must do. There's good to do. And there's nice to do. And right now, they've taken a cleaver to all their spending and it's just bang, down 40% and so, they haven't really fully sorted it out, and to the OpEx too. Now, they got to get back to the must dos and the should dos but they don't have to get back to the nice to dos.","So, that's what we want to be close to and help them as they sort out \u2013 now, they've insourced things they're going to figure out longer term that they probably should be outsourcing things. It's very fluid.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Steve, I think real quickly, I just add to what Randy said. I mean, I don't think we see or we'll be able to call the recovery this year. Which means, any growth we get will be our backlog plus modest expected growth in 2017. Given where we are in the base this year, we would expect to grow modestly next year, continue to work the cost actions that we need to, and then any long-term recovery or rapid recovery is definitely in our views beyond 2017.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then one last question just on the Flow & Filtration segment. I think that implies a relatively strong back half of the year. Is that some lumpiness in Food and Beverage? What's kind of the driver there?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It's just Food and Beverage. I think what we've got is we've got a little bit of customers who have completed some consolidations and they're a little bit more lumpier in their execution of the projects and how their letting the capital flow through. And so, while we still have a very solid backlog, we're seeing a little bit of retiming of that backlog, which is impacting what quarter that ships.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks a lot. Way to go.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Your line is now open.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Shannon.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. On Valves & Controls, just in terms of actually hitting the forecast this quarter, that seems regardless of what the actual numbers were, it was on plan, which has been a challenge. John, can you talk about kind of the actions you took while you were there? And do you feel changes you've made to the processes there are going to enable more kind of reliable delivery on forecasts regardless of what those forecasts actually are?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I appreciate that, Shannon. I think what Randy and I are introducing, and what I took into the business and we tried to improve the discipline is there's known ways to think of project execution and working long-cycle businesses and project backlog. You start out with a shippable backlog, and then you get \u2013 you look at standard deviation and what's going to happen between being pushed out or pulled in? Customers are always going to retime you. But if you look at that over a period of time, it's always a percentage of the backlog.","And what happens is people work deep in the business is they have a lot of hope in their forecast, that all, everything is going to be good and nothing bad is going to happen. And so, when you take a look at it at a high level, we just started to take out those stretches from the expectations and, really, build on the precision of what's going to get shipped out on a weekly basis.","And I really think that muscle has now been developed and built within the team. And I'm very proud of what they've accomplished, as Randy mentioned. And, I think, we're going to be much more predictable as we go forward. So, that's what I would say...","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd add in complement to you John. If you will, the algorithms, there was not great coordination between the sales forecast, the operating forecast and the materials forecast and the finance forecast. They were not \u2013 as you said, there was assumptions. But I mean, John, really streamlined that, got people talking and we have higher quality forecasts now. And this is the second quarter. I mean, we hit the fourth quarter too.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, we're a long way away from a perfect SIOP (40:51) process. But, I think, we're on our way to getting the expectations aligned and, therefore, not trying to have anticipated production against demand that's not needed.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. No that helps. Thanks.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","And then just a little follow-up on the stabilization in Enclosures. You talked about exiting last year down double-digits, and then getting less negative. Are we turning positive yet? Or when do you expect it to turn positive, maybe just a little bit more of the cadence to that daily sale (41:08)?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. No. We haven't turned positive yet. And so, what we're saying is, if we stay at the level we're at when we start lapping the second half, the comps will look better, But we're not \u2013 I would call bouncing along the bottom, maybe.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We think we get back to flattish as we exit Q3 and maybe some slight increase in Q4 Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Howard from Baird. Your line is now open.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Morning, everyone.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Mike.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","So, just continuing that thought process then, when you think about stabilization beyond just the Enclosures piece, are you at the point where you're starting to see a little bit more normal sequential patterns through the year? And when you get towards the back half of the year, is there any fundamental improvement embedded in some of those kind of core industrial markets or is it just following that normal sequential pattern?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Yeah. I think we are getting back to sort of more normal expectations. I think one of the learnings for everybody is that when the Energy business spends $1 trillion a year, and goes down to $600 million a year, the knock-on effect into many other industries is pretty profound. And that's really what's I think is the core driver of a lot of the \u2013 what we call Industrial, but sort of the second order effect of the cuts in the Energy business.","And so, those are getting sorted out. I mean, people are adjusting to the new reality at this new level. And so, I think we'll see more seasonality. And, as John said, we're hopeful that there'll be an increase in the fourth quarter. We typically would see a bump in the fourth quarter in Industrial so.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And then on the Aftermarket side, you guys talked about insourcing versus outsourcing before and obviously still competitive out there. But when you think about what the competition is doing, not so much some of the larger valve guys, but some of the smaller valve guys, what are you seeing with them and what are you seeing your customers doing? Is there a migration towards some of the lower cost guys at this point and how are you defending core share?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We're certainly looking out for that, but I think what's happening right now is dynamic. First of all, we've got the cutback of OpEx because it's a spend. But the downstream right now is where all the cash is being generated on for our customers' customers, and they're running them full out to bring cash into the organization. And so, a lot of the deferrals are still happening because we don't have the planned shutdowns we used to have.","As Randy mentioned, you can only do that for so long and then ultimately you got to \u2013 you do the shutdown. Now, we haven't assumed any recovery in Q2 in that pattern, and we're thinking that that's more likely a Q3 event.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And just from that perspective, what do you guys need to see besides time? Is there anything specific or is it just time needs to push on and then these guys can come back to the market again?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I mean, what they need to do, our customers need to adjust to the fact that this may not recover soon. So, they have to adjust their own operating practices. So, I mean, it's not just the maintenance but the first thing you do when you have downturn like this is before you lay people off, you insource everything. You can't end up bringing maintenance in-house. And then when you start realizing that that's not as efficient as if I have a contractor do it, you end up then going out more aggressively. It's not a mystery. I mean, this is what we are expecting.","So, we want to be in a position. That's one of the reasons why we want to focus more in Valves & Controls on the aftermarket value stream is so that we can be in a position to be that provider on valves because with the breadth of our product line, we \u2013 and with the service centers we have, we can be more aggressive as they make that next step and they haven't gotten to that next step yet.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks for the time.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","This is more of a question for John. You guys are looking to do a lot in your footprint rationalization plans over the next several years. I was just wondering if you can kind of give us a little bit more on the metrics, the factories, distribution centers closed, things that are in process and what have you. I know you've said that you feel good on track there, but it's still early and \u2013 I was just wondering if you could share some more metrics with us.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, to put that in perspective right now, we have 29 factories in Valves & Controls, and we have announced the closure of maybe two to three, well it is three factories. I think we're focused right now on making sure that we've got good standard work and that we've got good documentation as Lean generally requires you to do, because moving these factories is not very easy.","So, I don't think we're going to announce or discuss substantial factory reductions over the next several years. I think where the big opportunity is and where Dennis is focusing is, how do we improve the linearization within a quarter of how we're shipping, how do we reduce the inefficiencies, these are all great tools that, Lean brings that tool to the table.","And I think as far as the distribution in the outside service centers, we have 43 independent service centers that aren't part of a current distribution center or a customer's factory. I think the customer is going to help define that for us over the next three to four years because it's moving in-house into their operations is where we see it going because eliminating that brick and mortar in between us and them seems to be where the industry is heading.","So, I can't give you specifics, but I think there's opportunities in both of those areas. But I'd say on the factory side, I wouldn't expect very many closures in the next several years. I'd talked about optimization.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right. Fair enough. My follow-up is about the Valves & Controls split of revenues where you guys are calling that business essentially half aftermarket and MRO, and every valves company has their fair share of standard products. So, it just seems like half of the business coming from the aftermarket just seems like a pretty high number because typically when a standard valve fails, the end users essentially cuts it out and throws it in the garbage. So I'm just kind of wondering, is it possible that there are some CapEx from your customers in your aftermarket?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Look. Yeah. Let me \u2013 aftermarket, short answer. It is aftermarket in standard product because you can't tell the difference particularly if it's sold in the U.S. it is heavy distribution. If you've got a standard keystone butterfly valve, and it's sitting in stock, if it's going in to a new installation or replacement, you can't tell the difference. But it's the same selling motion.","So, to be precise, we put aftermarket and standard product together in the same selling motion because there's an urgency and an intimacy that you need with the customer in order to win. And we haven't had that clearer focus on it and that will help both the aftermarket, serviced valves and the standard replacement valves. Now when you get to engineered valve, it's closer to a project selling motion. So, we'll try to be more precise.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That sounds much more specific. Thank you. Would you say the standard valve product which is essentially a cat backs item, is that maybe half of the MRO?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it isn't always the CapEx, it's OpEx. The only difference between an operating expense dollar and a CapEx expense dollar is how the accounts treat it. And to me, it's money spent, and then different people control it. So you \u2013 I don't mean to be flip but the operating expenses to run a refinery, a petrochem plant, they're enormous. And a lot of it looks very much like \u2013 particularly in the standard valves side, it looks the same.","So, I think a lot of people, including us, were surprised by how much the OpEx spending was impacted given that it was the CapEx that was intended to be cut, but it's a blunt weapon, and we all know all that from our own, when we have to crank down costs, it's cranking down costs. We don't differentiate when there's an urgency about it. And then we get better, right? We say we got to put more into the efficiency of the existing plants and we've already cut as many projects as we can. So \u2013 I don't mean to go down to, into the depths here but, that's all I got.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you. I was just wondering, if you wouldn't mind, if I can just tack this one on. Could you tell us at all how April is looking outside of Valves & Controls?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, we don't do that.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean, it's all incorporated in our Q2 guide, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Fair enough. Thank you.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Nathan.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Nathan.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Let's start in Water Quality, some very nice margin expansion there. But, Randy, you also mentioned increased growth investments. Can you talk about the kind of investments that you're making there, and perhaps quantify the increased headwind. I know you're always making growth investments, but maybe the increased headwind to margins in the quarter?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We talked a lot about investing in products which we're doing both in Residential Filtration, a lot in Food Service, which is a really attractive business, and in the pool side. But in addition to that, we're making investments on the sales coverage side on our Residential Filtration business. We moved Residential Filtration to Karl Frykman and his Water Quality team about 18 months ago. And what we want to do is we want to replicate what we've done in Pool in the Residential Filtration business.","We're the largest maker of product and components for water treatment and water filtration in the world for residential. We are the largest. But we don't have the same kind of customer intimacy that we see that we have in the pool business that has turned into such a sweet business for us.","We believe that Residential might have the same potential for us. So what Karl and his team has done is they're replicating the kind of coverage, direct dealer coverage on the other side of distribution in order to drive brand and drive product adoption and get customer intimacy and getting voice of customer back to our product.","So, a lot of the investments are actually on the sales side and that's global and we're doing it in the United States. We're doing it in Europe and Canada. Less so, it's a different kind of coverage investment in the emerging markets. But I'm quite excited about the early returns on that. I don't think it's really affected our numbers yet, but it's given us great insight and I'm expecting great things.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And Nathan think about that as somewhere around $10 million to $12 million on an annualized basis.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","That's helpful. Thanks. Second one is on the Enclosures business. You talked about Industrial stabilizing, but there's also a bit with a couple mentions of some price pressure in Enclosures. Is that something you expect to continue as Industrial stabilizes, perhaps the pricing pressure eases, just how you're thinking about that?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. One of the things we're seeing is, we've been more aggressive on the Enclosure side of going back after what we would call modified standard product and there's a little more pricing pressure in that and that's what we're really seeing there. Plus there isn't a lot of commodity inflation, so there's not really a lot of price being passed on on the standard size. So, we're not assuming we're going to bounce back to getting 1 to 2 points of price, but we don't think it's a systemic issue.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Josh.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey. Could you just update us, John, on what you're seeing on the price cost side and how we should think about your guys' purchase commitments or hedges and how those weigh out over the course of the year? I guess, Valves & Controls is its own animal so maybe the rest of the portfolio?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, I'll hit Valves first, we said we expected roughly 4 points of price for the year and that includes standard product which is not a lot of price and then margin compression coming from the project side and I would say that that's still the right forecast. I think we hoped that that would be a little bit conservative I think right now, that's playing out to be realistic.","On the rest of the portfolio, very, very modest as far as what pricing we could get across the general portfolio, areas of two-step distribution we have normal price increases, we're seeing it. But for the most part, the low inflation on material, which are recognized as material productivity is leading to a more flattish pricing environment globally.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Is that \u2013 when is that gap largest just based on the timing of purchases as you see it today?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think you're seeing \u2013 in Q1, you see kind of by segment what the prices cause we break it out. And I think we expect that rate of price increases to be the \u2013 what we think for the rest of the year. But I think the inflation starts to become a little bit more on the raw material side as we move into Q3 and Q4. We're expecting some modest inflation the back half of the year, which then would lead to what does the pricing cycle look like for 2017.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got you. And just to shift over to the Food and Bev comments \u2013 I don't remember if you guys mentioned this in the script or not, but the push outs there, are those are all getting made up in 2Q or will those filter in as we move through the balance of the year?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Balance of the year.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got you. All right. Thanks, guys.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is open.","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. I just wanted to ask about the free...","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Brian.","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. Just wanted to ask about the free cash flow forecast. Having done about $635 million in 2015, you got the $100 million improvement in the first quarter of this year, and the target is $750 million. Just any thoughts regarding why we wouldn't see more significant year-over-year improvement as we move through the balance of 2016 given you're just \u2013 you're talking about these opportunities to further improve working capital as we move through the year.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think the linearity of the cash flow, first of all, great Q1 and I think the linearity looks a lot like last year. The opportunity to do better than $750 million would be incremental working capital opportunities, and right now, although we're making progress, we're not confident enough yet to say that we're going to realize those in 2016. So, it is the opportunity and now we got to get after it and make it a realized benefit in 2016.","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. And then could you give an update on the geographic trends that you're seeing in Water Quality. I think it was on the outlook call in December that you talked about the different geographies. You mentioned in Europe, you were seeing some strengths, but that it might be fueled largely by restocking, do you have a better sense for how much restocking was driving that growth, and have you seen any improvement in China? And then also if you could just comment on what you're seeing in North America? Thanks.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll grab it really quickly. I mean, first of all, we did see a recovery in China in Q1. It was nice to see. So, we saw a recapture of our normal sort of double-digit growth rates in the China space. Europe is stable, modest growth, single-digit core growth in Europe. And we had strong shipments in North America in the Water Quality side. So, overall, I think the developed region's doing well in that space as you would expect and then doing pretty well and seeing some recovery in China as we add new distributors, and we work on different distribution channels.","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","So, this wasn't just a blip in Europe, a positive blip with restocking you're seeing the continuation of that?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, Water Quality globally is a pretty good market. And it's up more in North America. It's up modest in Europe.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Which is good.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Really great. Yeah.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Eighteen months ago (58:51).","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, guys. Good morning.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Barry.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","So, just kind of a big picture question on the margin outlook, it's staying the same even though you came in ahead on 1Q and raised the outlook for growth in the highest-margin segment. I'd think FX would probably also be maybe a little less of a headwind. Is it that all just the kind of slight tweak to the Tech Solutions outlook, or is there anything else going on there?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's pretty much just Tech Solutions. And we feel good about the first quarter, it's kicked off the year well, but we're still pointing at the same commitments we made. Second quarter, we're focused on right now.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. Okay. And then in FFS, just to follow up on some of the questions about the shortfall there, is that delta between the down 2% that you did and the guided 4%, is that all in the Beverage shipments or is there anything else going on in there?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Irrigation was a little worse. I would \u2013 I almost going call it like \u2013 I think we whiffed that one, I think \u2013 before we got the plans finalized, we came out with a 4% organic growth in Q1. If we take a look at 2% for the year, just put that one on me, I don't think we had ever an expectation to deliver 4%, but we apologized and we said it would be up 4%.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, I think we start to think the municipal ramp and all the contribution in the back half of the year. And so, we think we ramp our organic core growth as the year goes along and...","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. Could you actually just shed a little light on what's going on in muni? It does sound like that's an end market that's been building momentum. It sounds like it was pretty good in the quarter.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think the break and fixes are starting to accelerate, and we're starting to see municipalities start to let some of those projects \u2013 and obviously not large ones, but we're seeing a market that's starting to grow 3% or 4% on a more sustained basis.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And globally it's still a good market as well.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. And the recovery in the beverage piece in FFS, is that all in the backlog? It's just timing or...","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Yes, it is.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Actually, they built backlog. We had a good orders quarter. So, there's still \u2013 we have a lot of newer technologies that are being applied, but it's just in a sense lumpy in terms of when they get shipped.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. And as those projects come on in Food & Bev, is that mix positive or negative?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's slightly negative. I mean we're putting a project in. We wait for the aftermarket to pick-up on the better margin rate.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. Thank you.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. Just a quick housekeeping. Can you highlight some of the biggest changes in the accruals for the quarter, and how they stack up against fourth quarter comparisons or back half-of-the-year comparisons?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","What do you mean by accruals?","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Well, are there any compensation accruals or any other accruals that might change the comparisons this year versus last year in Q1 and then in the back half of the year? Just something that we should be watching?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. The only one of note would be the incentive accrual or the compensation accruals in Q1 are generally different this year as we look at the vesting periods of directors and officers and so you can kind of see that if you take a look at a full year of 90 and roughly 30 in Q1. The rest of the quarters looks a lot more like last year from a seasonality standpoint, a little bit of a benefit in Q2.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then last, if I may, were there any particular variances, V&C was spot on but within the different segments, was there anything that stood out from forecast as it relates to labor and materials or productivity within the either different segments?","John L.

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned desal in industrial water reuse in your prepared remarks. And I am trying to remember, I don't think we've talked too much about that on calls in the recent past. So what are you seeing there?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We haven't talked much about it because it's been kind of dead.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Yeah.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, we're a large supplier of subsystems for desalination projects and they, after the financial crisis, they kind of went all soft around the world. And they're getting let loose. We have some in Eastern Europe. We have some in the Middle East.","And some on the industrial water reuse side, where everything is distressed, industrials don't vote, so they get curtailed on the water faster than anything and they're the ones that will be the early adopters of water reuse technologies which we have a number of different technologies applicable there. That's what we're talking about. And it's been a focus of ours. We've been trying to get more focus there. (1:04:41)","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Can you maybe scale that for us? Like how big was that at its peak for you? And where is that today, those two, like maybe those two businesses in terms of just overall size?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Probably $100-ish million and it's probably in the $20-ish million in the quarter.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Is that in the quarter or...","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. It's probably \u2013 yeah, it's roughly just less than $20 million on a quarterly basis and the $100 million is some was annual. So, we're down 20% from peak.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, okay. And then just last from me. Can you talk about the magnitude of the price pressure on the Aftermarket you've seen in V&C just on that piece of the business?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On the standard MRO side, it's not significant on a product versus a product basis. We are seeing a mix issue in the sense that the larger markets, North America and Europe, we're down substantially in the quarter and we saw some, the fast growth markets actually pick up on the Aftermarket side and the margins are slightly lower. But on a like-to-like product, roughly, around 1% to 1.5% is all we are seeing on the pricing at the moment.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Randall J.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Jim Lucas - Pentair Plc","Thanks, Scott, and welcome to Pentair's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. We're glad you can join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our third quarter 2016 performance as well as our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 outlook, as outlined in this morning's release.","Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-K and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results.","Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website.

We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions.","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Thanks, Jim, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll be starting on slide 4. We delivered third quarter results that operationally met the high end of our forecast and were slightly above our guidance as a result of anticipated separation costs that did not materialize.","While two of our three segments did not deliver core sales growth as a result of continued slow industrial spending, the margin performance overall is a testament to our strong discipline around cost management. We announced in August that we reached an agreement to sell our Valves & Controls business to Emerson. This transaction is on track to close at the end of this year or early next year, subject to regulatory approvals. We're not expecting any recovery in industrial capital or maintenance spending at the end of the year in contrast to the typical year-end lift. Given this muted top line outlook predominantly on industrial-facing businesses, we're lower our fourth quarter outlook.","We do not believe the fourth quarter is indicative of a trend, and we expect at some point maintenance spending will return in a more meaningful way. And longer cycle projects, particularly in food and beverage and infrastructure, are also likely to break loose. As we look ahead to 2017, we believe we are positioned to deliver strong EPS expansion despite this ongoing slower growth environment. I'll discuss this in more detail later in the call.","Now let's turn to slide five for discussion of our Q3 2016 results. Third quarter core sales decline 2% as we saw further slowdown in capital spending throughout the quarter and ongoing referrals deferrals in maintenance spending. Water Quality Systems was our only segment to deliver core growth as the pool business once again finished the season in a strong position.","We reached the one-year anniversary of the ERICO acquisition and the performance has met all of our expectation. Segment income grew 15% and return on sales expanded 110 basis points to 17.9%. Water Quality Systems delivered over 300 basis points of margin expansion. And despite the core sales decline in Flow & Filtration Solutions, income and margins were down only modestly as the segment delivered on better internal execution.","Adjusted EPS grew 11% to $0.78 per share and exceeded our forecast of $0.70 to $0.75 per share as our core operating results met our income forecast while we did not incur the one-time separation costs we were expecting below the segment income line.","Free cash flow continued to be bright spot, up over $150 million year-to-date compared to last year, and our conversion to adjusted net income remains just north of 100%.","Now, let's turn to slide six for more detail on Pentair's Q3 2016 performance. Once again the residential and commercial vertical was a bright spot, driven in large part by our strong North American pool performance. While ERICO's performance was not captured in the core, its commercial sales also remain strong.","After a good second quarter, we did see overall infrastructure sales decline modestly in the third quarter. We continue to see strength in engineered pump orders and backlog but our process filtration business faces difficult second half comparisons as large projects in the comparable period last year are not repeating.","Food and beverage declined with delays in a number of larger beverage projects being the largest factor this quarter. While we've greatly reduced our exposure and energy, our remaining sales for this vertical remain under pressure. Industrial was down in the quarter due in part to ongoing deferrals in short cycle MRO spending and a global capital spending freeze that shows no sign of thawing.","The right-hand side of the page shows that price and productivity continue to more than offset inflation as we continue to control costs across the enterprise. ERICO's contribution also helped drive the strong margin performance in the quarter.","Now let's turn to slide seven for a look at Water Quality Systems performance in Q3. Water Quality Systems delivered core growth of 2%. These results were below our expectations as within our water filtration business we saw foodservice and commercial market softness in North America and Western Europe, as well as shifts in timing of key account program installation.","We also experienced a moderation in growth rates in the fast growth regions as our distributors closely managed inventory levels due to slower growth in China. The North American pool market ended its season on a strong note. We continue to view this market favorably longer-term. We also believe our water filtration business has good long-term prospects and expect growth to return in 2017 as new product rollouts and key account program installations, particularly in foodservice, return to growth at a normal level.","Segment income grew an impressive 15% and return on sales expanded 240 basis points to 21.2%. Robust operating leverage was once again the largest contributor to this strong margin performance, with the strong growth in the pool business contributing positively in the quarter.","Now let's move to slide eight for a look at Flow & Filtration Solutions performance in Q3. Flow & Filtration Solutions saw core sales decline 6%. While we anticipated sales to contract in the quarter, water technologies and fluid solutions were down more than expected, as we saw softening demand in short cycle pump sales and weaker capital spending and beverage. Water technologies core sales declined 3% as distributors managed inventory levels tightly and we saw continued declines in irrigation sales, albeit at a moderated pace.","We experienced a dramatic slowdown in fast growth regions, particularly in the Middle East and Latin America as sell-through was soft in the quarter and, as a result, distributors are not restocking. In contrast, Western Europe was a bright spot, up double digits in the quarter with good momentum. We continue to see an improvement in infrastructure bid activity, which points to a stronger 2017. Fluid solutions core sales declined 1%, which is slightly better than the 3% decline we saw last quarter. Sales in agriculture grew modestly in the quarter and, importantly, we expect this momentum to continue. Our biogas and beer membrane filtration businesses remain strong, offset partially by our beverage business seeing a number of large project delays globally and softer component sell-through.","Core sales in process filtration declined 22%, largely in line with expectations, with the key drivers being project timing within infrastructure as well as declines in oil and gas and industrial filtration. Segment income and return on sales declined modestly as the impact of lower volumes were not fully offset by the continued strong productivity and pricing seen for the past several quarters. We remain vigilant on improving the cost structure to offset the impact of lower volumes.","Looking ahead, we expect food and beverage to rebound with agriculture turning positive, along with growth in biogas and beer membrane filtration. As we continue to reduce the complexity in the business and drive better execution in projects, we believe we have a long runway for margin improvement.","Now let's turn to slide nine to discuss how Technical Solutions performed in the third quarter. Technical Solutions reported 26% sales growth for the quarter, consisting of 1% core sales decline and a 27% positive contributions from ERICO. Core sales in enclosures declined 1% as industrial sales continue to bounce along the bottom, diminishing chances of any order rate growth acceleration for the remainder of 2016. Thermal management core sales declined 5% as downstream energy MRO product sales are not showing any signs of recovery. Our industrial heat tracing business continues to win small projects, but our project growth was challenged as large Canadian projects are nearing completion.","While the results of ERICO are captured as acquisition contribution, the business performed in line with our expectations at the completion of the one-year deal anniversary. The majority of ERICO's sales are into commercial vertical, which continued to deliver growth in the quarter, although the rate of growth is moderating.","Segment income grew 18% as return on sales contracted 140 basis points to 22%. Margin contraction was isolated to our thermal management business, as the sales of projects versus higher-margin MRO product sales negatively impacted mix and we face the productivity issues at the end of the large Canadian projects. ERICO has performed as we had anticipated, and enclosures continues to stabilize. The performance of these two businesses was not enough in the quarter to offset the margin impact from thermal management.","We're not expecting downstream MRO spending to rebound for the remainder of the year. We also expect the Canadian project margins to pressure thermal margins in Q4, as we substantially complete them before the end of the year. This will undoubtedly have an impact on fourth quarter margins for Technical Solutions. With ERICO and enclosures performing as expected and thermal completing the large Canadian projects, we still believe Technical Solutions remains well positioned longer term.","I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2016 outlook and then I'll have a few closing remarks about how we're looking at the world entering 2017.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you, Randy. Please turn to slide number 10, titled Q4 2016 Pentair outlook. For the fourth quarter, ERICO is now captured in the core results, so core sales and total sales are currently equal to each other. For the fourth quarter, we expect overall sales to decline approximately 6%, as we expect MRO trends in energy and customer capital spending in all verticals to worsen as we head into the end of the year. Motivation for customers to push our projects and commitments shows no signs of stopping by the end of the year.","On a core basis, we expect Water Quality Systems to grow approximately 2%, while we expect Flow & Filtration Solutions to decline approximately 9%, primarily related to project spending in the food and beverage vertical. Technical Solutions is expected to decline approximately 10%, due in large part to the completion of previously mentioned large Canadian projects and mid-teens declines in year-over-year MRO spending within energy.","We expect segment income to be down approximately 10%, and return on sales to decline roughly 70 basis points to 17%. Below the operating line, we continue to expect the tax rate to remain around 21.5%, net interest and other to approximate $35 million, and shares outstanding to be around 184 million, about flat with Q3 ending levels. We expect free cash flow to end the year on a strong note, greater than continuing operations net income of $550 million and nearly $780 million inclusive of Valves & Controls.","Please turn to slide 11, labeled full year 2016 Pentair outlook. As Randy mentioned at the beginning of the call, we've taken our full-year adjusted EPS outlook for continuing operations down to approximately $3 for 2016. For the full year, we expect core sales to decline 1%. Water Quality Systems full-year core sales are anticipated to be up approximately 4%. We now expect Flow & Filtration Solutions core sales decline of 4% and Technical Solutions core sales to be down 2% for the full year.","We expect segment income to grow roughly 11% and return on sales to expand approximately 70 basis points to 17.1%. Our revised forecast factors in slightly better operating performance from Water Quality Systems, while Technical Solutions and Flow & Filtration Solutions are expected to have margins impacted by negative mix related to unfavorable market conditions.","The pressure on higher-margin short cycle sales has been felt most acutely within Technical Solutions. We anticipate full-year corporate cost to be just under $110 million, net interest and other roughly $141 million, and the share count to be roughly 183 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow approximately 6%. Finally, we remain on track to generate free cash flow in excess of adjusted net income for the full year.","Please turn to slide 12, labeled balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the third quarter with $4.4 billion net debt inclusive of cash on hand. This continues to improve as we used our strong cash flows in the quarter to reduce our debt levels.","On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow has increased over $150 million versus the first nine months last year. We continue to expect to deliver free cash flow greater than adjusted net income for the full year. Our ROIC ended the quarter at 10.6%. When the sale of Valves & Controls closes, we expect our balance sheet will look dramatically different for the better, with lower debt levels and balance sheet capacity available for tuck-ins or incremental buybacks.","I'll now turn the call back over to Randy for some closing comments and preliminary thoughts around 2017.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","I'll wrap up beginning on slide 13. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, the sale of Valves & Controls remains on track to close at the end of this year or early next year, subject to the regulatory approvals. With the closing and the Valves & Controls separation, we expect the infusion of cash to alter our balance sheet dramatically for the better. As we discussed in August, we know what debt we will retire, mostly within our bank line. We're also exploring other options to restructure our debt, substantially reduce interest expense on our higher cost fixed rate long-term debt.","We also continue to build our bolt-on acquisition funnel for businesses that have earned the right to grow, primarily within Water Quality Systems. We're doing what we can to control our destiny and while we still see some pockets of growth within residential and commercial and infrastructure, the uncertainty around any type of recovery within industrial gives us pause. So we're taking a closer look at our cost structure and adjusting it accordingly.","Now, let's move to slide 14 for a look at segment positioning. Water Quality Systems has been a bright spot within the Pentair portfolio for several years, and while we've seen the growth rate moderate some, we continue to believe in the long-term prospects of this high-performing segment. With strong residential demand, dealer intimacy and a steady stream of new products, our outlook for the aquatics business remains strong. Within water filtration, we continue to believe we will benefit from increased awareness around water quality globally, and our investments in a more focused sales effort in North America and Europe are already paying early dividends.","Foodservice has been a relatively consistent growth business for us longer term. We continue to believe there are many avenues for growth, including traditional restaurant sales as well as edging on into adjacent products and connected solutions. We believe Flow & Filtration Solutions remains the biggest opportunity for improvement within the Pentair portfolio. Our number one priority is reducing the complexity of the business, accelerating cost-out action and focusing on the most attractive growth prospects.","We continue to see momentum around biogas and beer membrane filtration. It is encouraging that agriculture seems to have bottomed. So, we believe we're building some momentum exiting this year after a tough couple of years. As I discussed previously, we are seeing improved orders in backlog and infrastructure, which is a longer cycle part of the business, and is positioning for a return to growth. Finally, we're placing an increased focus on building our aftermarket service capabilities to leverage our installed base.","Flow & Filtration Solutions has a number of opportunities and our principal focus is to prioritize which opportunities drive first and build momentum to restore growth and raise margins. We believe Technical Solutions has an attractive position in profitable areas of the electrical industry. We expect the 2016 headwinds will begin to dissipate as industrial order rates are near trough levels, hints of inflation returning are on the horizon, large projects in Canada are complete, and deferred MRO spending cannot continue forever.","While we expect the strong growth in commercial to moderate, growth is likely to continue, progressively right-sizing the cost structure with the slower growth environment. This is the piece of our portfolio where we still have energy exposure. And while oil prices appear to have stabilized, we'll watch closely for signs of improving thermal MRO spending. While we still expect some near-term headwinds in parts of our portfolio, we still believe there are many avenues for growth longer-term.","Now let's move to slide 15 for a look at the framework for 2017. Given the portfolio change and attendant P&L and balance sheet improvements we're undergoing, we think it's important to provide some framework for thinking about our prospects for next year.","As we discussed throughout the call, we expect the slow growth world we are all facing today to continue, and we do not expect a meaningful recovery in 2017. Therefore, it's prudent to focus on having our cost structure aligned with this reality, the result of which should be margin expansion from all three segments next year.","Upon the closing of the Valves & Controls sale, we expect to have an opportunity to restructure our debt, which will reduce interest expense. Also, we expect to have the financial flexibility to explore other opportunities to allocate capital in a disciplined manner. By focusing on cost, simplifying the business and improving the capital structure, we expect to be able to deliver EPS growth in excess of 15% next year with minimal top-line help while still positioning the company for the longer term.","Thanks. And operator, can you please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Your line is open.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Good morning, Shannon.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Good morning, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, so, just on kind of the 4Q caution, I mean, is there anything in October that's making you think we've seen yet another like down or you just, is this lack of inflection, concerns around election \u2013 maybe just a little more color on what keeps you cautious on 4Q? And I know you're more optimistic beyond 4Q.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah, Shannon. It's John here. I think what, if you take a look at Q3, we started out really strong and we ended okay, but we certainly didn't see acceleration towards the end of Q3. And what we're seeing is continued project slippage, where these are projects that we've either won, but the start dates on the projects continue to move to the right. And given where we are right now, with all the uncertainty you mentioned, we just don't think our customers are going to rush to conclude them between now and the end of the year.","The other main issue is we've been hoping that MRO would recover throughout this year and that's on the operational side, primarily in energy, and we're not hopeful now at this point that that's going to recover for the end of the year as our customers manage cash to the end of the balance sheets. So, those are the main issues.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Yeah. We almost always see an uptick in the industrial spending in the fourth quarter and what we're saying is, we're not counting on that this time, with these deferrals.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just, in terms of all segments improving margins next year, the one that's been a little bit tougher has been Flow & Filtration, maybe just an update on how you think they're progressing operationally? I know volumes were a little tougher this quarter, but what \u2013 do you have confidence that segment can improve margins next year?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Yeah. If we had hit the forecast of down 2% instead of down 6%, we would have expanded margin. I think we're making a lot of progress on simplifying the product line and on driving productivity. It's a business that frankly didn't get as much attention as we focused on Valves & Controls and now we're getting back to it. So I think there's lots of opportunities and things like agriculture coming back, the crop spray business and some of the other businesses that are some of the more profitable businesses, those stabilizing and even getting a little bit of growth is going to help in the mix.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, all.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Morning, Steve.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Just first a quick question on ERICO. So I know it's not in core growth. What would that have contributed to core growth? What was just the ERICO core growth for that business?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","1% to 2%, Steve.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And just on Water Quality Systems, this was one of your strongest businesses that could do no wrong historically and clearly you had a forecast for 8% at least in terms of guidance, came in at just 2%. You talked about a couple of those dynamics, but maybe also for John, I mean where was the forecasting error here and in terms of that business that's supposed to be so much more stable.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","I'll hit your last part first and then I'll have Randy. We had three key businesses in Water Quality. We have our aquatic and environmental systems, which is primarily the pool business. The pool business continues to be very strong and we continue to hit all of our forecasts relative to that business. Where the softness came in the quarter, which also relates to the way we're thinking about Q4 was in the foodservice business, which has been up, high single-digits throughout the year and had moderated back to flat in Q3. And then also we had the water purification business which also was strong most of the year and took a little bit of pause in Q3. So that's where the misses came, Steve.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Yeah. I'd just add, on the foodservice side, we've been growing at high teens rate in Asia, and while we're still growing there that took a step down to high single-digit growth rate, which was one change. And then we've seen some, I would call, variability in some of the deployments in some of the chains as restaurant growth has slowed down. So we expect those deployments to continue, or get positive again, as we launch a new range of products, which I referenced in my comments, but that won't happen in the quarter.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And Randy, in terms of how you're thinking about M&A. You early on talked about those businesses that have \u2013 I guess, have earned the right to capital deployment soon \u2013 shortly after Valves & Controls closes. Maybe a little more guidance on how you're thinking about bolt-on, just any kind of size range or just a little bit of sense for investors of what we might expect early next year?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Well, we're going to be disciplined, I mean, we're getting out from under the overhang of a lot of the debt and we take our lessons from that, okay. But the place that we have the most opportunity. We are one of the leading players in water. We expanded that with the Tyco merger into the broader flow space and I think we want to get narrowly focused again in what I'll call the water side of the flow space.","So, that's why I mentioned Water Quality. There are some that are sort of in between Water Quality and FFS, which is really, I mean, both of them together are our water business. And so, we want to continue to build that leading position and, so around water quality and availability. We like the food and beverage business, although we want to be careful about the heavy capital side of that versus things with annuity, which is why we like the membrane, the beer filtration, and also biogas, which is I think a nice growth business. So, it will be in areas that expand our reach and deepen our expertise in water \u2013 way to think about it.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird","Hey. Morning, guys.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Morning, Mike.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird","So, first on 2017 thought process, obviously, no meaningful improvement embedded in those numbers. Yet I got the sense from some of your commentary more specifically on the divisions that there was some expectation that fourth quarter doesn't represent the right run rate. So, maybe help kind of reconcile those two right there and then what areas should start getting maybe a slightly better in the next year and which ones you're more worried about?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Let me start with Technical Solutions. We mentioned thermal. As the thermal business saw the decline in the energy business, we got aggressive in going after projects to replace the product. Those have proven to be more challenging from a profitability standpoint and those are coming to an end. And so, we'll immediately mix up, if you will, on the profit side.","On the growth side, we expect more normalized. We're assuming in the fourth quarter this muted impact on the usual bump in sales we would see in industrial. We don't think \u2013 we're hopeful that after the fourth quarter, we'll return to a more normal level, which won't be the negative impact we see in the industrial market for the fourth quarter. John, if you want to add anything?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","No. I agree with that.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird","So, you're basically saying beyond that, though, it's a pretty steady run rate from the fourth quarter other than the maintenance side reverting back to normal?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. If you take a look at the full year, core growth was down 1% for full year, that had a lot of choppiness in it. We started the year with almost double-digit declines in industrial. We've worked a way back to flattish numbers as we close out the year. So sequentially things have stabilized. What we're really saying is these larger projects that were out there for the Q4 cycle are going to be pushed or deferred into next year or may be deferred permanently. And we don't see me environment that's reflected in Q4 in the pause and concern of our overall customer base being the same cause of concern that we see as we enter 2017.","Now, we said negative 2% to plus 2% next year so that's clearly not a robust growth environment, but it's flattish and then we have the operating income cost structure changes that we're driving as an organization to drive margin improvement.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","And I would add as \u2013 and that's the framework. We're planning on a minus 2% to plus 2% top line, which means to drive the performance that we know we can drive, we need to focus on simplifying. We're already working on simplifying the cost structure with the removal of Valves & Controls. We're going to do more than that, as a result of that outlook. If we get more upside, we will be in a position to serve (26:22) on the volume side.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird","Makes sense. And then, second one on the stranded cost side, maybe just an update there on how that's going? And then, just with the margin levers in the next year, some sort of thought process on how much is discretionary oriented versus something more permanent?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Well, we're looking beyond just the stranded cost and we're looking at how do we simply the cost structure and, in a lean sense, how do we really take out waste and variability in the course of that simplification. I'm confident that we will get to a run rate at the beginning of the year that takes that overhang away or more.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird","Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Just follow on to Randy's point, real quickly. I mean, we had a focus to integrate and standardize a lot of the Valves & Controls activities, because that's where the biggest opportunities were for improvements. And so we repositioned a lot of our cost structure savings towards Valves & Controls. Now we're going to bring back the focus to reintegrating ourselves, if you will, to our Pentair standards on the rest of the portfolio, and we believe we can accelerate a lot of those cost-out actions in simplifying the company as Randy mentioned.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning. Hey, how do you get so \u2013 you got the 5% operating profit increase, I guess 15% EPS growth. Just remind us kind of how you bridge that, I'm not sure if you mentioned early in the call and if you did then I guess I'll take it offline, but just a little more of a precise bridge on how you get there?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. We didn't, Steve, I mean, but I think the element we're now working to right now is we believe there is opportunity in the debt structure of the company. And we do think for relatively inexpensive investment, we can get a fair amount of interest out by putting our capital position or our debt position more in line with where we want it to be on a permanent basis. And there would clearly be significant interest savings associated with that, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So that's a refi or that's, I mean, because your interest rate, I think your average interest rate is pretty low already, right, or is there...","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Right. We're carrying gross debt fairly high without taking out fixed debt structure and we think there's an opportunity to take out some of the fixed debt structure in a productive way and therefore it's incrementally better than what we had mentioned before. And we think we then have a capital and a debt structure that mirrors where we think we can be longer term as a growth oriented company.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I got it. So it's a kind of combination of use of the proceeds effectively and then a little bit of a different structure in the underlying.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Correct.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","In what's leftover.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Correct, but no (29:07) buybacks or --","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","The 15% plus, think about it as one half on the capital side focused on debt, and one half on the performance side.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then in Technical, what's going on in the core enclosures business? And is that decline in the fourth quarter, is that all thermal related? Is that just a tough comp on thermal because it doesn't seem like the enclosures business would have that kind of a drop-off from flat given the short cycle nature.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","The profit impact is almost 80% thermal and usually in the enclosures business, that's the place where we would see a fourth quarter uptick and we're assuming we won't.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So that's within enclosures, though, like the kind of short cycle CapEx, the box business, is that stable down in that negative 10%? What is that kind of trending?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Bumping along the bottom...","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","It's stable, Steve, from Q3 sequential. The overall...","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So, but down year-over-year, because you may have had a good fourth quarter last year, or something like that?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Slightly down year-over-year, but not 1% to 2% down.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I think that's it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Ronnie Weiss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, good morning, guys. It's Ronnie Weiss on for Julian.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Morning.","Ronnie Weiss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Can you just talk a little bit about the pricing dynamics in each of the segments, still holding up decently well and how that kind of looks into 2017?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","As you can see overall, pricing is \u2013 it's not moving a lot in either direction. We actually think with rates go up and inflation goes up a little bit, it'll give us some more pricing leverage.","I mentioned in the script that in the thermal projects, that's been tougher on the project side. But we've seen the impact of that. Now, we're being more selective about going after them because we don't want to get low-profit projects anymore. Rather just get the products of it. So I'd say there's really no dramatic change in the pricing environment in any of the businesses.","Ronnie Weiss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then kind of on the accelerated alignment of the cost structure going into 2017, can you frame some of those numbers? Is the 50 basis points all productivity, is that 2% benefit that you guys had in Q3, is that the right number to think about into 2017, or does it step back up as you maybe see some more opportunity?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. I don't think we're ready to give our final number yet. I think the number that you mentioned, about 2% of sales, is certainly in the ballpark of where we're targeting as we head into next year. And obviously, being more selective at where we apply that cost out to where we think the economic conditions will not as robust as other places of the portfolio. But overall, you're in the ballpark.","Ronnie Weiss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, guys.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Good morning.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Hey, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, so, I was trying to follow the answer to Steve's question earlier on the fourth quarter in Technical Solutions. You guys have that stepping down organically 10%, so what exactly is driving that in the fourth quarter?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","It's primarily all of our thermal business related to energy, MRO...","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","MRO.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","And energy projects.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","And a couple of points on enclosures.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. So, enclosures are going to be down, I think, low single-digits and thermal and the heat tracing business could be down more than double-digits in the fourth quarter?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah, keep in mind that that's a year-over-year comparison, so last year we had projects roll through. So it's a comparison against the projects. If you actually look at it sequentially from Q3 to Q4, it's just down slightly on the top line.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then the second question is just around the ERICO business. I think you guys mentioned earlier that the annual run rate was about $507 million for this year. And then, I think the numbers that you gave us at the Analyst Day were closer like $530 million, $540 million. So what's happened in that business throughout the year and also maybe some commentary on recent trends there as well?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. I don't know where the $507 million came from, we think it's $530 million for the year, slightly better than $530 million for the year. So...","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. So, basically that business is flat right now?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Slightly up.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Slightly up. Yeah.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Right in line with the plan.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. All right. Great. I'll get back in queue. Thank you.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, good morning.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Good morning.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I was hoping to get underneath some of the inflation numbers here. Where exactly are you guys seeing inflation emerge?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Steel, starting to see some pickup in steel related pricing, as a material buy. We're also seeing some uptick in some of the commodity prices for mining related commodities, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","We also have wage inflation, labor inflation.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Are there price increases set for the fourth quarter, given the steel situation or have they already occurred?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah, as Randy said, we have modest increase as planned and they have already or will already have been in place this early quarter.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. And then I have one other more holistic question for you guys. This is the same portfolio as we kind of left off pre-Valves in 2012. And with of course the addition of ERICO, yet we seem to be talking a heck of a lot more about project business today than I really ever recalled in the older portfolio. What has happened to your businesses and the dynamics of the market where so much of your business now seems to be more project oriented? And if there's any way of quantifying how much of your businesses now project oriented now, versus what it was then, I guess sort of the last question within that would be, how does that affect your cost down plans for next year, project orientation makes that a little bit harder or otherwise?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Yeah. Let me \u2013 there are \u2013 it's not wrong. We do have more products \u2013 as we move from products to solutions, they tend to be larger, more complex and we call those projects and then of course the thermal business. We saw the thermal business and about half of that is projects, a little bit more than that because of the MRO, the product sales has been impacted. So we expect that the solutions sales can still give us the same amount of margins.","We need to get better at predicting when they're going to shift. We need to make sure that we're getting the same margins we're getting as we move the products to solutions and that's all underway. So strategically it's where we were going anyway because it's where customers want us to become. So there are projects in both Technical Solutions and in FSS.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah and the total would be roughly just under 8% of sales \u2013 would be our total project revenue for 2016.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","But a lot of the variability. That's why we need to get better at predicting.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Right.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And would you say that is maybe double or more what it was pre-Valves & Controls?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Probably, yes.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right and does that affect how you pull cost out next year?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","It doesn't because the way we look at it is most of that is variable spend, right. So we flex it up and flex it down and so we look at that and as we referenced cost out targets, it's those targets plus what needs to go away related to the project.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I got you. All right, very good. Thanks a lot.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is open.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Morning, everyone.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Morning.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Hey, Nathan.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I'd just like to follow up, John, on the point you just made about increasing prices in the fourth quarter. Can you maybe give us an idea of historically how much of that pricing sticks and given that we're in a pretty weak demand environment at the moment, if you think that pricing increase will be more or less sticky than it historically has been?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","We think that the price increases that we put forward which are more modest price increases will all generally stick. There's only one area of our particular portfolio right now that's unusual versus prior trends and I'd call it the strengthening dollar, right. So...","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Right.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","We're in a situation where Europe and you heard it in Randy's commentary, Europe's doing relatively okay. So there are imports coming from Europe that are realizing lower cost basis. Now we have European business as well that we're benefiting from that. But overall, I think we put in a net price increase, modest less than 100 basis points for the total company, next year that we think we can realize.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Next question, you talked about I think this call and last call about industrial order rates being at trough levels. But your guidance on that end market there has taken a step down this quarter. Can you reconcile those? Have the order rates taken a step down and now you think they're at trough levels and what gives you confidence that maybe there's not another step down to come from here?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. Actually it's flat. I mean, the thing is in my 20 years or 30 years in industrial, I'd say 19 out of the 20, there's been an uptick in the fourth quarter and we're saying is that doesn't happen. So we're flat essentially in the third quarter and fourth quarter, and compared to last year, that's down a couple points.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","But what gives you confidence that that improves going into 2017? I mean, on a year-over-year basis, we've taken a fairly significant downtick in the fourth quarter, even if it's flat sequentially?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Well, ISM actually went positive in September, that's only one month. We'll see what it does in October. It's usually a precursor of recovery and...","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","But, Nathan, just to be clear, I think our framework, not guidance, but our framework for next year doesn't assume it does, and I think that's what we hope you took away. That, yes, we think Q4 is an anomaly, but if you take a look at the overall core growth for the company at negative 1% and moving to that general framework next year, I don't think we're counting on a big recovery next year. We think it's a slower economic growth environment and we're going to double down on the simplicity of the company, work on the debt restructuring and disciplined capital allocation to drive the value.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's fair. Thanks very much.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Hope we're wrong, but I don't...","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hopefully not wrong in the wrong direction. Hopefully wrong in the right direction.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","There you go.

Your line is open.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, good morning.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Morning.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Morning.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I didn't see it on the slide, but just wanted to talk about free cash flow conversion to the adjusted net income for the next year and what some of the levers are you have to pull to keep the conversion rate really strong, whether it's CapEx or working capital or any other items to be aware of on the cash side.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","We think on a go-forward basis, we're still targeting to achieve greater than 100%. While we've lost some of the working capital opportunity in Valves & Controls, we still have plenty of working capital opportunity in FFS, and we also believe we have a less severance environment, right. So, our cash flow captures our severance outflows as well, and there were a fair amount of those in the Valves & Controls business that as we move away from Valves & Controls no longer are headwinds to the company. So we still think 100% or greater than 100% of net income is our targeted cash flow conversion.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Which is what we did before the Tyco merger on a regular basis, so...","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. And then just wondering if you can give us an update on the valuations that you're seeing out there on the deal front, kind of seller and buyer expectations are getting tighter and if it's kind of still a \u2013 I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it seemed like it was kind of evenly split between preference for share repo and M&A when you did the Valves & Controls call?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Yeah, when we did that, we said we're going to have this firepower. We are about shareholder value and we will as a board look at the opportunities of how we deploy that. Our bias is to grow the business and grow the company, but we're not going to do it with non-strategic acquisitions. So if we can't find them at the right price, and it's hard to generalize as to pricing, but there's a lot of people looking at deals, so usually that causes prices to go up. But we have been disciplined, and we will continue to be disciplined as we look at it. And we're not rushing to put the capital to work. We want it to be informed by a good strategy, and the board is totally aligned on that.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","All right. Thank you.","Randall J.

Your line is open.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Just another one on M&A. I think, Randy, your comments were much more focused on Water ,and I think you've talked in the past about both Tech Solutions and Water having the right to grow, so kind of what informs that bias? Is it what's available out there or how you're thinking about the businesses strategically or the end markets? Maybe just a little more color there.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Well, Technical Solutions has to get back to earning again. I'm not happy with the forecast that we got on the thermal side. So we want to support high execution. So there are opportunities in Technical Solutions. It's a great business. I mean, as I mentioned in the script, we have great positions in the electrical industry and there are ways to build upon those, but we need to get the cost structure in that business right. We need to get the execution back to where I know it can be, and then I'll let them come up to the front of the line again.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then, John, just back on the debt restructuring. So this ability to restructure some of the debt -- that is built into the guide? Is that the right way to think about it?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","The framework.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yes. We haven't given guidance yet.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Into the framework, yes. Okay. So you're putting that in and are you paying down more \u2013 within that framework, are you paying down more debt or you're just getting a more favorable rate based on a restructuring?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","We will be paying down more debt. I don't what yet, we're still exploring it, but given our original views, we quickly after the Valves & Controls hadn't had time to look at it.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Right.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","We're now looking at it and we're seeing that for a very good return, we can invest a little bit of money and get a longer term savings. So we're looking at exploring those options and when we give our guidance, we'll be able to fully share that.

Hogan - Pentair Plc","Hey, Josh.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah. Just to follow up on I think Steve's earlier question on ERICO. I guess I'm still struggling a little bit with the plug there. I'm looking at the slides from when you guys initially did the deal, $570 million in 2015, $595 million in 2016 forecasted revenue. And it still seems like even with some margin error or maybe some reporting differences, we're still talking about a number in the low $500 million range, whether it's $507 million or $530 million. What am I missing in that bridge?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. So, thanks for bringing it up. Those original numbers were gross sales.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Gross sales.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","They're not net sales. And on a net sales basis, we're closer to the $530 million this year and that is roughly a 1 to 2 percentage point growth over where it was on a full year basis last year. It is made up of \u2013 roughly half of that is CADDY, which is a commercially exposed business, and then half of it is more related to infrastructure and also rail and utilities. So the big difference in those original slides to what we published later was gross to net deductions.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got you. And the just to circle back on Flow & Filtration, clearly you guys have a lot of initiatives going on there all at once and the market certainly not helping you out, but what should we expect to see first when you're starting to get traction there? Is it organic growth stabilizing, is it margin improvement, is it a little bit of everything? Because I think you guys have been focused on this for at least the last year and clearly at a high level things are still probably disappointing to you, but I'm trying to figure out what would be the green shoots from your perspective that you'd want people to look at and say, hey, we're starting to get some traction here?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Yeah. I would say margins and, Josh, go back two or three years, we were making some good \u2013 FFS was, if you will, in the legacy venture side, it was the lowest performing margins and our goal was to get it to 15% or more. I still think we can get them there and we get close at some point. And so you'll see it in our margins first and then growth.","So right now we actually have, as I said, some of our innovations like biogas and membrane filtration of beer, even though general the food and beverage industry isn't growing, these applications are and we're doing well in them. So we are getting good progress in a number of growth areas, it's just not enough to offset some of the areas that aren't growing. So margins first, growth second.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","To be fair, though, Randy, the 15% target, that was inclusive of AMR (47:10), right, the way you guys used to report it, or is that wrong?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","I'd say, yeah. In addition though (47:18)","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","The margins in Flow & Filtration should approach what they are in Water Quality. I mean these are some high technical specs. I mean, I don't think we'll get our core pump business that high, but the filtration side of this business and the technology side of the business has a lot more potential than 15%.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got you. All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, guys, good morning.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Good morning.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","So the talk about the large beverage projects being pushed out, is that beer and is that related to M&A or just maybe a little more color on what's happening there?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","It's basically the valving in all beverage, it's dairy, it's beer, but the biggest ones for us in beer.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yes, and there is a capital pause happening, as you mentioned, that's driving some of that delay.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Related to M&A activity, I know you've talked about that before.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yes.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And so when you talk about the beverage projects, should we think about that bucket of revenue, is that about $350 million of sales that's kind of...","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","No.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","$250-ish million.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Yes.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","$250 million. Got you. Okay. And maybe just to put a finer point on some of the earlier questions about the framework for next year. I mean what should we plug in our models for 2017 for interest expense and corporate?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Not there yet. We have to get through and figure out where we end and then we'll give guidance at the appropriate time. We just wanted to provide the framework so that people can understand how we're thinking about it.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","I mean the corporate sounded like maybe it would go back to the 90 (48:47) that it was the pre the V&C sale or maybe even a little lower. Is that kind of ballpark?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","I think that would be the low end of the range.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. And then maybe just finally in Tech Solutions, you talked about some of the productivity issues with the big projects. I mean in the quarter and maybe year-to-date how much of a drag on the margin has the thermal project productivity issue been?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","300 basis points.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. So when we're looking year-over-year, that's like a 3 point headwind that's just going away?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","That's correct.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","For the segment?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","That's correct.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. Okay. Thank you.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Thank you very much.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Lucas. Please go ahead, sir.","James Lucas","Thanks, Angie, and welcome to Pentair's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasury. And with me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer and future President and Chief Executive Officer and Mark Borin, our future Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our first quarter 2018 performance, as well as our second quarter and full-year 2018 outlook, as outlined in this morning's press release.","There will be a second conference call this morning immediately following this one to discuss the Electrical segment, first quarter performance and second quarter and full year outlook for nVent. There is a separate dialling required for that call.","Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the Company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-Q and today's press release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today and the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randy Hogan","Thanks, Jim. And good morning, everyone. We\u2019re very pleased to report that Pentair started 2018 on a very positive note with solid core sales growth in both of our reported segments, Water and Electrical, and also strong segment income and adjusted EPS growth.","The next two slides are standard presentations reported results in the balance sheet. But given the expected imminent separation of the Water and Electrical businesses, we wanted to concentrate on this particular call on a new Pentair where the water business excluding electrical.","Before I turn the call over to John and Mark to discuss the first quarter water results in the outlook for the remainder of 2018 for the new Pentair, I wanted to provide an update on the planned separation of electrical for nVent.","As you may have seen earlier this week, nVent began to trade on a when issued basis. nVent has its management team and board in place and there will be a separate call following this one to discuss the results and outlook as Jim just said.","This is the last earnings call for Pentair as it is constructed today. It's also my last earnings call. For over half a century Pentair has gone through many changes and the results have been stronger company with successful long-term track record.","While our history has been around transformation and create shareholder value, we're excited for Pentair\u2019s next chapter, as we create two industry leading, pure-play companies in Water and Electrical.","I believe the excellent performance in the first quarter demonstrate the quality of both these businesses. For the consolidated company overall sales grew 7% and were up 4% on a core basis.","Segment income of $211 million represented 13% growth and adjusted EPS of $0.88 per share was up 35% versus the comparable period a year ago and was a full nickel [ph] above the high end of our first quarter guidance.","Thus, both companies have a strong foundation from which to build. And I feel confident that both companies have strong leadership in place to drive more shareholder value and they focus on their respective strategies.","It's been my honor and privilege to lead Pentair for the last 17 years and I feel that Pentair and nVent will continue to be successful under John and Beth\u2019s leadership.","I'll turn the call over to John, who will focus on first quarter Water segment performance and the outlook for the full year for the new Pentair.","John Stauch","Thank you, Randy. Not only for your 17 years or 68 quarters of distinguished leadership as CEO, but also thank you for the opportunity to lead the new Pentair.","Please turn to slide number eight, titled New Pentair Executive Summary. As a reminder, Mark and I will be discussing the results, outlook and strategies for the new Pentair or the Water business, excluding Electrical.","We reported core sales growth of 4% with all three of our businesses contributing. Return on sales showed solid expansion of 180 basis points to 16%. For the full year for the new Pentair, we have narrowed our guidance to core sales growth of 3% to 4%, ROS expansion of approximately 50 basis points to 18% and adjusted EPS is now expected to be $2.25 to $2.30 as our strong start to the year gives us confidence to raise the lower end of the range.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss the first quarter results and update you on our full year 2018 outlook.","Mark Borin","Thank you, John. Please turn to slide nine, labelled Q1 \u201818 New Pentair Performance. Core sales grew 4% with Aquatic Systems leading the way with 8% percent growth Filtration Solutions core sales increased 4% and Flow Technologies core sales grew 2%. Segment income was up 21%. And as John mentioned previously, return on sales expanded to 180 [ph] basis points to 16%.","Please turn to slide 10, labelled Q1 \u201818 New Pentair Business Performance. We wanted to give some additional color on how all three of our business has performed in the quarter. We expect that these three businesses will be our reporting segments after the separation.","Aquatic Systems despite a tough year-over-year comparison delivered 8% sales growth, driven by strong demand for existing and new products in addition to continued dealer gains","Filtration Solutions saw 9% overall sales growth and core sales grew 4%. The strength within the core residential and commercial offerings, as well as China, but equally important we saw stabilization in our industrial businesses.","Segment income grew dramatically and ROS expanded significantly as we improved in many of our cost actions last year to remove complexity in the business are reading through.","Flow Technologies grew its top line 5% with core sales up 2%. This marked the second consecutive quarter of core growth for Flow Technologies. Segment income grew 17% and ROS expanded over 150 basis points to 16.1%.","Specialty sales, principally precision spray enjoyed strong growth in the quarter. We also saw continued gains in North America and further stabilization in our long cycle backlog.","Please turn to slide 11, labelled 2018 New Pentair Outlook. Given the solid start to the year, we wanted to update the revenue and segment income walks that we provided in our Investor Day in February.","We raised our core growth outlook for the year to a range of 3% to 4% which moves the bottom end of the range up a point. FX is providing a little bit more of a tailwind than we originally anticipated, but we are also exiting a few countries and product lines, as you can see on the left hand side of the slide.","Our expectations for segment income in ROS have also improved following the strong start to the year. We are seeing some more inflation headwinds, but the better top line growth and productivity give us confidence in healthy ROS expansion even as we make the previously mentioned $25 million of incremental growth investments this year.","Please turn to Slide 12, labelled Q2 \u201818 New Pentair Outlook. We anticipate second quarter core sales to grow 3% to 4%, with Aquatic Systems up 7% to 8%, Filtration Solutions up 1% to 2% and Flow Technologies growing 2% to 3%.","Segment income is anticipated to be up approximately 5% and ROS relatively flat as the aforementioned growth investments accelerate. Below the line, we expect the tax rate to be around 18%, adjusted net interest and other expense to be approximately $8 million and our share count should be around 181 million.","Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.67 to $0.69 per share. In addition we see free cash flow improved sequentially and be in line with historical seasonal trends.","Please turn to slide 13, labelled Full Year 2018 New Pentair Outlook. As mentioned previously, we now expect full year core sales to grow 3% to 4%, while our outlook for Filtration Solutions is unchanged at 2% to 4%, we have tightened the range on Aquatic Systems and now expect 5% to 6% core sales growth and Flow Technologies to grow 1% to 2%.","Segment income is expected to be up around 8%, while ROS is expected to end the year around 18% percent, which would represent an increase of roughly 50 basis points. Below the lines, full year tax rate will be around 18%.","Net interest and other expense to be around $33 million, and shares will be around 181 million. For the full year, we expect adjusted EPS to be $2.25 to $2.30 per share. And we continue to target free cash flow to approximate 100% of adjusted net income.","I would like to turn the call back to John for more on the new Pentair strategy.","John Stauch","Thank you, Mark. Please turn to slide number 14, titled The New Pentair Strategy Summary. This is slide that we introduced at our Investor Day in February that was designed to frame our vision for the new Pentair and prioritize our path to achieving our vision.","As you can see on the left hand side of the page, we want to be the leading Residential & Commercial water treatment company. While we are organized around three businesses that we expect to be our reporting segments after the planned separation, roughly 80% of our sales of the Residential & Commercial verticals.","From a geographical standpoint, we are more weighted toward the U.S. today, but we see opportunities in other parts of the world, particularly China and Southeast Asia. The middle section of the page starts with who we plan to be, a pure-play water company with healthy profitability and strong cash flow, and with annual sales of approximately $3 billion.","The next areas are focused strategies, which I'll expand on in the next slide, but want to spend a moment discussing. Historically we have sometimes been distracted by doing too many things and trying to be everything to everybody. We believe focus is the key to driving long-term sustainable and predictable growth.","While all of our businesses have a purpose, we have identified three key areas to focus on, advanced pool growth, accelerate residential & commercial filtration and expand in China & Southeast Asia.","We intend to accelerate investments and efforts in both digital transformation and technology innovation, focused on the end consumer to accelerate these three prioritized growth strategies.","Our foundation of win right values and our Pentair integrated management system gives us the tools to successfully and continuously deliver for our customers and our shareholders.","The right hand side is an abbreviated look at our long-term value proposition, that starts with serving markets that are growing and focusing on driving differentiated growth and ultimately looking for tuck-in and bolt-on M&A to augment the organic opportunities.","Regarding capital allocation, we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating, reinvesting in our most attractive core businesses that pay a competitive dividend yield. We will also look at a balanced approach between M&A and intelligent buy backs with our M&A decisions being informed by overall valuations and the quality of assets available, as well as our ability to integrate them successfully.","Please turn to slide 15, labelled Focused Strategies. This is an important slide and one that I wanted to spend a moment on because this is how we plan to drive differentiated growth and hopefully be a top tier growth performer.","We spent a lot of time looking at our portfolio over the past nine to 12 months and identifying the most attractive opportunities for growth and that is how we arrived at these three focused strategies.","The first area is to advance pool growth. Our Aquatic Systems business has a great track record of high single digit core growth. And while the business has been successful, we believe that some incremental investments can make their growth rate even better.","The two areas that we have identified are expanding our aftermarket product offering and increasing our position in a fast growing automation space. There are roughly 5 million in ground pools in the U.S. and the aftermarket and upgrade market continues to make up nearly 80% to 85% of all pool product equipment sold and used by pool owners. There is significant opportunity remaining to grow both base content and upgrades.","Over a decade ago, we revolutionized pool pumps by introducing variable speed technology. A decade later, variable speed pumps still are only 20% penetrated, leaving ample room for continued growth.","In addition, there are many other energy efficient products in areas like, lighting, heating and cleaning that we believe have significant runway for growth. Our investments will include technology upgrades, digital marketing campaigns, incremental sales resources and dealer tools, as well as working on value propositions and alternative channel support.","Our second focused growth strategy is to accelerate residential & commercial filtration. We are a leader in residential water treatment components today and we have an opportunity to capitalize on increased water quality awareness globally, both in homes and restaurants, where we are developing innovative products and engaging consumers.","We see opportunities to enhance dealer loyalty similar to what we have done successfully in our pool business. The majority of water treatment dealers are not affiliated by brand and we see an opportunity to drive higher demand of our products through a loyal dealer network.","As we build out our value proposition for dealers and consumers, we believe we can generate the same type of loyalty that we have achieved in the pool business. Investments in this focused growth area will include branding, refresh value propositions, selling tools for our partners and technology advances that utilize smart capabilities.","The final focused growth strategy is to expand China and Southeast Asia. While water quality is an issue globally, we have purposefully focused on China, as we have a strong presence to build from and our brand is well known. We see opportunities in both the residential and the commercial space.","For consumers in China our biggest opportunity is building out our portfolio and creating products that consumers in China are demanding. On the commercial side, we have a strong presence with our global customers that have expanded to China and we have also developed many new customers through entry level food service offerings.","As we increase our local manufacturing, we see opportunities to further expand our customer base outside of the Tier 1 cities and into Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, as well as expanding rapidly in the Southeast Asia.","As we prioritize our growth opportunities, we believe this allows us the best opportunity to drive differentiated growth in what we believe is a very attractive water quality space.","I would now like to turn the call over to Angie for Q&A, after which I will have a few closing remarks. Angie, please open the line for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Randy Hogan","Morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Congrats on getting through the - getting to this point of the spin. Just on the free cash, you know anything in there that was related to the separation? I mean, it was - you know, it's usually - first quarter is usually weak, but it was definitely a little weaker than I was expecting?","John Stauch","Yes, Steve. Certainly there is some in there in the first quarter related to separation and then you know, comparing to last year, we were down a little bit, but really when you look at it historically around down $150 million - is a little bit more of the norm. So last year was a little bit better than normal this year, is a little bit more in line with historical levels. And you know, we're not seeing any major concern through the remainder of the year with respect to hitting the target of 100% of adjusted net income.","Steve Tusa","How much in there was from the spend from - I notice you know, working capital is particularly weak, what was in there from the spend exactly. Can you quantify that?","John Stauch","Yes. $20 million, $30 million probably now and then there'll be more of that, that will have additional separation related cash outflows in the second quarter as well.","Steve Tusa","How much?","John Stauch","Another $20 million to $30 million.","Steve Tusa","Okay. On the Ops, on price costs, you talked about a little more inflationary pressure. Can you maybe talk about what you're doing to perhaps offset that and you know, how the channel is saving [ph]","John Stauch","We've got a strong funnel of material productivity actions that the team's been building and there's a high level of confidence that through the remainder of the year, through the productivity actions we'll be able to offset that increased inflation. So we still view productivity and price offsetting inflation\u2026","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then one\u2026","John Stauch","If you look at water quality real quickly, on the full year you'll notice that inflation is slightly higher than when we gave our guidance in February. And also though embedded in there productivity is a little better and then just assuming the productivity column and we might have a little contingency as we work through the rest of the year.","Steve Tusa","And then John, I think you guys bought back some stock in the quarter, was that you know, how do we think about the next kind of nine months as far as your capital allocation priorities. And then also interest is a little bit higher and anything going on there in that, that's it?","John Stauch","Yeah. So we bought 150 back in the quarter and we think that was prudent. And you know, as we look forward I mean, as we mentioned, first of all we want to drive the cash and we do think we're a strong cash generator and then we want to continue to work on organic growth and maintain investment grade.","And then really choosing wisely between you know, incrementally more buybacks or doing tuck-in acquisitions and that's how we think we can drive value and our capital is precious and we want to use it wisely.","Randy Hogan","And Steve, on the on the interest question, we did see - for the full year we've increased the estimate for interest expense, think of that is higher interest rates. The timing of when we'll use or be able to use the dividend back from nVent in the separation to pay down our existing debt and then its really just you know, the imprecision in our original estimate as we were trying to balance all the moving pieces as we were heading into separation.","Steve Tusa","Great. Thanks a lot guys.","Randy Hogan","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jeff Hammond","Hey, good morning, guys.","Randy Hogan","Morning, Jeff.","Jeff Hammond","So just on capital allocation, can you one, just talk - I mean, you mentioned investment grade, but what you think the right leverage profile is for the company and how fast you think you get there through bolt-on M&A and buy backs?","And just on the M&A the pipeline, can you just talk about how you\u2019ve been building the funnel, where the opportunities lie and kind of how those align with what you talked about, John on the focused strategies? Thanks.","John Stauch","Yeah. I mean, it is long-term, I mean you know, 2 to 2.5 times leverage is you know, probably the appropriate place to be, but we're no rush to get there. We\u2019ll be slightly under levered. And I think we want to continue to focus on organic growth capabilities and preserve and manage our potential funnel focused on areas that have historically organically grown, which you know for us is our Aquatic Systems business. And you know just continue to add value where we can. So I think - you know, I think for modeling purposes that's a good place to be, but I wouldn't certainly think we feel any urgency to get immediately up to that level.","Right now I think we're really encouraged by the work we're doing to build the growth culture internally. These three strategic priorities have really got the focus of the organization and we're getting good tack and execution plans are below them and I think we're all excited about the opportunity that we can drive an organic growth.","Jeff Hammond","Okay. And then just back on price cost, can you just talk about any - you know, what price actions you've taken, what you've announced, maybe across the different businesses to kind of get to that one point of price for the year? Thanks.","Randy Hogan","Jeff. I mean, the price actions that we've taken so far this year, nothing out of the ordinary. So it would be our normal activities that we would do heading into the season and I mean, have not done anything unusual that those actions have been taken and really nothing planned incrementally going forward.","I mean, just to the inflation that you see there is a combination of wage inflation and also material inflation and you know, wage inflation was a little larger this year and the material inflation you know, we're working on to offset that with productivity as Mark mentioned earlier and you know, right now we're not overly concerned about it as we look forward.","Jeff Hammond","Great. Thanks, guys.","Randy Hogan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets.","Scott Graham","Good morning, all.","Randy Hogan","Hey, Scott.","Scott Graham","So what does price cost, if we look at it plus one and then minus two point for the first quarter. What are those numbers look like based on today's commodity prices? Because I assume you know your labor inflation. What are those numbers look like on an exit rate basis in \u201918?","Randy Hogan","I think you know, we mentioned this that the total full year \u201818 is out there, but it is a $58 million, I think\u2026","John Stauch","The inflation for the year\u2026","Randy Hogan","Inflation for the year and think of that is - roughly half of that is related to labor and the other half of it roughly material and that's what we think and that includes the current work and what we're seeing in all the commodity prices Scott.","Scott Graham","Right. And I do see that, I guess I was just sort of wondering we had a pretty heavy dose of steel inflation in the second half of the first quarter. And I know you want to do your best here to kind of make sure that everything looks square versus what you've talked about previously.","But I guess I was just assuming that price would be a little bit better than that on a full year basis or certainly as we exit the year end, it sounds like you're not saying that?","Randy Hogan","That's true on price. And the steel side you know, really when you look at our overall purchase steel is not that significant of a component of our overall spend. And so the steel inflation that you know, maybe you've seen on the other side of the business, we haven't seen that impact us in the same way.","Scott Graham","Got you. Fair enough. The other question I had is about you know, tariffs, obviously a lot going on both in the headlines and being executed to U.S. and China or maybe I should say U.S. versus China, even Russia a little bit here. Did you talk about - you know, have you analyzed how this could affect your business going forward?","Randy Hogan","We have looked at it and we\u2019ve really looked at it really in the two components, so the initial announcement focused on steel and aluminum. And as I mentioned earlier that that has a very limited impact on us for the year, so not even something that is worth mentioning.","Kind of the second round, the more recent round of announced tariffs. The team has been diligently working to evaluate what that looks like for us. As I'm sure you know there's a host of product codes that have been announced are being impacted, but at the same time you know, this is \u2013 it\u2019s evolving every day and there's a lot of ongoing review and comment that's coming in.","So it's really too early to be able to tell you know, what that's going to look like and how that's going to impact us. But rest assured that the team is on top of it and looking closely to understand what the implications are, as we get closer to a timeline where it's finalized and it's more clear what it may or may not look like when it's actually put in place and we'll be able to talk a little bit more specifically about how we think that might impact us.","Scott Graham","Understood. Thank you and nice quarter, amid a lot of moving parts in the quarter. Thanks.","Randy Hogan","Thank you. Appreciate that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Randy Hogan","Morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey, to just start off, Randy congrats. I remember the first transformational move you made way back when you pivoted Pentair out of the woodworking tools business and into water. So the company and you have come a long way.","Randy Hogan","Thank you.","Deane Dray","And then a question for John, and we saw the slide on your Investor Day, on page 15, the new Pentair Focused Strategies and look it makes a lot of sense to us to have you go down the path of your biggest strengths in Commercial & Residential and you said 80% of the business already are in those focus areas, but it still begs the question about that other 20%. And I'm not sure, you may not be in a position to disclose exactly how you're going to approach this.","But just share with us your thinking, what's on the table here, because you had some really strong brand and they are valued and maybe a lot of people interested in them, but maybe you want to keep them in some sort of a run-off for a no-core segment. But just what's the thinking there in terms of how that value might get unlocked?","John Stauch","And so half of that - half of that you could classify as more industrial facing opportunities, which is our food and beverage and our ex [ph] flow membranes play in there, Deane, and they're very important not only to our short term value creation, but also into our long-term value creation and coming back into the residential, commercial markets.","Because I think you know that technology starts with the applications of the municipal side and the industrial side and then usually get scaled and gets then some traction in the commercial and residential, so very key.","The other half of that would be our municipal products, primarily our pumps. And again you know, technology and the partnerships we have with different municipalities and the APCs help create some value and translate in the rest of the business.","So right now it's really more about, they\u2019re important businesses and they need to continue to grow and continue to drive cash. But the incremental investment will be geared to the 80%. That's what our messaging is both externally and internally. And I think it's resonating.","Deane Dray","Got it. And. Just to clarify, would those be in separate segments or separate business lines that we might have some clarity as to how they're doing?","John Stauch","They're in Flow Technologies and they'll also be in the segment called Filtration Solutions. And we'll be sharing that on an annual basis kind of what are you know, percentages of revenue are and sure as you ask us we'll be able to tell you how those market segments are doing.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then a question on Aquatics. This is an important quarter for you always because there is elements, at times where there's an early buy. You highlighted new products. What kind of expectation are you looking for contribution from new products and is there anything baked in for all the rebuilding and replacement from the hurricane damage in Texas and Florida. Is any of that included in your assumptions?","John Stauch","Yes, that's included and you know, all in, we are having new product introductions this year like we usually do. It's all of that is included in the expectations for the year Deane.","And you know, as you mentioned, Q2 is a very important quarter, right now all indications are it's going to be another great season and we're going to participate in that.","Deane Dray","Was there any early buy that was a factor in the first quarter or is that comparable to last year?","John Stauch","Nothing unusual from an early buy perspective in the first quarter.","Deane Dray","Excellent. Thank you.","Randy Hogan","Thank you, Deane.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird.","Mike Halloran","Morning, everyone.","Randy Hogan","Good morning, Mike.","Mike Halloran","So just on the filtration and the flow tech side, two questions for both actually. So one, top line was pretty healthy on both sides. You know, obviously just got the color on what that looked like last year with the backdated information you guys gave us. But maybe talk a little bit about what the sustainability of those healthy trends look like, anything that you thought was unique to the quarter? Because we're certainly encouraging to see the revenue start coming through there?","John Stauch","Sure. Really I think the story in both places is stabilization, as I as I talked about a little bit. So both businesses continue to focus on the things that will improve and reduce some of the variability and stabilize both topline and bottom line, removing and reducing the complexity in the businesses and focusing on the areas where we can profitably grow.","So we're cautiously optimistic that in both cases we're going to see that those trends continue and see the return to topline growth and see improve profitability.","Mike Halloran","So that the second question for both is just on the profitability side, very healthy year-over-year gains in both segment. The expectations for the year seem pretty healthy as well.","Any way you can parse out what directionally what's internally driven, what\u2019s price cost, what volume related just to help understand what the sustainability looks like and then also understand what the drivers are, specifically\u2026","John Stauch","Yeah. As Mark mentioned, there's a big mix benefit here. I mean, when we - when we go after the large projects in filtration which have been a nuisance to you guys, as well as us, they don't bring any real value to the bottom line. So by not growing those areas we actually do get a mix pick up like.","The second one inflow, I mean, the reducing of the complexity as well, I mean, we had a lot of under scaled product lines globally and by exiting those and you know, optimizing the portfolio we're seeing the benefit of what the residential, commercial drop-throughs are.","So I think it's a focused portfolio on both around the things that we really honestly think we can differentiate against competition and differentiate our consumer\u2019s eyes. And then we're benefiting from that growth.","Mike Halloran","Make sense. And then last one here, just making sure I understand the impact from the divested businesses that you guys talked about or the product launch shutdowns. What's the segment income impact? I'm guessing relatively negligible otherwise you would have pointed it out, but just curious and how that flows through?","Randy Hogan","That's right. The segment income impact is small, so it really did reference back to what John just said, it's part of a focused optimization strategy to really exit the things that are - that are unprofitable and we don't believe we can be successful and so that's why we didn't call it out separately.","Mike Halloran","Make sense. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Congratulations.","Randy Hogan","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with UBS.","Steven Winoker","Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the separation guys.","Randy Hogan","Thanks. We\u2019re getting there. ","Steven Winoker","You're always there. So listen, just first on flow tech, why 1% to 2% on the guide given you had the uptick to 2% I mean, maybe it's just so close. I shouldn't worry about it. But is this any kind of deceleration though for the rest of the year. I looked at the comp, I don\u2019t think that really explained it, just little color for that, just conservatism?","Randy Hogan","Yeah, there's no there's no messaging there, its no - there's no deceleration. It's just as I said earlier cautiously optimistic and you know, trying to stay, not get too far out over our skis and we'll see how the rest of the year plays out before we call it a success.","Steven Winoker","And you mentioned long cycle backlog improving, a little color there would be helpful?","Randy Hogan","The point there is that after years of kind of bouncing around and declining, it's stabilized, we're seeing a relatively strong order rates and the backlog stabilizing as we look forward.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And restructuring $6 million in the quarter I think, but no more for the rest of the year. I wasn't sure if that was total anyway, but just maybe a little perspective you know, given kind of what you're seeing, given the separation all these other things going on that you think there's no more restructuring for the rest of the year or is this just kind of you know, a little color there would be helpful?","Randy Hogan","Sure. So think of the restructuring is all being tied into the optimisations and some of those the product lines of business exits that John referenced earlier. And so while we didn't necessarily indicate that we've guided to any more restructuring in Q2, I do anticipate there will be some in Q2.","But what we're really focused on - and that restructuring again it's associated with the separation and the activities around setting up the two separate businesses to be successful going forward.","So I see some more in Q2 but then after that we can expect that to taper off and not anticipating anything in the second half of the year.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And John, one for you on Aquatics, you know, another great quarter in terms of growth here from the business, but if you \u2013 you know, a lot of other businesses who have focused tended to kind of under-invest in various pieces and finally find these great opportunities when they start investing again.","Your point around focus here in advancing growth in aftermarket and automation, I mean, were there as great as it's been in terms of performance as much as this kind of contributed to helping the other businesses when they've had troubles for recent years. Have there been areas where you would have liked to have seen more dollars flow that are kind of pent up and now you're getting to do that. Or is this just a case of normal course of focusing growth?","John Stauch","Well, I think, first of all the former, right. I mean, we have our best business that often is - unfortunately became the cash cow for funding some of those non-prioritized areas of business that we\u2019re talking about. So is allowing them to invest where they think the opportunities are.","On the automation side, we are - we have a great product on the high end of the market, but not everybody can afford the high end automation products. So it's about serving the mid-market and the entry level of automation and we think we've got a great product there, that's going to be introduced in the short run. And then also making sure we got a high efficiency heater, which we just launched this year.","So both the technology and a new product introduction, as you know those things need to be nurtured in the early quarters of launch and we also think that we have to build our brand at the consumer level, we're really well-known at the dealer level. And we like to market ourselves direct to the consumer to make sure we're taking advantage of all the different aftermarket opportunities that we would have.","Steven Winoker","Okay, great. I\u2019ll let it go. Thanks.","Randy Hogan","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone.","Randy Hogan","Morning, Nathan.","Nathan Jones","The question on operating leverage and so I'm looking at slide nine here, you got $24 million of volume growth and then $20 million of income growth from growth price acquisitions. So if I knock [ph] the $5 million of price out, there you've got $58 million on $24 million of volume or incrementals that are in the low 60s. Is that the right way to think about it? Just on volume growth how much did mix impact that and how should we be thinking about that kind of incremental over the longer term?","John Stauch","I think the long-term incremental is closer to 45 days and all in. And I remind you guys that you know, we had a tough project challenge last year and we call that out last year and that was a help this year. But beyond that you know, 45-ish to 50 that's our drop-throughs. And then how do we invest wisely goes into the productivity bucket.","Nathan Jones","Okay. That's helpful. Then on the product line exits business divestitures. How much of that is - I'm just getting out of these businesses - I can actually sell this for some cash. Is there going to be much of cash flow back to you from here or is this just exiting markets and can you give us any detail on what kind of marketing products \u2013product launch that you're going to be exiting?","John Stauch","Sure. It's really the focus is getting out of product lines or markets that are underperforming. So I wouldn't anticipate that there's any significant cash that comes in. We're certainly not giving the businesses away by any means. But you know, given the nature of the businesses and the size it's not it's not something that we're seen as a big uptick in cash.","For us it's small geographies that we don't feel that we can - that we've got the scale to be able to be competitive, so exiting businesses in Brazil in Russia in South Africa, places like that and then small product line, product line in Australia, a few other smaller product lines, things that we wouldn't have talked about before. But think of them as distractions that you know, pulled resources away from the focus on what are the priorities in the areas that we think we can really double down on and do better.","And so the intent was to get those behind us all again as part of this process of separating and standing up to new businesses and creating a water business that we feel can be successful going forward. So - and those things are all underway and we anticipate that they'll be completed over the course of the next couple of quarters.","Nathan Jones","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair.","Brian Drab","Hi. Good morning. Brian Drab from William Blair. Two questions. One, basically the same question one for the Aquatic segment and then same question for Filtration. The growth in Aquatic obviously off to a very strong start, you're forecasting you know, its bit about 8% growth again 7.5% growth for the second quarter within 5.5 for the year. So you know, it implies a deceleration from 8% growth in the first half to about 3% in the second half. So I wonder if you could talk about why that would be?","John Stauch","No real reason. I mean, if we continue trends it will be better, but we\u2019ve got to see how Q2 comes out and then we'll adjust accordingly as the year unfolds.","Brian Drab","Okay. So sort of a similar mentality to what you're forecasting for the flow tech, it seems like the theme here is that there is some conservatism in the in the second half guide?","John Stauch","Well more we have to see to make a determination.","Brian Drab","Okay. And then on the filtration side you know, just doing that same exercise looking at what you know first quarter results, second quarter guide, here you\u2019re going from 4% growth down to 1.5 and then you know, if you take the full year guide into account then it reaccelerates back to you know 3 plus in the second half of the year. You know what's happening in the second quarter. And then you know, what drives that rebound in the second half of the year? Thanks.","John Stauch","Right now it's just year-over-year comparisons in Q2, Q3 and Q4. We generally took the Q1 upside and moved it the year and we haven't adjusted anything yet in Q2, Q3 and Q4 until we see how the seasonality unfolds in Q2.","Brian Drab","Okay. John, than you very much.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Ronnie Weiss","Hey. Good morning, guys, Its Ronnie Weiss on for Julian.","Randy Hogan","Hi, Ronnie.","Ronnie Weiss","Of the $25 million of growth investment, how much of that came in Q1 and then can you walk through how that trends through the year and what the payback timing on that investment spend looks like as we go forward here?","John Stauch","Yeah, if you were to put it linear by quarter, we spent a couple million less than that linearization in Q1 and it ramps up as we head into Q3 and Q4.","Ronnie Weiss","Okay, great. And then going back to the inflation point, I was wondering if you could quantify or bucket out you know, what came from raw mats, what came from labor inflation, maybe there were some great inflation there as well. And you know, how those three buckets look for the year?","Randy Hogan","Think about it by half - half of that inflation is labor, half is material. No real significant change in freight. And then think of that consistently throughout the year.","Ronnie Weiss","Okay. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks, guys.","Randy Hogan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna.","Robert Barry","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Randy Hogan","Hey, Robert.","John Stauch","Morning.","Robert Barry","Just curious another take on the tariff question about what you're seeing in the ag end market any impacts there from kind of uncertainty around tariffs?","John Stauch","Yes, so as Mark mentioned, I mean, there's tariff one which is steel aluminum, is really nominal impact to us for the year and that's focused into this forecast or factoring in this forecast. As far as the next round of tariffs as Mark mentioned, we're grinding through all the different codes and the products and you know, trying to explore what the impact to us would be and the actions would be and we're not prepared to share anything on that at this moment.","Randy Hogan","I think, the thinking of it from a market perspective, we have a global ag business, so if the market moves from one place to the to the other the business can pick that up, regardless of whether it's here or in other geographies.","Robert Barry","Got it. You also had called out precision spray. Can you just remind us how big that business is and what in particular caused it to outperform this quarter?","Randy Hogan","We've got about a $100 million of revenue annually in which we create precisions spray. We have an OEM relationship where we've been really driving our nozzles onto the OEM side and then we also are getting good aftermarket lift in that business. So it's a share and creating new products and those new products create value to the farmers.","Robert Barry","Got it. And then just finally the divestitures, is that having a material impact on one mix in helping the ROS this year or will it?","Randy Hogan","As John talked about that, that's part of the reason why we've mixed up is because we\u2019ve exited through divestitures of product line exit, so some of the lower - lower performing parts of the business.","Robert Barry","The 10 basis point change since the Analyst Day is that\u2026","Randy Hogan","Basically think of really no income impact on the revenue that is highlighted there.","Robert Barry","Got it. Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global.","Walter Liptak","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Congratulations, guys.","Randy Hogan","Thanks.","Walter Liptak","I want to ask about, you know, on the growth strategies slide 15, should we think about you know you've got more in - more focused programs in filtrations, I mean, you've got more spending on new products going on there are these you know, somehow weighted by segment?","Randy Hogan","I think in the filtration side take that as a global business and a global opportunity, so yes there is more innovation and technology required there. There's also today we don't go to the consumer with our brand. So there's some brand investment required. So I think you're thinking about it correctly.","Walter Liptak","Okay, great. And then if you can just refreshes on timing of when you think you'll get benefits from the incremental spending and how will that look in terms of growth rates?","Randy Hogan","I think, we\u2019ll start to get benefits here in the second half. But I mean, will - it will be generally rounding error as you think about differentiated growth and we hope to build over time to getting a predictable and consistent incremental 1% to 2% of differentiated growth over the long haul from these three activities.","Walter Liptak","Okay, great. And then just a couple of kind of housekeeping things. What's your expectation for R&D spend this year and corporate expense?","John Stauch","$55 million for corporate and roughly 3% of sales for R&D.","Walter Liptak","Got it. Thank you.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Randy Hogan","Okay. Thank you for joining us today and I hope you have heard our excitement for the new Pentair that is expected to be completed by April 30th. As a pure-play water company we believe we'll be well positioned to benefit from strong secular trends. We are driven by the Pentair integrated management system and we have a proven and capable management team in place. One of the things we like most about our portfolio of businesses is our large and installed base. This allows us an opportunity to drive differentiated offerings for our customers across all of our businesses. Finally, we have a strong capital structure. Our free cash flow generation is robust. We plan to continue to be disciplined with our precious capital. Thank you for your continued interest. Angie you can conclude the call.","Operator","Certainly. Thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time."],"16686":["Pentair Inc.

(Operator Instructions) I'll now introduce and turn the call over to Sara Zawoyski, Head of Investor Relations.","Sara Zawoyski","Welcome to Pentair's full year and Q4 2011 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Sara Zawoyski, Head of Investor Relations. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our Q4 and full year 2011 performance as well as our Q1 2012 outlook, as outlined in this morning's release.","Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's 10-Q for the quarter ended October 1, 2011, and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results.","Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website at www.pentair.com. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. All references today will be on an adjusted basis amongst otherwise indicated towards the non-GAAP financials reconciled in the appendix of the presentation.","We'll reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks, but in recognition that there are other calls going on this morning, we will target to be done in an hour. With that, I'd like to request you to limit your question to one and get back in the queue for further questions. So we can try to make it for everyone this morning.","With that, Randy?","Randy Hogan","Thanks, Sara, and welcome everybody. Let me begin with our fourth quarter performance on Slide 2. As you saw in the press release, we recorded the non-cash goodwill impairment charge of roughly $200 million pre-tax and $1.82 per share related exclusively to our Residential Filtration business as a result of our annual impairment assessment process.","The recent decline we saw in residential water treatment components sales in the U.S. and Western Europe and the expected continued softness in these end markets no longer supported the level of goodwill carried in Residential Filtration.","Clearly, this is a difficult headline on which to end the year and one that I'm personally disappointed to have to report. However, it does not change where we are as a company, the progress we've made in 2011 and the growth opportunities we have ahead.","Today, we sell roughly $1.2 billion into the global residential end markets. Roughly one-third of that relates to pool, which is already back to setting records with good secular trends and efficiency in automation. Another third of that is Flow with solid replacement demand and a strong performance in 2011. The remaining third is Filtration, which includes point-of-use filtration which has low penetration and solid global growth, and the water treatment softener component business that mainly serves developed regions and tends to be more discretionary. This business is the one that's been impacted by consumer sentiment and financing in the housing business.","We still, however, continue to see long-term value in the Residential Filtration business with growing scale and fast growth regions and industry-changing innovations like the Hybrid DI coming to market this year. We expect to continue to gain from our global expansion and innovation to drive topline growth and will be relentless in our focus on operational excellence and improving operating performance in Residential Filtration to be sure Pentair is well positioned to benefit from a meaning residential recovery in this business when that comes.","The other item impacting Q4 reported earnings was an $11 million pre-tax restructuring charge as we reposition the company to capture CPT cost synergies, address the realities in the developed markets and continue to reposition us for global growth.","Let's turn now to the core operating performance in Q4, which came in generally in line with the revised growth expectations we shared in December. The operating performance headlines were solid despite the headwinds in Western Europe in Residential Filtration. Overall, we grew sales 15%, expanded adjusted operating margins to drive operating profits of 18% and delivered adjusted EPS of $0.56, which is up 14%.","Strength continued in many of the end markets we serve, including industrial, beverage, agriculture and energy. Momentum continued in the fast growth regions as well with sales up 23% in the quarter before including the CPT acquisition. We continue to execute well on our growth initiatives with new products and expanding coverage adding to our growth.","Margin increased another 30 basis points in the fourth quarter, generally as expected. Volume, productivity and pricing helped to offset persistent material inflation to sustain growth investments.","In Q4, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.56 compared to the $0.49 in the prior year, reflecting the solid sales in both Water and Technical Products, excellent operating performance and benefit from CPT. We finished strong in cash flow, generating $61 million in the quarter. This brings our full year free cash flow to $248 million.","In sum, we delivered another quarter of solid operating performance with strong execution driving topline results, good price cost dynamics enabling margin expansion and sustained productivity funding continued growth investments, which we believe position us well for growth in 2012 and beyond.","Now let's turn to Slide 3 for a review of our Water results. Water sales grew 21% year-over-year in the quarter, largely driven by the CPT acquisition, which added $92 million in sales. Excluding the 2010 GIWW project headwind in Engineered Flow, organic sales grew 6% in Water with good price realization and broad base growth across the businesses.","Residential Flow sales were up 7% in the quarter. Share capture with better delivery in quality, new products and geographic expansion helped to offset headwinds in Western European pump sales which were down nearly 10% in the fourth quarter.","Agricultural equipment sales, including irrigation pumps and crop spray, grew an impressive 31% in the quarter, lapping a 30% growth of a year ago to finish the year overall of 19%. While still relatively modest today, we believe this business can meaningfully contribute to Pentair's future growth with innovation, geographic expansion and channel improvement.","Residential Filtration sales grew 5% in the quarter. Fast growth region sales continue to grow at a robust pace with India more than doubling. We continue to expand distribution coverage and make great strides in our in-region for-region strategy. In contrast, sales in developed regions were down 5% in the quarter, reflecting channel and discretionary pressures in residential softener components as well as a sharp adjustment in yearend pro channel inventory levels in the U.S.","While we have some upcoming product launches, including a new treatment valve in Q2, we expect continued weakness in residential softener component sales this year.","Pool sales were up 18% in the quarter, reflecting share gains and a solid aftermarket demand. Early buy program sales were strong with good carryover, while standard orders grew at an even faster rate, both of which are positive indicators for 2012.","Expanded distribution continues to be a growth driver, adding another 95 dealers in the quarter, totaling over 400 additions for the year. Our Eco-Select products well outpaced the industry, growing 25% in 2011, led by impressive IntelliFlo pump sales which were up over 50% this year.","Next in innovation is the IntelliChem, which is an efficient auto dosing pool system that monitors pH and sanitizing levels to maintain safe well balanced water. Even with no meaningful housing recovery, industry growth fundamentals remain strong with now over 30 utility-funded rebate programs for energy-efficient pool products and expected launch of an ENERGY STAR program by the EPA with support from the DoE for pool pumps later in 2012. Share gains combined with targeted international expansion at technology and innovation investment should position us well with sustain growth going forward.","Engineered flow sale decreased 25% with a GIWW comparison driving 17 percentage points of that decline. The remaining 8% decline reflects continued softness in the large U.S. municipal project sales, partially offset by strong industrial sales. While muni backlog seems to be stabilizing running at roughly $60 million, consistent with 2010 end of the year numbers but better than the 2011 low-point of approximately $45 million, we continue to expect ongoing sluggish municipal sales in the U.S. as reduced capital spending for Water infrastructure continues.","Filtration Solutions sales were up 3% at ex-CPT and up 5% excluding foreign exchange. We continue to see nice growth and desalination through the distribution channel along with some project work. Food service steadily adds the sales each quarter, growing 4% in Q4. In energy, sales were down modestly year-over-year reflecting some project delays.","Backlog in energy projects, however, has never been stronger as we apply our existing technology in systems outside of the refinery to sell the broader set of customer needs in the oil and gas market.","CPT added $92 million in sales in Q4 and grew mid-single digits in local currency when compared to pre-acquisition 2010 sales. Growth moderated from Q3 reflecting market pressures, a tighter project focus and currency headwind. For our market view, backlog remains strong, we seem them delayed from project activity particularly in the municipal water side, which we expect to continue into 2012. Q4 also reflects the tighter focus on profitable growth, muting the topline slightly near-term, but expected to boost profitability and long return. And last currency was more of a headwind than we expected coming into the quarter.","For 2012, I'm confident on our ability to generate 10% plus topline growth in this business and grow profits at an even faster pace. We've got some exciting innovations with both our Megablock and Anaerobic-MBR solutions now both in the market.","In Dairy, we just launched the first and currently only mix proof valve that is not required a full port leakage chambers, which simply means greater efficiency, much more safety and smarter operation and a new space-saving design for our customers. We're also developing a new technology platform around hollow fiber nanofiltration that improves performance due to the less energy and reduces the footprint compared to the standard RO solution used today.","The first targeted application is the removal of silica from water using high purity applications like boiler water feed and steam generation in power plants with plans for broader applications in the future including color and endocrine disruptor in 2013 and beyond.","Cross-selling opportunities are also beginning to take hold. Global sales training for CPT should be complete in Q1, unlocking pull-through potential for vessels, pumps and the full water product line. The cross-selling opportunities extent to food and beverage as well, with our leading position in aseptic valves and diary, for example. We're recently started pouring utility pumps, incoming water treatment, boiler feed water and wastewater treatment proving meaningful upside potential. I believe we've only just began to see the benefits from our combined sales coverage, technology platforms and product portfolios.","The right half of the page shows Q4 Water operating profits and margin. Water operating margins expanded 20 basis points to 11.2% in the quarter, a significant accomplishment given the mix pressures.","I'm pleased with pricing and productivity was constant in Q4 helping the offset inflation. While CPTs seasonality help Water margins in Q4, we expect to drive meaningful improvements in CPT margins going forward through a combination of volume leverage, lean-driven efficiencies as well as synergistic cost takeout from the Q4 repositioning efforts.","Through the application of lean disciplines we've already made progress in multiple plans. Examples include machine setup time in half, doubling output of cells with no additional headcount and rolling out our safety first Program, all while reinvesting these savings to create Lean Leader rolls at all CPT sites to ensure a compounding, sustaining impact as we move forward.","Overall I'm pleased with the Water performance this quarter and continue to be excited about its future with CPT in the fold and the global investments we've seeded over the last several years.","Now let's move to Slide 4, for a review of Technical Products. Technical Products sales were up 2% in local currency and operating profits were up 12%. The topline results reflected good price realization with no net volume contribution. While the majority of end markets we served continue to grow nicely including industry, energy, commercial and infrastructure which all grew double-digits. Communication which accounts for nearly 20% of Technical Products sales was down 19% in the quarter.","Consistent with what we've said in Q3, roughly half of that decline reflects the lumpiness of the telecom program going end-of-life, and the remainder is due to communications market softness overall.","Technical Products grew fast growth region sales higher by 25% in the quarter, led by impressive growth in China and Southeast Asia. We continue to execute our in-region for-region strategy including repositioning our Qingdao operation to more directly focus on serving the China market with branded products.","In Brazil, we've begun localizing thermal production to support our row global cooling initiative. We continue to leverage our lower cost manufacturing capabilities in strong brand to build our position in key growth markets and expand distribution. While there is still more work to be done, Technical Products increased fast growth regions sales an impressive 28% for the year to over a $135 million.","Technical Products operating profit grew 12% in the quarter with an impressive 80% drop through in-sales. Operating margins reached 16.4% in Q4, a significant accomplishment given our continued growth investments and mix headwinds for fast growth regions. Bottomline in Technical Products is that like the market, we're growing. We continue to see robust growth in U.S. and global industrial as business spends is more on maintenance and capital. We're also benefiting from some positive mix shift away from communications and our established lean disciplines continue to drive margins higher.","Please turn to Slide 5 as I cover the full year. 2011 sales grew, a strong 14% year-over-year to record $3.5 billion. This reflects 6% organic growth including roughly a point of foreign exchange benefit offset by a negative 2-point impact from GIWW.","For the year, U.S. organic sales grew 5%. Fast growth regions were up over 20%. And Western Europe was up 3% in local currency. Our clear focus in execution on growth initiatives are driving topline results. At the operating margin line solid pricing, productivity and lean action helped offset inflation in the CPT acquisition impact of 20 basis points.","Pentair adjusted margins expanded 70 basis points in 2011, on top of prior year is a 140 basis point improvement. At the same time, we continue to invest in global capabilities and technology innovation in sales and marketing.","From a segment view, Water revenues grew 16% for the full year. With CPT innovation and distribution all playing key roles and margins expanded 60 basis points.","Technical Products grew revenue 10% for the full year and expanded margins by an impressive 190 basis point, on top of last year's 230 basis point improvement.","The bottom line for 2011 was adjusted EPS of $2.41, which was an increase of 21%, so 2011 marks the year of solid sales growth and margin advancement along with significant progress and strategy that we believe position us well for 2012.","Now let's turn to Slide 6. Details of the free cash flow are on the left of the slide and a summary of our debt levels are on the right. We finish the year strong, generating $61 million in free cash flow in the fourth quarter. This brought our full-year free cash flow to $248 million representing a net income conversion of greater than 100% and above our goal once again.","We returned approximately $80 million to shareholders through dividends and recently raised our 2012 quarterly dividend 10%, which equate to an annual dividend of $0.88 per share marking our 36 consecutive annual dividend increase. In addition, we repurchased $13 million in shares under our share buyback authorization program to help offset dilution and have a similar program in placed for 2012.","ROIC, which is shown on the bottom right section of the slide continues to be a key priority for our organization. We're exiting 2011 at 9% on ROIC, up 80 basis points from the 8.2% at the end of last year. Our goal continues to be to drive ROIC back into the double-digit range.","Not let's turn to Slide 7. Beyond the numbers, we made good progress on our strategic priorities, setting the stage for future success and sustainable growth. Organically, we increased fast growth region sales 22% in 2011, totaling about $650 million with CPT. We also meaningfully advanced our global water and fluid process capabilities through acquisitions, Clean Process Technologies and Hidro Filtros in Brazil.","Both acquisitions directly aligned with the biggest mega trend driving the world today, and that is the population in the wealth growth that what we call the new world. This is putting incredible pressure in demands on food, water, energy and industrial and transport infrastructure.","On the innovation front, we remain committed to investing for growth and serving these growing needs. Sustaining higher R&D investments deliver customers what they need including better efficiency, sustainability, automation and safety.","We continue to be recognized by customers for our service and our innovation solutions. We continue to grow beyond market rates by identifying new adjacent opportunities including expanding our global thermal platforms in Technical Products which is up 40% outside the U.S. as we design, develop and manufacture new product in China, India for China and India.","In Water, we see exciting new market opportunities at high growth areas like dairy and agriculture. Another key growth driver is Pentair Integrated Management System. We continue to improve product quality, on-time delivery, workplace safety as well as cost-and-cash as shown by our 80 basis points gross margin expansion in 2011.","We also have over a decade of generating strong cash flow, consistently converting greater than a 100% of net income to free cash flow, all investing for future growth. We also recognized our one-year anniversary of the rapid growth process, training over 500 global years in this new disciplined growth process and adding another strong tool in our PIMS toolkit.","We believe that progress in 2011 to advance our strategy in technology and innovation, fast growth region and PIMS positioned us well for sustained profitable growth in 2012 and beyond. And the Q4 repositioning actions are yet another catalyst as we better align to capture fast growth region opportunities, flow resources to the best opportunities and lower cost structures in developed regions.","With that, let's turn to Slide 8 for a snapshot of our realignment within Water. Three years ago, we implemented our global business unit organization structure, enabling us to advance our global growth strategies and execution. As we leveraged PIMS and incorporated our rapid growth process, we gained deeper insights into their markets, current processes and growth platforms. Now with CPT in the fold, our next step was to ensure that we were aligned around how the customers want to do business, while also recognizing today's market realities.","Our new water & fluid process alignment focuses on three key platforms. Two of them flow and treatment in process each represents roughly $1 billion in sales today. Aquatic Systems, which is the renamed pool business, represents roughly $500 million in sales. Within this framework, we will prioritize technology platforms, leverage scale where we can like in flow and have a shared fast growth region strategy across businesses.","This will help ensure we are moving swiftly and efficiently on opportunities in key growth markets like China, India and Brazil, maximizing growth, customer alignment and scale, while reducing channel and business conflict. We believe this new water alignment will help us advance our mission towards being an increasingly global company while delivering superior returns to our shareholders.","With that, let's turn to Slide 9, which is the same outlook we've provided in December. We continue to expect organic revenue for 2012 to grow in the mid-single digits, margins to expand 40 basis points to 80 basis points and EPS of $2.60 to $2.75 a share. We entered 2012 with good price cost momentum, additional price actions underway and a strong track record of productivity.","With additional savings expected from our recent repositioning actions and the improvement in CPT margins, we believe we can manage the continued mix pressures and foreign currency headwinds. We also expect to once again convert greater than 100% of net income into free cash flow and improve an additional 50 basis points in ROIC.","With that, let me turn it over to John to review in greater detail the 2011 financial performance and 2012 guidance.","John Stauch","Thanks, Randy. Please turn to Slide 10 where I'll discuss the adjustment items enacting full year reported EPS. The acquisition-related costs, including deal cost, customer backlog and inventory step-up adjustments, came in at $0.15 for the full year, in line with initial estimates with no carryover into 2012. The restructuring charge totaled about $0.08 in the fourth quarter and $0.10 for the full year, which reflects the repositioning actions Randy discussed.","Recognizing today's market realities, we've reduced capacity and consolidated warehouses to lower cost in developed regions. At the same time, we've better aligned the channels between CPT and the Bayswater businesses and taken a more market-backed look at key fast growth regions to ensure we are leveraging the broader Pentair portfolio and have the right prioritized investments in the right regions.","And last is the goodwill impairment charge of $1.82 in the fourth quarter, resulting from an annual impairment analysis. Under GAAP, goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. In the first step, we determine that the carrying value of the Residential Filtration business exceeded its fair value. From there, you move on to the second step, which includes a rigorous and thorough valuation analysis of the business and all the assets and a revaluation of goodwill.","The second step resulted in $200.5 million pre-tax reduction of goodwill and a Residential Filtration GBU, which is primarily triggered by performance in valves and tank products for water softeners in developed regions.","As Randy mentioned, we still feel that our technology in this business, especially the to-be-launched Hybrid DI, our Homespring application and all of our point-of-use technology for fast growth markets has significant value. But the steady downturn of the U.S. housing market combined with a shift in the pro channel, the retail channel which pressured profitability and the performance of this business in Q3 and Q4 of 2011 could no longer sustain for accounting purposes the value of the goodwill in the balance sheet.","So we wrote it down to what was more in line with the business outlook, reflecting the realities of today's market. Because the majority of our goodwill is not tax deductible, we've only a small tax benefit associated with the impairment, $19.4 million, resulting in an after-tax charge of $181 million or $1.82 per share.","With that as a review of the adjustments, let's turn to Slide 11 for a view on the ongoing operating performance. Over the past two years, we've expanded margins by 210 basis points with another 40 basis points to 80 basis points of expansion expected this year. Lean discipline and productivity enhancements along with repositioning savings will positively impact 2012, all while continuing to invest more in R&D, technology and selling\/marketing growth initiatives, primarily in fast growth regions.","In 2012, we expect to build upon the product quality, on-time delivery and workplace safety improvements of a year ago, enabling us to serve our global customers better and more efficiently.","We're anticipating our repositioning efforts to drive over $20 million of savings in 2012, equating to approximately one-third of the top end of the net productivity range we provided in December. This gives us a higher level of confidence in our 2012 operating targets while helping us fuel future growth.","Another key enabler to our margin expansion is improving CPT margins. With roughly 15% EBITDA margins for the Pentair ownership period in line with our expectations, full year CPT EBITDA margins for 2011 were about 12%. Along with volume leverage, we're driving material sourcing savings, lean transformation and a tighter profit focus to increase profitability.","Net pricing and productivity should yield even better results for us in 2012. We expect pricing to yield 150 basis points to 200 basis points for the full year with most pricing actions rolling in during Q1 and early Q2. We expect material inflation to moderate a bit in 2012 compared to the persistent inflation of plus-4.8% last year, providing a better price material cost dynamic.","In 2012, we'll continue to prioritize and allocate our resources to the best opportunities available. We'll continue to fund our growth initiatives with R&D and sales and marketing investments critical to driving share gains and delivering long-term sustainable growth.","Corporate cost should increase by about $5 billion versus 2011 due to higher pension and medical costs and global investments in business development, brand marketing and fast growth market infrastructure.","Please turn to Slide 12 labeled Q1 2012 Outlook. For Q1, we expect the Water revenue to be up approximately 20% over the first quarter of last year with Technical Products up low-single digits. This puts total Pentair revenue up 13% to 15% including the contribution from CPT of approximately 10 points or roughly $80 million in sales.","We expect operating income to grow 7% to 12%, which equates to operating margins between 10.5% and 11%, slightly below the Q1 2011 margin of 11.1%. Because of the seasonality of CPT and the softer geographic mix, we expect Water margins to be down 50 basis points to 100 basis points. We expect Technical Products margins to expand 30 basis points to 50 basis points, reflecting some carryover pricing actions.","Below the line, we expect interest expense to be about $8 million higher in Q1 of this year versus Q1 of 2011 and the tax rate between 29% and 30% consistent with full year 2011 results.","Overall, we expect earnings per share in the quarter to be between $0.53 to $0.57, which equals growth of 2% to 10% over last year. Also, we want to remind you that like previous years, our cash will typically run negative in Q1 due to the seasonality of our revenue.","Please turn to my next slide, Slide 13, labeled Q1 and Full Year 2012 Outlook. As we said in our December call, we anticipate generating roughly of our EPS in the first half of 2012, which implies the modest first half growth rate and specifically Q1, as shown here on the slide. We expect once the European headwinds to carry over into the first quarter, impacting both sales and profitability. Further on, sales year-over-year growth in Technical Products is negatively impacted by the choppy telecom project by roughly 3 points in Q1 and into Q2.","While the CPT acquisition adds Q1 sales, we expect CPT margins in the low-single digits in Q1, typical of their normal seasonality, but we are working hard to improve to focus on higher margin projects and a transition to an improved operating structure. In addition, we have an incremental $8 million of acquisition-related interest headwind related to deal which we did not have in Q1 in 2011.","Pricing and reposition savings should ramp in the first half before reaching the full run rate in Q3, thus being the lightest benefit in Q1. All in, we are expecting a good start in Q1. We have a clear path forward for growth and margin expansion in 2012.","Please turn to my next slide, Slide 14, labeled full year 2012 outlook. For the full year 2012, we are reaffirming our previous guidance initiated in December. We expect revenues to be up 7% to 10% to about $3.75 billion at the midpoint and we anticipate $445 million to $470 million of operating income, which would yield operating margin expansion between 40 basis points and 80 basis points.","We continue to expect another solid year of EPS growth with earnings per share of $2.60 to $2.75. We expect free cash flow in 2012 to be roughly $270 million or at least 100% of net income. We are targeting a 75 basis point increase in ROIC by the end of 2012.","Please turn to my last slide, Slide 15, for the summary. Our record sales and strong operating performance in 2011 demonstrates our excellent execution of growth and productivity initiatives by both our Water and Technical Products teams. Our presence in fast growth markets has never been stronger. And we'll continue to leverage the investments in new product development and selling and marketing that we have ceded over the past few years.","We continue to covert income to cash at very healthy rates and deploy disciplined capital allocation strategy through balance of dividend, buybacks, high-return capital expenditures and acquisitions with strong strategic fits. In 2012, we are committed to our growth agenda through disciplined investments, focused resource allocation and prioritized initiatives.","We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. With that, we'll open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Robert Barry with UBS.","Robert Barry - UBS","Based on how you calculate the return on invested capital, how much of the improvement, if any, was related to the goodwill impairment charge?","John Stauch","Very small, 10 basis points, 15 basis points. What we do is we basically a take five quarter average of the ROICs we blended in. So we don't have the full investment base of CPT in yet either, but there isn't a full benefit from the goodwill reduction within the Residential Filtration business either.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Lucas with Janney Capital Markets.","Mike Worley - Janney Capital Markets","This is Mike Worley sitting in for Jim. Not that we would expect 80% incremental margins intact to continue, but what was the main reason for that and would we return to normal like 35%, 40% in 1Q?","Randy Hogan","The biggest drivers of that are they really are lean champions and they had good price and they had real positive mix. The declining communications, communications is the lowest margin. So they had a positive mix shift. That helps too. So yes, you can expect it to drop more than normal rate. I still think high end of that normal rate. They are solid, solid business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse","Randy, hoping you could touch a little more on the realignment of the Water global business units and maybe how this helps you in terms of a better sales channel, go-to-market strategy and also operationally in terms of driving productivity. And how do the benefits specifically play out in your mind over the next couple of years? Does this change your thinking in terms of M&A amongst those various buckets, or that's not really relevant?","Randy Hogan","Well, let me start with that. Our M&A focus continues to be in the areas of technology. What we're learning is that there is some more attractive businesses like dairy-like industry. Those have the highest margins and they have really good growth fundamentals. We're looking at applying anaerobic MBRs into a broad array of industries and we have market-leading capability there, the CO2 recovery, same thing.","The realignment is really to do a couple of things. Number one, it's to allow us to get some cost synergies from the CPT acquisition. The Nijhuis business that we bought, which is really a pump business, we get more synergies by aligning it with our pump businesses.","And as we look at that, we look at our high-performing Residential Flow business and our struggling Engineered Flow business, we saw an opportunity to take cost up by putting them all back together. And it was particularly relevant as we look to globalizing. We have a lot of brands in the U.S., for instance. Their channels are well established. But as we go overseas, we had gaps in coverage and we had conflicts in brands that we can make coherent by managing it as one unified piece. So that's the answer in Flow.","In terms of Filtration, we still have two GBUs in Filtration: one, the Residential Filtration; and two, the more technical process solutions. There are similar technologies, but the applications and go-to-market are very different, ones that imply capability and the other one is more through distribution.","But again, as we go to these new countries, we want to go to Pentair. We don't want to go to individual GBUs. So that's the other big change we're making here. So in China, we are Pentair. We are not Pentair Residential Filtration. We're not CPT. We are Pentair. And we see big leverage there.","For instance, I was recently in Chongqing, 32 million people. We only had three salespeople and they were all Residential Filtration. It's an industrial capital of the city. It's a huge opportunity for us. So we need to be there as Pentair for Pentair. And that's a big part of the realignment.","And then finally, the focus on pool leading our efforts in agriculture, because we already sell 20 million, 25 million worth of equipment with the RAS segment of agriculture with the use as pool equipment. And actually, our advanced pool equipment helps raise the yields in those applications. So we're quite excited about that and we saw that name change better captured where we're investing on our platforms.","So we're seeing the benefits both in terms of cost and in terms of prioritized investments and being Pentair, not individual GBUs in the markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Quealy with Canaccord.","John Quealy - Canaccord","It's Chip Moore for John. Just hoping you guys can talk about what you're seeing in January in a little more detail, particular in the muni market, and if you're still looking for that to be down sort of in the single-digit range for the year?","John Stauch","If we take a look at Q4, we did as we shared in December see a pretty steep decline in November and we did have a nice recovery in December. And so while Western Europe is still a challenge for us in the first part of 2012, we did see a distributor reaction based upon the economic outlook in Europe that we think impacted us, primarily as Randy mentioned, Residential Filtration.","As we look out to 2012 at the muni market, we still think it's down to single digits globally. Clearly, a customer base that doesn't have a lot of money. Break and fix will probably still get done, but large projects that have been anticipated continue to get the lag. So we're still anticipating a tough outlook for the municipal market for 2012.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with MKM Partners.","Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Just maybe to dig in on China for a moment, given the macro-sensitivity there, are you guys able to calibrate same-store or same-city sales? I would imagine that you're moving west and penetrating more cities as you go in some of the more established cities on the East Coast. Has growth flattened there or gone negative? Just maybe help us calibrate within country. Is the growth coming from additional regions or more growth within already established regions?","John Stauch","It's a combination. First of all, we do about $130 million and $140 million in China. So our growth rate is still strong in the 20s on the volume basis. Obviously we're coming from a little lower base than some more established organizations. But it is continuing to add distributors, adding new customers. And as Randy mentioned in his comments, we've got more localized content with more localized production with more localized marketing application.","And then I think there is a lot to this one-Pentair aspect in serving the customer the way the customer wants to be served. So all those things factoring in and we still see a pretty strong outlook for our products and technologies for 2012.","Randy Hogan","All of those things are really more than offsetting. What we have seen, which is some of our more established distributors having more difficult, as no surprise here, getting financing to put in inventory. That is the impact of the government being more strict about where monies go. So we have seen that too. But as John aptly described, the new initiatives and the new coverage is where it will sway.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Can you just run through within the mid-single digit organic growth again? How are you thinking fast growth regions versus Europe versus North America and maybe just touch on how you're thinking about FX relative to your guidance?","John Stauch","If you look at full year 2012, Jeff, we've got FX sort of $100 and 50 basis points in the headwind. You're going to see a predominant amount of that in Q2, not assuming we're going to get back the FX levels to year-old levels that we had last year. So let's call it 100 basis points to 150 basis points. Acquisitions as you know, will still carry over and give us about 5 points. But if you look at core volume growth, it's close to 4 points.","And in that context, we're thinking 15-ish for fast growth regions which for us is about 20%. So I kind of gave you what developed is looking like and within that we have context of European down about 5%. And we still see some growth in the U.S. domestic market.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","And you're not really changing your revenue guidance, so what's the offset to the FX?","Randy Hogan","Meaning what?","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","It means is FX materially worse from your December outlook?","Randy Hogan","No, its not. Ironically, the year-olds ending or ended 2011 starting in January, about where it was last year, I think the difference is that we just don't see it spiking in Q2 the way it ran up last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","Just wondering, how Water versus Technical Products order rates where as the quarter progressed?","John Stauch","You're talking about Q4?","Scott Graham - Jefferies","Well, you indicated muni business kind of weaken and then improved a little bit. But I'm just wondering if you can maybe look at that more holistically by segment. As the quarter progressed, you know, October, November, December how did these businesses do, just trying to identify from this trend?","John Stauch","The Tech Products, we knew it was going to be low growth, because we knew what communications impact was. I mean it really came in the way we thought it would, with the low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter in Tech Products. In terms of Water, what caused us to trim our guidance in December was the fact that Western Europe was a lot weaker. And we saw weakening in November. And in December it was still weaker, but not as weak as it was in November. Muni came in the way we thought it was going to be, but it was weak and we expected it to be weak. The surprise for us in the quarter was how much weaker Western Europe gone in the Residential Business in November and December.","Randy Hogan","And Scott, just to add to that, we usually expect and see summary stocking in Q3 due to the season within Residential and Residential Filtration working its way out more in the summer months. We don't usually see in November a sort of correction, and that's what caught us off guard in the Q4 with the November correction primarily in Residential Filtration distributed base and as we mentioned those tanks and valves specifically.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair.","Brian Drab - William Blair","Just wanted to ask about the Residential Filtration business again and make sure that I didn't miss something but the outlook for that business in terms of organic growth 2012. What are your expectations there? And then how is the JV with GE Incorporated into that thinking and how is that business doing?","And I think you mentioned the Spring Business. I'm not sure what we're talking about there?","Randy Hogan","Let me start with the JV. The Residential Filtration is the JV. We set that up in mid-2008 and with the expectation that housing was going to strengthen and we would have the clear market leading position particularly in the developed world. And we have that. We have that position. We've actually made great progress in terms of new products and innovation and going global, particularly with a point of use product. The problem was that U.S. market didn't come back for that business. And the western European market got worse. It's that simple.","So strategically and if you will in terms of the initiatives we're investing in that business, that business has done everything we expected it to do and it has been very aggressive on taking cost out too. So it really singularly is driven by the housing downturn going longer and having a greater impact on water softeners and basically water softener is something that, if you lose your well pump or you lose an injector pump or you lose a trash pump, if you have a grinder, you're going to replace it. If your water softener goes out, you can buy bottle water. It's more discretionary purchase and that's really the whole impact there.","John Stauch","I'll hit the growth, we still and if you take a look at point of entry products which the valves and tanks, they were flattish for the year. They were up slightly in Q1 and Q2 and a big correction in Q3 and Q4. So when you take a look at the outlook for next year, we still think we'll be flattish on that side of the business.","And we got strong double-digit growth on the fast growth markets on the point of use. So this business is still expected to grow mid-single digits. The challenge is to make a lot of money and the piece that's flattish. And we're starting to make good money on the piece that's growing internationally in the fast growth space.","Randy Hogan","Well, we moved Homespring. Now we make that in China. We improved margins dramatically. It's an exciting product. It's still at a price point where and it is a discretionary purchase, so it's where I think now with our lower cost, we can be more aggressive in terms of pushing it in. We're also very excited about the Hybrid DI which we showed at the Aquatech Show. We call it Hybrid DI because it not only replaces a softener, it does some of the same characteristics as in RO systems.","For the first time, we'll have it and introduce this year a solution for those communities that don't want to have salt discharge anymore. And we think that the opportunity that that presents is enormous. And again, we'll be commercial on that maybe this year. So there are some exciting things going on in that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research","Just referring to the balance sheet, from my calculations I calculated that you guys are kind of bumping up against your three-and-a-half times debt EBITDA covenant in Q4, I'm just curious how did the charges in the quarter kind of playing to those calculations? And also is there an equity or capital based covenant associated with your debt as well. It's not highlighted anywhere?","John Stauch","We're nowhere near the covenant levels. And if you take a look at the debt levels versus the 500 plus of EBITDA, we're nowhere near the numbers that you're referring to. And well within those bank limits and most of those bank limits allow for non-cash adjustments anyway.","Randy Hogan","And our banks have no problems with this one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citigroup.","Deane Dray - Citigroup","Just as you're going through the realignment of the broader business units and I missed what you said regarding CPT. I trust it's in that process technologies, is that correct?","John Stauch","Yes, if you take a look at this product line what we call the purification on the one side which is basically the Residential Filtration and the rest. And what we've really done is we've taken Nijhuis out of that and put it up in the Flow. So we have a strong technically focused group that includes the higher tech side of CPT.","Deane Dray - Citigroup","So the initial plan when CPT was acquired is you were going to run it as a standalone business. Does this reflect some integration of the business further within Pentair?","Randy Hogan","If we characterized it that way, that was certainly not intended, our intent was to get to know the business before we made decisions on how to run it. So we wanted to do is run it throughout the year and get to know the business intimately. So that when we did make changes they were smart changes not some kind of top-down corporate America, slam down changes, which many of us have seen before.","So the intent always was once we understood Nijhuis and the dynamics to how Nijhuis, the pump business, worked with the waterside of CPT was to say how can we get synergy. And as you know, we ended up selling some Nijhuis pumps through our Engineered Flow sales force. This was much more natural in terms of what we've done here. And we took some cost structure out when we did. So this is perfectly to plan.","Deane Dray - Citigroup","And then how about some color regarding what is the seasonality impact in the first quarter of CPT. Just what it is about the nature of their sales that would be softer in the first quarter?","Randy Hogan","Part of it is I would call it cultural organizational training. There was a business that always focused on the year and so the fourth quarter was the crescendo and then they kind of paused in the first quarter. A lot of the first quarter business, at least as we look at it traditionally for that business was our pump business in countries that we longer do business in. But we exited those businesses, those countries. And so we're not getting that business which would typically be in the first quarter. So it's a seasonally weak quarter. We'll see overtime whether that will continue or whether will end up flattening things out as they go. But that will come with the knowledge and work.","Deane Dray - Citigroup","Randy, it's right I mean that's just a private equity model that have to shift to a public company model and that Q4 is very meaningful, and I think overtime Q4 will be a little less contribution and we'll get to more normalized activity in Q1 and Q2, as we flattened that project and that booking cycle.","Randy Hogan","Particularly as we drive our lean disciplines. The first thing that hit me with was capital expenditure request because they were out of capacity. We've already run three lean events and we've created about 20% capacity. As we get to more of a lean kind of a pulse from the business, I would hope we could flatten things out and then create capacity and use it earlier in the year.","Deane Dray - Citigroup","And then just last question from me regarding CPT is, what are you expecting for contributions from new products in 2012?","Randy Hogan","On a percent basis, I don't that have on the top of my head.","Deane Dray - Citigroup","Is that the roll out of some of those new membranes or is that more of a 2013 of that?","John Stauch","We're going to see the first rollout of the nanofiltration about midyear and we think that application is going to be an exciting one. And as you recall, a few years ago we built and RO system in Vietnam to basically remove silica for feed water for new power plant in Vietnam. And RO is a sledgehammer as we've talked about before. But this first application is aimed at more technical removal like silica, that plant would cost less than half of it would applying in nanofiltration solution. So we think that there is a whole range of solutions for that that are going to be very exciting.","We're also very excited about the anaerobic MBR. The anaerobic MBR and the CO2 removal in beverage and in another food process is a huge opportunity to improve the efficiency as well as the environmental footprint of all of these plants. And we've talked before about the yoghurt plant in the U.S. with the Anaerobic-MBR, it's very, very exciting. We've already sold two more. So that's something we're very excited about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","Just wondering how much or if any of the dry and warm weather in North America played into the strong results improving the quarter and if so, is it possible to quantify how much of demand was put forward away from the first half 2012?","Randy Hogan","We don't think in the fourth quarter that we saw a lot of pull ahead, because in fact the carryover of orders into the first quarter were stronger than they were year ago. In the fourth quarter we had stronger regular orders as opposed to early buy which means that's selling though. And that could be because of the drier weather. But it also could mean, just that we've returned to a more normal application, 30 utilities driving rebates to drive energy is pretty compelling. And 400 additional dealers that we've got in place to drive because of our superior solutions is really why we think we're outgrowing the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","Just wanted to get a little more color on end market expectations within Water in 2012. John, if I follow the discussion correctly and I qualify, water up 9 to 12 for the year, call it 6 to 9 ex-CPT, call it 7 to 10 adjusting for the currency headwind roughly. And I think I heard you say you're expecting municipal down mid-single digit. Can you take us through the other segments, just a broad brush, what you're expecting on organic?","John Stauch","As we mentioned, just more of the 20% in water is fast growth that we think is going to grow at least 15%.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","I'm sorry, John. I was talking about like Resi Flow, Engineered Flow, pool.","John Stauch","If you take the Engineered Flow business, I think you're down mid-single digits to flat, with exports around commercial being a little stronger than they were in 2011. And then you've got what we think is a continued muni headwind of around 5 points of decline.","Residential Flow grew mid-single digits last year. We still think it's growing mid-single digit this year, helped by agriculture, which we think continues to grow double-digit. When we a look at Residential Filtration, we mentioned mid-single digits with a lot of its fast growth penetration offsetting which is likely to be flattish developed market shipments.","Who we still think will be high-single digits based upon trends in the market, all the factors around the dealers, certainly the energy efficiency place that Randy mentioned, we don't see significant slowdown in what would be high-single digits growth rate in our pool business. And we've also got the agriculture penetration that Randy mentioned.","All in all, I think we grew overall volume in water last year as roughly 5% all-in for water, absent price in the foreign exchange and acquisitions that we think is about a point lower at around 4% this year.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","So if the way to connect the dots between those comments which map to mid-singles, you're not including price in all those segment indications?","John Stauch","That's correct. Price for water, we expect to be around 175 basis points to 200 basis points.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","What was it again for all of 2011?","John Stauch","It was just around 100.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","Do you need to take additional price increase actions in the channel to get to that number or are we talking about a run rate or January price increases that they get you there?","John Stauch","You're talking about everything that's either in or planned at the moment. I mean it's anticipated and it's lined up.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","Are there any other acquisition revenues other than CPT in the mix for 2012?","John Stauch","Not at the moment, I don't know.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","So did the CPT revenue expectation for '12 come down because of the weakness in Europe?","John Stauch","Well, I mean it may come down slightly, but I mean with still strong double-digit growth.","Randy Hogan","We still expect double-digit growth. There is a impact on it, Terry. I mean when we were at about (technical difficulty) CPT and we're now about 30-ish. So there is that impact. But other than that, core volume is roughly the same.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.","David Rose - Wedbush Securities","I have a follow-up on the CPT revenue expectations for next year as well as the breakdown in Residential Filtration. CPT you're guiding for mid-single digit growth in the first quarter. Why are we seeing an acceleration for the rest of the year to get to strong double-digit growth, particularly when you said you're deemphasizing sales and focusing more on margin?","Randy Hogan","We got a plethora of opportunities in CPT and what we're doing is prioritizing those that have repetitive sales after them. So things that we can do and sell and then have a repetitive sell-through in the industrial cycle. And the second one is backing away from some of the lower margin aspects and a lot of those happen to be in muni where you're solving water issue once and you don't have that repetitive sales.","What you're seeing in Q1 is just a little bit more FX headwind on the business and a little less Western Europe volume. But we're starting to ramp the backlog in the business and we feel pretty good about the second half opportunity there.","David Rose - Wedbush Securities","This is one of the calls that you haven't talked a lot about ultra-pure water aside from boiler feed, but you've talked about life sciences, some microelectronic opportunities, similar markets that Paul serves. Is there still expectation that we'll see more in the ultra-pure side?","Randy Hogan","I just used a couple of examples with basically the nanofilter we're launching mid-year is going to be a superior product to put into ultra-pure applications. I just used some of the simpler ones, if you would, as the examples, because they're real-time and we're already selling them. But no, we still see opportunities there and we're still excited about.","David Rose - Wedbush Securities","And you've been talking about anaerobic MBR for almost a year and you have two products. I think you've said you've made two product sales. How much of the system sales each?","Randy Hogan","They're millions.","David Rose - Wedbush Securities","We don't have a number? Okay. So we'll expect that to ramp up?","Randy Hogan","Yes.","David Rose - Wedbush Securities","When we look at the Residential Filtration market and break it down between point-of-use and point-of-entry, I'm trying to better understand the dynamics. From what I understand, you've got a lot of growth in the point-of-use mostly from the emerging markets. You've identified a weak U.S. and European residential market that's point-of-entry. With that said, what do we expect for the Hybrid DI given that macro?","Randy Hogan","It's like the Hybrid DI is going to have high margins and it's going to enter at the high end. And ultimately as we get changed in some places where you'll need to put them in, it will have a ramp, as I said before on another call, it's not going to have iPad kind of a ramp. But it's going to have a very profound impact over time on how people solve treatment problems, particularly in areas where discharges is an issue, which basically means anyplace that's arid and have water shortage problems.","John Stauch","Just to give you numbers, think of point-of-entry which is the valves and tanks and water softeners as being about 60% of the business and the other 40% in what we call point-of-use. And the rest of the world solved their drinking water issue at the point-of-use and the one particular area they're going to drink from because of the cost and also footprint issues.","And so that part of the market and the technology there is doing exceptionally well. I still think we feel that the rest of the business will recover. There is a need for it. It's 10% to 15% penetrated in North American market. It's right now struggling to get financing and that's challenging both the price point and the penetration rate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert Baird.","Mike Halloran - Robert Baird","Could you just talk a little bit about the water margin side of things? Sequentially comparable revenue and water for Q1, but down margins, but then as we work through the year here, obviously a nice sharp recovery and expect some year-over-year growth. Is it really just the seasonality component particularly related to the CPT business and a little bit of the resi softness? Could you bucket those out a little bit?","Randy Hogan","I would say it's 80% of the CPT margin headwind and the rest, which is a little bit of the Western Europe headwind, will make pretty good margins. That's it. I don't want to overcomplicate it. We're anniversarying and putting CPT for the first time in the first half of the year. It's not going to make majority of their income. And as we mentioned, we'll be improving that as we go forward. But it's going to have a margin headwind hopefully one last time in Q1 and early Q2.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","Just on the goodwill impairment, could you tell us the sales size of the business that this affected?","Randy Hogan","Yes, about mid-400.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","And if I may, John, you're not thinking this way at all on CPT. But clearly, you saw a couple of things in the quarter that you didn't like. How do we avoid this on CPT three, four years from now?","John Stauch","Well, I think we're looking at two different things. We had a series of business we combined in the residential period where the residential housing market in North America was at two-point-some-million. So there was certain expectations and valuations of the things we put on the balance sheet that reflected that. I think where we're with CPT is obviously looking how into industrial process and some things that I think are a little bit more predictable as far as what their revenue contribution could be. I mean trying to say it's 20-20, but it's hard think back to 2 million housing starts going all the way down to mid-400s.","When we got to 2008 and we revalued and put the GE business in our fold, we had what we felt was a realistic view of the residential market, but it was significantly higher than where we are today. So we still feel that we're long-term going to hit the value of the business, but it's getting harder and harder and therefore why we took the charge to get the accounting of perspective to agree with our particular views of where residential is going to go.","So I think we're in good shape with CPT. Clearly, it's going to be about executing and all the things that we shared with you and internally to our strategic plan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stewart Scharf with S&P Capital.","Stewart Scharf - S&P Capital","Just wondering how are you planning to prioritize your cash use with debt-to-capital at 40%?","John Stauch","Well, our first goal has always been to support CapEx inside the business. The rest would be to support our strategic initiatives.","Stewart Scharf - S&P Capital","Regarding long-term growth guidance for revenues and EPS, you had 7% CAGR and 15% respectively. Does that still hold true through 2015?","John Stauch","We're looking at roughly 5% to 7%-ish this year. So I think every year, that's going to reflect the different type of economic outlook. But we still believe that we're sitting there with our growth outlook this year and we continue to draw our cash and the ability to augment that and the strategic initiatives that Randy mentioned.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions in the queue. I turn the call back over to the presenters.","Randy Hogan","All right, thank you very much.","Operator","Two hours after this call has ended, there is a replay available if you dial 855-859-2056 and enter the conference ID number to listen.

My name is a Zetania, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair 2019 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to your host Mr. Jim Lucas. Sir, you may begin your conference.","Jim Lucas","Thanks, Zetania and welcome to Pentair's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. And with me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Borin our Chief Financial Officer.","On today's call, we will provide details on our first quarter 2019 performance, as well as our second quarter and full year 2019 outlook as outlined in this morning's press release.","Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-Q, Form 10-K, and today's press release.

We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions.","I will now turn the call over to John.","John Stauch","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide number 4 titled Executive Summary. As we shared earlier this month, our first quarter of 2019 reflected cold wet weather in many parts of the country and this had an adverse impact on our first quarter sales of our high margin pool and specialty ag spray businesses. This weather pattern combined with distribution inventory that was created to avoid our heavier than usual price increases related to 2018 tariff impacts created a significant impact to the bottom line.","The slower pull-through of demand in Q1 related to weather and pool, means that we expect inventory will now be worked out of the channel in Q2 and Q3, causing the further reduction to our full year guidance.","While these two events created unique impact on the business, we feel that this situation is isolated to 2019 and our overall thesis for our pool business remains healthy and intact. On a more positive note, we completed two strategic acquisitions during the first quarter that further our strategic initiative to accelerate residential and commercial water treatment. Both acquisitions are performing well and the integrations are on track.","I will now turn the call over to Mark, who'll provide more detail on Q1, Q2 and the full year forecast. Mark?","Mark Borin","Thank you, John. Please turn to slide 5, labeled Q1 2019 Pentair Performance. For the first quarter we saw core sales declined 4%. Segment income fall 16% and adjusted EPS is down 12%. We'll provide more color on the individual segment performance shortly.","Below the line we saw an adjusted tax rate of 18%, net interest other expense of $8.5 million, and our average shares in the quarter were 172.5 million. Net interest other expense was a bit higher than planned due to the two acquisitions closing earlier than expected.","Please turn to slide 6, labeled Q1 2019 Pentair Segment Performance. This slide lays out the first quarter performance of our three segments. Following robust growth in 2018, which we believe was somewhat elevated as distributors bought inventory ahead of price increases as we commented on our fourth quarter call, first quarter core sales in Aquatics declined 6%. Segment income in Aquatics declined 13% as the produced top line led to under-absorption in the quarter.","Core sales declined 6% in Filtration Solutions, but segment income was flat due primarily to positive mix. Within the core residential and commercial business, we saw two areas of softness that we believe are short-term in nature. First, we experienced lower component sales as Aquion is now represented as intercompany sales and is no longer reflected as external sales.","Second, Europe saw ongoing weakness but the comps are easing. While this had an impact on our first quarter sales mostly due to timing, we continue to see positive growth prospects for the key residential and commercial piece of Filtration. We note that the food and beverage and industrial businesses were on plan for the quarter.","Flow Technologies reported flat core sales but that does not capture the story of the 22% segment income decline. While price helped the residential piece of Flow, we saw our specialty business, which is exposed to agriculture crop spray faced significant top line pressure.","Specialty is one of the most profitable product lines within Flow and the sales in this contributed to the income decline in the quarter. We are rightsizing the cost structure of specialty to the adjusted demand levels now expected for 2019.","Please turn to slide 7, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Our first quarter saw cash flow usage in line with seasonal trends as we tend to build working capital in advance of the important residential selling season primarily in our Aquatics segment.","In addition, we closed on two strategic acquisitions during the quarter and saw our debt level increase as a result. While our debt level increased from the end of 2018, we expect cash flow to turn positive in the second quarter and we anticipate debt levels coming down as cash flow improves throughout the year. While we did not repurchase any shares during the first quarter, we remain committed to buying $150 million in 2019.","Please turn to slide 8, labeled Q2 2019 Pentair Outlook. We anticipate second quarter core sales to be flat to up 1%. We expect Aquatic Systems to be flat to down 1%, Filtration Solutions to be flat to down 2% and Flow Technologies to grow 2% to 4%.","We anticipate segment income to be down approximately 5% to 7% as some of our more profitable businesses continue to see short-term top line pressure. We expect adjusted EPS to be in a range of $0.63 to $0.66 per share.","Below the line we expect corporate expense to be approximately $14 million to $16 million. We expect our second quarter tax rate to be 22% as we anticipate a true-up during the quarter. We also expect net interest other expense of roughly $11 million and shares to be approximately 171 million.","Please turn to slide 9, labeled Full Year 2019 Pentair Outlook. Slide 9 looks at the different components of our updated 2019 outlook. For the full year, we expect core sales to be flat to up 1%. We continue to expect price of roughly 3% for the full year. We expect total sales growth of roughly 1% to 2% with roughly 3% contribution from the recently announced acquisitions offset by a 2% headwind from FX. We anticipate segment income to be flat to up 2%. Our full year adjusted EPS range is $2.30 to $2.35 per share.","Other items embedded in our guidance include corporate expense of $60 million to $65 million, a tax rate of 20.5%, net interest other expense of $38 million, and an average share count for the year of 171 million shares.","I would like to turn the call back to John.","John Stauch","Thank you, Mark. Please turn to slide number 10, labeled Full Year Guidance Update. Before I discuss our longer-term outlook, this slide is meant to be a helpful look at what has changed since we provided our initial 2019 guidance. While we do not like to use whether as a reason for sales miss, the reality is that cold wet weather had a pronounced impact on two of our businesses, pool and agriculture precision spray.","The main change from original forecast is our very profitable Aquatics business. In 2018 Aquatics delivered higher than average growth of 11%. We anticipated that some inventory was pulled ahead of the price increases, but it is worth talking about what was -- what has happened to the start of the year.","Wet and cold weather delayed pool construction activity in several key markets such as California, Texas, and Arizona. The inclement weather also impacted pool openings in other parts of the country primarily the Sunbelt. As a result, sell-through in our distribution channels was impacted and therefore inventories were not reduced at the levels we would have expected if the pattern would have been more consistent with historical trends when weather was not a factor.","Of importance is that we have not seen any significant changes in demand trends within the key Aquatics markets. Our dealers continue to report strong backlog and while weather created delays, we expect inventory levels in the channel to come down as activity resumes in the second and third quarters.","Within Flow Technologies, we saw our higher margin agricultural precision spray impacted as many parts of the country were under water to start the planting season. Given these delays and the limited number of months in the season, we are not anticipating a rebound in activity and are adjusting the cost structure of this business accordingly.","With Aquatics and the specialty business in Flow experiencing slower topline growth rates in 2019, this has led to reduced expectations for segment income and adjusted EPS growth. We do believe this is a short-term issue, but unfortunately, the weather-related delays were compounded by the higher inventory levels in the distribution channels.","Please turn to slide 11 titled Segment Positioning. We wanted to take a moment to speak to our three segments and why we believe we are well-positioned for the longer term. Aquatic Systems is a leading franchise where we believe long-term demand trends remain in place. We expect to continue to invest in dealer engagement and consumer pull. We have been expanding aftermarket products including in the faster-growing automation space.","We have built a strong business and while the growth rate in 2019 is not up to historical standards, we believe that averaging 2018 and 2019 is more reflective of the longer term growth rate of this attractive business.","As we mentioned earlier in the call, we strengthened our residential and commercial water treatment business with two strategic acquisitions. Aquion brought water treatment systems capabilities and an affiliated dealer network, while Pelican brought a water conditioning systems capability and an established e-commerce platform.","In 2019, we will experience some modest impact to the topline as former component sales to Aquion are recognized as inter-company sales. We continue to focus on digital marketing and engaging consumers to build our brand.","Flow Technologies continues to be a business where we are focusing on leveraging our core PIMS competencies and improving margins. While parts of the Flow portfolio have been impacted by inventory and weather issues, we are accelerating operations, sourcing, and structural changes to improve our overall cost structure to create a solid foundation for 2020.","Please turn to Slide 12 titled Long-Term Value Creation Goals. This is an updated version of a chart we have referenced in the past, but an important slide as it highlights our longer term goals. With last year's separation and our emergence as a pure play-focused residential and commercial water treatment company, we remain committed to delivering more consistent performance.","We continue to believe that we have a portfolio capable of delivering low to mid-single-digit core sales growth over this cycle. With a portfolio capable of delivering positive price coupled with the relentless focus on productivity, we expect segment income to grow mid to high single-digits. We generate strong free cash flow and have committed to repurchasing 150 million of our shares annually.","We believe that this should result in top-quartile EPS growth and disciplined capital allocation would add upside to a strong base performance. We recognize that consistency is the key to being recognized as a top-quartile performer and we remain committed to achieving these long-term goals.","I would now like to turn the call over to Zetania for Q&A after which I will have a few closing remarks. Zetania, please open the line for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","Hey guys, good morning.","John Stauch","Hey Steve.","Mark Borin","Good morning Steve.","Steve Tusa","So, just curious as to what really kind of changed from when you gave guidance in I guess late January or early February to today. I mean I missed it as well. But pool was very clear that they were not going to have the greatest first quarter on the planet and with the destocking impact, you guys actually had guidance like above what they said they were going to guide. I don't know what that is. That's either a disconnect -- there's a disconnect somewhere. What happened there? Why didn't you guys just come out in January and say hey first quarter was going to be -- is going to be weak given these dynamics?","John Stauch","I think it's a fair question and a good question Steve. I think the different dynamics are it's easy to sit here now and look backwards at what inventory is in the channel. But as we raised prices last year, primarily related to the tariffs, we knew there was a little bit of inventory in the channel being built. But that's all based upon what the expected sell-through is through our dealers into the markets that they serve.","And so we had anticipated that the inventory would be dealt with in Q1. But the significant drop in the sell-through produced more inventory in the channel and therefore it didn't make sense to continue to sell into the channel. And that was really what happened later in the quarter Steve.","Steve Tusa","No, I understand that. And I'm just saying like is there something in the FP&A function here that you guys aren't kind of picking up what the channel is saying? Because again like it was a public company telling you what the growth rate was going to be.","And if there was destocking in the first quarter, then you guys would have been below that growth rate instead of guiding to something like 4% to 6%. And then going around to conferences and kind of not really insinuating it all that things were weak over the course of the quarter. Because I think visibility here is a question that I'm getting from investors all the time. And I think there's just a bit of a confidence issue that people have that you guys aren't picking up the right PVs in the channel.","John Stauch","Yes. Again, I wish it was that easy Steve. I think we're looking at four days of inventory on hand and there's a lot of inputs in there. And I do want to remind everyone there's more than a distributor, right?","I mean the pool market and also part of this is distributors in Flow as well, it's not just all pool. And there's lots and lots of distributors and lots of estimates that go into a four days of inventory on hand. And I think we didn't know till late in the quarter that we were in the situation we were and as soon as we knew, we went out and told people and we dealt with it accordingly. And we're taking out the cost and we're taking all the actions we can to position ourselves the best we can for next year.","I don't want to damage a great business like pool and I think we're off doing all the right things to grow share and pull demand in that particular business. And I think it's demonstrated that success consistently over a series of years. And I do want to remind you that the tariff changes and the significant price increases was part of this issue as well and those don't happen often.","Steve Tusa","Sure. On Filtration, what was the -- why was that weak? Because I mean I think we were expecting some weaker sales in Flow given the flooding and all that kind of stuff which is completely legitimate issue. Everybody is kind of seeing the weather and the flooding out there that's definitely not specific to you guys. But Filtration was definitely weak. Can you maybe just talk a little bit more about what happened there? And you guys cut guidance there as well and revenue.","John Stauch","It definitely was slightly weaker than we expected Steve. I think weather impacted it as well primarily on the service and the installs. The timing of the acquisition was positive as far as the reported acquisition, but it also changed the way the intercompany sales moved from us to those two acquisitions because we sell to both of them. And then we did experience slightly weaker European demand which we have adjusted our full year guide to reflect.","Steve Tusa","That also would have been helpful to know that you're going to kind of like have a little bit less of an organic impact from these deals that could have been communicated better probably at the time of the deal just some feedback. That's about it. Thanks a lot.","John Stauch","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone.","John Stauch","Good morning, Nathan.","Nathan Jones","I'm going to follow-up on the pool business here. I understand it's seasonal. I would have thought that customers would have been making these decisions -- spending decisions on an annual basis. And if we had cold weather in the first quarter that might defer revenue out of the first quarter into the second quarter or third quarter. Can you guys talk maybe a little bit more about the dynamics there and why you're not just going to catch that the revenue up? I mean, I can understand why the spray business doesn't catch up. But I'm just a little confused on why that pool -- the pool revenue wouldn't just shift from one quarter to the other rather than disappear altogether?","John Stauch","Yeah. It does. I think clearly, if we didn't have the inventory situation in the channel that we have, part of the Q1 miss would be made up in likely Q2 and Q3, Nathan. I mean, there is limited labor. So people don't go out and necessarily hire more. They're going to slide job's a week or two, or so in the schedule. And so they tend to do as best they can to make them up in the season. What we're really reflecting in the outward quarters is the fact that we still have to deal with the inventory in the channel. So, I do think the dealers will make up the demand. I do think that, our channel partners will see that demand come through and it's more muted on us because of the inventory build that occurred from the Q1 sell-through.","Nathan Jones","So does that mean there was more inventory in the channel than you guys had predicted when you reported 4Q? I mean, you said you thought there was $30 million of pre-buy in 4Q 2018 ahead of the price increases. Did that end up being higher than you expected which is part of what contributes to this 2018 was higher than it should been and 2019 is lower than it should be?","John Stauch","Yes. I mean, what we anticipated to be about a point of headwind for overall Pentair is now a couple points of headwind. Now again, I'm reminding you that it's not just pool. There's a little bit in the Flow Technologies distribution channel as well related to the weather, but yeah as I was mentioning, we were looking as you looked at days of inventory on hand forward-looking in Q4 it felt like 30. Because of the lack of sell-through that happened in Q1 that number expanded and it's got to be dealt with in Q2.","Nathan Jones","Okay. I just want to follow-up on Steve's question about maybe looking inwardly at your own forecasting tools. Have you run a root cause analysis on this thing kind of looked at the FP&A processes to see if there's things that you guys can do to improve the predictability results here?","Mark Borin","Nathan, yeah, I mean, as you'd expect we have our PIMS toolkit and that doesn't just apply to how we run the operations it applies to how we run our back office functions as well. So we are using our root cause countermeasure tools to try to understand what are the things that we could had better visibility to and gotten more out in front of. But as John said, sometimes it's a little bit easier to do that when you're --when you've got hindsight information to look at. But that's the information that we need to think about and how do we put that more at the front end rather than seeing it at the back end. So absolutely, we're working on that and looking for improvements across the board.","Nathan Jones","Is there anything that you found that you could -- that you could share that could change -- could improve those kind of processes? Are you still in the -- are still in progress?","Mark Borin","That would be such an easy answer, if that was it. I mean, there's no way we could predict the Q1 weather patterns.","Nathan Jones","That\u2019s fair.","Mark Borin","I mean, California Arizona and Texas I mentioned are such significant markets to the pool business. And what happened there was so unusual as far as the wet cold weather and that stops production or stops pool builds for a period of time, because they can't move machines in. So, I don't know what we could do. I mean, we always run sensitivity analysis on our forward-looking analysis, but that's not one we would've predicted.","Nathan Jones","I should have qualified that question to be outside of weather effects and things that were -- would be obviously unpredictable?","John Stauch","The answer is no. Because I mean, we found out afterwards as we shared in our Q4 call that we felt there was inventory in the channel and that inventory would have normally burned off in Q1. The specialty ag business was also uniquely impacted and that all happened throughout the process in Q1 as well. So those two things led to the Q1 challenges and we've not sensed -- we\u2019ve not put in a forecast of the recovery in pool and we've not put any recovery of the specialty ag in the outlook. And then we've adjusted demand to be what we think are on the lower ends of our forecast models and then we're working the cost actions to go build the foundation for 2020. And that's the only way I could think of reacting to the situation.","Nathan Jones","Okay. Fair enough. I'll pass it on. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joe Giordano","Hey, guys. Good morning.","John Stauch","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Giordano","So, I don't want to keep asking the same question, but one thing that's confusing to me a little bit. I -- I heading into the quarter when you had your look at inventory and pool I totally understand that that changes because of weather on a day's basis, because the demand side of it changes. But like on a gross level of inventory that number is a fixed number. And so if we're saying that this is largely going to like shift quarters on the revenue side that's where I don't get why the overhang doesn't like kind of fix itself sooner. Because yes we could change like what we thought was 40 days is really 50 or something like that, because the denominator changes but the top -- the actual amount of inventory was a fixed number of units. So that's kind of where I struggle with. I don't understand that.","John Stauch","That's fair. I mean, I think the one thing I'll remind you is that, if it was just a product sale it was not dependent on labor required to install it. I do think you'd see a quicker recovery. But the labor is not excessive, right? I mean, it's not going to like you're going to go out and add more labor to build more pools in the short-term. So it will come through the channel clearly and we do think that that will spread itself over Q2 and Q3. But the Q1 hit to us is going to be reflected as an inventory reduction in Q2 and Q3. It won't affect the channel that same way.","Joe Giordano","How much is that -- like is that actual construction element weighing down? Because I always -- we talk about this business being like that's not really a big piece of it at all. So I'm just curious as to how that-- ","John Stauch","Well, every dealer is out there either installing a new pool or they're also out there doing the aftermarket aspects or scheduling the aftermarket pool product install. So they're -- they generally are the same people and they're going to do their best to get those pools in place. And so there will be a delay on both ends the aftermarket and the new pools.","Joe Giordano","Okay. And then on the forward guide for that business so 2Q implies like more of a seasonal sequential ramp than normal, which I guess maybe some of that is a snap -- a little bit of a shift in that demand. But the second half guide is essentially flat year-on-year versus last year and we keep talking about how much pull-forward there was and that was a plus 12 comp. So, how comfortable are you with the back half being flat year-on-year? And what kind of visibility do you have into that?","Mark Borin","Yeah, Q2 and Q3 as we talk will be impacted by the inventory coming down and then Q4 we expect kind of as you look at it sequentially, it will pick-up and get better and we'll see some of that recovery coming through. And we -- when we look at it for the full year we're confident that the full year expectation is appropriate. And as John said, we factored in everything that we know today as we look at the out quarters.","Joe Giordano","Okay. And then, if I could just shift quick to last one on Filtration just to follow a bit on what Steve asked initially, to me that was like the biggest surprise was the magnitude of the miss there. It's not pool. It's not Flow. And it was a pretty sizable miss versus the initial guide. So the -- your comment on lower component sales like not being intercompany makes sense, but that -- those I assume were kind of factored in, because you announced those deals before you gave the initial guide. So, can you maybe talk through what -- some of a little bit more detail there?","Mark Borin","Yes. Let me just frame that. I mean, the intercompany sales are roughly about a point overall total Filtration Solutions for the year, okay? Which will give you an impact on kind of what it is per quarter.","Keep in mind we did not have the acquisition as a contribution in Q1. We had it closing after Q1. So these two things you're seeing the benefit of the acquisitions. But we had not forecasted in the quarter the impact of the intercompany sales.","But the real impact that we saw was a little bit slowing in Q1 where the weather impact us. We do expect to catch that up in Q2. And then the European trends are not where we'd want them to be. And that's really the reflection that we added to the full year forecast. I don't think we know that. I think we're anticipating it and we're planning for it.","Joe Giordano","Good. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird.","Mike Halloran","Hey, good morning guys.","John Stauch","Hey, Mike. Good morning.","Mike Halloran","So question on the margins on the Flow side. So talk a little bit about the inefficiencies in the mix side please? And then also when do you think that can normalize back to what your previous run rate suggestions were? And how long does some of these headwinds render?","Mark Borin","Yes. Sure. The biggest contributor to the margins in Flow is the mix impact from the decline on the specialty ag spray business at a higher profit component of that overall portfolio. So that's the -- is the biggest driver.","And then the other driver is just the timing in how price works its way in throughout the year as all their price actions take hold. We had talked last quarter about the couple of factories. Those are stabilizing and we see those not having a negative impact to margins during the year and improving as we get through the balance of the year.","Mike Halloran","Sounds good. And then when we think about the second half of the year here, just explain what's changed now versus your previous guidance. Obviously, so, on the Aquatic side the assumptions on the top line have come in a little bit. Obviously, we're adjusting a little bit through some of the costs on the Filtration side that are no longer external sales. Anything else you would point to that's changed in the back half of the year versus the previous guidance?","Mark Borin","Sure. I mean, I think the -- overall when you think about it, not a lot has changed. So that's how I characterize kind of the headline. We talked before about just the timing of inventory and how that works off. But -- and then specialty that the business that we referenced right the softness there. We have not projected that that is going to improve as we work through the balance of the year. And so those are probably the two biggest factors when we think about what's different, but overall really the back half of the year is not significantly different than what we had previously been thinking.","We have also not assumed like any benefit from tariff relief in this outlook. So that's consistent with the previous outlook. And we've also most of the operations and sourcing and the targeted actions this year are not expected to have 2019 benefits. But they generally are expected to offer contributions in 2020. Meaning, we're driving the activities this year and assuming it's going to take a longer-term to -- longer time to realize it, and therefore are really driving them as a 2020 foundational benefit.","Mike Halloran","So in other words, if you hit your plan, your expectation is that the run rate exiting 2019 is slightly lower than what you were originally expecting, but not meaningfully lower like the front half trajectory would imply?","Mark Borin","Yes. That's correct.","Mike Halloran","Good. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Mark Borin","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","John Stauch","Hey, Deane.","Mark Borin","Good morning Deane.","Deane Dray","I might have missed this, but are you able to separate and quantify the impact of weather this quarter from the inventory dynamics?","Mark Borin","We didn't specifically quantify it earlier Deane. But think of it as $30 million to $40 million. So if you think about the majority of the Q1 impact is really driven by weather, which as John said delays the bleed off of that excess inventory that then happens in Q2 and Q3.","Deane Dray","Got it. I just wanted to make sure that part had been quantified. And then just is there any ripple effect on pricing? I know you called out the 3% pricing assumption. But with an incentive to work inventory down, is there going to be any compromise on pricing? And what might the dynamics be there?","Mark Borin","No. No. The overall pricing profile stays the same as you referenced, we talked about 3% for the year, and so nothing changing from a price perspective.","Deane Dray","Got it. And just last one for me is, it's more of a business model question and maybe it's just an observation. But as Pentair has refocused the portfolio to a water pure play, you've lost that benefit of earnings diversification that you had when nVent was part of the company. So now we're -- we see this vulnerability to weather that really maybe just as magnified versus what the company structure was before. Is this variability or vulnerability just something that comes with the more focused portfolio? And has that been part of the framework that you're looking at for the company Pentair as it is today?","John Stauch","Deane, I think it's a great observation. The answer is -- to the first question is, yes. I mean, that is definitely exposed more vulnerability on weather impacts. Now what we got to do is build more diversification into our portfolio to account for that. I mean, we did see spots of that. I mean, we did have a good China quarter. I think things in China have improved. We had that little bit of softness in Europe. Normally that wouldn't have happened. But I think the diversification of portfolio is something we will focus on and ensure that we do not subject ourselves to these types of weather patterns and the variability that they can cause.","Deane Dray","Got it. Thank you.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets.","Scott Graham","Hi. Good morning.","John Stauch","Good morning.","Mark Borin","Good morning.","Scott Graham","So kind of a follow-on to that question. Would it be fair to say that even though Aquatics is really the flagship, the best business, the highest margin and all of that that the business will be built more going forward through organic means aftermarket, consumables that kind of thing and then your acquisitions would be more focused on the other two segments?","John Stauch","Yes. I mean, I think, the pool business is well-positioned, and I think we have a lot of organic growth runway remaining. And I think we continue to innovate there from a new product perspective, and we continue to have good intimacy with our channels and our consumers and understand what they have. So I think that's going to be more of our organic strategy as we go forward.","As evidenced by the two acquisitions that we just did, our goals in Filtration Solutions is to build out a closer-to-customer model and also make sure that we're doing our part to drive demand in the channel.","The overall penetration rate of Filtration systems in homes is relatively low. And, although, it's better in the commercial office space and\/or commercial restaurant space, it's still not where we think it should be or can be. And so, most of our acquisition activity will be focused about, how do we drive that demand and how do we get closer to the customer to drive that demand in Filtration.","Scott Graham","Good. Thank you for that, John. That helps. My follow-up is, really, not to beat the horse even deader here, but would you be able to maybe answer this question, because you indicated that there doesn't seem to be a much of a change in demand on the pool side. I'm not quite sure what you meant by that. And maybe, the question specifically would be, what was sell-through by your dealers in the quarter?","Mark Borin","Yes. When we see -- when we talk to our dealers and we hear from our -- from the builders and understand, sort of, what's going on out in the market, backlogs remain high, business remains solid. So when we talk about we're not hearing anything from an underlying perspective that the market is slowing, it's based on those discussions and that insight.","And that's really what -- kind of, what informs the way we're thinking about that. I mean, sell-through, from the information that we have access to, remains strong. I think, we'd expect an impact in Q1 from weather, but as we said that starts to turn around and as we move into the heavy season here in Q2 and Q3. So, again, underlying trends in demand, we're not seeing anything that would indicate softness there.","Scott Graham","So your -- from what, I think, I'm gleaning from this is that, your distribution channel is kind of normalizing right now?","John Stauch","I mean, I can't speak to that. But I can tell you, what Mark is saying is, the sell-through is accelerating, right? The March sell-through was definitely towards the end high from the dealer channel and then we also know the dealer channel is going to make up.","As we mentioned, most of that whether loss in Q1, they're going to do their best to make that up in Q2. Why that's muted to Pentair is, because there is that inventory in the channel that needs to be worked out before we're going to see the benefit of that recovery of the channel shift.","Scott Graham","That makes sense. Thank you.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.","John Stauch","Hi, Josh Pokrzywinski.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hey, good morning, guys. ","John Stauch","Good morning, Josh","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just a follow-up, just a finer point on pool that I think Mark raised earlier, I want to not miss it in passing that, the business should normalize by the fourth quarter. I guess, just given everything we've seen from tariff pre-buy and even your callouts about the inventory position exiting the year.","I guess, mathematically looking at guidance, you do have to pick up the growth rate by the fourth quarter. Is that explicitly something that you're calling for? And, I guess, why not take a more conservative track, just given some of the surprises this quarter?","John Stauch","I think, we have, Josh. I mean, I think, if -- when we take a look at what our new estimates are in that sell-through demand throughout the year, we are assuming taking inventory down to at or below normalized historic levels, right? It is still a growing market and is still a growing industry.","And so, you'd expect inventory to actually be accelerating through this period. I think, what we wanted to do is, make sure we forecast it on the downward end. And I know it looks like Q4 is out of the norm, but we would expect our normalized patterns to continue and Q4 is usually a pretty good quarter for Pentair.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. And then, I guess, just following up a little bit on Deane's question on pricing. Looking holistically at price-cost productivity, I know you kind of think about that, those three different legs of the stool. I would imagine there was some drag there from all the disruption this quarter.","But thinking about that total bucket the rest of the year, how should we think about that gap closing, improving or getting worse? I would imagine something happens in the world as it pertains to rebates or pricing power, given volume. But just thinking about it holistically, should that get better or worse from here?","Mark Borin","Yes, you hit on it. It does get better as we move through the year, which is in line with sort of how we expected it to move. Just, with the timing of when price is impacted with rebates and other things. But, as we said on our earlier guidance, we continue to believe that effectively price and inflation will offset each other. So we continue to view that as the overall way to look at the guidance and that's a full year statement, so we see that and we sort of see that starting to turn as you get into Q2, Q3 and Q4.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. And if I can just sneak one more here, more of a question, philosophically, on how you guys get impacted from a weather perspective. If I think back to 1Q of 2018, I think, some other folks in the broader construction ecosystem called out weather then in January. Was there anything in the comp that would have said, 1Q of last year wasn't particularly smooth sailing on the weather front?","John Stauch","No, Josh. Last year's Q1 actually was one of our stronger organic growth quarters of the year. I think we benefited from some of the tax changes that occurred and demand was strong out of the gate. So I'd say, we don't think that weather had a significant impact on Q1 of 2018 at all.","And usually if it happens earlier in the quarter, it's not as big of a deal, because those things can get made up. I mean, really, what we're talking about is the end of January and February was six significant weeks in a row of a consistent pattern in the states where it matters to us.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. All right. Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Brad Vanino","Hey, good morning. This is Brad on for Jeff. Just to clarify something. In the first quarter, it seems like cash flows is particularly weak. I understand some of the abnormalities going on there. But just, on a full year basis, what's your confidence on hitting the target?","Mark Borin","Yes, I mean, Q1 cash flow, as you referenced, is traditionally our weakest quarter. As a reminder, Q1 of last year was when we were going through this separation. So we were -- there's noise in 2018 and sort of the visibility to what a run rate level of Q1 cash flow for this separate water business would look like.","So this, I think, is the -- in many respects, sort of, the new view of what Q1 looks like and we'll start to turn that in Q2 and go -- and to turn positive in Q2 and then continue that through the balance of the year. So, remain confident in our ability as we target cash flow to equal adjusted net income.","Brad Vanino","Okay. That makes sense. And then, just on the strategic initiatives and investments you have going on. You talked about on the last call, some flexibility to kind of throttle those back, should demand kind of weaken a little bit. Just given what happened in the first quarter, have your strategic investments changed and plans for those for this year? And kind of -- does that have any kind of trickle-down impact over the longer term?","John Stauch","No. I think we're focused on still building out a portfolio that we think has a lot of runway around organic growth. Couple of small additions that we're looking to do again on the tuck-in side, on the residential and commercial Filtration side to continue to build out our portfolio. And then from an organic standpoint, continuing to make the consumer aware of what Pentair can bring to the table. And then how we bring that through our channel partners, and how we give the consumer what they want. That's where the strategic investments are and we're going to continue to invest in high-priority areas throughout 2019.","Brad Vanino","All right. Thanks for the color.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.","Rebecca Yuan","Hi, guys. This is Rebecca Yuan on for Brian. Thanks for taking the question. So aside from the weaker demand in Europe that you've pointed out, have you seen any slowdown in your end markets? And can you maybe speak to the growth trends you're seeing or any broader macro comments?","John Stauch","No, we haven't. I mean, we did as evidenced by our particular outlooks for the year adjusted to what we've called the lower end of the ranges for some of our revenue forecasts that we could get ahead of the cost curve and work on the foundational aspects. But as I mentioned, I think we're starting to see a stronger China as we move forward here in 2019 and we think we got maybe one more quarter of headwinds in Europe. Some of the slowdown started in Q3 and Q4 last year for us in our particular markets. And overall, we think that our end markets continue to be solid and I think our position in those end markets is solid.","Rebecca Yuan","Okay. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up for some of long-term goals that you highlighted, can you maybe give us an idea of the time frames whether it's like three years or five years?","John Stauch","Well we'll continue to move rapidly to build out the portfolio in those strategic growth areas. I mean, yes, this is a three to five-year vision and we want to move aggressively and fast as we can to achieve that vision. But it's a combination of organic growth efforts that we're doing with marketing and sales and new product development organically as well as a series of tuck-in acquisitions that we would do over time. Can never time those and obviously we continue to try to grow the funnel, but executing them is not always within our control.","Rebecca Yuan","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global.","Walter Liptak","Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask a capital allocation question. The share repurchase, it looks like there was no share repurchase done in the first quarter and with the shares that you guys talked about, it looks like 80 million in the second, have you started on the share repurchase yet this quarter?","Mark Borin","We can't really comment on the timing of when we're in the market doing share repurchases. But as I said in my comments, we're committed to the 150 million for this year and would expect to execute that in the -- from now to the balance of the year. And you're correct, we did not do any purchases in the first quarter. And generally, that's because as we talked about cash flow, we utilize cash in the first quarter and so we think it's most prudent to manage the planned buybacks in Q2 three and four.","Walter Liptak","Okay. And with the share repurchase, can you be opportunistic with it? Could you do a bigger amount in the first -- in the second quarter? Or do you have to spread it through the rest of the year?","John Stauch","Short answer is, yes.","Walter Liptak","Okay. All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning. Maybe just a question on something below the top line for a change. You talked on slide 13 about optimizing the cost structure in the operational footprint and it was notable that your SG&A to sales rose quite a bit year-on-year in Q1. Is there any way that you could quantify the scale of the savings program, when we're thinking about the sort of base number for 2020? And then also looking at the sort of operating profit in Q1, the GAAP profit was about 30% lower than the adjusted segment profit. It looks like there was an asset impairment charge in there. So maybe just give us some background on that charge?","John Stauch","Sure. I'll handle the first one and I'll let Mark handle the second. I think when we talked about going forward what our actions are I mean, the first and foremost I think making sure that our sourcing activities are connected to our business units and quite frankly, the product lines is the number one priority. Because we have to have the anticipation of what's happening in the commodities that we're buying and be able to make the determination of either cost out on the sourcing side or value-added -- value engineering on the cost side or be able to price appropriately and give our distributor partners enough heads-up that those pricings would come.","The second one is the operational footprint. Some of our businesses have way more capacity than they need and that capacity might not be in the right regions. And so getting after the operational footprint is the second largest priority. The third one on the operating structure is making sure that we're adjusting our cost investments to the priorities of the company and not what we feel is the priorities of the individual product lines of the businesses. And that is a huge opportunity for us.","And as Mark mentioned, we're going to right-size the areas that are affected by what we call more cyclical trends where they're not going to recover any time shortly. That's really the cost efforts. I don't want to quantify it yet, because they're fairly sizable targets internally that we expect to go after and get as a foundation for 2020. And at the appropriate time, we'll share what those benefits are. Mark you want to handle the second part?","Mark Borin","Sure. The asset impairment items think of those as relating to the optimization and some of the actions and activities that we talked about in 2018. Part of that was exiting certain businesses. In this case, these are a couple of cost-based investment businesses. So they're not businesses that are part of what we're running as Pentair, but small investments. And we wrote those down in Q1 based on an updated view of what we would be able to sell those assets for. But it's -- so it's not something new. It's really just the continuation of some of that work that we talked about last year. And as we finalize that and get those things behind us that was an adjustment that we had to record.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks for the color. And just my follow-up would be around the top line in Flow Technologies. The core sales were sort of flattish in Q1 guided to grow 2% to 4% in Q2. It sounds like ag is still going to be weak. So maybe just talk a little bit about, how much of a reacceleration in the resi parts of Flow you expect? And what types of products were really affected by the excess channel inventories in Flow?","Mark Borin","Sure. So maybe a couple of things. So in Flow, there's really three parts to that business the residential, and irrigation, and commercial, and infrastructure and the specialty business. So as you said specialty is -- pulls numbers down. But then we do expect to see the residential irrigation and commercial infrastructure parts of the business start to pick up as we move through the balance of the year. Some of that comes from price. So we -- a lot of the price impact that we're projecting for the year is coming from the Flow business and particularly in the residential side and then that starts to readout as we move into Q2, Q3 and Q4. And so those are the -- those would be the biggest drivers there. The residential irrigation business would have been impacted in Q1, somewhat by the channel inventory and weather and that starts to correct itself as we get into Q2, Q3 and Q4.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you, very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair.","Brian Drab","Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a point of clarification. I'm not sure that it was clear, what exactly was the weather impact on the Filtration business? And which markets were you seeing that in the months?","John Stauch","It's just as you think about the installs of water treatment and water conditioning systems, they were affected by some of the weather patterns and those are like days, right? So we pushed -- we didn't get to do it in a day. So they pushed out their installs weeks or so. And that's why we feel that that all will be recovered in Q2.","Brian Drab","Okay. So it just made it harder, even though these are -- and this is all primarily inside jobs, right, I mean you're installing food and beverage Filtration system, you're installing something -- it's in a factory, it's in a facility? You're just saying that the weather in general just kind of dampened -- sorry about the pun which kind of dampened that activity. Is that what you're saying?","John Stauch","Yes, it was minor in Filtration. But yes.","Brian Drab","Okay. Okay. And then can you quantify at all what growth or decline overall you reported in Europe and in China for the first quarter?","John Stauch","Yes. I mean China had a recovery and was up double digit. And in Europe, we're talking about modestly down.","Brian Drab","Okay. You broke up a little bit on my end on China. You said it was -- what you said in China?","John Stauch","Double digits and then we were modestly down in Europe.","Brian Drab","Got it, okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","Hey guys, good morning.","John Stauch","Good morning.","Andrew Obin","Just a simple math question. So if I look at the guidance on Aquatic Systems before for the year and where you end that up, it seems there is eight percentage points difference, which is, I think for the year is a little bit over $80 million. And if I look at the delta for first quarter versus what you were guiding or versus what you reported, so it seems $30 million. So if I think that $30 million is a combination of a little bit too much inventory and weather that sort of implies that non-weather-related stuff is $60 million for the remainder of the year. Is that how I should think about it?","JohnStauch","On the outer end, yes, you got it right meaning the inventory did not get worked down in Q1 as we've said. And that inventory will be worked down in Q2 and Q3. And so yes, you got it right. So the weather impact for us, you've got it quantified correctly. The rest of it is the inventory burn that we're expecting in Q2 to Q3 and using the outer end or the lower end of the projections as you do that math. So yes, you got it right.","Andrew Obin","And I'm just struggling with the concept. So you said if you can't do pools in Q1, so you can hire people to dig pools in Q2 and Q3. Because it seems that you say there are labor constraints. And I'm just struggling to understand the concept I apologize?","John Stauch","Yes. So again, we're talking about a couple of things. Certainly, they will do their best to work as fast as possible to build those pools in Q2 and Q3. But as I've said, we're not going to benefit from that because we have to work our inventory down through our distributors and dealer channels. And so that will recover in the industry, but because Q1 demand was so soft and the inventory did not get reduced in Q1, we are planning on reducing our inventory in Q2 and Q3 as all of that activities that you mentioned gets happening in the outer end of the market.","Andrew Obin","Got you. Thank you so much for taking my call.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Damian Karas with UBS.","Damian Karas","Hi, good morning everyone. So a follow-up on Aquatics, you highlighted some of the areas of U.S. that were most impacted by the colder weather and the inventory destocking. Just thinking about your expectations for the further destocking over the next one to two quarters here and then what ensues. Could you give us a sense on whether you're really expecting a similar level of activity across all these regions? Or could there be some dispersion or any unique regional circumstances that you're perhaps factoring in?","John Stauch","We're not factoring any unique dispersion or circumstances. What we're doing is trying to get below this and get to the bottom of the range. And so, we're assuming that the inventory gets worked out. Obviously, it's not perfect. The inventory is not ideal or perfectly balanced by region or all those other things. But we feel like we need to work to get this inventory out of the channel. We have a great business. It's a business that has performed historically at the upper single-digit growth range and we believe it's going to perform again to mid to upper single-digit growth range.","And so what we want to do is get it right-sized from the inventory perspective, work on the demand pull to the consumer, our new product development and all our great marketing and sales activities and make this business the right business -- the great business it used to be in 2020 and beyond. That's what we're doing.","Damian Karas","Okay, sounds good, makes sense. And just on CapEx. So you've guided that $10 million higher. Just wonder, if you can give any additional color on what led you to up the budget there and just any color on where you're planning to spend this?","John Stauch","Yes I think we've gone out and made sure that our businesses understand that capital was important factor in driving productivity. It doesn't matter if it's not on -- it's on the software or the front-end, marketing and sales-related activities, as well as automation in the factories and capital investment in the factories to drive productivity. So just a philosophy of Mark and myself that we need to use capital to help drive productivity and we wanted to make sure that the businesses have the capital they need to do that.","Damian Karas","Got it.

My name is Keith and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","James Lucas","","Thanks, Keith, and welcome to Pentair's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer.

We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. (Operator Instructions)","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randall Hogan","","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with our third quarter performance, which is on Slide four. We are very pleased with third quarter performance as revenue met our forecast and we delivered strong margin expansion and EPS growth once again. Sales grew 3% during the quarter with Technical Solutions leading the way with 8% growth. Our operating income grew 12% and operating margins expanded 130 basis points to 15.2%. EPS grew 22% and exceeded the high end of our guidance for the quarter. Free cash flow continued to be strong and was greater than 120% of net income in Q3. We remain on track to generate free cash flow greater than 110% for the full year.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide five for a more detailed look at the third quarter results. After a slow start to the year, the 3% sales growth was an encouraging continuation of the top-line acceleration experienced in the second quarter. Volume grew 2% and we delivered a positive point of price in the third quarter. Foreign exchange was neutral, but we are closely watching the strengthening of the dollar against many currencies and are anticipating FX headwinds to pick up in the fourth quarter.","We will discuss the geographical and vertical performance of the company in more detail shortly, but it was particularly encouraging to see all five vertical markets grow in the quarter. The right half of the page shows third quarter Pentair operating profits and margins. Our adjusted operating income increase of 12% and adjusted operating margin expansion of 130 basis points to 15.2% were driven by growth leverage and strong productivity and synergies. Inflation remained consistent with the first half and price and productivity continued to more than offset inflation. We continue to make great progress with our lean and sourcing initiatives, particularly in our 16 focus factories.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide six for a review of our largest segment, Valves & Controls. In the third quarter, Valves & Controls had flat sales with price mostly offsetting slightly weaker volume. Orders were flat in the quarter and backlog was down 3%, excluding FX, to $1.3 billion. During the quarter Oil & Gas grew 3% and process sales saw a 5% growth, while the smaller Power and Mining sales declined. We continue to see quarter-to-quarter volatility in Power, but the Mining weakness is expected to continue.","The right half of the page shows third quarter Valves & Controls operating profits and margins. We were very pleased with the operating performance of Valves & Controls in the third quarter, with adjusted operating margins expanding 260 basis points to 15.7%, even including $4 million in cost for the segment Operating Model Transformation, or OMT. As a reminder, we expect the OMT investments in Valves & Controls to continue on an annual basis through 2016, with that investment expected to drive nearly $80 million of annual operating income savings, once completed, and overall tax benefits to Pentair of roughly three points through the optimization of the global Valves & Controls structure.","We continue to see strong adoption of PIMS and momentum in Lean is accelerating as seen by continuing improvements in on-time deliveries in Valves & Controls","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide seven for a look at the orders and backlogs GBU. As you can see on Slide seven, Valves & Controls backlog is broken down in four key industries, three of which fall into our energy vertical, Oil & Gas, Power & Mining and one in our industrial vertical, which is the Process business. Overall backlog at the end of the quarter down 3% including FX to $1.3 billion. Energy remained mix in Valves & Controls with Oil & Gas delivering strong order growth while Power declined and Mining was weak. This is the second consecutive quarter of orders growth for Oil & Gas and quoting remains healthy. In particular, we continue to see strength in North American LNG. With a sharp decline in oil prices the past month, we are monitoring quoting activity closely.","Overall Power orders were down in the quarter. We did see some large Power orders finally break in India and China during the quarter, while Europe remained soft. Mining continued to be in a secular decline. And while we\u2019re seeing maintenance orders comes through in Mining, the overall outlook for this smallest piece of Valves & Controls remains guarded.","We saw the biggest backlog declines in Process and Power. Although Power is expected to remain volatile quarter-to-quarter, we expect improvements in Process in 2015 as we continue to see positive signs with an acceleration in North American orders based upon strong quoting activity.","Now let\u2019s move to Slide eight for another view of Valves & Controls orders. Obviously, the fluctuations around orders and backlog are disquieting. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building more rigor in our forecasting of Valves & Controls orders and sales. This chart is an example of one way we\u2019re looking at the business. The left side shows the quarterly volatility we\u2019ve seen in Valves & Controls orders. So to see clearer trends, we look at running averages. You can see on a trailing six-month basis, orders are showing that a positive trend may be emerging. On a trailing 12-month basis, that potential trend is further evident. It's likely that quarter-to-quarter volatility will continue with this business given project timing and customer needs, but our improved forecasting models are showing improvement in both the trailing six and trailing 12-month orders for both industrial process and oil and gas. Given these two industries comprise nearly 75% of Valves & Controls business, we remain cautiously optimistic for the GBU.","Now let\u2019s move to Slide nine for a look at our Process Technologies segment. Process Technologies reported solid top line growth of 4%, with volumes contributing 3% and a positive 1% from price. Residential & Commercial remained strong with 7% growth, Food & Beverage grew 5% and Infrastructure was up 2%. Our beverage business experienced some customer delays in spending, but these projects or delays are not cancellations. Our food service business delivered another strong quarter of double digit growth, which was broad based globally.","The right half of the page shows second quarter Process Technologies operating profits and margins. We are disappointed with the operating margins of Process Technology during the quarter. Mix was a primary factor in the income and margin declines as we saw more growth from our lower margin project businesses within Process Technologies and our pool business began managing its early buy program more closely. In our Residential Filtration business, we have seen a shift to more point-of-entry than point-of-use solutions, which also had a detrimental effect on margins.","While mix will be important to improving margins, we continue to have a lot of opportunities to drive productivity within the businesses and so this is an area of focus for Process Technologies.","Now let\u2019s move to Slide 10 for a look at Flow Technologies. Flow Tech reported a 2% revenue decline as a point of positive price contribution was not enough to offset a 3% reduction in volume. As we indicated last quarter, we have strategically been deemphasizing lower margin retail business and this did have a negative impact on the quarter's reported results. This is the correct strategic and financial decision. And while we will have a few more quarters of top-line headwind, we more clearly focused on driving differentiated growth in the more profitable Flow channel.","The retail shift was the contributing factor to the Residential & Commercial decline in the quarter, but we also saw the industrial and infrastructure businesses decline in this GBU. Industrial saw growth in its global fire offerings, but this was not enough to offset sluggish OEM demand. Within infrastructure, we saw some growth in the break and fix business where project activity continued to be slow for our engineered flow business. We saw growth in Food & Beverage as our applied water business once again delivered differentiated growth, which more than offset continued weakness in agriculture.","The right half of the page show second quarter Flow Technologies operating profits and margins. Operating income was flat with operating margins expanding 30 basis points to 14.1%. Flow Technologies delivered positive price and productivity that offset inflation during the quarter. The weaker top-line, including the retail shift we mentioned previously, hindered income growth. But operating margin expansion is expected to accelerate as mix slowly improves.","Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 11 for a look at Technical Solutions results. Technical Solutions had a great third quarter with 8% sales growth, with all verticals contributing in the quarter. Volume grew 7% and price was a positive contribution of 1%. Industrial grew 5% led by our North American Equipment Protection business. Energy still showed strong growth of 13% in the quarter with strength globally, particularly in Canada. While it was encouraging to see Canada turn positive for the first time this year for Technical Solutions, it is far too early to call this a trend, but we\u2019re watching order rates in the oil sands very closely.","Infrastructure was up 12% on the strength of our European Electronics business where comparisons will begin to get tougher starting in the fourth quarter. Finally, Residential & Commercial grew 9% as last year\u2019s cold winter has led to early stocking in both North America and European channels. The right half of the page shows third quarter Technical Solutions operating profits and margins. Operating income grew 15% and operating margins expanded 140 basis points to 22%. Price and productivity remained a hallmark of this GBU. What the strong top-line demonstrates is leverage in this business and how little bit of growth can quickly flow through to the bottom line.","Again, we\u2019re very encouraged by the strength of Technical Solutions in the quarter. And while the growth rate is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter, it does appear that the industrial business is strengthening the back half of the year as we had expected.","Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 12 for a closer look at the total Pentair growth profile. Like the first half of the year, during the third quarter we saw solid growth in developed countries while fast growth regions remain mix. U.S. grew at a mid single digit rate and Canada grew double digits. But we saw Europe decline for the first time this year. Overall, developed economies delivered solid growth. Fast growth regions were down modestly for the quarter, but it truly was a mixed bag. China, South East Asia and Latin America, all grew double digits, but we continue to see declines in the Middle East and softness in Eastern Europe and Africa.","While weakness in the Middle East is due mostly to a couple of large projects last year that did not repeat, we still see attractive growth prospects for the Middle East long term. Energy turned positive for the first time this year, but remains down year-to-date. Part of the decline is the previously mentioned large projects in the Middle East. We\u2019re seeing strength the last few quarters in oil and gas, particularly in North America, but the declines occurring in the smaller power and mining industries are masking the oil and gas improvement.","Industrial grew modestly overall and is up year-to-date. We're particularly encouraged to see the strength in our high margin North American equipment protection business. While process orders have shown quarterly lumpiness, we believe that we\u2019re well positioned for what we see as improving North American orders in 2015 and 2016. Quoting activity remained strong as process companies made CapEx commitments to take advantage of lower energy and feedstock prices.","While we\u2019ve seen residential and commercial growth rates moderate, growth remains healthy on the strength of a strong North American housing market. We also saw continued signs of recovery in our smaller commercial businesses.","Food and beverage has seen growth moderate largely due to two factors. First, as mentioned earlier, the slowing in agriculture is clearly having an impact on our Ag related businesses. Second, delays in beverage projects have muted the growth in this vertical. Infrastructure was a positive story once again this quarter, driven mostly by our electronics business within Technical Solutions. While the comps begin to get tougher for electronics next quarter, we\u2019re seeing small signs of encouragement that make us believe our water related infrastructure businesses are slowly turning positive.","After a slow start to the year, we\u2019re seeing improvements in our two largest verticals, Energy and Industrial. We continue to grow albeit at a more moderate rate than was anticipated at this point of an economic recovery, and we\u2019re positive about the progress we\u2019re making around productivity and standardization. While the global economic environment has its share of challenges, we remain cautiously optimistic. Cash flow remains a very bright spot for us and we remain focused on disciplined capital allocation.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John.","John Stauch","","Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide #13 titled Q4 '14 Pentair Outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we expect sales to be up approximately 1% to 2% to 1.85 billion which includes about a point of anticipated FX headwinds. Valves & Controls is forecast to be flat, Process Technologies is expected to be up 5%, Flow Technologies is estimated to be down 4% with tougher comps in Ag and further deemphasis of lower margin retail business, and Technical Solutions is expected to be up 4% on continued strength in industrial.","We expect operating income to be up roughly 9% and operating margins to expand 90 basis points to 14.5%. This includes ongoing OMT investments in Valves & Controls unless of a negative mix issue in Process Technologies. Our EPS forecast for the fourth quarter is a range of $1.02 to $1.04 for an increase of roughly 20%. We are expecting the tax rate to be around 23.5% and the share count to be around 187 million, reflecting recent stock buyback efforts.","Please turn to Slide #14 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Quarter end debt was approximately 3 billion, or 2.7 billion on a net debt basis, inclusive of global cash on hand. In the third quarter we returned over 450 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. At the end of the third quarter we had approximately 300 million remaining under our current 1 billion share repurchase authorization, but we plan to exhaust the remaining authorization levels in the fourth quarter. Our ROIC ended the quarter above 10%. We continue to have a lot of opportunities on the working capital front with the legacy flow control businesses and we expect to make further progress as the year continues.","Please to turn to Slide #15 labeled Full Year 2014 Pentair Outlook. We are raising our 2014 adjusted EPS to a range of $3.72 to $3.74 from a range of $3.65 to $3.70 or greater than 20% growth reflecting the third quarter results. For the year, we\u2019re expecting the top line to grow 1% to 2% inclusive of the impact of foreign exchange to 7.1 billion. We expect Valves & Controls to be down modestly for the full year. Process Technologies is expected to grow 5% for the year on the strength of pool, beverage systems and food service. Flow Technologies is anticipated to be down 2% for the full year and Technical Solutions is forecast to grow 4% due largely to an improving industrial business.","Adjusted operating income is expected to be up approximately 13% to just over 1.01 billion and this includes roughly 20 million of OMT investments within Valves & Controls. Adjusted operating margins are anticipated to expand 140 basis points to 14.3%.","For the full year, we expect the tax rate to be around 23.5% and the share count to be about 195 million. Free cash flow remains on track to be north of 110% of net income.","Operator, can you please open the line for questions? Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","So when we think about the dynamics around the valve orders and some of the stuff that's coming out of process or which segment is the one that\u2019s down in the fourth quarter, the flow segment, this year along with some other incremental headwinds, how does all this kind of mix together and set up for the growth dynamics for next year? You talked about the rolling valve orders being good. Does the fourth quarter look okay on that front? Maybe you could just talk about those dynamics.","Randall Hogan","","I think we never put too much emphasis on Q3, first of all. I mean with August being a pretty light quarter month traditionally than July, and we take a look at a couple of dynamics. We look at our win rate in the quarter\u2019s that we're quoting. We look at how strong the front log is than where the quote log is. The actual quoted activity in Q3 was down, so we feel like our win rate held in. And we still see a bunch of projects heading into Q4. So we're expecting Q4 to be another strong orders growth and we need it as we set up our expectations for next year. But we're certainly in wait-and-see mode on the pace of those orders and obviously mid-December we'll be providing guidance that will give an update on how we feel about next year.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","And so can you still -- that $4.50 number is still kind of out there as a possibility or is it too late now to book enough orders to have that at least as part of a range?","Randall Hogan","","I wouldn\u2019t take it off the table at all, no. I mean we are not done until we're done. As we mentioned, our hit rate is good. There is lots of activity out there. We track hit rate, and things have slid, we all know that, everyone in the industry has seen that. But we haven\u2019t seen massive cancellations or share loss that we can calculate.","John Stauch","","Steve, I think when you look at the dynamics of what we are trying to drive, and I think Q3 is indicative of this, we want to have most of the things in our control. And one of the things not in our control is the market. But we still have a lot of synergies remaining and we are building momentum at Lean. We have got carryover restructuring that we are still working on heading into next year. And the operational performance is encouraging because we are building momentum there. We want to grow more than anybody. And every time we see some markets go forward, a couple of markets go backwards. And so we have got to look at things we can control and within the things we control, we're exceeding our expectations. And then we have to see where the market is going to shake out next year. But I think given our operational execution, we still feel confident that we can deliver superior value to the company.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","What percentage of your oil and gas business is midstream, upstream, downstream? How do we think about that?","John Stauch","","Just under a third would be midstream.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","And then upstream? Is it a third, a third, a third?","John Stauch","","It is more than a third and then downstream is a little down of third.","Randall Hogan","","The way we look at Valves & Controls, we are particularly strong in mining and power. They are not as big as oil and gas obviously, or process. So their being weak is not great news for us. But frankly, we are very strong in LNG and we are very strong in process. And those two, the outlook for those two applications, LNG in particular with cryogenic applications, we are very strong in that. We see a number of projects there that are quite exciting. And there is going to be five-six -- in just in North America there are going to be five or six new plants every year for the next three years in the Petrochem space and probably five to six expansions. And it's early days for the valves to be led in that because in the way it rolls out, there will be plant level awards first and then get to the valves. But we are tracking them all and we feel good about those.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein Research. Your line open.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Hey Randy, maybe you could follow up a little bit on that. In terms of if oil prices were to stay similar to the current range for a little bit more of an extended time and you look at the balance of your exposure that you just described upstream, midstream, downstream, I mean to what extent do you see that as kind of a headwind versus tailwind for the company?","Randall Hogan","","Well I am not an oil guru, but we are watching with great anticipation like everyone else on what the impact will be, what oil price is, different activity change. But the end customers don\u2019t -- they are not changing their CapEx plans based on movements week-to-week on oil prices. They are waiting \u2013 they'll take the year to do directionally drill the well in a tight shale formation. So it's not something that you turn on and off on a weekly or monthly basis, so \u2013 if we look at overall CapEx plans. But in particular if you take a look at the two businesses that I just talked about, LNG, the thing that\u2019s driving LNG right now is the opportunity to export LNG from North America. If you take a look at it, we have a vast amount of natural gas that is priced for the first time the lowest BTU value since the deregulation natural gas and the first time natural gas is trading at a price lower than its BTU value. And with the abundance of natural gas, you can see us having a real opportunity to export that gas to other countries, but basically Asia and Europe. And there's four or five projects underway right now then there are 17 being planned. And then on the petrochem side same thing. A lot of the investment left overtime as natural gas, which is the feedstock at petrochem, the natural gas liquids, as they even up in price, that capacity left in the country and now it\u2019s coming back and all for the same reason, natural gas prices were pretty low. So, those two in particular benefit from the longer term lower cost of natural gas. So that\u2019s why I'm encouraged and I\u2019m worried less about what oil prices do to those two things than I am to what it would do to E&P.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","","And then John, Page five, which is really helpful, the operating income walk that talked about growth inflation and productivity versus price. The inflation you're saying is sort of 1.5% for the whole company. I mean I make the assumption that that\u2019s including wage and material, total inflation, And then mix is somewhere baked in here, maybe you could describe where you put it. And then the basic business model then is kind of 1.5% inflation offset by 1% of price and 1% of productivity. Is that the way \u2013 that just happened obviously this quarter. But as you think about kind of the business model for the company in the absence of growth, how should we think about this? And then how do you think about it sort of a little bit longer term?","John Stauch","","You\u2019re right. I mean our inflation numbers include both labor inflation and material inflation, so you\u2019re right. And then mix is netted into productivity and price columns and that\u2019s inclusive of a negative mix we have. I think as we think about where we are right now, I think inflation is going to get a little higher and that\u2019s not a bad thing, we\u2019re actually hoping it to go up a little bit. And then overall we do strive to get about a point of price. I mean where 70 to 80 basis points of price is a full yield for us given the fact that half of the revenue -- or about 40% of our global revenue is more projects and systems now, so less price opportunity there. And our productivity is two points and that\u2019s what we try to archive. And right now we've got a lot of tailwinds there. We'll start to see benefits in OMP next year. But as I mentioned, we have to carry over restructuring and we\u2019re really building momentum around lean and sourcing in the new flow control additions.","So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s time to pull back on productivity anytime soon. As a matter of fact, we want to push the pedal harder on that, Steve. And those \u2013 I said it earlier, those are in our control.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Your line is open.","Mike Halloran - Robert W. Baird","","So just on the thermal side of the business, maybe you could just talk a little bit about how backlogs are trending there, project acceptance, some of the Canadian activity. But then also what that quoting activity looks like and how that\u2019s tracking relative to expectations?","John Stauch","","So a couple of elements there, I mean I\u2019ll start with Canada first. Canada, we are at levels now on an annual basis that we feel really reflect hopefully a floor. But we\u2019ve been tracking at those levels and starting to see an uptick and we did see an uptick at both orders and shipments in Canada in Q3 that we think continue into Q4. As far as the order rates, certainly getting a strong pickup in the order rates on the industrial side, industrial heat tracing, and starting to see the benefits of some of those petrochemical, particularly sulfur orders that Randy mentioned earlier and we\u2019re starting to see some fairly strong encouraging news on what\u2019s happening in energy in that space. And so we feel pretty optimistic heading into Q4 that we\u2019re starting to see those orders pick up in a way that could be helpful in the future.","Randall Hogan","","And I\u2019d add, one of the things, as we've talked before, we\u2019ve gone underneath the segments we\u2019ve gone to 19 focus platforms to drive growth. In the thermal areas what that did was we broke out the commercial thermal business, commercial thermal solutions, and that focus has led to higher growth. I mentioned in the script that we\u2019ve seen some nice stocking orders in preparation for \u2013 or as a result of the cold winter last year we actually had stock out last winter with the heat tracing for snow melt and rail protection and et cetera. And so our business, with the focus we have, we've been able to get out front make sure the stock is in place for what might be needed for this upcoming winter and that whole focus has led to some more innovations in terms of other applications in the commercial space for install on hot water and some other interesting applications. So thermal is looking pretty good.","Mike Halloran - Robert W. Baird","And then at a higher level, obviously you guys took down revenue expectations last quarter. There is still talk of push outs and there is a few moving pieces within the portfolio. I guess what I\u2019m asking is if you take out the FX swings with the strengthening dollar here, relative to your expectations, how much on a revenue line on a forward basis has really changed? So maybe you could just talk about a couple of the puts and takes as you see versus where you guys laid out expectations last quarter?","John Stauch","","Yes. The way we do FX is we take the ending rate at the end of September of about 28 on euro, and there's other currencies of course, but that one had the biggest impact. And so if you would take that into next year and assume that we\u2019re tracking right around where the euros to dollar is today, that is roughly a 1% headwind next year and that is current views. We can forecast where the currency is going to go. The way I would tell you is every penny of euro to dollar movement is worth about 10 million to Pentair on an annual basis.","Randall Hogan","On the revenue line.","John Stauch","On the revenue line. And what it gives the operating income line is the natural transactional benefits that also occurs of not being substantial headwind.","Other than that, I think we\u2019ll be watching as we head into next year where the Valves & Control backlog is and how that impacts next year. And then we\u2019ve had a couple of headwinds. We\u2019ve had this retail issues in flow which is about a point of revenue to Pentair and that continues next year. So, I mean there is puts and takes. At the same time, the industrial and the thermal is performing at a higher level.","Randall Hogan","But I'd say with the exception of FX, we kind of see the world where we did when we talked last quarter. I mean FX is different. But other than that...","Mike Halloran - Robert W. Baird","","That makes sense. And that\u2019s what I thought you were driving to. So, appreciate the time.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","","So, my first question is -- really just not to delve few much into the oil & gas pressures that we\u2019ve seen of late, but perhaps maybe you can talk a little bit about the quoting activity that you mentioned, it was lower this quarter. Is that a seasonal factor? How much of that related to what you were hearing from your oil and gas customers? And specifically going back to the question that was asked earlier on your exposure, when you talk about your upstream exposure, what percentage of your business is linked to longer term projects versus shorter term projects?","Randall Hogan","","On that one, I can\u2019t give you how it splits in here right now. I don\u2019t know if John, you can get that?","John Stauch","","Yes. So, I mean yes, Q3 is seasonal. We inherited some businesses that used to have a fiscal year of September. So just to remind everyone, it used to be a big push for them because it was a fiscal year end. But naturally, Q3 would be a lighter quoting activity given kind of shutdowns in August in Europe and that kind of leaking over in the United States lifestyle. When it comes to projects, large projects do make up about 70% of our overall quote activity still today and so we are looking for large projects. I want to define large projects as anything over $1 million to $5 million. These aren't mega projects at all. They're just larger valve order rates. So those continue to be the trends that we are looking to. And like Randy said, the quarters have been very volatile and what we\u2019ve been looking to is the six-month, the trailing month order rates to try to get some sense of normality as to where these markets are going.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","","And so is it fair to say in a sense necessarily from the conversations you were having with your customers that the project push outs we\u2019ve been talking about for quite some time now, but there wasn\u2019t really -- was there much of a change in the quarter and in the tone relating to the projects that you\u2019re looking at?","John Stauch","","We would have expected to be up modestly in orders entering into the quarter and we came out around flat. So there were a couple of projects that we could point to that felt like they slipped primarily around EPC actions and activities that have pushed those out. And so that\u2019s consistent with what I think you\u2019re hearing from others. And we don\u2019t feel like there is any share loss in there and therefore we feel like as the market comes back, we\u2019re going to participate in that.","","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And just one follow-up question on the margins, because look, the margins in your Valves & Controls business was really strong this quarter. The expectation as you head into 4Q is another really strong quarter. So, two follow-ups there. One, can you tell me the OMT headwind that you\u2019re expecting in 4Q versus 3Q? And then secondly, you\u2019re basically expecting to see about 280 basis points of margin expansion in 4Q. Just help me understand the confidence in that number from where we sit today.","John Stauch","","Yes. So we're expecting 5 million of OMT in Q4, which is about 1 million higher than it was in Q3, but no tracking to the 20 million on the annual basis. That\u2019s fairly consistent. The margins last year, just to remind you, we had a little challenge in a couple of our factories and a couple of...","Randall Hogan","","We had one big project too that shifted.","John Stauch","","One big project that was a very low margin project. So, when you take a look at it sequentially, it looks more normal. And we feel like Q3 performance is indicative of how we are performing in our factories and the sourcing benefits we\u2019re receiving and the mix of projects that we\u2019re shipping. So we feel comfortable heading into Q4 with that same margin look.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is open.","Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","","If we go back to the Valves & Controls business, you said you were looking at order rates pretty closely with the decline in oil and gas. If you looked more at the short cycles part of that business, have you seen any meaningful change there over the last couple of months with the price decline in oil?","Randall Hogan","","Well, we were softer in short-cycle orders than we'd have liked to have been in the third quarter. That\u2019s largely due to lower mining activity and lower power than it is in oil and gas. As when we take a look at what the change rate was, not so big a difference in oil and gas.","Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","","Okay. You also called out softer Middle East relative to some tough comps from projects last year. It\u2019s pretty typical of the Middle East to build a lot, digest for a while, build a lot, digest for while. It sounds like we are in that digesting period. Can you talk about the outlook there and where you think we are in those cycles, maybe when you expect to pick up in Middle East?","Randall Hogan","","Well, I would say second half next year would be when we would expect to see it. I mean there is some activity in terms of quotations now that wouldn\u2019t hit sales until the second half of next year.","Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","","So you would expect orders to start hitting maybe six months before that?","Randall Hogan","","Yeah.","Operator","","Your next question comes from line of Scott Graham from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","","When we look at the fourth quarter sales guidance and we adjust for the FX, it doesn\u2019t really look a lot different than what we saw in the third quarter. Yes, we've had a bunch of negative headlines in press from second quarter till now. Is this essentially a function of your saying -- or are you essentially saying to us that your customers have really not -- their orders have not been impacted. And again, the company as a whole I am talking about here. I think that there was some fear of that out there heading into the quarter and you guys are in a lot of markets. So just as a general statement, are you not seeing your customers pull back off of some of these negative headlines?","Randall Hogan","","Well, let me start with your last point. We do serve a diverse set of end markets and they are not all moving together. And they don't all move with move oil and gas. Even within oil and gas, as I mentioned, the lower prices are actually good for some applications. But, we think food and beverage is still strong. We think our residential position in the U.S. is going to continue to give us growth, albeit maybe at a little bit more moderate rate. And so we think that particularly those two businesses are quite good. Europe is the thing that is weaker now than we thought it would be. So we are cautious on oil and gas. But again, oil and gas is just part of our energy exposure and energy is only 28% of our sales. So oil and gas is less than 15% or so. I will give you exact number. So we look at all of those end markets as important to us. And particularly the industrial North American growth and capital spending is a huge driver for us. And we saw that in the third quarter and you can see what it does when we get some growth there if we don\u2019t expect to book another 8% in the fourth quarter then.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","It sounds like there was nothing knee-jerk from what you saw in the quarter, essentially?","Randall Hogan","","Right.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","","The second question is more about the intended usage of cash next year. With sort of the reset to the guidance and the divestiture of that business, kind of looking at that $4.50 maybe a little bit differently, is there a chance that we could see some M&A mixed into your cash usage next year on top of share repurchases?","Randall Hogan","","Yeah.","John Stauch","There's a chance, yes.","Randall Hogan","There's a chance.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","Okay. From anything sizable? Are you no longer looking at small things? Are you looking at things that are maybe a little more sized as the company is larger?","John Stauch","","We are always actively looking at and we have been actively looking hard. We think that we have proven that we can integrate. And there is some of our platforms and businesses that are -- certainly have an appetite to do deals and have the capacity to do deals. So we are constantly looking and we got to have the right price between the seller and the buyer and those things have to line up. So it\u2019s hard to predict.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","Fair enough. In the absence of M&A though, we should, I think realistically then, expect more share repurchases in 2015 kind of maybe not along the lines of year and a half ago, but maybe something along the lines of maybe the last couple of quarters that we have seen?","Randall Hogan","","Currently we are a new company, but we used to be -- before our merger we had 250 million in cash flow, that was a big deal. We are going to do over 800 million and as we get bigger it's going to be in the billion dollar range . Over the last -- since the merger, which was just two years ago, close to two years ago, we have returned almost -- we have almost done 2 billion in share buybacks already. So we see the benefit of doing that. At that level and with that rate, it would be pretty dramatic. But we do believe in returning shareholders -- giving shareholders return. And we have done it about 38 years in a row \u2013 or was it 39 -- 38 ears in a row with our dividend increases. And our belief is that capital should be used, not wasted.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","John, just back to your comment about we expect strong orders in the fourth quarter, can you just clarify that? I mean, is that just translating some of this quoting activity into orders?","John Stauch","","Yes. What I was saying is that obviously we\u2019re going to put the pedal to the metal on trying to get as much orders as possible. And there still is activity out there. And as Randy mentioned, we can\u2019t just be wed to the price of oil and there is a lot of other markets in which we serve that we\u2019re focused on. So, I mean we've got to keep going after it and there is still a good solid quote log heading into Q4 and we want to continue to take advantage of that.","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","","And then just on this $4.50 number, clearly you\u2019re doing a lot more buyback here than certainly I would have thought. That helps. You seem to be pushing pretty hard still on productivity and you should get some OMT benefit. But can you maybe frame how you think about -- what do you need in terms of top line growth to kind of approach that $4.50 number?","John Stauch","","I mean, I think just to remind everybody, the $4.50 was in response to the $5 target with about a quarter of that related to losing water transport contribution, the other quarter due to macro environment and that\u2019s all at a point in time. So as we talked about earlier, mid December we\u2019ll be giving guidance heading into next year which will frame kind of how we feel about the overall contribution based upon what we see in December. That will include our Q4 order rates and include current foreign exchange views, include where we think the balance sheet participates in that and we'll have a better insight to what to provide. Right now there is really nothing out there against that number.","Randall Hogan","","Yes. Where we are in our process right now, over the next month and a half we will be doing the heavy lifting and doing the discipline planning. Productivity will always be part of our strategy. We plan our work and we execute that and I think you can see in our integration and you can see in our consistent productivity overtime, we know how to do that. What we'll be doing is building that detailed growth plan. That will roll off into our budget. Those budgets will then form the guidance we give in December. So we'll tell you then.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg from the Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners","","Can you actually just give an update on where you stand with the synergy number? I know you've been kind of moving away from it. But you talked about 200 million completed as of the end of Q2. Where do you stand at the end of Q3? And to the extent you can, maybe what the bridge will be between '14 and '15?","John Stauch","","I think the 200 million was \u2013 it might be the same number, but it was also the repositioning our cost takeout that we were actually driving to, so permanent cost structure reduction. I mean, as we gave the update, we\u2019re looking to get over $275 million of synergies by the end of next year, which was the new number exclusive of the water transport contribution. And given where we ended Q3, it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re tracking stronger than that number. And if you would push me for a number, I would say we're $10 million to $15 million, maybe $20 million better than expectation.","We\u2019ve been blending this in. What we\u2019re really looking at is what we do in gross margin and how much that gross margin is coming from lean and sourcing, and then what are we doing on cost structure, primarily G&A, and what is that percentage of sales in the reductions there. That\u2019s really where we\u2019re driving it. It falls under standardization category, the reductions in ERPs, reductions in accounting centers and then where are we as far as lean evolution in the all factories, including legacy Pentair side as well. We feel really good about what we've achieved so far.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners","","Yeah, it's been good. Another question, just coming back, you talked about your strong position in LNG and chemical. When you\u2019re bidding for these projects, are you really appointed as a sole source supplier as valves and heat tracking equipment on these projects or are they breaking it up amongst multiple suppliers?","Randall Hogan","","It really depends on what the specific quotes are. Sometimes it will be a multiple package. The range of technologies and then performance characteristics of valves are pretty broad. So for instance we\u2019re a leader in triple offset valve, we\u2019re a leader in pressure relief valves. And all of those get specified and you bid those, sometimes you bid them as a package. The EPC and the end customer in our large project will decide how those split up the packages. They'll let the DCS go and then they'll do the pumps and then when they get to the piping and the valves, each of those common packages. So it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all on how it gets bid. And then it depends on, I mentioned LNG. LNG has a lot of cryogenic applications. We\u2019re a leader in that in terms of our valves, our triple offset valves and our pressure relief valves. So we tend to have higher share in those applications. Other applications, maybe not, so maybe not so high a share. So it's kind of hard to generalize.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners","Can I just sneak one last quick one in? I see you changed your CapEx modestly to downside, same with D&A. Can you just address what the thought behind that was?","John Stauch","","Yes. I mean it's really as simple as every year the GBUs -- our businesses and segments start out with a plan and we approve the capital if it goes along and we make those capital decisions based on the returns. And usually they overestimate in the beginning on what we're going to spend. And usually by the end of the year we get to the correct number. So we\u2019re just kind of getting to the correct number.","Randall Hogan","","Brian, in my 14 years it's probably 12 out of 14 years where that's been the case.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","","Hey John, just wanted to go back to the Valves and Controls margins, sort of showed some pretty significant upside versus the margins. The plant issues last year were known and so a pretty sudden sharp uptick. I\u2019m wondering is that just all sustainable structural step up?","John Stauch","I think that we crossed into the upper 15%s. We are forecasting just slightly above 14.5% to 15% for Q4. The only difference is that we get a stronger level of manufacturing in the September and December we sort of have those last couple of weeks where we start to tail off which creates some absorption issues in some of the factories. So we think that we\u2019re now at this type of run rate, we feel very good about the progress being made around sourcing, as I mentioned, and we can see margin of backlog and we\u2019ve got a better handle on a lot of the inter-company shipments between each other. So, feeling good about the Q3 performance and feeling good about our ability to sustain it.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Great. And then you mentioned being aggressive to get the orders in place in the fourth quarter. Just to kind of beat the dead horse on the Valves and Controls margin sustainability. Do the second half run rates here \u2013 do they reflect the level of quoting discipline that you have room to back up a little bit?","John Stauch","Yes. And I don\u2019t -- I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re necessarily backing off. But one of the things that the Valves and Controls team has done a nice job of is using Lean across the quoting activity. And we\u2019re spending quality time on the right quotes and right engineering jobs. And when we\u2019re doing that, we feel good about our ability to go on with a quote that we think meets our margin needs and meets the customers' value proposition. So, I think we feel good about the progress we\u2019re making using the Lean tools outside the factory and I think you\u2019ve seen that in our quoting activity.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Josh Pokrzywinski - Buckingham Research","Hey guys. I think it's me based on the announcement. On the -- just to circle upon Valves and Controls, you mentioned some of the other areas that you\u2019re participating in and are focusing on outside of oil and gas and maybe why we shouldn\u2019t be focused on the correction in oil prices and I get all that. But I guess thinking about a comment you made earlier, John, on 70% of the business being project related in some way, even if those projects are smaller, how much of this business that you\u2019re going after in pockets of strength is a legacy position for Flow Control or for Valves and Controls where you\u2019re calling on customers where you have relationships versus trying to start things from scratch and maybe in an environment where projects are getting pushed around and it\u2019s a little tougher to kind of calling a customer for the first time?","Randall Hogan","Yes. We have -- our brands are well known and they're known pretty much to all the EPCs and all of the oil and gas or any other customer set for that matter. But we are, for instance in sub-sea, we're not really strong in sub-sea. So, a lot of the sub-sea activity we\u2019re not going get. We do better on land. In that category I mentioned, we do better in liquefaction stations and natural gas than we do in pipelines. And this is really more of a product mix. So, we look at all of that and we look at our hit rate and what I would like to do is I'd like to see a higher hit rate on where we\u2019re strong and I would like to see us figure out how to get better in some of the places where our hit rate isn't. So there isn\u2019t a general answer I can give you on that.","Josh Pokrzywinski - Buckingham Research","I guess what drives the better hit rate though is my question. I mean clearly it\u2019s not price. I mean you guys have been very forthright with that. Is it lead time, is it capability, is it just...","Randall Hogan","","We believe configured-to-order can help us on smaller projects in particular. Having product in stock and being able to configure to order in our 80 locations is something that we think we can do better at. That\u2019s an idea yet, it\u2019s not a plan. We are doing some alpha test on that that will be helpful for the smaller projects. The rest is a lot of specification work. And we\u2019d rather be specified and take our chances than just compete on price, as you said. We have been more disciplined, we believe, on price than maybe before.","Josh Pokrzywinski - Buckingham Research","Got you. And then John, just two follow-ups, little housekeeping items. If spot rates stay where they're at on FX, and you mentioned that point of top line headwind in the next year, what does that work out to on an EPS basis with some of these transactional benefits you get that you mentioned? And then on the share count, if you do what you claim in the fourth quarter, what is the starting share count for 2015?","John Stauch","","Yeah. So a couple of different answers there. I mean on the transactional and translational FX basis, if we saw somewhere around a $0.10 movement in the currency, that would be the impact on the revenue line of $0.10 times what I said before. $100 million on the top-line, we would be inside of a nickel is what the impact would be on EPS. That\u2019s a model that we run quarterly and annually. And there is, as I mentioned, benefits to currency going down that offset some of the impacts of currency going down.","When we take a look at where we are in share count heading into next year, we are anticipating what purchase should be made. And as of today there is $70 million remaining on the authorization and that would drive somewhere around 185 million of the share count next year.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair. Your line is open.","Brian Drab - William Blair","","I think at this point in the call I need to drive in some finer detail on a high level that hasn't been touched on. One comment you made today is that you are seeing a shift I think the point of entry water filtration system.","Randall Hogan","","Yeah, I said that back. I am glad you asked that. It\u2019s point of use, not point of entry. I said it backwards. I've read that script three times and I didn't think [indiscernible]. Basically a lot more under sink, a lot more point of use versus point of entry. Point of entry has a bigger content for us and frankly a better mix of margins on the products. So I'm glad you asked.","Brian Drab - William Blair","","All right, thanks for that clarification. The related question was just going to be around that Hybrid DI system. I think it was last year with your Milwaukee team, they said that they are working hard on that product, but it didn\u2019t seem to be at the point yet where the price was going to result in an inflection point where you'd see a significant uptick in adoption of that product. But how is that going with that Hybrid DI product?","Randall Hogan","","We are still in development. We have actually done some redesigning work to take some of the cost out and improve the efficiency of the what's called the sack, a membrane sack, and improve the control of it so that it doesn\u2019t have to cycle as often. And so we have got that on beta test now and looking at it. We don\u2019t have a new launch date yet to go public with. But we still have positive thoughts about what that can do in the marketplace to eliminate \u2013 we basically provide the softness.","Brian Drab - William Blair","","And then I guess you touched on this but I just wanted to ask maybe a little different way. For the fourth quarter forecast for Valves and Controls and I am just trying to get a better, a higher level of confidence in the forecast. Your forecasting plant revenue for the segment suggests a 5% sequential increase, but backlog was down sequentially in the third quarter. Is this just the typical end of your push seasonality dynamic or is there a particular vertical you have more confidence in or better than average visibility in? Thanks.","John Stauch","","Yeah. Part of the backlog decline was foreign exchange and that\u2019s already reflected. But that rolls through over the next 12 months. So there is a small impact to Q4 related to that. It is a combination of how we feel about the shippable backlog. And then just as a reminder, we had about 35 million to 40 million of one project last year that went out on zero margin, which was in the Q4 number last year. So if you pull that out, you're going to see a little bit more revenue growth excluding that project. And year-over-year you should see the benefit of that drop through as it pertains to the operating income and where the margin. Does that help?","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank Of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. ","Andrew Obin - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch","","Just a question on your bridge, just going back to Slide 5. As I am think to the fourth quarter and I am thinking about your productivity price in the fourth quarter. Should we see it roughly in line with the third quarter? Because if you sort of do the math, it implies a slight deceleration. ","John Stauch","","Yeah, I mean as I mentioned earlier, we don\u2019t tend to get the same December contribution that we get out of June and September on an end of quarter basis primarily because of the way the holidays impact the last couple of weeks of shipping in the year. But all other components, inflation roughly there, little bit of headwind from foreign exchange, not a lot, and then also we expect to see a good productivity price push as well. ","Andrew Obin - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch","And just to clarify, no restructuring this quarter? And what\u2019s the thinking -- does that mean we are accelerating in the fourth quarter?","John Stauch","","We have not taken any incremental restructuring in Q3, as you indicated. And as Randy mentioned earlier, the context of rolling up plans and taking a look at where we think we are going to be next year and what contribution we have in productivity and growth, any further decisions on that would be taken as necessary.","Andrew Obin - Bank Of America Merrill Lynch"," ","So are we waiting for the board meeting or right now there's plan for no restructuring in the fourth quarter, it's just a placeholder?","John Stauch","","No, we are evaluating where the markets are going. We are evaluating the confidence in the growth plans. We are evaluating the confidence in the current productivity views and how all of those things work their way into any further access we need.","Operator","","And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Wright from Nomura Securities. Your line is open.","Jonathan Wright - Nomura Securities","","Just on SG&A, 18.7% sales this quarter. I think in the past you've talked about a long term target of 20% of that. Is there anything going on specifically in the quarter that was weighing on or bringing down SG&A or is that longer-term target now sort of sliding down a little bit? Can you get more cost out there than you originally thought?","John Stauch","It is a combination of a couple of things. I mean one is we do think we can get more G&A out, no doubt about it, but certainly feel even on current levels of G&A, we don\u2019t need to add any, so growth helps to leverage that down. And then we certainly -- we come up the difference by adding more into the R&D line overtime and adding to selling and marketing if necessary. And right now we\u2019re evaluating these 19 growth platforms that Randy mentioned and we\u2019re certainly giving them all the money that need at the moment as they earn the right to invest in more, we\u2019ll add more to the growth pocket.","Jonathan Wright - Nomura Securities","So looking forward, do you think SG&A as going to sales is going to be more like 18% to 19% sustainable?","","John Stauch","","Yes, I think so. I mean the quarters fluctuate. So we can take a look at where your full year's coming it and right now we think around 20% is achievable and then also drifting down to 19% would not be -- there is no magic formula there.","Randall Hogan","","But we are disciples of Lean enterprise. And G&A -- no offense to anybody on my team -- G&A is considered muda in the lean concepts. Muda is waste. So we want G&A to be as productive. In a perfect world there would be no G&A.","Randall Hogan","","Operator, any more questions in the queue?","Operator","","We do have one more question from the line of David Rose. Your line is open.","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","","I don\u2019t want to beat this to death either. But just to get a little bit more clarity around the comfort in orders for Q4, if I look at Q4 last year, you really had an exceptional period and you've got some very tough comps. Mining, as you mentioned, is not doing that great. That\u2019s probably your easiest comparison. Help me get more comfortable on the specific projects that you\u2019re looking at and how do we frame the risk at Q4 orders on the upside and the downside given where they were last year?","Randall Hogan","","I can say comfort is a word that I\u2019m not familiar with while you\u2019re projecting the future. But I mean in terms of the model, when you think about it, we look at our backlog we have and we look at what's shippable and we look at the quotation activities and that\u2019s what we use to drive our forecast.","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","","So this is all front line, right?","John Stauch","","Yes. And I just -- what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re trying to build the backlog up to get the next nine to 12 months of shippable backlog. And there is also booking shift in the order take as well. So I agree with Randy. I wouldn\u2019t use the word comfortable. But the level of execution around consistently getting robust orders growth is where we\u2019re trying to drive to and we are not yet ready to say that it\u2019s not where we needed to be. But I also want to remind you it relates to a third of our business and we also are looking at all the order and the booking shift business and the other two thirds of the business. And there is, as Randy mentioned, when you see oil and gas move in a particular direction, that\u2019s not necessarily bad for some of the industrial segments that we serve either. So all of it has got to weigh into what we think we can achieve for next year.","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","","And maybe last one is, last time we had a big disruption in Europe or at least concerns over Europe, there was a lot of destocking in the channel. Has October shaped up to be that way at all?","Randall Hogan","","I'd say too soon to tell in terms of Europe specifically. I mean, Europe was the surprise weakness and Europe was -- we had growth in Europe in the first half and then it declined in the third quarter. So that\u2019s a note of caution in terms of what we\u2019re looking at.","John Stauch","","It was one of the bigger pull-backs in September -- with the Europe performance in September was really soft.","Randall Hogan","","And for Europe, because July and August are vacation months, it\u2019s all about September in Europe. So making sense of what that means when you have a weak September in Europe takes a little while.","Randall Hogan","","Thank you. So that\u2019s it then.

On today's call, we will provide details on our first quarter 2015 performance, as well as our second quarter and full year 2015 outlook as outlined in this morning's release.","Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-K and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results.","Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow up and get back in the queue for further questions in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions.","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randy Hogan","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let me just begin on Slide 4 with a summary of how 2015 has started and how we see Pentair positioned for the remainder of 2015. As we announced two weeks ago this year has started off significantly below our initial forecast. We expected most of our energy related businesses to be challenged this year given the dramatic decline in oil prices in the second half of 2014. But a global capital spending freeze and its impact on industrial businesses was not foreseen.","We do not see this to be a Pentair specific issue as this broad-based decline was across virtually every business, every geography and every market. In fact, the only geography of growth we saw was North America. We believe there is broad, economic uncertainty that is contributing to delays in our customer\u2019s spending habits, and we have felt this in both large projects and some MRO business.","As a result of the dramatic impact of FX translation and a significantly slower start to the year we are now taking a cautious position on any expected recovery this year. So we have gone back to our cost [paybook] and are working aggressively to adjust our cost structures accordingly. Our balance sheet remains healthy and we expect 2015 to still be a strong free cash flow year. We will continue to invest in M&A where appropriate while executing on costs.","Given the uncertainty, we have rebuilt the plan to drive performance in 2015 to equal 2014. As a result we are adjusting our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $3.80 per share, making 2015 a pause year. We believe that Pentair is in attractive markets for the long term. We have detailed plans in place to work through the anticipated near-term challenges and we are executing them.","Now let us turn to Slide 5 for a quick look at our key 2015 forecast assumptions. Given the significantly slower start to 2015 as a result of the global capital strike we are experiencing, we are now expecting our core sales for the year to decline 2 to 3 percentage points instead of growing 2% to 3%. Given the first quarter top line shortfall and its negative operating leverage, we could not adjust our cost structure quickly enough in Q1. But we still expect operating margins to expand roughly 50 basis points for the full year.","We completed $200 million of share repurchases in January, and we\u2019re still focused on our active M&A list in our most attractive businesses. John will outline in detail the cost actions being taken both variable and fixed as we adjust to the start of 2015. As a result of these actions, we are expecting roughly 40 million of repositioning benefits this year, an accumulative 100 million plus in 2016. Our balance sheet capacity is over 800 million.","Although the external headwinds have worsened, we are focusing on the elements within our control. This includes getting more aggressive on cost actions, continuing to invest in differentiated growth, and as I mentioned, select M&A where appropriate. ","Now let us turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of our first-quarter results. This first quarter saw our core sales decline 4% as all verticals declined except Food & Beverage. The one geography that performed well was North America, but we saw weakness in all other key geographies, particularly in fast growth regions. As previously mentioned, FX was a significant headwind in the quarter.","Given the sharper than anticipated volume declines, productivity and price were not enough to compensate and we saw adjusted operating income decline and margins contract in the quarter. Cash flow was a typical seasonal usage where we expect another strong free cash flow year, and expect significant improvements in sequential cash flow improvement.","Now let us turn to Slide 7 for a more detailed look at the first quarter results. Our 4% core sales decline consists of 5 points of volume decline and one point of positive contribution from price. FX subtracted another 6%. Adjusted operating income declined 15% in the quarter and operating margins contracted 60 basis points, even though we continued to see lean sourcing actions and standardization efforts and G&A gained traction. We are accelerating our cost actions to adjust to the reality of the FX environment and lower core volumes, which should reverse this operating margin contraction. ","Now let us turn to Slide 8 for a review of our largest segment, Valves & Controls. Valves & Controls has seen a fair amount of quarter to quarter volatility in its performance, and the first quarter saw both sales and orders fall double digits. North America was the one pocket of strength, particularly in processed and with LNG customers. But all other geographies were down with double-digit declines in fast growth regions as customers seem to be delaying and in some cases canceling projects.","For the first quarter, Valves & Controls core sales declined 11% and FX translation was a further 8% headwind. Including significant adjustments due to currency translation the quarter ending backlog declined 4% sequentially following a 7% decline in the fourth quarter of 2014. Over half of this six-month backlog decline was the result of FX headwinds. ","Given that backlog is generally shippable in the next 6 to 12 months we feel it was prudent to adjust backlog for FX to give the most appropriate view of the state of the business. Core orders declined 15%, which we\u2019ll discuss in more detail in the next slide. Total orders declined 22% while including negative FX translation. ","During the quarter we saw some customers [directed] delays of scheduled shipments, and this accelerated near the end of the quarter. We anticipate some delays and expedites in shipments every quarter. The first quarter saw an even greater amount of net delays than we are accustomed to seeing. We did not see a material increase in project cancellation. We are seeing more customers requesting delayed deliveries which is not surprising within oil and gas, but we have also seen in the process industries.","The right half of the page shows first-quarter Valves & Controls operating profits and margins. While our lean sourcing and standardization continued to drive productivity within Valves & Controls, it was not enough to offset the volume drops in an already typically slow period, and FX translation also had some impact in the 30% drop in operating income.","We are still making progress with our changed agenda and gross margins in Valves & Controls expanded as a result of strong productivity. So we continue to feel good about our efforts underway, including lean transformation and the OMT initiative within Valves & Controls. While the strong margins gains of the past two years are encouraging, there is much more to do. So we plan to go even more aggressively after the cost structure and getting results from where we are investing for growth. ","Now let us turn to Slide 9 for a look at the orders and backlogs for Valves & Controls. As you can see on Slide 9, Valves & Controls backlog is broken down into four key industries, three of which fall under our energy vertical, those being oil and gas, power and mining, and one in our industrial vertical, which is called [process here].","Orders were down double digits across all four industries in the quarter, while the impacts to our energy related businesses were not a surprise given the decline in oil prices, process order weakness was not expected and declined globally with North America the lone bright spot. We are not expecting orders to improve during 2015 as customers continue to re-evaluate existing projects and in their pipelines for planning projects.","Although backlog has been hurt by the stronger dollar, we saw a decline in our backlog in real business terms as well. We will continue to focus on capturing shorter cycle MRO business, which has remained somewhat stronger than projects. While we do not expect the global capital strike to last forever, we are being cautious and are rightsizing to the current reality that Valves & Controls is likely to see top line pressure throughout the year.","We continue to believe in the long-term prospects for Valves & Controls and the transformation underway. For the next several quarters we will be focused more on cost, while anticipating increasing price pressure on the existing business. ","Now let us move to Slide 10 for a look at flow and filtration solutions. Flow and filtration solutions saw a 13% top line decline. Its core sales fell 7% and FX translation was an additional 6% impact. All four verticals served by flow and filtration solutions saw a decline. Residential and commercial fell 11% as global weakness and destocking in some of our North American distributing channels impacted the top line.","Infrastructure was down 14% as municipalities continued to delay spending, although we have remained more disciplined on pricing and believe we are seeing declines greater than in the served market. Food & Beverage was down 2% as the strength in global beer and diary was not enough to offset declines in agriculture spending.","Segment income declined 16%, but margins contracted only 40 basis points despite the volumes, FX and mix drags during the quarter. Productivity readout was strong and we believe we continue to have a long runway for improvement in margins within flow and filtration solutions. Given the weaker top line environment we plan to go after more than just G&A standardization opportunities and accelerate our rightsizing efforts within this segment.","Now let us move to Slide 11 for a look at Water Quality Systems. Water Quality Systems was a bright spot in the quarter with core sales growth of 4%. The growth within Water Quality Systems was not a surprise given that they are over 70% in North America and mostly serve the residential and commercial, including beverage verticals, which have been our two growth verticals recently.","Our aquatic systems business started strongly and we believe it is well positioned entering the pool season. Our foodservice business continued to grow globally with core sales up 11% in the quarter. The right half of the page shows first quarter Water Quality Systems operating profits and margins. Segment income grew 3% and margins expanded 40 basis points to 16.1%.","Price and productivity offset inflation and new product development investments continue. Our outlook for Water Quality Systems remains positive and we expect to see solid growth and margin expansion for the full year.","Let us now turn to Slide 12 for a look at technical solutions results. Technical solutions saw core sales grow 1%, which was offset by a 6% FX translation headwind. Energy was up 2% as our heat management solutions business entered the year with strong backlog, including two larger projects beginning to shift. We will watch orders closely as the year progresses. Industrial was flat as our equipment protection business was impacted by delays in industrial spending that occurred in the quarter. Residential and commercial grew nicely and despite a tough comp, infrastructure also was up modestly driven by telecom.","The right half of the page shows first-quarter technical solutions operating profits and margins. Segment income declined 8% and margins contracted 70 basis points to 18.4%. With the absence of price in the quarter, productivity was not enough to offset inflation and mix further hampered the income and margin performance during the quarter.","Negative FX transaction cost were a factor in margins as strong growth in Canada, combined with the strengthening dollar, squeezed margins on our U.S.-made products. Following the end of the first quarter, we closed a small bolt on acquisition within technical solutions for our thermal building solutions business, which we believe has attractive growth opportunities. We have five criteria around acquisitions and this transaction met all five. The deal made strategic sense. It made financial sense. We were the right buyers. We have a detailed integration plan, and we know who will lead that integration. Process and Technical Solutions will be addressed in cost structure as a result of FX and mix, we believe we have interesting M&A tunnel for this segment. ","Now let us turn to Slide 13 for a review of our key verticals and our expectations for growth in 2015. Given the difficult start to the year, we have adjusted our expectations across all verticals. Starting with industrial, our largest vertical representing roughly 29% of sales, we now expect core sales to decline 4% to 6% in 2015. While Valves & Controls continued to see strength in sales with its North American customers in the first quarter, the rest of the globe saw a sharp decline in orders. The remaining parts of Valves & Controls, industrial business, also saw weakness including industrial gas and shipbuilding.","We now expect the channel and customer destocking to continue throughout the year and pricing is something that we are actively managing. Core sales in our second largest vertical, residential and commercial, are still expected to grow 2% to 3% for the full year. But the slow start to the year has lead us to shave a couple of points off of our expected full-year growth rate. We believe that our aquatics systems business within Water Quality Systems is well positioned for another strong pool season in North America, and while a smaller piece of our vertical we expect improvements in non-residential construction as well. Roughly 10% of our sales are within our Food & Beverage vertical, which we expect to grow 5% to 7% on a core basis for the full year. This is on the anticipated strength of our global beverage and food service businesses.","Food service had a great first quarter and should stay strong through 2015. While core sales growth in beverage is also expected to be strong, this is a global business and we expect to be negatively impacted by FX translation. The strength in beverage is in both beer and diary. Within Food & Beverage, we also include the agriculture related businesses in flow and filtration solutions. While we are driving differentiated growth in agriculture, it will likely continue to be a drag on growth in our Food & Beverage vertical. Within our infrastructure vertical, which accounts for less than 10% of our overall sales, we are now anticipating a modest decline in core sales for 2015. We knew our electronics protection business in the technical space had tough comparisons to start the year, but we are encouraged to see modest growth in the first quarter.","We expect our infrastructure related businesses within flow and filtration solution, serving global desalination, water treatment and water supply to continue to be challenged. While it appears the municipal desalination markets have bottomed, we do not expect any recovery this year. Within North America the infrastructure break and fix business, we expect it to remain mixed with continued price competition. We now expect energy core sales to decline 6% to 8% for the year. This includes oil and gas, power and mining industries for us. The upstream business has been as weak as we had anticipated. We now expect to continue the pause in shorter cycle downstream business with capital spending delays or reductions have spread to midstream and downstream as well. We saw continued strength in North America in LNG, but the majority of global oil and gas was as weak if not weaker than we are expecting entering 2015. ","Let us now turn to Slide 14 for a look at our updated 2015 adjusted EPS guidance. As we take into account the challenging start to the year and the pause in global capital spending we are adjusting our guidance to approximately $3.80 per share from a range of $4.10 to $4.25 per share. The volume shortfall will not be overcome in one quarter. We are taking corrective cost actions that we expect to begin to read out in the second half of 2015, and also benefit 2016.","Begum not foresee the industrial pause continuing indefinitely, but until we see customers beginning to spend again, we will remain cautious. In the meantime, we plan to continue to invest for the long term. Not all of our businesses have been impacted in the short term and with our strong balance sheet and cash flow we will be thoughtful as we look at M&A opportunities.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John to give more details on the cost actions we are taking and provide additional color on the outlook. John?","John Stauch","Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide number 15 titled 2015-2016 cost actions. As Randy mentioned, we faced increasing headwinds in the first quarter and we are working to align our cost structure appropriately. To start, we saw a strengthening dollar create both top line and bottom-line headwinds. With euro at $1.07, we anticipate a $65 million operating income headwind for 2015.","If the Euro were to move to parity against the dollar, it would create another $10 million impact on operating income. We\u2019re not planning for the dollar to weaken, in fact we are assuming that this will be the new norm for the year, and are now implementing cost out actions to mitigate the translation impact on the go forward basis.","If the dollar weakens, we would expect to benefit, but we\u2019re not counting on it. The cost actions will primarily be in Valves & Controls and flow and filtration solutions, the two segments hit the hardest by the global capital spending pause. We expect these actions will yield $40 million in savings in 2015, an accumulative $100 million plus in 2016. We plan to continue to continue to focus on G&A and variable labor, but we are also expanding our cost actions through our fixed cost structure.","Please turn to Slide 16 labeled 2015 current outlook. This slide looks at the changes that have occurred since we last updated our forecast in early February. We experienced lower than expected volumes in two of our larger verticals, energy and industrial, and we are now anticipating pricing to be flat for the year and down for the next three quarters. As our Valves & Controls segment is expected to see increase in pricing pressure as the year progresses.","Within the residential and commercial vertical, we expect another strong year in North America, while anticipating residential spending around the globe at slower levels. We believe that Food & Beverage will continue to be a bright spot, where we expect benefits from commercial expansion. We do not expect the negative operating leverage from lower volumes to be offset immediately, and the translation impact discussed previously has become more challenging.","We plan to continue to drive productivity and expect the cost savings from our actions to read out in the second half to help mitigate some of the top line challenges. We still expect operating margins to expand approximately 50 basis points to 15% for the full year.","Please turn to Slide 17 labeled balance sheet and cash flow. Quarter-ending debt was approximately $3.4 billion or $3.3 billion on a net debt basis, inclusive of global cash on hand. In the first quarter, we returned 258 million in cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We completed $200 million in share repurchases during the quarter and we have $800 million left under our current $1 billion authorization.","Our ROIC ended the quarter at 10.9%. The first quarter has historically been a seasonal usage of cash, just as it was this year, but we expect strong cash flow during the second quarter and throughout the second half of the year.","Please turn to Slide 18 labeled 2015 forecasted cash flow usage and capital allocation. For the full year, we are expecting free cash flow of approximately $900 million or greater than 120% of net income. We anticipate returning nearly $200 million to shareholders through additional dividends for the remainder of the year. We remain committed to our investment grade rating and will remain disciplined in our capital allocation approach.","We expect to continue to fund organic growth opportunities and that capital expenditures will be slightly ahead of depreciation. We still see select opportunity for M&A in some of our businesses. If these deals do not materialize as we get later into the year we will consider incremental share repurchases.","Please turn to Slide 19 labeled Q2 2015 Pentair outlook. For the second quarter we expect core sales to decline approximately 3% to 4% and FX to present a 7% headwind. On a core basis, we expect Valves & Controls sales to be down 13% to 15% based on their shippable backlog and what we expect to be further project delays. Flow and filtration solutions core sales are anticipated to be down 3% to 4% on slower industrial and infrastructure business.","Water Quality Systems core sales are expected to grow 6% to 7% as we enter the peak period for North American residential, which includes another expected strong pool season. Finally, technical solutions core sales are anticipated to be up 3% to 5% in the strength of energy backlog in our heat management solutions business, and some expected increase in industrial capital spending as the quarter progresses. We\u2019re expecting adjusted operating income to be down roughly 10% and adjusted operating margins to contract 10 basis points to 15.1%.","Below the operating line, we anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 23%, net interest and other to be around $18 million and the share count to be approximately 182 million. Our second quarter adjusted EPS range of $0.95 to $0.96 represents a decline of roughly 6% year-over-year. As mentioned previously, we are expecting a strong quarter of cash flows.","Please turn to Slide 20 labeled full year 2015 Pentair outlook. For the full year we are now expecting adjusted EPS of roughly $3.80 as the cost actions we\u2019re implementing in the second quarter not anticipated to be enough to fully offset the volume shortfall and negative FX translation impact that hit our first quarter results.","For the full year, we expect core sales to decline 2% to 3% and FX to be around a 6% headwind. Valves & Controls sales are anticipated to be down 8% to 10% on a core basis. Flow and filtration solution sales are expected to be down 4% to 6% on a core basis. Water Quality Systems sales are anticipated to be up 6% to 7% on a core basis and technical solution sales are expected to be up 2% to 4% on a core basis.","We anticipate growth in our residential and commercial and Food & Beverage verticals with energy and industrial decline expected to continue. We expect adjusted operating income to be down 5% for the year and adjusted operating margins to expand 50 basis points to 15%. We will continue to right size our cost structure for the economic realities we are facing. It will take time for those savings to begin to materialize.","We expect overall corporate costs to be approximately $100 million, net interest and other to be around $73 million, and our full-year tax rate around 23%, and the share count for the full year to be approximately 182 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be roughly flat in the pause year we are anticipating. Finally, we expect another strong year of free cash flow of approximately $900 million or greater than 120% of net income.","Jody, can you please open the line for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Randy Hogan","Good morning.","John Stauch","Hi Deane.","Deane Dray","Yeah, maybe we could start with the comments about the global CapEx spending freeze, and maybe take us through the cadence of the months and I am particularly interested in the comments regarding how it may have spilled into some of the MRO spending and maybe this was part of the destocking comment in your \u2013 the negative [Ph] announcement, so could we start there please?","Randy Hogan","Yeah, thanks Deane. Basically if you take the industrial market that we follow most closely is of course our equipment protection business, and actually industrial and that business, industrial showed some increasing weakness in Valves & Controls as the quarter went. But really we saw a pronounced decline in March in the other industrial businesses, the sell through distribution, which we believe is some destocking and uncertainty as the knock-on effect, which we can see in valves as we saw the knock-on from oil and gas into some slowdowns in other projects and delays in other projects.","So we think there is a bit of a knock on effect and uncertainty that has caused this and we do believe this destocking, we even saw some destocking in the residential and commercial side in flow. So we do believe that distribution has taken a cautious turn in their re-ordering in industrial and in some places in residential and commercial.","Deane Dray","And then could you expand on that comment on energy regarding seeing the softness starting to work its way into your midstream and downstream businesses, I mean, clearly everyone has been set up for an upstream headwind, and that seems to be playing out a little bit earlier, but could you expand on the comments and any specifics regarding the midstream and downstream activities?","Randy Hogan","Well, we \u2013 particularly the downstream is bigger for us than upstream. So to see the oil and gas decline that we did and when we look at the projects we see a slowing in the orders rate across the board really. Our hit rate seems to be okay. But with the exceptions we pointed out, process, which we count as industrial, in North America was pretty good, but we saw a slowdown in process. In the fast growth markets we saw a slowdown in refining in the fast growth markets and now a lot of that is in specific countries like Brazil, which shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise.","But we do think there is a knock-on effect and I think you can see it in oil and gas companies, who are basically constraining capital and [Indiscernible] constrains capital it is a blunter instrument than just precisely focused on projects. We also saw MRO decline, you know, single digits, but MRO sales in Valves & Controls generally has been up every quarter, and we actually saw a decline, which to us feels like a \u2013 obviously you have to maintain things. So, it feels like a slowdown in general capital spending to us in the downstream. We will see how this \u2013 if they see it too.","Deane Dray","And just last one from me related to the energy side, Randy you made some comments about delays versus cancellations in some of the orders and maybe just expand there by your major energy businesses, you know, how much are delays?","Randy Hogan","Yes, it was a comment about Valves & Controls, primarily the \u2013 our Valves & Controls ship later in projects cycles. And so, you know, every quarter we see projects get pushed out some because they don\u2019t want the valves onsite until they are ready for them. But also usually there is some that get pulled in because projects speed up and slow down. So we always see a mix of delays and expedites in a quarter. We basically saw no expedites in the quarter.","I would say delays were probably 20% higher than normal, but there were no expedites to offset it and that to me \u2013 that feels like to us just a general slowing on project execution. We have had some specifics, which I won\u2019t get into, people exploring, we have had a few cancellations, but I can\u2019t say that that is any \u2013 that is abnormal.","You know, orders that we thought were going to go the projects we cancelled. But we are very cautious as to that was my comment about customers reviewing project pipelines. I think mergers in the industry affect that and the customers industry affects that and as they look at adjusting the capital obviously they\u2019re going to take some projects off the list.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs, your line is open.","Joe Ritchie","Thank you and good morning Randy, John and Jim. So, my first question clearly oil and gas is weaker you\u2019ve got this contingent effect it\u2019s still over into industrial Randy you mentioned in your prepared comments that the delays accelerated in March. And so, I\u2019m just trying to get, I\u2019m trying to understand I guess, when I think about your organic growth guidance for the year of down 2 to down 3, your complicated puffer organic growth is down 4 in the first quarter and just trying to get the sense for what gives you the confidence that you\u2019ll get some improvement as the year progresses?","John Stauch","Joe just to clarify its John. I think some of the Valves and Controls as we call Q3 and Q4 were not great quarters for us, so we started to see some of the slowdown from the order shortfalls in last Q1 and Q2, start to work its way in Q3 and Q4. So, some of those comps and Valves and Controls gets a little bit better, same thing in industrial (indiscernible) business solid backlog that we feel comfortable is going to continue to shift throughout the year. And then, residential commercial has been strong as Randy said in Water Quality Systems and we also start to anniversary some of the tougher headwinds in our flow and filtration solutions. I think we\u2019ve looked at the organic growth and although we don\u2019t see if we took a 90 day rolling average of historical sales we don\u2019t see that improving throughout the year. We do think that gives us a little bit easier comparison to the back half of the year.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. Do you guys have any clarity at this point on the destocking and when you would anticipate some of the headwinds associated with destock to subside?","John Stauch","We think it continues in the Q2 for us, I mean, we look at some of the same bell weathers that you guys do in the industrial distribution side, I think they saw the slowdown a little later then we did and they started to correct as Randy mentioned and that started to work its way through our March shipments, we expect that to continue through April and May.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. And then, I guess one last question on \u2013 I\u2019ll pass it up. On the restructuring side I applaud your efforts to take cost out just given the economic backdrop, can you just maybe provide some more clarity on the run rate that 100 million plus in 2016 just given the restructuring actions that you have 60 million this year, does that bake into some of the restructuring actions that you took last year as well because the magnitude of that number just seems like a big number and the payback seems quick?","John Stauch","Yes. These are new actions incremental to the things we\u2019re working already in synergies and in fact as Randy and I met with the business precedence we\u2019re still hopeful and our sales people are still hopeful that things going to improve throughout the year, we\u2019re trying to be hopeful as we were trained, hope it\u2019s not a plan and we think our view now is react to this new economic uncertainty and take the cost out. So which you\u2019re seeing in G&A and then some entry into footprint actions finally in our Valves and Controls and other businesses where we can get after some product line moves and get ourselves right sized and competitive.","As Randy mentioned in his remarks and I followed up, I mean, we now expect pricing to be the new norm in Valves and Controls and so even the projects that we\u2019re anticipating wining we\u2019re expecting to come at lower margins and so we\u2019ve to accelerate our competiveness to continue to bring those projects in at the same drop through that we anticipated for.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, helpful guys, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan, your line is open.","Steve Tusa","Hi guys, good morning.","John Stauch","Good morning Steve.","Steve Tusa","So, just on the pricing dynamics, I guess this is just happening in Valves and the orders, just happening a little bit faster than expected in Valves and Controls, I mean, is pricing, are these orders kind of going to impact \u201916 now or is this say kind of reshuffling in the backlog such as becoming more, it was longer cycle on the way up and it\u2019s now shorter cycle on the way down I guess. And then, from that perspective prices already kind of stating here in that business in revenues, so I mean, how we think about pricing in the back half of the year does that actually go negative in the back half of the year in Valves?","John Stauch","Let me talk about 2000 \u2013 we think, we were very cautious on orders through the year which we think will effect Valves and Control sales in 2016. So, we don\u2019t see a change really in sort of things going faster or slower, I think it\u2019s going to be a tough year on order and we\u2019re going to do everything we can do to win in a discipline way which will put switching the price. We already see pricing and you already heard about what customers are asking in terms of pricing. It might not just be in Valves and Controls, I mean, one of the things that effects does is if you\u2019re, the example I used in \u2013 which was a surprise, it won\u2019t be a surprise next time in terms of the transactional impact of effects that was an impact in our technical solutions business. Technical solutions really did pretty well in the quarter but we had a few surprises that being one that was a Canadian dollar transaction in the U.S. dollar cost and that hits prices. And as competitors as foreign, as non-U.S. competitors start using their change in cost advantage, price advantage we expect the challenging price environment in more than just Valves and Controls.","Steve Tusa","So when think about kind of this total price of Pentair going negative in the second half of this year?","Randy Hogan","Yes. We do think it goes slightly negative still in some of our distribution business we still expect to gain normal price increase and we have those through and they\u2019ve been accepted but we would expect any project and certainly areas where we got a bid on a cost to the price negative to the back half of the year.","John Stauch","We\u2019ve good material productivity that\u2019s hung up on the balance sheet so that will get more productivity as we go through the year too which will help offset some of that price. But, we think it\u2019s a more cautious plan to assume, we\u2019re going to see tougher pricing environment.","Steve Tusa","And then, I think you said in Valves and Controls next year, just kind of a high level 100 to 200 basis points as kind of not out at the question, I mean, as you move through the quarter here and assume you\u2019re just seeing on your dashboard, I mean, is that now maybe a little too aggressive, I mean, could we see more, we did \u2013 price decline in the long time in any of the markets we cover so the magnitude is always kind of tough, could it be worse in that do you think in \u201916?","John Stauch","I don\u2019t know, I think we\u2019re \u2013 to address the previous question, we\u2019re getting after the cost in aggressive way to continue to be competitive, so we\u2019re anticipating a tougher environment on the quotes and we\u2019ve got to have more cost competitiveness and so we\u2019re looking to our suppliers to participate as we\u2019re being after participate and we\u2019re also looking on our own cost structure and trying to be more competitive within that cost structure. So, the goal here is to continue to improve margins even with the decline of the revenue and we\u2019re going to have to be very aggressive to accomplish that.","Steve Tusa","Okay. One last quick question on free cash, what\u2019s kind of the key lever to ramp that cash flow throughout the year, what\u2019s kind of the one or two things that you\u2019re looking at to play out because it\u2019s little bit weaker than expected in the first quarter?","Randy Hogan","Yes. It\u2019s right sizing the inventory in our working capital levels to the new one.","John Stauch","Yes. Basically we\u2019re relying on working capital inventories to support the higher sales level and needs to be corrected and we know how.","Steve Tusa","Okay. So that\u2019s a negative for margins going forward then?","John Stauch","That\u2019s baked in.","Steve Tusa","Okay, thank you, thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein, your line is open.","Steven Winoker","Thanks and good morning. Just I want to stick on pricing and margin for a minute, we are entering this environment you had significant material deflation I think as a tailwind as well as pricing up until now has been helpful. Now those are both going against you and my question is given that you don't know how long this will last the restructuring that you have already taken and that is going to be fairly aggressive here how much more can you do there because there seems to be some risk to the margin opportunity going forward?","John Stauch","Yes Steve, I do want to be \u2013 I want to clarify something. I think we expect we have done really well in material productivity we expect material productivity to do even better going forward. We can see that and what we call the deferred productivity as Randy said what\u2019s done in Q1, but its hung up in balance sheet and we work its way in a positive way throughout the rest of the year. We\u2019re continuing to partner with our suppliers to anticipate these potential pricing headwinds and the pricing is an anticipated pricing. It\u2019s not realized so we are expecting that environment is going to be tougher and we are managing it appropriately as when I want you to take away. In addition we are saying if it continues to get more competitive we have to be more competitive and therefore the other actions that we are taking to make sure the long term our margins are still very high.","Randy Hogan","On the comment about \u2013 concerned about cost cut getting into growth we are very cautious about touching our growth resources but what we are doing is, I am personally redoubling my efforts with our platform, we\u2019re using our precedence to make sure that those investments we made are paying off. I didn't see enough read out of some of them in the first quarter.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And I think it\u2019s also leads into sort of the broader question on M&A that you put out there which is clearly you are on the hunt for attractive M&A at this point in the current environment. But how are you thinking that about that as well given all the pressures that you are seeing yourself and what makes an attractive acquisition given the weakness that you are seeing out there?","John Stauch","One thing is that given how difficult and uncertain things are sometimes opportunities become available that weren't available before so it\u2019s actually a good time to be looking but to your question how are we sure that we are ready, we that's one of the reason I put in the comments that we did in the prepared remarks on the small acquisition we just made, -- this is a good example, our thermal building solutions businesses is a growth business. We have some great innovations there and had a great year in growth last year. We expect to have a great year growth this year. This business built on is augment that are offering gives us more to put through our distribution channel. So, it fit those five questions, it fit our strategy well so there are strategy to drive growth, profitable growth it fit it well. The financials may think, we were able to do that deal with the comfortable set of financials that we know we can execute. We were the right buyers. We have the best fit that's why the financials work the best. And the last two things, we don't do a deal unless one we understand how we are going to integrate into the company and then two, we know who is going to in-charge be -- the in-charge of the integration and we trust them to execute it well. And so we are going to keep that \u2013 keep to that discipline and make sure that might start at the bottom and say which businesses are ready, which businesses are more strategically ready and capacity ready and we always do that but I think you should all count on this to continue to put that first.","Steven Winoker","And is Australia process on track the divestitures?","John Stauch","Yes. ","Steven Winoker","Okay. Alright. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Scott Graham","Hey. Good morning. I am sorry to beat the old dead horse here but if we can just go to slide 13 where we have the forecast for organic by vertical. The energy number has only really been taken down 1 point versus two months ago and we are talking about more concerns about pricing and moving into mid stream and downstream which I think many of us did expect that but nevertheless I am just wondering why we are only down 1 point incrementally from the two months ago guidance particularly given the order scenario that was laid out on an earlier slide?","John Stauch","Yeah its fair question. Thanks for asking it. I think its couple of things and couple of factors in here, Valves and Controls is experiencing more challenging entering into environment, we are also experiencing some key wins in technical solution primarily around industrial e-trace so these are down streams and later projects there are productivity related and we are starting to see a pickup in that area. So, we do have a mix of where the projects are coming through our typical businesses but all in we have backlogs and those backlogs give us confidence that this is not only appropriate number that we will ship this year.","Randy Hogan","Yeah we also don't think that the \u2013 we think - -we don't think the MRO declines on the first quarter this sounds like one orbit plan, is going to be as acute as it was in the third quarter, as it was in the first quarter.","Scott Graham","Alright. Thank you. And the other \u2013 my follow-up would essentially be on the share repurchase so I know we are kind of back into the M&A hunt mode and all that which is great I think I am wondering though is that why would we wait on share repurchases given this environment. Do we, you say if we don't find anything then you are kind of \u2013 you buy shares sort of a guess that was implied for the second half of the year you have a ton of balance sheet capacity why would we wait for that?","John Stauch","We feel optimistic. We have been working for fair amount of time as Randy said we have what we call platforms or businesses underneath the four segments that are high performing both in revenue and also on the operating side and we want to continue to feed the core and we have enough in the pipeline that would give us the feeling that we are going to execute on some of those throughout the year if in fact we don't feel that those are going to come through we are not going to execute clearly we would take a look again at share repurchases.","Randy Hogan","Right I mean we can only use the part or one so if we can't use our M&A then we will have through that but if we use that when we won\u2019t have M&A.","Scott Graham","Right. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is open.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Good morning guys. ","John Stauch","Hi Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Hey. Can you give a little more color on the geographic difference in Valves and Controls, I mean, you mentioned that the fast growth regions were getting hit the worse maybe a little more kind of specific countries or types of projects just being on there and then in terms of North America being the only piece up was that basically just L&G being the area strength that was there a more positive in North America beyond that?","John Stauch","Starting with that North America was strong in process in industrial as well stronger and L&G was a nice pick up. We had a particular focus on North America and we have actually invested in coverage there and I think that actually helped in Valves and Controls when \u2013 few years ago when we first got into it, it looked like our coverage and our share in North America was weaker than it was in other so that's an investment that I think is actually has paid off a little bit. It\u2019s obviously \u2013 somewhat by the overall trends. But on the fast growth side both China and Brazil we\u2019re down significant double-digits in the quarter. And Brazil I guess isn\u2019t that surprising, but China was more surprising than we expected and that was in chemicals as well as in oil and gas in industrial.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. And then just maybe a follow-up on this global capital strike point, I mean, as you kind of made sense over the first quarter and talked to your customers what are the most cautious about or uncertain about that sort of driving the decision making is there one sort of macro concerns that's particularly weighing on people one or two things you tend here?","John Stauch","Well, I think the oil and gas industry is one of the biggest drivers in capital spending in the world and I think it\u2019s the uncertain here on the knock-on effect and there is a lot of cuts and there is a high degree of caution and uncertainty about \u2013 well, there is projects that are getting delayed and won\u2019t get done but just concern about what all that mean we believe that is the fact and that's why we think destocking. When we see in industrial space where we kind of exclusively distributors we were pretty confident that there is destocking effect going on. But we also \u2013 we have seen delays in not just oil and gas we have seen continued delays in deferrals and power. And I think that has more to do with the general need for electricity and the fact that the economy generally is just buttering along in the world and electricity needs grow with the economy so we have had a lot of power projects that are just delayed, delayed, delayed and the fact that percent delays in the first quarter in power were in the projects that we tracked whereas the percent delays was high in oil and gas.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Randy Hogan","And I would just add to that I think all the investment tasks could be considered now in the fact of where are the cost basis and while ago you wouldn't have thought of investing in Europe and look at the new competitive nature of how the European factories on the global basis are competitive again and all that gets paused to people to say where do I put my investment and what is my likely return is going to be. So I think there is a lot of uncertainty out there that needs to be worked through. I think we feel good that energy as long term is a great investment cycle and we are going to see that rebound and we also think the industrial cycle long term will rebound. We are not just planning for 2015.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Got it. Great. Thank guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel. Your line is open.","Nathan Jones","Good morning Randy, John, Jim.","John Stauch","Morning.","Nathan Jones","There has been a lot of talk about the pricing pressure that you guys are feeling and are planning on feeling, can you discuss a little bit more where the opportunities are for you to put pressure on your suppliers in terms of pricing to participate in the pain if you will?","John Stauch","Yes, I think clearly global commodity prices are not increasing as Randy mentioned we don't want to use the word deflation yet but it feels like we are heading a little bit more into deflation area environment and so we are put our main suppliers on notice that we all have to work competitively to reduce our cost structures and certainly in the long cycle businesses we usually are participate in the \u201cgoing in and asking everybody to participate with you\u201d so we have our supply base primarily in those long cycle businesses that we certainly put on notice early, we tell them where we are in the quoting cycle and they are prepared, they being in the same headlines we all are and they know what\u2019s coming so we just all have to be more productive and we all have to participate to win the orders.","Randy Hogan","So couple of things, if I am just going to add to that is the decline in oil prices has led to some good declines in prices in resins. We want to make sure that we are getting the benefit of that. The change in FX means say we are buying something in dollars today if we can get it from supplier who is making in the Euros or the Canadian dollar that can be a transactional benefit to us. So, I mean that's those are the kind of things that we have been working as we said because of the productivity gets defer to the balance sheet to the shipment. So, I mean, we actually feel pretty good about our material productivity, we feel good about the actions our team is taking even beyond what they have already booked in the balance sheet.","John Stauch","Nathan I think just to finalize this question I don't think this is unique to us and that's my point. I think the industry in itself is going to go through it together and so we are all going to be dealing with the same dynamics and I think we are prepared for it and we are anticipating to be prepared for it and we are making sure that all our partners are prepared for it.","Nathan Jones","Okay and my follow-up you talked about increasing pricing pressure in Valves, you talked about the residential and commercial part of flow and filtration thinking you saw a greater than market decline due to holding price. Can you talk about where the decision or how you think about the decision to hold the price and lose share versus cut price to protect share in various parts of the business.","John Stauch","To clarify the on the point about where we are being very discipline that's in water, that's in large pumps infrastructure. Large infrastructure pumps. It wasn't I might haven't \u2013 I am going to have it blend it together with a sentence before the residential and commercial but just to clarify that comment was about basically our large engineered flow pumps and they had loss on pricing, we felt took some things on lower margins so we changed that and we have more discipline now. We make those products in Europe. Those are more competitive we make those products in North America and in Mexico and well Mexico is good in North America is less competitive. So we are trying to keep pricing disciplines that reflect our margin goals but also where we make things in that infrastructure space.","On the residential and commercial side, I would say we haven't really seen pricing pressure. We feel pretty good about that. There are some of the areas that were weaker in residential or not in North America, Europe and Middle East but we think Europe is actually showing some signs of life in residential and commercial that we didn't see it clearly in the first quarter. But we saw some promising signs. So, I would say that pricing is really more of a concern in energy and in industrial not in residential and commercial.","Nathan Jones","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Hammond","I\u2019m all set guys, my questions have been answered.","John Stauch","Okay. Thanks Jeff.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Brian Konigsberg","Yes. High good morning. Couple of more on Valves and Controls just when it comes to the MRO and slowing that you noted are you seeing any in the customer base trying to in-source that service component to try to save cost or is that economically beneficial for the customer to do?","John Stauch","Right. I don't think, we haven\u2019t seen any kind of trend in that regard at all because ours is mostly replacement in parts there is some service, in sort service but on the replacement which is replacing whole valves or whole servicing on existing valves that's I mean the parts for service valves. They have come back and our service revenue was not the issue. It was the parts and replacement valves that was down.","Brian Konigsberg","Okay. That makes sense. And also just on the pricing front are you seeing re-pricing of existing backlog or is it that the pricing pressure really on the new bids that you are pursuing?","Randy Hogan","New bids only.","Brian Konigsberg","New bids only. Okay and then lastly are you seeing any trends where for larger projects you are seeing the customer base or potentially EMC substitute start to substitute maybe some of the domestic higher quality suppliers of Valves and Controls with \u2013 maybe in some of the non-critical applications with some of the lower cost and potentially lower quality suppliers potentially out of Asia?","John Stauch","We have seen that before the decline in oil prices, we saw some more uses on \u2013 particularly on with close of the commodity products throughout the more commodity products and we expect that particularly where companies go to the EPCs for fixed bids. The EPCs have for some time used that as a focus to try to drive profit into their box frame. So that doesn\u2019t always pay off in launch in Valves \u2013 don't work but we have seen that in the Middle East. We have seen that in Asia for a long time and we expect that will just continue.","Brian Konigsberg","That's it from me. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab of William Blair. Your line is open.","Brian Drab","Hey good morning. There is one more left I guess. You talked about the 100 million in cost cuts and the timing of that and that we are going to see it I guess more likely in Valves and Controls infiltration but I am just having I don't know how much color you can give on it having trouble figuring out where do you find that much in cost cuttings when you are so successful in developing cost synergies and attacking that after the merger if there is any more detail around the types of moves you can make that will be helpful?","John Stauch","Yes, I think the discipline is, we forecast where we are going to be in organic growth and we certainly look at right sizing labor and the variable cost associated with what those declines would be and then we also take a look at our fixed cost structures and our plans on where we want to be on standardization and we accelerate those based upon where we are on our ratios I mean when you are declining you got to hold margin and to hold margin you got to take your cost out at the rate of sales and then sum. So again we are \u2013 we have $6.5 billion in the company in sales and when you take a look at this as a percentage overall cost we are still relatively modest as far as the cost take out on the percentage cost and we have been pretty clear that the more we saw on the standardization front the more opportunities we actually saw in front of it.","Randy Hogan","The way we look at it is we benchmark against the best and you can look at our businesses and you can see two of our GBUs that do not have margins close to the best of the peers and that would be on filtration solutions GBU in our Valves and Controls GBU. So these are not plans that we invent in the moment. These are long range plans that we accelerate it. The \u2013 we have ambitions to get to the valves and control business to be the best among the bests in right margin so that's a roadmap that we have contemplated for some time and it\u2019s just the matter of in this environment that you accelerate and we have done that before.","Brian Drab","Right. What's the long term target there Randy for that business if you could remind me. ","Randy Hogan","Well we have talked in Valves and Controls I mean I don't want people to think I am hallucinating given the first quarter we just had you know valves and controls was well above 15% margin we got it to 45 with lots of more opportunities. So we have talked about a number of well north of 15 but I don't want to give that again because I think it might lack credibility right now.","Brian Drab","Understood and then John what percentage of your cash is broad versus in the U.S. today?","John Stauch","Well, I mean two roughly \u2013 keep in mind we are outside the United States, so it\u2019s not as relevant but we have roughly $100 million of cash that we hold in any given time under 150 and most of that is international are outside the U.S.","Brian Drab","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer, your line is open.","Christopher Glynn","Yes thanks. Hey good morning. So you made an effort to sort of ring-fence the price pressure dynamic. How do you feel about that exercise of being able to ring fence it in the guidance?","John Stauch","I am \u2013 I guess Chris I would say again we don't think it\u2019s going to be unique to us and we think we are in the forward looking piece of it and I think if you are in this industry and space as you are not anticipating and I think it\u2019s going to be a challenge later and so we feel like we have pushed the business to accept the reality of where we are and to get on with the solutions that would be required to still maintain competitiveness and bake the margins that we expect within that environment. We are hopeful we\u2019re wrong, but I think the worse case is if we are wrong we feel like there is upside to it. I wouldn't want to be anticipating it not coming and then have to rely on the back half of the year to take the cost out. So, I think the fact that we are dealing with it now and right sizing where we think the businesses are, I think it\u2019s going to put us in much better position for 2015 and 2016.","Christopher Glynn","Fair enough and then just quickly the MRO side I think would be debt pressure more concentrated in the first quarter could you just elaborate briefly on that?","Randy Hogan","Well, I mean most MROs is maintenance related and you can defer maintenance for a little while but you can't defer it forever and I mean there are \u2013 these are industries that care a lot about safety and so we believe that its MRO side is one that should be at least zero, and it wasn't it was negative and it has been positive right up until the first quarter. So that's why I mean I kind of view it as the same thing of destocking in distribution that can't go on forever.","Christopher Glynn","Right. It makes sense. Okay. Thanks.","Randy Hogan","Was that last question or \u2013 okay one more question. Thanks.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Buckingham Research, your line is open.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi good morning guys and thanks for taking question. Just back on the comment on MRO Randy, if you can help me out on Valves and Controls it looks like first half to second half there is about maybe 500, 600 basis point acceleration in core growth actually looks like the comp gets a little tougher so maybe from your earlier comment Jim and I can follow up on the math there but how much of that acceleration would you call MRO kind of normalizing versus some visibility have in the backlog just trying to dimension out some of the drivers there?","Randy Hogan","Yes, I think it\u2019s right sizing the shippable backlog and timing that out I mean I think there is most certainty as you move into Q2, Q3 and Q4 with what that backlog produces. We are not expecting a significant order rate in the back half of the year to be helping our revenues this year and we think you can't unless you are going to cancel the job you can't push these projects out for a while some of these are so far along and that will be \u2013 we\u2019re pretty confident that we ship, it\u2019s just the matter of the timing of when they are going to ship. So clearly we are taking a look at current run rate and you can look at the current run rates that we are seeing in Q1 and Q2 and take a look at the seasonality bumps that we normally see we are not expecting those seasonality bumps that usually happen to Q3 and Q4 at the full year capital projects finish out to be consistent with where they were in prior years.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Okay. I guess if you have to think about it backlog visibility versus MRO normalization half and half, 60:40?","John Stauch","We are probably most confident about the MRO which you know in any given years call it a billion dollar of business and we feel like that's within a deviation certainly going to be closed to right around where it was last year if not slightly better on a core basis. And then, the projects are coming out of the shippable backlog from that shipment timing.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got you. Alright. Thanks John.","Randy Hogan","Alright.

I'm Jim Lucas, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. And with me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Borin, our Chief Financial Officer.","On today's call, we will provide details on our second quarter 2018 performance as well as our third quarter and full-year 2018 outlook as outlined in this morning's press release.","Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-Q, Form 10-K and today's press release.

Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you, Jim. And good morning to everyone. Please turn to slide number 4 titled Executive Summary. Overall, we are pleased with our second quarter performance, which marks the first quarter we have reported since completing the separation of nVent.","Despite a slow start to the quarter, we reported core sales growth of 3%, ROS expansion of 90 basis points to 21%, adjusted EPS grew 18% to $0.71 and we generated $364 million of free cash flow. Also in the quarter, we took some of our cash flow and bought back $150 million worth of stock or about 3.3 million shares.","For the full year we have maintained our core sales growth expectation of 3% to 4%, we are still expecting ROS expansion of approximately 50 basis points to 18% and we are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $2.31, reflecting the benefit of purchased shares as well as slightly better operating performance, offset by slightly worse FX impact.","With half of the year now behind us, we feel more confident in our ability to deliver earnings that should be above the high-end of the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss the second quarter results and update you on the details of our full-year 2018 outlook.","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","Thank you, John. Please turn to slide 5 labeled Q2 '18 Pentair Performance. As John mentioned, core sales grew 3%, with Aquatic Systems and Flow Technologies delivering growth and Filtration Solutions declining modestly. We will provide more color on the performance of all three segments shortly.","Segment income increased 8%, while ROS expanded 90 basis points to 21%. Adjusted EPS grew 18% to $0.71 per share while our adjusted tax rate remained 18% and our share count came in at 178.6 million shares, benefiting in part from the $150 million in shares we repurchased during the quarter. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter at $364 million, which was in line with normal seasonal patterns.","Please turn to slide 6 labeled Q2 '18 Pentair Segment Performance. This slide lays out the performance of our three segments with trends somewhat similar to what we saw in the first quarter. Aquatic Systems delivered robust 10% core sales growth in the quarter and income grew 7%, while ROS contracted 50 basis points. ROS was negatively impacted in the quarter by growth investments and inflation as the business elected not to implement any off-cycle price increases. We continue to have a favorable outlook for Aquatics and believe the business is well positioned entering the second half of the year.","Filtration Solutions saw core sales decline 2% as strength in our North American residential and commercial businesses was offset by declines in our industrial and biogas product lines in the food and beverage business. Segment income for Filtration grew 7% and ROS expanded an impressive 140 basis points to 20%. This is due in part to the business mixing up as we continued to move away from lower margin project business and further remove complexity from the segment.","Flow Technologies had 2% core sales growth, segment income growth of 10% and ROS expanded 130 basis points to 18.4%. North America remains strong, driven by improvement in our commercial pump business. We saw continued strength in our specialty business. And similar to Filtration Solutions, we saw improvement as we exited or walked away from lower margin business.","Please turn to slide 7 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. This is one of our favorite slides this quarter as free cash flow was a very positive story. And the balance sheet has further improved as we reduced our debt levels with the cash received as part of the nVent spinoff. In fact, our debt is now at a level not seen since 2010.","Considering our free cash flow generation expected for the remainder of the year and our current debt levels, we believe we are well-positioned to invest in the business, look at attractive strategically aligned tuck-in or bolt-on acquisition targets and continue to return cash to shareholders. We have bought back $300 million in shares year-to-date, and we would remind everyone that we have raised our dividend for 42 consecutive years.","Please turn to slide 8 labeled Q3 '18 Pentair Outlook. We anticipate third quarter core sales to grow 4% to 5% in Aquatic Systems up 8% to 9%, Filtration Solutions up 1% to 3% and Flow Technologies growing 2% to 3%.","Segment income is anticipated to be flat while ROS is expected to decline roughly 50 basis points. This is due principally to higher inflation, including the impact of tariffs and the timing of price increases we are implementing in the third quarter but we do not expect to fully read out until the fourth quarter.","Below the line, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be around 18%, net interest and other expense to be approximately $8.5 million, and our share count should be around 177 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $0.52 per share.","Please turn to slide 9 labeled Second Half 2018 Adjusted EPS Outlook. As mentioned on the previous slide, we are seeing increased inflation across the portfolio. And as a result, we are implementing price increases in all three segments during the third quarter. We have announced the price increases and we are currently implementing them, but we do not expect to see the full benefit of the increases until the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect to see more pressure on third quarter margins but benefits in the fourth quarter. In addition, second half earnings are expected to benefit from the shares we bought back in the second quarter. While there is some anticipated shift in earnings from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, we are still raising our outlook for the full-year.","Please turn to slide 10 labeled 2018 Pentair Outlook. This slide is one we first introduced at our Investor Day in February, and we wanted to provide an update at the halfway point of the year. The overall sales number is in line with our initial forecast for the year while segment income has moved up but the walk to get to each of these numbers has changed. We continue to look for core sales growth of 3% to 4% for the year with price being a little more favorable. FX has gone from appearing to be a nice tailwind to being modestly positive for the year. The right hand section of this slide has seen a significant increase in our outlook for inflation and we are now looking at $20 million of incremental growth investments, which is down from our initial target of $25 million. We are not dialing back the investments but the timing of some of the investments for this year were slower in the first half and we wanted to update our full-year forecast to reflect this revised timing.","Please turn to slide 11 labeled Full Year 2018 Pentair Outlook. As previously mentioned, our full-year core sales growth outlook remains 3% to 4%. We expect Aquatic Systems core sales to grow 8% to 9%, Filtration Solutions to be flat to up 1% and Flow Technologies to increase 2% to 3%.","Segment income is expected to be up around 8% while ROS is expected to end the year around 18% which would represent an increase of roughly 50 basis points. Below the line we expect a full-year adjusted tax rate to be around 18%, adjusted net interest and other expense to be roughly $33 million and shares to be around 178.5 million. For the full-year we now expect adjusted EPS to be around $2.31 per share and we continue to target free cash flow to approximate 100% of adjusted net income.","I would like to turn the call back to John.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you, Mark. Please turn to slide number 12 titled Pentair Strategy Summary. This page is the same slide we showed you at our Investor Day and in the first quarter earnings discussion. The good news is nothing has changed. And all I'd like to do is remind you that we are focused on our desire to be a pure play water company, drive focused organic growth strategies and utilize our precious capital wisely to create incremental shareowner value.","Regarding capital allocation, we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating, reinvesting in our most attractive core businesses and paying a competitive dividend yield. We will also look at a balanced approach between M&A and intelligent buybacks with our M&A decisions being informed by overall valuations and the quality of assets available, as well as our ability to integrate them successfully.","Please turn to slide 13 labeled Focused Strategies. As we prioritize our growth opportunities, we believe this allows us the best opportunity to drive differentiated growth in what we believe is a very attractive water quality space. I'd like to give you a quick update on our progress regarding two of our most important focused strategies.","The first strategy is advancing pool growth. During the second quarter, we launched a segmentation study to better understand the behaviors of pool consumers. We believe we made great progress in winning more dealers to allow for greater aftermarket penetration and we completed an in-depth study of how to accelerate our efforts in the expanding automation space and better penetrate the automated home platforms. Also during the quarter, we launched our next generation of automation called IntelliConnect.","Our second key growth initiative is accelerating residential and commercial water treatment. In the second quarter, we kicked off a consumer segmentation study here as well to better understand the residential water needs of our end-consumers and made great progress driving dealer loyalty back to Pentair through our True Blue dealer initiative. We also have included our strategic roadmap of innovative product offerings and how to expand our service offerings in both residential and commercial water treatment. More to come in these two areas, both on the organic priorities and potential acquisitions as we continue to dial-in our clear priorities to differentiate ourselves to customers.","I would now like to turn the call over Lee Wei for Q&A, after which I'll have a few closing remarks. Lee Wei, please open the line for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you so much. And excuse me presenters, so we have our first question, comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO. Your line is now open.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Hey, Scott. How are you doing?","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, John. Good morning. Hey, Jim. So, I just really \u2013 I apologize for jumping on a couple minutes late, so I missed the early. I just want to maybe ask you a broader question. I know you've talked about and I heard you at the end here say two to three years of movement toward more of a sales model involving reaching deeper and this kind of thing. I was just wondering if you can kind of give us some gates on that, John, sort of like when do you expect to be where type thing. By the end of this year with your channel partners, what do you expect to have accomplished, by the end of next year, that kind of thing? Because obviously, there's a big opportunity here to connect more closely with customers than you have before, I know that that's what you want to do. And I'm just kind of hoping you can kind of give us how this lays out, maybe if you have any type of benchmarks, any type of metrics that you use internally to measure yourselves on this end of this year, end of next year kind of thing?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","All right. Thanks, Scott. Yeah. I mean, I just want to remind everybody we're 85 days in and I think the best way to express it is we're where we thought we'd be at this stage. I think we're really excited about our strategy. But more importantly, our commercial excellence process that we've rolled out and really utilizing the commercial excellence process to drive our prioritized growth. And so, as an example, making sure that we understand that we serve a traditional dealer channel, distribution and dealers, but we also have to influence the consumer. And so, this consumer segmentation work that we're doing is to inform us of what are the buying behaviors of the consumers that we service and how do they want to be served and then, helping our dealers run their businesses better so that they can take advantage of what those consumers want.","I think in the pool business where we do roughly $900 million of revenue in pool and we have about $800 million of that in the U.S., we have a lot of scale, and we have a good offering, and we have a really good business model. We have to go through our next sets of businesses which for us would be our residential and commercial water filtration, which is just under $600 million and then, also our residential pump business which is just under $400 million and we have to have that same model, Scott.","So I have high expectations for the team, clearly, but to answer your metric question, it's going to be accelerated organic growth and that's the one measurement we're trying to drive here and then, making sure that's profitable, and we're getting the same drop-throughs. So we've got other metrics. How are we doing on dealer conversions, how are we doing on turning leads into sales. The earlier indications suggest we're becoming more of a growth culture. But again, I just want to be balanced here, it's 85 days in. So it's hard to call victory on it, but I love the attitude. I love the way the team leaned in, and I am really appreciative of how they're doing it.","The other thing I would tell you, Scott, is as we move to a growth culture, I was proud that the team worked the price angles the way they are. I mean, we saw some of our competition going off-cycle with price increases. We considered that. But we also thought that it would be better if we were to wait, reflect, and go on our normal cycles so that our dealers and our customers can prepare for those price increases, quote their jobs and not have to suffer the consequences of us going off-cycle. So it is hurting us here a little bit in Q3, but I'd say the long haul we think that that's going to help us out in Q4 and into next year and our customer is very appreciative of the way we responded with our price increases.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Right. And as just my quick follow up to that, one of the things that you and I talked about recently was that there's going to be a cost to this and I \u2013 certainly it's a welcome cost to get more sustainable organic on a go-forward basis, particularly given your markets are pretty positive. I guess my simple question is and I heard you say this, you want to keep the same drop-through. That's obviously a key point. So are you out there internally kind of telling the business units, hey, this is kind of if you want to spend this, you have to fund it with that? Or is that more of a corporate kind of funding?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. I think the funding that we're working on is the focused priorities and the two that I took you through. And most of that is more what I call enterprise funding, meaning we all know what we're spending the money on and we have ability to measure it.","We're willing to do some slightly lower margin revenue. I don't think we want to just be margin focused. But at the same time, we want to make sure that as we grow our revenue, we're not adding complexity and we're making sure that that growth leads to shareowner value. And that's critical to us. I mean, we are a public company. We're here for the benefit of share owners, and we have to serve our customers in a way that's good for all.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Thank you, John.","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Thank you so much. And your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is now open.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Morning, guys.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Hey, Joe. Good morning.","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","Morning.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, John. Maybe if you could take us through some of the more obvious like immediately accretive things that you've done to kind of drive margins in business and like particularly Flow, like margins there look pretty good considering where the growth was. So, what are some of the things that you were able to put through very quickly that are seeing like kind of early results?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. I'll hit it quickly and then Mark can chime in as well, but in Filtration it's about mix. As you know, we've had some really interesting businesses and we still have those interesting businesses, and we love the technology of those businesses. But we're a lot more focused on where we actually make money and where we should be spending our time and energy. And I think you're seeing that in the benefit there.","In Flow, to Flow's credit and I really appreciate all the hard work by the team. We've introduced the optimization effort, getting out of some product lines and getting out of some geographies that were not only not making money, but constraining resources and challenging the resources of the SBU.","So by being focused on these core businesses, we've actually been able to really improve the mix in both of those two businesses. And I think you're seeing that in the margin expansion in the quarter.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","And is there anything that you'd call out kind of between the 3Q and 4Q split? I mean, generally, I think those quarters for you are fairly similar in terms of margin and it looks like maybe a bit more of an acceleration into 4Q. Is it just timing of initiatives that you're putting through? Or is there anything more specific you'd call out there?","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","Yeah. Really the key driver of the Q4 ramp is that's when price kicks in. So price comes in at the back half of the end of Q3 and then we see it fully implemented in Q4.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","So we've publicly announced our price increases here in the last week. Those go effective mid-September-ish. For most of our businesses, that's a normal cycle by the way. And that is what Mark said, we're not getting the benefit in Q3 but we expect to receive that benefit and then some in Q4.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","And then just last for me on the Aquatic side, I mean there was obviously some fear in the market given some comments made earlier by like POOLCORP. It seems like you're \u2013 not just the numbers that you put up but the guide, it seems like you've gotten through that. Does the channel seem pretty clear? And I know POOLCORP comments for the second half seem pretty robust. Like curious as to like what your view on the channel is there? And any maybe update on some of the newer technologies in that business on the automation side and how that's progressing there?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. So yeah, we just had a slow start in April. I mean weather was not as we hoped it would be. And I think the team did a really good job responding and making sure we got all the shipments and all the demand serviced in the back half of the quarter.","The outlook for pool is very, very strong. And I think we're reflecting that in our current guidance and demand continues to be almost full up in that business and things are progressing nicely.","As far as the new products, yeah, we got a couple really good products that we're launching. We launched a new hybrid heater and we have another version of a heater that's got a high efficiency rating. So those are two products that we've been working on for some period of time.","And we're really excited by IntelliConnect, which is a lower price point. And the purpose of that is to really make sure that automation gets more penetrated across pools. The penetration rate for automation across all the 5 million pools is less than 10% right now. And we really think by raising that penetration rate gives us the ability to really upgrade our products and capabilities.","What's really cool about IntelliConnect is it connects to all of the other Pentair products in Filtration and pump and Flow, which gives you the ability to control those devices. But also, and I think this is the real breakthrough, it connects to all of the products in the industry if Pentair makes it or doesn't make it within pool.","And we do think that that is what's necessary to really increase that penetration rate. And then it also gives us the ability to connect with the consumer and begin to think about their experiences with Pentair versus maybe their experiences with some of our competitors in the industry today. So we're very excited by that.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys.","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you so much. And your next question comes from the line of Mr. Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Good, how about you?","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","Morning.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","On Filtration Solutions, what was the weakness in industrial? Can you give some color on that, the projects you said were down?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah, food and beverage. It's in the sustainable gas area where there's a merger that's taking place. It's not yet completed and those investments have substantially stalled. And it's also on the food and beverage space regarding beer and the de-investment in some of the global breweries that are out there. That's the weakness.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just more specifically. I'm not sure, I might have missed this. But what is now kind of the guidance on price\/cost for the year?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Meaning?","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Price\/cost like material inflation versus pricing?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yes. So it's in the slide, Steve, I'll point it out to you. So full-year, we're getting $0.19 of price and our inflation is $0.35. It's on slide 9.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","And about two-thirds related to material and about a third of that being related to \u2013 no, I'm sorry what is it? A third to two-thirds?","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","Two-thirds of it is material and a third of it is labor.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And as far as the timing of these price increases, I mean, have you already kind of gone out with some of these early in the third quarter here or is it more kind of back-end loaded?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","I shared that too Steve. We went out with everything (00:24:03) so far, but they're not effective until mid-September, and that's why we're...","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","... getting (00:24:08) slightly in Q3 and then, we expect to have more of a benefit in Q4 related to those price increases.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Real quick, Steve. I shared this \u2013 I think it was important that we \u2013 we listen to the channel. We listen to our customers. And our customers were asking for non-off-cycle because they're out there with quotes, especially in the pool industry, you're quoting six to nine months ahead of time. We just didn't feel it was right for them to absorb that price without having a heads up that it was coming. So we feel that this is giving 60 days' notice. Is what's appreciated by the channel, and I'm proud of the team for bringing that forward and for us exercising these price increases in a way that everybody can get behind.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I mean, is your competition not putting price through like \u2013 I mean, in HVAC, they didn't really seem to have that kind of problem of conditioning the channel. They went with kind of a mid-season \u2013 unusual mid-season price increase. Is there something going on in the industry that kind of drove that kind of behavior? I mean, it's just a little unusual to kind of ask your customers and then oblige when they say that they don't want a price increase.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. I mean, they didn't say they didn't. The issue is, I mean, it's any job that was quoted \u2013 and I do know the industry you're referring to, that's more of a break and fix and other than the new construction jobs that they're working. But if you're installing a pool for instance and you quoted a customer, those price increases coughing (00:25:41) off-cycle are coming completely out of your pocket. You're not passing that along. If you have the ability to know that price increase is coming and even those significant price increases we're going forward with, you at least have the ability to know how to quote your next set of jobs and you're not losing on the job you originally have. So I don't know about the HVAC industry. We're not in it but for our industries we think we did it the appropriate way.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So, just a different industry dynamic. All right. No problem. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you so much. And your next question comes from the line of Mr. Deane Dray from RBC. Your line is now open.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Good morning.","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","Good morning.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, I'd like to start with Mark and get some perspective on the free cash flow this quarter which was significantly above expectations. I think part of it, the explanation is both we should be looking at this as a first half as opposed to a second quarter. And aren't we also now seeing the Pentair as a water pure play in the pool sort of the build of inventory in the first quarter and then that gets \u2013 comes through in the second quarter. I just want to make sure that's \u2013 we're just seeing the seasonality to this and is it a first half comparison is more appropriate. Thanks.","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","Sure. That's right. You kind of answered the question there. A couple things, one what we're seeing now is Pentair on its own with nVent in discontinued operations. And that includes the cash associated with the separation in discontinued operations. So what you see in our numbers is the continuing operations which is really reflective of the ongoing business. And as you said, the pool business really has that big seasonal cash influx in the second quarter at the end of the second quarter. So, on a year-to-date basis, we're at about $160 million. And then we see \u2013 to get to the 100% of net income which is about $410 million, that will be a little bit more ratable in the back half. Think of it as $125-ish million per quarter to round out the year. But yes, felt very good about \u2013 with the cash that came in in the quarter and where we are on a year-to-date basis.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then just shifting back to the price increase and price\/cost, just a couple clarifications. The first being wouldn't it make \u2013 first of all, I get why you're not \u2013 you didn't put the \u2013 go off cycle with pricing, and that makes sense to us. But the idea here is wouldn't you maybe get some pull forward as you had some dealers doing some pre-buy ahead of the price increase and wouldn't that benefit the tail end or benefit third quarter more? So, that question and then what's the impact of tariffs and how have you calibrated that?","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","Sure. So, maybe first just on the timing of the price increase. So, as John referenced, we announced it last week effective middle of September. And to clarify, the normal cycle of price increases is mid-September for the pool business. The other businesses are typically the beginning of the year. So, in fact, the timing of the increase in the Flow and Filtration side was accelerated for the very reasons that we talked about. And so, as we said, that will start to pick up at the end of September and then be fully in our Q4 numbers.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Tariffs?","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","Oh, and tariffs \u2013 sorry. Thank you. Tariffs are included in our number. And frankly, the reason why we're not breaking those out separately is we really think of tariffs as just a form of inflation. And when you look at the direct impact, that's not really the most significant piece. What we're really looking at is the indirect and the indirect-indirect, so trying to make assumptions around what do we think is going to be passed through to us, and really what are other suppliers that may not be impacted by China, how are they going to use that as an opportunity potentially to raise price to us.","So, we factored all of that into our inflation assumptions for the back half of the year and for next year as we think about the price increase that we put in place here now. And we're going to stay agile and continue to look at things as they develop. And as I said, because this was off cycle in Flow and Filtration, if we need to re-evaluate further, we certainly have the ability to do that.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then last question is we had the opportunity a couple weeks ago to meet with Pentair at Singapore Water Week and then in Shanghai to see your big commercial beverage customer. And just reflecting what your opportunities are in China and Asia-Pacific., John, under focused strategies, it looks like maybe it didn't fit on the page, but there was a third priority earlier in your outlook that talked about the China opportunity in Asia-Pacific broadly. So, if you can just bring us up to date on that. Appreciate it.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. Still a very important priority, it's more longer term. As you know, Deane, it's $160 million in China, Southeast Asia today, and we think it can grow at a very significant rate. And as you probably saw and I really appreciated you spending the time out there, we got to control our own destiny, especially around the Internet and the fact that we have to think of MSRP or list price and then work back off of that and really understand Tmall and JD.com and make sure that we've got our capabilities and we're controlling our own destinies around that.","So, in the near term, I would expect a little bit of disruption as we start to manage a lot of that product descriptions and how we want to demonstrate our products in the marketplace and control the consumer and the customer experience. But in the long run, we're very excited about our growth opportunities there and really are excited about the market and our ability to serve it. We do have the right products, I think we're well-positioned, especially around food service and I'm really proud of the way the team is leaning in and driving those results. Thanks for bringing that up.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you so much, Mr. Dray. Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Steven Winoker from UBS. Your line is now open.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks and good morning. And John, congrats on the first quarter as a standalone. That's great.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you, Steve. A lot of work went into it as you know.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","I do. I do. I just want to first hit on the capital deployment comment that you made in light of debt levels also coming down fairly quickly here. As you look at those priorities at this point and we look at the share repo et cetera, is that \u2013 should there be an expectation in the investment community that given the pipeline and given where you are in sort of building the standalone right now, that the repurchase could accelerate even further?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","No, Steve. I think first of all, we did. We did buyback some stock and I think we want to be agile with our capital allocation strategy. And if we see an opportunity or we feel that we're not \u2013 the value we think we could drive is not properly reflected the market. I think we're going to use our capital in that way. At the same time, I do think we have the ability to really build some great businesses here and we want to continue to build out those funnels and those pipelines of opportunities. And as those opportunities become more and more realistic, we want to be able to act upon them and then integrate them in a way that the shareowner benefits significantly from.","So we're active. We're looking. We're encouraged by the direction of the funnel right now and the potential discussions that didn't seem likely six months ago and now we're starting to see more discussions happen as I think some of these owners of these properties looking forward and it might not feel as robust to them on a look-forward basis as it did just three months ago before there was maybe global supply chain challenges, to use a fancy word there. But I think the opportunity in front of us, Steve, is great. And I want to be flexible with our capital and use it in the shareowners' best interest.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Well, I was going to ask about Aquatics but given that answer, if you look at Filtration and Flow Control versus Aquatics on the M&A pipeline that's out there and given the levels of consolidation globally and all of that, I mean, should we expect activity on the Filtration side more, the Flow or how are you thinking about that?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","I think we should look at it as water filtration is our second biggest business next to pool and it's a business that's definitely worth investing in. I think some of the themes about getting closer to our consumer, meaning how do we connect through automation and how do we maybe connect through the services realm are a couple themes that we would think are likely to occur as we build out the M&A pipeline, Steve.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And just one other question or clarification maybe for Mark is on that tariff answer that you gave, does that mean in the pricing increases that you've already taken that you are contemplating sort of the 301 tariffs but nothing further at this point? Because it was a little unclear to me sort of which part of the tariffs you were already kind of baked in that the current price announcement that you've talked about cover, versus some of the ones that are maybe, I don't want to use the word \u2013 that are still uncertain that are out there?","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","Yeah. So our price and our view of inflation overall is reflective of all of the tariff information that's currently out there, whether it's actually enacted or not. And frankly, the second or the third round or the most recent round that was announced a few weeks ago has very little impact to us. But we did take a look at that and feel that we have that covered, but again, very small dollars.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Steve, at some point, we'll be having tariffs on all of everything that we get out of China, right, there's very little left to tariff for.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Very helpful, guys. Good luck. Thanks.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you so much. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just had one, most of mine have actually been covered. But on the guidance specifically, Mark, here, you're moving around the sales growth outlook for Aquatics and Filtration quite a bit here. And then you're also coming off a quarter where ROS beat by a pretty healthy margin.","So wondering why there's no change here to the full-year ROS views across the board and by segment? And I guess curious, is that some conservatism for the back half given some moving pieces around price\/cost and mix, but particularly for Aquatics given the better growth expectation here, was wondering how you're thinking about the ROS targets here through the back half of the year? Thanks.","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","Yeah. Sure. As I said in my remarks, the numbers themselves are pretty similar but the way we get to the numbers are quite a bit different. So it is some of the things that you mentioned.","As we talked about Q3 with inflation kicking in and the impact of tariffs coming in, but price not yet being there. That's really the biggest driver of why, as you look at margins across the three businesses and overall, why they tend to not be expanding as much as you might otherwise think. And then we see that ramp and improve a little bit in Q4.","And we're continuing to invest, so I talked about the fact that in the first half, the timing and the pace of our growth investment was a little bit lower than what we had originally planned. But we're still very committed to investing for growth. And in the back half of the year, we were maintaining the growth investments in those key parts of the business that we think we have the biggest opportunities.","Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks a lot. That's all I had.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you.","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you so much, Mr. Lee. And your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Morning, everyone.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Morning.","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","Good morning.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","John, you talked a little bit about exiting some low-margin revenue, I think, particularly in Filtration at the moment, but you've also talked about opportunities to do that in Flow. Can you guys comment just a little bit on what potentially the drag to your core sales growth numbers for fiscal 2018 are from voluntary exit of some of this revenue so we can get maybe a little bit of a better idea of what core sales growth really is?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. That's all \u2013 just to be clear, all of that is being handled in the divestiture, right, so it's about...","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","About a point.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","About a point. About just shy of $40 million for the year.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So those \u2013 the Filtration targets of 0% to 1% and Flow 2% to 3% are actually independent of those exited product lines?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","That is correct.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Productivity goal for the year, I think is about $28 million. I know you guys had been disappointed in 2017 with productivity, though I think a lot of that resided in nVent. Is that a number that you can see accelerating as we go through 2019? Is it a number you're happy with? You think that can be improved? Or just any color you can give us on future productivity expectations?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Sure. One thing I'd remind you is that the productivity that's reflected, it's on page 10 of the presentation. That doesn't include the $20 million of growth investment, so it's really something closer to $50 million.","But that said, we certainly think that there remains opportunities to get after further productivity. And as we've talked about before, that $20 million will then be embedded in the underlying numbers of the business. So it'll still be there for continued investment in the future but it won't be a year-over-year headwind.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Are there specific initiatives that you're looking at at the moment to improve productivity?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah, I mean, I think we're \u2013 and just to remind you, I mean, productivity is also \u2013 and think about OCOGS, right, or manufacturing efficiency. We've got higher freight cost going through which we're working on those elements as well. And I think that we feel that we have a path to accelerate our organic growth and we're going to get that leverage on top of the existing facilities.","But if you look longer term, I mean automation is a theme, more intelligent factories is a theme, I mean we've got a lot of things we're working on, Nathan. But as far as large cost out initiatives or incremental restructuring, we'd like to say that that's generally behind us.","Nathan Hardie Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you so much. And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital. You may now ask your question.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Thanks, guys.","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","Good morning.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just to be clear on the investment. So I think you were saying $25 million and now you're saying $20 million? So, it's pretty de minimis what the deferral is?","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","That's correct. Yeah.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on Filtration. I know you cited the industrial project weakness but it just seems like in a pretty good global demand environment, growth still seems to be problematic, anemic. So, what do you need to see to kind of start to see better growth within that business?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. So, just to be clear, we have an industrial filtration business within Filtration Solutions as well. And that's doing really well, obviously with the recovery of oil and gas and a lot of the global manufacturing. It's specifically the piece exposed to the food and beverage which is beer, Jeff, and also our sustainable gas offerings that also go into that industry via a couple gas management companies that are in the process of a merger.","So, that's where we're really seeing that headwind. And yeah, what do we need? We need to make sure that the residential and commercial portfolio, which is done well, continues to become a higher percentage of the revenue. It continues to grow at a rate greater than it's currently growing today. So, it's the focus within the portfolio and I think the focus is help margins. You're not yet seeing that on the core growth in Filtration. We understand that and we got to get that going.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And anything in food and beverage that would indicate that starts to get better or are these gas management companies indicating that they would be picking back up into 2019?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Only in the sense that if you think about where those projects are in the whole scheme of things, you're looking at about $30 million, $40 million right now, right? So, as a percentage of the overall portfolio it's come down substantially. But it's not necessarily \u2013 I mean you take the worst case scenario of that and you'll see it's not that much of a headwind going forward.","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","So, the headwinds that we saw on the first half of the year we don't anticipate continuing in the back half of the year mainly because of the comps and because as John said, the business has shrunk to a point that it's a lot smaller, so.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just back on Aquatic I don't know if I missed this, did you see any pre-buy impact or just maybe talk about sell-in versus sell-through?","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","No, no change in the normal buying habits and process. No increase in any kind of early buy or timing of orders. So, a pretty normal process in the sell-through, sell-through was strong.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you so much, Mr. Hammond. And your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Ronnie Weiss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. This is Ronnie Weiss on for Julian. Good morning.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Hey, Ronnie. Good morning.","Ronnie Weiss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I know you don't want to get into 2019 guidance yet, but back on the growth initiatives but...","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Definitely not.","Ronnie Weiss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","...back on the growth initiatives, as I think about them being pushed out, should we think about these growth initiatives being a multiyear initiative? And given the volume is a little lighter than initially expected, could we see acceleration into that into next year or 2018 is the peak of what you guys are going to be putting into that?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","No. I mean, we set out to spend around $25 million and we knew that it would be tough to spend it all wisely given the fact that we ratably didn't get there in Q1. So, what we're doing is really reflecting where we think the full-year spend will likely be. We're running these ideas and we're a lean company which is a process rich, but we also want to be a growth culture which is much more innovative. But innovative ideas still have to run through a standard process and you have to test these ideas and we're doing that and to \u2013 before we launch a brand new product for instance, we'd like to have consumer feedback on it. That takes time. And so, we're gathering that consumer information and deciding if consumers actually want what we think they want. And once we have that, we move on to the next phase and move on to the next phase.","So, yeah, do we expect to ramp this a little bit next year? Probably, as far as investment. But as Mark said, we've ramped $20 million incremental this year. If you put it on a scale next year, maybe it's $5-ish million incremental, maybe it's $10 million. So, you're still going to have a ratable impact that's positive next year as part of the year-over-year investment there. So, I'm not worried about it.","Ronnie Weiss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood. And then, you guys mentioned some mix benefit for Filtration. I'm just wondering if you could quantify how much of a margin uplift that was for the quarter and kind of how much it should be for the year.","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","Yeah. Benefit is on the income side about a point, point and a half.","Ronnie Weiss - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you so much. And your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair. Your line is now open.","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered but I just wanted to get clarification on the pricing. I know there has been a lot of questions on pricing. But in terms of the three business segments, which price increases are going through on cycle versus off cycle, and when is the normal cycle for those price increases to go through? I know, Mark, you mentioned some were accelerated. Can you just clarify that?","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","Sure. And so, the Aquatic Systems business is \u2013 always follows the pool season, which is September to September. So, those price increases are normally in the September timeframe. It's the other two businesses that for the most part within the business the normal timeframe would be the beginning of the year. So, early January would be the normal timeframe. So, those two with the announcement here in July with an effective target of mid-September have been accelerated.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","And just to clarify my point there, we're hopeful we're going forward with one, that reflects what we need in 2019 as well, and we're doing that in mid-September, as Mark said. And so, that's hopeful that this stays as the pricing necessary and that those businesses can get on with that expectation in their forecast and our customers can react to that in the appropriate way.","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just a last quick one is on slide 7, 2018 forecast D&A of $183 million. I think I just need to think about this more, but $21 million in D&A in the second quarter. How do we get to $183 million for the year? I assume that has to do everything with the split but...?","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","I'd say good catch. Wrong number. We'll update it. It's $90-ish million for the full year.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. Yeah.","Mark C. Borin - Pentair Plc","Yes.","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you so much. And your last question comes from the line of Walter Liptak from Seaport Global. Your line is now open.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask \u2013 we've talked a lot about Aquatics but I wanted to ask about market share gains. It sounds like with a more focused strategy that you may be gaining market share. This 9.5% growth is pretty good. I wonder if you could help us understand what was market growth, what was market share gains.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","I mean, we're estimating that we call it incremental penetration or differentiated growth is probably somewhere around 1.5 to 2 points and the rest would reflect the general volume and the price that we're getting.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Good. Right. And so there was some price in there. Can you split that out volume versus price?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","I think it was \u2013 oh we don't do that. No, just price is just about under a point.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then in the restructuring charges, it looks like you're done with the charges now year-to-date. And I wonder if you can help us to understand what the restructuring charges were for. Is that part of the productivity benefits that you're already receiving or is that going to show up in the back half? You talked a little bit about productivity already, I wonder if this is part of that productivity that you're talking about?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Sure. The restructuring is really the \u2013 it's the end of the program that we started last year and into this year associated with the separation of the businesses and optimizing the portfolio as we were standing up the standalone water business. A lot of that relates to some of the business exits and the product line exits that we've talked about. So those are underway and certainly, we would expect we'll drive further productivity as we move into 2019.","Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you so much, ladies and gentlemen. Presenters, there are no further questions at this time. You may continue.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you. So thank you for joining us today, and I hope you agree that we delivered a solid second quarter, and we're demonstrating our ability to use agility and prioritization to meet our commitments. By building up a track record of meeting and exceeding commitments, we hope to earn the trust and right to pursue a compounding strategy that allows us to not only achieve core growth in earnings but to also utilize our strong cash flow and capital structure to pursue strategic, targeted and accretive acquisitions.

With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer.","On today's call, we will provide details on our first quarter 2013 performance as well as our second quarter and full year 2013 outlook, as outlined in this morning's release.","Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and today's release.","Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

In recognition that there are other calls this morning, we will target it to be done in 1 hour.[Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Randy. Randy?","Randall J. Hogan","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with our first quarter performance on Slide 3. This marks the second quarter for Pentair since we successfully closed our merger with Flow Control at the end of September last year. I want to note straightaway we're very pleased with the progress we've made on integration and the momentum we've been building.","Before I go through the first quarter results in detail, I want to note that we will be discussing our operating results on an adjusted basis to better address the core operating performance of our businesses and referring to 2012 on a pro forma adjusted basis to provide a more accurate apples-to-apples comparison that includes Flow Control in the results. You will find reconciliations of this for overall Pentair and the segments in the appendix at the end of the presentation.","With that, here are the numbers: First quarter revenue grew 1% on an organic basis but was flat as FX was a 1% headwind. Adjusted operating income grew 4%, while adjusted operating margins increased 40 basis points to 10.1%, as price and productivity once again more than offset inflation.","Adjusted EPS grew 7% year-over-year, coming in slightly higher than our expected range at $0.58. Free cash flow for the quarter was a usage of $29 million, in line with our seasonal timing. We believe we're on track to deliver full year free cash flow of greater than 1% of net income once again.","The top line and adjusted operating income were in line with our prior guidance. We made good progress in executing the action plans to deliver the $90 million in synergies we outlined in November, and John will discuss that we've now increased synergy expectations to $100 million for the full year. In addition, we completed $140 million in share repurchases, and we delivered a 25% tax rate in the first quarter. So overall, we are underway at flank speed.","Now let's turn to Slide 4 for our performance review on our largest segment, Water & Fluid Solutions.","Water & Fluid Solutions sales were up 5% on a core basis, and FX was a 1% headwind. As a reminder, Water & Fluid Solutions represents the legacy water segment for Pentair plus the Water & Environmental Systems, or WES, business from Flow Control. Overall, we saw strong volume and price growth, which more than offset the FX headwind.","The residential and commercial vertical, which represents roughly half of the segment, grew 10% in the quarter as the North American residential recovery continued. We saw double-digit gains in our aquatics business, which is hard for us to imagine here in Minneapolis, given we just got a foot of snow last week and more snow last night. Growth was very good given that Western Europe continues to be a challenge, particularly due to distributors maintaining lean inventory and levels -- lean inventory levels and minimal order activity through the start of the year.","In food and beverage, which accounts for nearly 1\/5 of Water & Fluid Solutions, sales grew 17% in the quarter, led by solid double-digit growth in agriculture and several beverage projects that were postponed at the end of 2012 shipped during the first quarter.","We won our second major beverage project that combines hygienic valves from our legacy Water & Fluid business and industrial valves from our new Valves & Controls business. This is another example of how we are starting to see some winds in combining the 2 portfolios.","We continue to look for strength in beverage based on our project backlog, and agriculture is well positioned entering the spring selling season.","Infrastructure, which is nearly 20% of Water & Fluid Solutions, was down 10% in the quarter as Europe continues to be miserable. On a positive note, our North American municipal backlog continues to grow, and bidding activity remained healthy.","The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Water & Fluid Solutions operating profits and margins. Water & Fluid Solutions adjusted operating margins improved 90 basis points to 10.6% on the benefits of productivity, price and mix. With the North American residential recovery gaining momentum, we saw a strong drop-through to the bottom line as we have realigned the cost structure in the last several years during the prolonged downturn in this important market. In addition, we made good progress with our repositioning actions, which should begin to read through.","In summary, Water & Fluid Solutions began 2013 strong. With the actions taken to embed PIMS in this segment and the tailwinds in North American residential and food and beverage, Water & Fluid Solutions is in a good position to continue its momentum on operating margin expansion in 2013.","Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a review of our Valves & Controls segment performance. This is the second quarter for Pentair's newest segment, Valves & Controls, and we're quite pleased with the progress we're making. We've been actively engaged with Valves & Controls leadership and are leveraging their deep knowledge of the business. We're tweaking the strategy to focus more clearly on profitable and sustainable growth, which was not always achieved in the past, since the business had growth rates through the cycle that exceeded the industry but margins that have been below industry peers.","To unlock the margin potential we see in Valves & Controls, we're taking a disciplined approach by driving PIMS combined with a simpler, more focused service-led organization. The commercial organization is renewing its focus on development of the MRO services business, as well as being more selective in pursuing large profitable projects.","Looking at first quarter results, we are encouraged that backlogs remains near record levels and shippable backlog grew 17% sequentially, setting us up nicely for low single-digit growth for the full year. Markets were choppy, reflecting the overall economic environment. The 4% top line decline is not reflective of the overall business trends. Oil and gas had a very difficult year-over-year comparison. And power is yet to begin shipping; it's now growing backlog. Plus, Asia has seen a slowdown in spending in process markets. Our book to bill was 1.1 at the end of the first quarter, portending a return to top line growth in the second quarter. We will discuss orders and backlog in further detail in just a moment.","The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Valves & Controls operating profits and margins. Valves & Controls operating margins were up 10 basis points to 10.1%, owing to price and productivity improvements. We've seen broad adoption of PIMS, particularly in the enterprise, and we've seen momentum building on integration synergies that should help drive further margin expansion.","We've deployed 8 senior operating leaders to help accelerate the deployment of Lean, and over 10,000 e-learning PIMS modules have been completed by over 4,000 Valves & Controls employees. In addition, over 1,000 Valves & Controls employees have participated in our PIMS growth tools training.","In summary, Valves & Controls first quarter saw a tough year-over-year comparison, but the fundamentals for this business remain intact and our integration and standardization efforts made good progress, particularly with regard to training on PIMS.","Now let's move to Slide 6 for a look at the orders and backlog for Valves & Controls. As you can see on Slide 6, the Valves & Controls backlog is broken down in 4 key industries, 3 of which fall into our energy vertical -- oil and gas, power and mining -- and one in our industrial vertical, which is the process business.","Backlog grew 1% to a near record $1.4 billion. Within oil and gas, backlog remains strong globally, despite a slight decline from record Q4 levels. Orders declined at a high single-digit rate due to project delays and a tough year-over-year comparison.","The Power business saw a high single-digit increase in orders, so we expect to see sales growth return in power in the second half.","Mining, one of the smallest pieces of Valves & Controls, saw a steep double-digit decline in orders following strong orders in the fourth quarter.  However, mining backlog remains at record levels, with projects scheduled to ship through the remainder of the year.","Finally, backlog within process saw a healthy increase, while orders remained flat year-over-year. Process has seen shipping delays in Asia, but the strong backlog points to top line growth as the year progresses.","We knew this business would have some quarter-to-quarter lumpiness, but we remain encouraged by the growing backlog, particularly the 17% growth in the shippable backlog from the first quarter to the second quarter. The organization has been simplified, the team has brought a new discipline to pursuing large projects, and we're very pleased with the adoption of PIMS throughout all of Valves & Controls.","Now let's move to Slide 7 for a review of Technical Solutions.","Technical Solutions comprises Pentair's legacy equipment protection business and Flow Control's thermal management business. Sales through the segment declined 3% for the quarter, led by a nearly 20% decrease in infrastructure, consisting largely of datacom, telecom and networking, which remain weak, particularly in Europe. Industrial declined 2% as inventory destocking continued for much of equipment protection customers. Energy was up 4% as thermal delivered strong product sales in the quarter.","The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Technical Solutions, operating profits and margins. Technical Solutions operating margins increased 230 basis points to 17%, owing to positive contributions from price, productivity and mix, which helped mitigate inflation headwinds in the quarter.","As we've seen in the past few quarters, Technical Solutions is growing its profitable business, while the lower margin infrastructure business is where the declines are occurring. While we expect the top line to remain pressured in Technical Solutions, we'd expect further margin improvement as mix remains favorable and standardization gains momentum.","Let's now turn to Slide 8 for an overall market trend update. Given the top line challenges that persist and the mix signs we're all seeing, we thought it would be very helpful to provide an update on trends on our 5 key verticals as we see them.","Looking around the verticals, Pentair remains well aligned to serve key global megatrends, and we expect to see growth as the year progresses. Within Energy, we still expect low single-digit growth for the full year. The first quarter saw a modest contraction as Valves & Controls faced a tough year-over-year comp. But our backlog provides visibility that growth [ph] accelerating in the second quarter and into the second half. In particular, power orders will continue to grow and should begin shipping in the second half. Industrial remains mixed globally, but we continue to expect modest growth for the full year.","We've seen daily orders rates improving within our Technical Solutions business, and again, backlog and Valves & Controls within the process markets points to an acceleration in the growth rate and the declines we saw in the first quarter.","Residential and commercial has finally evolved into a much improved story. While Europe has not shown signs of recovering, the North American residential market has clearly strengthened. This should contribute nicely to Water & Fluid Solutions margins this year, given the amount of cost we've taken out of this segment and the strong drop-through to the bottom line we should experience as the North American recovery continues.","For the year, we still expect mid to high single-digit growth in the residential and commercial vertical.","Infrastructure is the one vertical that we expect to be down for the full year, which is likely not a surprise given the current state of municipal financing around the globe. While we do not expect much improvement in the datacom, telecom and networking markets within Europe, we have started to see some hints of bidding activity on the water side. Within North America, our municipal backlog has shown strength in the last 5 quarters and bidding activity was strong in the first quarter. Overall, we'd expect the infrastructure to be down mid-single digits for the full year.","Food and beverage, which is our smallest vertical, continues to justify our unique focus. Agriculture has shown consistent high single digit to low double-digit growth for several years now, and we would expect ongoing gains to be made as we continue to invest in this space. On the beverage side of the business, we not only saw delayed projects from the fourth quarter shipped in the first quarter, but more important, backlog continues to grow. Overall, we expect high single-digit growth for food and beverage for the full year.","Now let's turn to Slide 9 for a summary of our first quarter. While markets remain mixed, we believe our diverse portfolio positions us well for the future. As we've highlighted on the previous slide, we're expecting growth to accelerate as the year progresses following a modest top line showing in the first quarter.","We're executing on our commitment in the first quarter, and the integration of Flow Control continues to gain momentum. We completed all of our planned repositioning actions, and standardization roadmaps are being developed and implemented throughout the organization. As we progress with the integration of Flow Control and gain more visibility, we are raising our 2013 synergy expectations to $100 million.","Our first quarter performance positions us to deliver on our 2013 commitments, which John will expand upon.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John L. Stauch","Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide #10, labeled Q2 2013 Pentair Outlook.","For Q2, we are initiating revenue guidance of up 3% to 4%. We expect the revenue contribution to remain mixed and, again, led by Water & Fluid, which should be up 5% to 7%. We continue to see high single-digit growth in our North American residential market, which represents approximately 20% of overall Pentair sales and nearly 45% of Water & Fluid sales.","Valves & Controls should turn modestly positive in the quarter as near record level backlog, 17% growth in shippable backlog versus Q1, and an easier comparison year-over-year produce revenue expectations of up 1% to 3% for the second quarter.","Technical Solutions is still expected to be down year-over-year, as mid-single-digit growth in Thermal Management is not enough to offset continued headwinds in equipment protection. Although average daily sales rates in orders in equipment protection are improving, we do not expect to cross over into year-over-year growth until the third quarter.","We're expecting operating income to grow 12% year-over-year and operating margins to expand greater than 100 basis points as standardization and synergy benefits continue to accelerate. Water & Fluid Solutions margins are expected to exceed 15.5%, further evidence of our success in driving PIMS and Lean throughout our businesses.","EPS is expected to be up around 17% to $0.88 to $0.91 per share with a tax rate of roughly 25%, interest of roughly $18.5 million and total weighted average shares around 205 million. Q2 is a seasonally strong cash flow quarter for Pentair, and we expect cash to exceed 125% of net income for the quarter.","Please turn to Slide #11 labeled Q1 to Q2 Seasonality. For those that have followed Pentair for some time, you know that our second quarter is seasonally our strongest quarter of the year. In the new Pentair, we're expecting the pattern to continue, with the difference being that we expect less of a fall-off in Q3 and Q4 with the inclusion of Valves & Controls and Thermal Management, which both have fairly strong back half as a standard rhythm. Our contribution from our global residential businesses is what drives this Q2 pattern, as the Q2 season is when our distributors and partners ramp up to serve the seasonal demand.","The top half of Slide 11 shows you how the normalized seasonality plays out. This would be for the pro forma 2011 and for pro forma 2012. In addition to that normalized pattern, we feel this year, we'll see an incremental bump due to an acceleration of the North American residential market, a larger shippable backlog in Valves & Controls, and specific projects within Water & Fluid infrastructure.","On the operating income side, we expect to experience a nice drop-through on incremental revenue, which is really leveraged in our factories and on our operating costs. The Q2 seasonal shipments are usually quite profitable, and volume through these factories should produce a rich mix of profit. In addition to the normalized profit opportunity, we expect a lower mix of profit on the incremental project shipped in Q2, but we also expect at least $15 million more in synergy and standardization benefit versus the first quarter as we continue to ramp up the repositioning savings in specific projects that are driving through the integration and standardization team that we have deployed.","So bottom line, we feel confident that our normalized pattern will continue, and we expect to see a very strong Q2 result.","Please turn to Slide #12 labeled Integration and Standardization update. For Q1, we exceeded our modest cost takeout goal. This was a big piece of us exceeding our EPS goal and was especially helpful due to the slight shortfall in Valves & Controls revenue. For the full year, we know that we must continue to overdrive the synergies and standardization benefits to help ensure that we could continue to absorb revenue softness if it happens again.","For the full year, we are updating our total integration and standardization benefit to at least $100 million for 2013. $80 million of this is coming from cost or repositioning actions that have already been taken, and $20 million of this is coming from expected Lean and sourcing benefits that are already in the pipeline. And actions are expected to read out throughout the second, third and fourth quarters.","We continue to fill the productivity pipeline and are getting great winds in sourcing projects -- our stock, castings and electronics on the direct side; and shipping, renegotiating product services and global energy treasure hunts on the indirect side, which have already yielded an expected savings of a $40 million annual run rate. Our Lean projects, especially in legacy Flow Control sites, are accelerating as well.","We have trained over 6,000 people and have built great momentum. A few of the examples are our strategy deployment, transformation planning and scorecards, which have helped build the robust Lean savings pipeline. In addition to these efforts, we're also driving Lean enterprise and standardization of ERP platforms, reduction of accounting entities, payroll centers, payable centers and receivable organizations, which are all intended to drive simplicity and a better customer and employee experience while driving significant savings throughout the organization. We have all of these projects and incremental hoppers [ph] and are in the process of creating a master plan for Pentair that will be the main fuel for 2014 and 2015 synergies.","Overall, we are very confident in our progress and believe that further upside will provide further contingency in the wake of uncertain overall global markets.","Please turn to Slide #13. For Q1, we delivered cash flow slightly ahead of forecast but with still a seasonal usage of $29 million. This was lower than historical usage levels in Q1 at Pentair, but we still feel we can improve on this and generate cash in every quarter of the year. With capital expenditures at 125% of depreciation, we're still investing heavily in the overall efficiency of our factories and systems and have to ensure that we continue to put creativity ahead of capital, especially in our new Flow Control businesses.","Total depreciation and amortization of $320 million, plus approximately $30 million of noncash stock compensation, provides a pretty nice cushion for net income to cash and one which we believe we could take advantage of as we start to significantly generate cash flow to pay off debt, accelerate buybacks, put the capital work in the form of acquisitions in our best-performing businesses.","We expect debt levels to remain around $2.6 billion, flat with year-end and we are anticipating having utilized or purchased $825 million of the approved $1.2 billion of buyback by the end of 2013.","Please turn to my last slide, Slide #14.","I will keep this pretty brief so we will have time for your specific questions. Even with some choppiness in some end markets, we're keeping our overall full year outlook consistent with our previous forecast. Sales, operating income, operating margins, net income and EPS are all the same. While some markets like industrial, municipal and energy give us some cause for concern, we have seen other markets like food and beverage, agriculture and North American residential show great signs of resiliency. We'll be evaluating our market outlooks and performance in Q2, and we'll update the full year, if necessary, after we conclude our seasonally important quarter.","With that, I will turn it back to Randy. Randy?","Randall J. Hogan","Thanks, John. And if could turn to Page 15. We'll go through a few of the things John just covered, just to wrap it up before questions. What I thought I'd say in closing is that the first quarter really does position us well to deliver on our 2013 commitments. The top line remains mixed. We have strong backlogs in energy and food and beverage, and we continue to see strengthening in the North American residential market.","As we stated earlier, the residential recovery brings with it strong drop through to the bottom line given the prolonged downturn we experienced, the process improvements we've made, and the amount of cost we've taken out of the business over the last 6 years.","Our integration and standardization efforts continue to build momentum. And we now expect $100 million in synergies versus our prior target of $90 million. We're pleased that the adoption PIMS throughout the Flow Control businesses, has exceeded our initial expectations and we're happy with the creation of the new Pentair.","With that, operator, we'll take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Graham from Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering. Last quarter, you gave us a really cool number. And what it was, was, that you said that by -- when you had reported at that time, you had identified 75% of the $90 million of synergies. And I was just kind of wondering if you can kind of give us a similar number updated for the first quarter on the $100 million.","John L. Stauch","Yes, I'd say that the $100 million is 100% identified, Scott.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. The other question was kind of simple. I know that you're seeing kind of a choppy energy market. I was wondering, could you tell us what your percent of sales, energy-wise -- and specifically, oil and gas is what I'm referring to -- is North America versus rest of world?","Randall J. Hogan","I don't have that right at my fingertips.","John L. Stauch","No, Scott, I don't know if I have that on top of my fingertips. Because I think there's a breakdown in 2 categories. And our Thermal business deal with a lot of what's going on in the oil sands, which would be up in Canada. And then our global Valves & Controls business is pretty spread across the entire globe, as far as oil and gas. I can certainly...","Randall J. Hogan","And equipment protection is skewed. The energy is skewed to the U.S.","John L. Stauch","But it's probably a good number to know, and we'll see if we can do that.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Well, I guess maybe more succinctly, are you sensing that the choppiness in the orders that you're seeing is more of a function of the North American markets or the rest of the world?","John L. Stauch","I mean, I think what we're seeing is, and it's probably the spread and certainly what's going on within the relative oil and gas, either Brent or West Texas, and then how that compares with what's going on in the oil sands. We're seeing a pause, if you will, in some of those large projects as that all plays out. But we still are seeing a healthy capacity expansion with oil and gas.","Randall J. Hogan","And I'd say it is skewed to a little more softness here. The Middle East, Southeast Asia, that remains strong. But again, we skew because of the legacy Pentair. We skew to more in the North America.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just -- so on synergies. So you raised the targets for 2013. You kept $230 million by 2015. It feels as though you've identified almost incremental savings rather than more of a pull-forward. Is there a reason to believe that it is a pull-forward rather than an incremental? Or maybe you can just touch on that.","John L. Stauch","I think we're very confident in what we can see through 2013. And obviously, the businesses probably have a number greater than what I shared with you. We believe and have always believed that there's opportunities to increase the $230 million. And right now, we're trying to close the gap on what we need for 2014 and ensure that we've got the $230 million and then we'd drive for upsides beyond the $230 million.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And just back on the Valves & Controls project work, just -- I know that's a business you guys were trying to get your hands around. Had you guys taken a look at the backlog that's existed within Valves & Controls? A lot of the pump players, well, on the pump side, who were selling into a lot of the same projects, particularly in the Middle East over the last couple of years, have experienced a lot of margin pressure that has kind of played out. But I believe that the Valves are really a leader in the sales cycle. I was curious, as you kind of look at the backlog on the Valves & Controls side, do you anticipate that you are going to be realizing some low-margin, lower margin than normal backlog within that business that might mask some improvements from operations that's kind of yet to bleed through. Can you touch on that, please?","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, on that subject, one of the things that we've done and I'm really impressed with the Valve leadership team that's come aboard, I mean, the legacy Valve leadership team. As we've focused on the strategy and simplified the organization, one of the things that, that team identified and we certainly supported, was more discipline around bidding projects with good margin. They had -- there was probably $25 million worth of sales we could have had in the quarter, but we didn't bid it because the margins weren't very good. So we think that over time that discipline is going to lead to a better margin in the backlog. There's a few projects in the backlog which have low margins that we know will read out. Some of them read out in the first quarter, maybe a couple read out in the second quarter. But we think that the team has really got their arms around it well and the disciplines are already improved.","John L. Stauch","So it's a metric -- just to follow up on what Randy said, it's a metric that we've scrubbed, we can basically measure. And it's one that we've actually asked the business to expect a lower outcome, as Randy mentioned, as we work through making sure we've got all the right cost initiatives in place.","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, it's not just about shares. It's about profitable growth, so that's the discipline that they have in place there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Halloran from Robert W. Baird.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So just on the Valves side. Could you talk about what the quoting and bidding activity looks like and then also maybe provide a full unit order number? I know you gave it by the 4 pieces, but I'm also curious if you could give the overall one.","John L. Stauch","Yes, I mean, overall orders in Valves & Controls, were up about 3% sequentially versus Q4, so that's a metric that we're keeping our eyes on how we're doing as we kind of look through the quarters there.","Randall J. Hogan","And the book to bill we gave, the 1.1, was overall.","John L. Stauch","And you know for us in the quarter, the overall trade orders are right around $600 million overall.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. But the quoting and bidding activity side of things, how does that look and what are the customers seeing there?","John L. Stauch","I think you've to go by segment. And as Randy mentioned, I mean, I think oil and gas is in the -- what we would -- I don't know if we call it a pause, but there's a lot of projects that are out there. And the timing of those projects feel like they're a little bit slipping. But the projects...","Randall J. Hogan","But the activity level is still pretty good.","John L. Stauch","It's still pretty good.","Randall J. Hogan","Yes. Mining is way off.","John L. Stauch","Mining is starting to taper off. Process and power are starting to get better.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Makes sense. And then, the follow-up from me is a follow-up from Scott's question on the -- how much of the $100 million is visible at this point? I know the repositioning actions have already been completed in the first quarter. Is that the same for the sourcing in the Lean side as well, that the actions have been completed and it's just going to take time to materialize? Or are the actions and the work still in front of you?","Randall J. Hogan","The actions are fairly visible. And the way those work is, as you get productivity in sourcing, it has to go through the balance sheet. So you don't get it right away. So against that $20 million of, I think it was sourcing, you could imagine that at a run rate basis. An annualized run rate basis is or going to be twice that.","John L. Stauch","What we're guarding against, Mike -- I mean, if I gave you the raw number, it would be substantially higher. But what Randy and I want to make sure that we have is that you don't want -- there's a productivity column and then what we synergy and standardization column. And we've got to make sure the productivity column stays positive as well.","Randall J. Hogan","And we don't duplicate.","John L. Stauch","And we're not putting everything into the synergy or standardization efforts because we needed the holistic number to read out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I might have missed this, but could you clarify on the backlog when you're now highlighting the shippable backlog being up 17%, will that be a number that we'll be able to back into or that you'll provide on a go-forward basis? And then when you talk about what's shippable for the second quarter, what's the mix look like? Because you've got no sense of what's going to be coming through for the second quarter. But what's the implied margin there?","John L. Stauch","Yes, Deane. As we got through Q1, the business started to share with us kind of the way we need to think about shippable backlog, especially as you take a look at how they performed last Q1, and then if you look at their last Q2, there was a different Valves & Controls. So the shippable backlog is a number that we feel is meaningful, which means, if you could ship everything to the dates that are in the system, that's what you'd ship to. Now obviously, projects move back and forth. It is a number that we think is meaningful, and therefore, probably a number we will share with you on a regular basis. Within there, Randy highlighted there are a couple of projects in the oil and gas area that will ship at lower margins, which I've called out in that seasonality bridge that we did in one of the slides. But overall, I mean, we're starting to build a pretty healthy backlog because as we get power and process into the backlog, those traditionally have higher margins than what we've experienced in oil and gas and mining.","Randall J. Hogan","So think the 17% in the dialogue we're having with the team is very helpful. It's 17% -- going into the second quarter that number was 17% higher than it was going in the first quarter. And we missed shipping a little bit from where we thought we'd be in the first quarter. So it gives us more confidence that we'll hit the number we expect in the second quarter. That's how we use it.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then, maybe just in terms of the upside versus our expectations on North American residential, maybe you can kind of take us through the next layer of detail on North American pull. Were there any special promotions? Is there -- was there an early buy? And what's your sense of inventory in the channel?","Randall J. Hogan","Well, I think we might have mentioned this in the last phone -- on the fourth quarter call, that early buy was as strong as we ever saw it. Some of that certainly shipped in the first quarter. But frankly, the regular buy was strong, given how bad the weather has been. It's not just been bad here. It's been bad in a lot of the areas, cooler spring, later start to the season. So the strength we're seeing in that aquatics business is really quite encouraging, and the industry is quite buoyant, pun intended. Then the pool builds are up.","John L. Stauch","Pool builds are up. We saw our first quarter of positive revenue growth in our valves and tanks in the water softener market. And we're continuing to see pretty nice sales now in the residential components of Flow. And we have a little bit of flooding, which is happening right now, which is always also usually a pretty good indication for that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","The first question is just with respect to food and bev. You saw some demand in the first quarter from projects that were delayed the end of last year, providing a nice bump in revenues. So has a lot of that pent-up demand been worked through in 1Q? Or are we expecting to see some additional project shipments because of the delays that you saw at the end of last year?","Randall J. Hogan","No, those I think were specific delays as some of the companies got concerned about -- I wouldn't want to blame it on the uncertainty or on the election, but there seemed to be a lot of clogged capital at the end of the year last year and some of that broke loose. But the bidding activity has remained strong, and the food and beverage business is a growth business globally. And we have some -- we have a really good position and some unique technologies, not just in beer but in soft drinks and CO2 recovery. And we've picked up a couple, as we mentioned, last time, we picked up another big, multimillion-dollar project because we have the broader scope now for the industrial valves with the hygienic valves and the filtration system. So we did get that benefit in the first quarter of the delayed projects, but the backlog is actually up.","John L. Stauch","And just to add on to what Randy said, I mean, we've always been strong in beer and certainly, our Beer Membrane is a product that's specced into a lot of global breweries, and those breweries are in places like Africa and Vietnam and Malaysia, and there's a huge growth regarding that. But the product that was in alpha and beta state test in 2011 and '12 was our CO2 recovery system. And for 2013, we'll have shipments in excess of $25 million on that product, and that product is becoming a standard product.","Randall J. Hogan","Which is up 10x.","John L. Stauch","Which is up 10x. And we're seeing some substantial revenue and income coming through on those particular projects.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. That's good to hear. And then, I guess, just switching on price cost, if you could provide your view as you look out over the next 3 quarters of the year, where that stands. You made some nice improvements in the first quarter. Are you anticipating any cost pressures from raw materials moving forward, or any benefits in it?","Randall J. Hogan","When we look at the activity in the mining segment, we think that that's a good indicator that there's not going to be a lot of commodity pressure, not a lot of commodity pricing pressure. So we don't think inflation goes higher from here. Employee raises are higher than they were, but we think we have that well managed. But John, I don't know if you'd add.","John L. Stauch","No, I'd agree with that. The pricing is somewhere, going to be greater than 100 basis points, and we think we can do better there. I think our new businesses from Flow Control are starting to put in some of the same price disciplines that we've had in legacy Pentair. And we continue to think we'll make progress throughout this year and into next year.","Randall J. Hogan","And if I could add. John mentioned earlier that we want to make sure we don't double comp between base productivity plus the synergistic activities. And in one way we've done -- that one reason we're able to raise that is that those 2 buckets perform well. And when they perform well in the first quarter, it's usually -- it's a good sign for the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just looking at Page 3 again, if you could, that 220 points of price productivity and mix, you've referenced it a little bit, but I'd love to get a bit more detail here on the productivity angle versus the mix side. You just talked about pricing. So what was the real productivity side of this? And you mentioned the 2 buckets. I want to get a sense, given how important this is to the story, just give us a sense for the real productivity improvement, if you could.","John L. Stauch","Sure. I mean, I think, first of all, if you take a look at where we were with price in the quarter, total Pentair, we got about a point price. One of the things that's netted in productivity is mix. Mix was about a negative 30 to 40 basis points. Inflation was about a negative 1.5-ish percent, Steve. And then on the productivity side, we were net $3 million to $4 million beyond what we said we got in the IST component, or the synergies. And that was inclusive of, if you noticed, a higher corporate spend, which is partially a quarterly timing. We always spend a little bit more in Q1 because of just certain fees that come in, in Q1 versus the rest of the year. But we also we're continuing to invest in what we're doing on the tax rate, what we needed to do around the suite [ph] structure and what we need to do to ensure that we're spending and investing in what the businesses are driving, to drive the standardization activity. So when Randy mentioned that we feel good about where we are in Q1, that's in light of incremental investment as well to drive the back half synergies.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, all right. And then when you look at Valves & Controls, I visited a number of those plants before you took them over, and I often thought of them as the gift that should keep on giving as you keep looking for repo and other opportunities to lean them out and drive efficiency. What kind of -- what are you starting? Now that it's a couple of quarters, what are you seeing operationally as you're getting to know these plants and the supply chain associated with them?","Randall J. Hogan","Well, as you know because you've been in the plants, Valves & Control is a great product, great quality, like the people a lot, too much complexity and too much differences between plants. So as I mentioned, we've put into 8 full-time operating leaders, basically, if you will, Lean aficionados from legacy Pentair over into the business. They've been very well accepted into the team, and if anything, they're being drawn on even more than I would have hoped. We identified the 3 most underperforming factories, and we've replaced the plant managers in all 3. And we have Lean rangers that we flowed locally from -- in other words, European -- from European Lean rangers from legacy Pentair to the European plants, same in the U.S., same in Latin America, in order to drive the basics of Lean and start driving that common language that we know is going to help simplify. The opportunity in delivery is enormous. It's not in this industry. Valves & Controls is not an industry that is known for their on-time delivery. We have very ambitious targets. If you recall or followed us long enough to know that in our aquatics business, we used to have deliveries that -- I hate to say it, but we're frequently below 60% on time. And now, they're over 95% on time. It's one of the reasons that we keep gaining market share there. Valves & Controls isn't that bad. It's not below 60%. But it's -- as an industry, it's not great. That drives a lot of waste in terms of inventory. That drives a lot of waste in terms of customer planning. It drives a lot of waste in terms of plant planning. And so, we know it works. We know Lean works, and Lean is the way we're going to simplify the business, and so that's our approach to it. And our goal, it took us 10 years to get Pentair where it is, and I want to be able to get Valves & Controls there in 3. But 10 years was hunt and peck. We have a plan now. So it's ambitious, but I think the team is up to it. I'm very impressed with the Valves & Controls team.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski from MKM Partners.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Can we just talk first about the ramp in IST as we head into '14? I guess with visibility into that $100 million at 100%, presumably, you have some level of visibility into a bridge between the $100 million and the $230 million.","Randall J. Hogan","Yes.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","And I guess, how much would you say you have on what kind of number, order of magnitude for '14? I understand that it's still early but I guess, any way to help calibrate whether it's a half-step jump from the $100 million all the way up, or if we get an accelerated realization? Just any kind of color there I think would be helpful.","John L. Stauch","Yes, so, Josh, the number I feel obviously best about, from a number perspective, is obviously the repositioning and the restructuring numbers because they're -- when people leave, those costs permanently leave the organization, and that was incremental to anything we were doing at Pentair. So that's an $80 million benefit this year, and that's well over $100 million next year, given the timing when those people are leaving. So 100% confidence on that number, and it's a known trackable number that doesn't get tied up between this productivity expectation and the synergy. To give you a number, the synergy targets for 2013 around the sourcing and Lean exceed $40 million versus what we're saying is $20 million. And they have to work their way through inventory and they have to work their way through the P&L. And we've got to make sure that they're incremental to what would have been in the base plans anyway. When you take a look at that number from '14, and it probably shouldn't be a surprise, lean builds momentum. And as Randy was talking about when we did this deal, having 100 factories all signed up to $1 million of Lean benefit or $100 million, is not a number that would be insurmountable. So everybody has internal stretch targets that they're driving to around those ranges, and so when you look at the productivity decks and the synergy decks, it's very encouraging. That being said, those same people would've been working on base productivity. So we want to make sure that we're not double counting the synergies in lieu of what we would've got in base productivity anyway. And that's why we're a little bit more conservative and cautious on our outlook. And as I think we get through these and we look at the examples I gave you, bar stock, and negotiations that are in the rack, [ph] those are all real. And as we get more and more confident on what's actually a permanent cost out, we'll certainly share that, and then we can have more confidence on what the '14 and '15 numbers will be.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay. I think that's helpful. And then just one clarifying point, maybe you touched on in the prepared remarks, the $825 million in buyback that you're signed up for this year, I noticed that the share count at 205 million looks like either that is very second half or even fourth quarter biased. Is that a new number? I know the 205 million is unchanged, but I'm just trying to understand: is there an element of conservatism or just very late positioning of that buyback in the year?","John L. Stauch","It's actually accelerated from our original views, and we're definitely planning now to have everything complete by the end of '14 and we'd only have $375 million to go next year. As you know, if our debt levels allow, it's in our best interest to do it sooner rather than later. And so we're...","Randall J. Hogan","But where we are is where we planned to be at this point. We accelerated before, as John just said, and we announced that last quarter. And we did the $140 million in this quarter, which is about what we thought we would do. And we thought we'd do more in the middle of the year, in the second half. One reason is, we're disciplined about cash flow, and we didn't know what our first quarter cash flow was going to look like because the Pentair legacy typically was a big sucking sound on cash in the first quarter, and it the minus $80 million or so last year. So we wanted to see what the new -- so we did what we planned to do.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay, so $825 million is not a new number, quarter-over-quarter?","John L. Stauch","No, no. Just sharing where we are as a status update, Josh.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just on Thermal, can you -- as you look at -- do you expect the mix dynamic to continue, i.e. the infrastructure stays weak, and the other businesses continue? And then you made the comment on oil and gas in a kind of a pause in order of quoting activity. Is that more of a Valves & Controls comment, or does that flow over to Thermal as well?","John L. Stauch","I'll take the first half. I think, when you look at technical solutions, I mean you take thermal and you take equipment protection. Thermal had a great quarter. And our technical -- or our equipment protection businesses is struggling through 2 markets, infrastructure and a slower industrial vertical. Our comparisons in equipment protection get easier in the second half of the year, and we're also focused on the food and beverage market, the energy market and an opportunity for our products to be in those spaces. As far as the Thermal into the oil and gas markets, we're really specifically in the cold weather climates or areas where we see a desert-like environment, where heating is necessary in the process. And those projects are enormous, but they're also dependent on certain price points. And that's what we're constantly monitoring in that side of the business.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So have you seen slowing in the quoting activity in that side of the business?","John L. Stauch","We've seen a lumpiness, meaning, we -- [indiscernible] was a project that was canceled in its entirety.","Randall J. Hogan","Which we had -- the project we had worked on.","John L. Stauch","We had worked on that. Now there's another project that's starting to come up in its place, which will be in a different location. And then there's large projects or a series of large projects in Canada that are obviously dependent on where the oil spreads are. So, yes, these are slowed, no doubt about it.","Randall J. Hogan","They're slow off what I would call our high expectations, but I think the business will still do well. One area that slowed in the first quarter, and for the Thermal business, is that they're fairly large in Scandinavian countries for snowmelt and in commercial and residential. And Scandinavia had been a bright spot in Europe, in Western Europe in terms of growth, and we've actually seen even Scandinavia slow down now, which is more of a -- that's a comment that I would draw across all of Europe, not just what we saw on Thermal, but it's a good measure for it.","John L. Stauch","So Jeff, just to follow up. I mean, one of the reasons we went back and restated the pro forma as we did without the projects in it, for these solutions, as when those larger projects come, those should be nice incremental upside for Pentair.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And the mid-single-digit growth you see in that business, is that x the big project comp?","John L. Stauch","Yes.","Randall J. Hogan","It's over the pro forma baseline that we set out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I'm just wondering about the Europe linearity, if there's anything curious there, or if you'd even call it may be stable at this point, just kind of an overall complexion.","Randall J. Hogan","I would love it to be linear and flat. I would not really lie. It's really a mixed bag. We've seen our equipment protection business, things they bottomed out. Residential seems to be finding new plateaus on our further downward slide. And so I don't really have a lot of faith that we've seen the bottom yet in the U.S. And even in Eastern Europe, which had been pretty robust, even that is feeling a little softer than it did, at least, when I look at orders. So, we factored all that into our outlook and that is piece -- a piece of the mix look. Middle East remains strong. Latin America is not bad. So it's really interesting. And I saw and read in an article over the weekend that the U.S. is the new fast-growth market. From those words to God's ears, I hope that's true. But certainly, the place we're seeing the best growth is U.S. residential right now","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just wondering on your acquisition pipeline appetite and how you're thinking about here, and the range of deal sizes that you might be open to, considering the share repurchase commitments.","John L. Stauch","Yes, I mean, I think it goes down to what businesses are operating in a high level and have great standardization and are prepared for acquisitions and a couple of those that we said are -- certainly, our aquatics systems business, especially around aquaculture and thermal management right now, as areas that we'd like to put more effort behind, and eventually, Valves & Controls. But that being said, right now, we're focused on what we're doing on integration and things that we do, in lieu of what we're doing on the buyback, would have to be incremental to what the buyback would yield. So I don't think we're feeling like we're missing out on anything at the moment at all. We're certainly making sure that our pipelines are robust, that we're prepared, we're ready to answer, but we think our plan right now is the right plan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just had 2 quick clarification questions. Number one, is there any change in Q2 on infrastructure and industrial end markets versus Q1, or is it more of the same? And second clarification, did you guys say that you guys are front-loading the buyback, is that right?","Randall J. Hogan","Well, we said in the last quarter, the multi-year stock buyback, we accelerated, but we announced that 6 months ago. We said that basically, we were going to move everything up about a year, so that's not new news. And we've been going according to plan since then. So the acceleration was the stock buyback we did in the fourth quarter, and that was the acceleration. The rest is -- and everything else pulled up the same way. In terms of industrial, we saw -- we've seen an increase in daily order rates in our core equipment protection, industrial and as we mentioned, Valves & Controls and other big processes within industrial. We've seen that stabilize, so I wouldn't say we expect industrial to be stronger in the second quarter, meaningfully stronger than in the first quarter. But certainly by the second half, we'd expect that, as we said in the outlook. And what was the other -- Hamzah, what was the other question?","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","On the infrastructure side, any change there?","Randall J. Hogan","Oh, yes. Infrastructure, in general -- in infrastructure, we obviously put water projects but we also put the telecom projects and rail projects and the like. And they just -- it seems to be challenged everywhere. We mentioned that our backlog has been staying at a fairly high level for us in the U.S. in water. But I wouldn't read that broadly because we're a niche player in that. We play, we work strong and we seem to be doing okay in it, but it's not real huge growth for us. It's just a bright spot in what I would call generally a global infrastructure slowdown. The RO projects and the large water products in the rest of the world are just not breaking free.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair.","Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just first, a quick question on the tax rate. You mentioned that you hit the 25% level. The effective tax rate you reported was 28%. Is the difference there just this divestiture of ad spend or is something else going on there?","John L. Stauch","Yes, the 25% reflects what we think the full year ongoing rate will be, and the difference are those things related to either the asset sales or one-time impacts, the true-ups related to the overall Pentair structure.","Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And in the first quarter, the adjusted tax rate was 25%, did I hear that correctly?","John L. Stauch","That is correct, correct. That's what I also think the full year will be. Correct.","Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then on the residential side, you mentioned -- you made a couple of comments on how the residential filtration, residential pump business is doing. Can you talk a little bit more, maybe a little bit more specifics, on how those businesses grew in the first quarter, what the order rates were?","Randall J. Hogan","As I mentioned, aquatics was double-digit.","Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And in aquatics, I think -- and I don't want to make you repeat yourself in aquatics, but I'm looking more on the filtration and pump side.","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, filtration and pump in North America only or globally?","Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","North America, given it's weighted towards that market. And if you have any global comments, that would be great.","John L. Stauch","We had high single digits in residential in our Flow business. And as I mentioned earlier, we're just slightly positive in our filtration -- or our tanks and valves. And then in our filtration platform, we were high single digits.","Randall J. Hogan","Operator, how many questions are there left because we're at the hour?","Operator","There are 2.","Randall J. Hogan","Okay, we'll take those 2 and then wrap up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Rose from Wedbush.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","A follow-up question on -- maybe a little point of clarification on the restructuring charge in the $28 million. Can you walk us through the buckets for that? And expectations for restructuring charges in Q2 and how that drives your cost saving goals?","John L. Stauch","Yes, so where we are right now, the $28 million concludes everything that would get us to the $80 million for '13 and then that slightly higher than the $100 million that I mentioned on an ongoing rate. And we would expect, if we could, to do a little bit more in Q2. And we're looking for everything because the inventory step-up in the backlog and the customer amortization concludes the end of Q2.","Randall J. Hogan","For [indiscernible].","John L. Stauch","And as we said, in Q3 and Q4, we'd expect to have a gap reported number, and that be consistent with adjusted. So any incremental restructuring would be assumed to be an incremental benefit to synergies and\/or to next year's synergy numbers.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","So to be clear, if we do to see any more restructurings in Q2, that means the synergy target for the $100 million target goes up?","John L. Stauch","It could be the $100 million, or it could be next year's 14 [ph] depending on the timing of the projects.","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, I think about it in terms of the $230 million that we put out as the overall target.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then was this largely severance? Footprint reduction? Can you kind of break it down?","John L. Stauch","Primarily, G&A structure, severance and tweaking of our structures as it relates to the models that Randy is trying to drive across the globe.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Chip Moore.","Chip Moore - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","For the energy-related business overall, could you give us a sense how that breaks down upstream, versus downstream, oil versus gas and then also the relative mix for mining and power?","John L. Stauch","Well, that's a big question. I think if we -- let me take the second half of that first, because it's an easier knowable answer. If we take a look at where we are from oil and gas, just north of $800-ish million, $825 million in total for Pentair. Power is roughly just north of $425 million for us. Mining is in the low 200s, and that would be in the Valves & Controls space. And if we looked at the total portfolio, we've always said we're pretty diverse from the Valves & Controls standpoint, so we're about 1\/3 upstream, we're about 1\/3 mid, and 1\/3 downstream, plus or minus a little bit on that equation for 2012, and those are '12 numbers.","Randall J.

My name is Matthew, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Pentair's Q4 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning, you may begin your conference.","Jim Lucas - Pentair Plc","Thanks, Matthew, and welcome to Pentair's fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. We're glad you can join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning. And with me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer.","On today's call, we will provide details on our fourth quarter 2016 performance as well as our first quarter and full-year 2017 outlook as outlined in this morning's release.","Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-K and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results.","Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section on Pentair's website.

We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions.","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Thanks, Jim. 2016 was a historic year for Pentair as we marked our 50th anniversary as a company. The year was memorable for many other reasons but, unfortunately, the challenges with the energy and industrial markets made from memories that we're looking forward to putting in the rear-view mirror.","We were disappointed to have to lower our fourth quarter guidance, but we delivered against to revise expectations. When looking at 2016 on a full year basis, we did have some good memories to point to. Including ERICO, sales grew 6%. Segment income was up 11% and adjusted EPS grew 8%. And we had a very good free cash flow year with 109% conversion of adjusted net income. Now on a core basis, sales were down 1% and segment income was up slightly, which was in line with results from other industrials.","Water Quality Systems was the strong performer for us once again. We have improvements to make in Flow & Filtration Solutions and Technical Solutions and those improvements are underway. As we change the structure to be simpler and more streamlined post-Valve & Controls, we're moving from three segments to two. We're combining the former Water Quality Systems and Flow & Filtration Solutions into one Water segment as this will allow us to better execute our Water strategy and lead to more predictable long-term growth.","As an update, we believe the sales of our Valve & Controls business remains on-track for close in early 2017. We continue to make good progress on aligning our cost structure with the reality of a slower growth world, as well as repositioning the company with the divesture of Valves & Controls.","Finally, we're introducing formal 2017 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.45 to $3.55, which represents 15% growth at the midpoint of the range. This guidance assumes the sale of Valves & Controls closes by the end of the first quarter of 2017. John will walk through the guidance in more detail later in the call.","Now, let's turn to slide 5 for a discussion of our full year 2016 results. For 2016, total sales grew 6% with core sales declining 1%. As I mentioned previously, segment income grew 11% and operating margins expanded 80 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew 8%. We're most pleased with our robust cash flow performance after being somewhat disappointed on this important metric last year.","In 2016, we generated free cash flow from continuing operations of $609 million which represented 109% conversion to adjusted net income. Total free cash flow including discontinued operations was $770 million. Overall, despite the top-line challenges in 2016, we were pleased with our income, margin, and cash flow performance during this year of change.","Now, let's turn to slide 6 for details on Pentair's Q4 2016 performance. As we foreshadowed in October, we knew the fourth quarter would have its share of challenges. As expected, we saw many distributors on our short cycle business take a pause on ordering in the quarter, particularly in October. We saw trend start to stabilize in December and order rates, overall, improved as we exited the quarter.","Core sales for the fourth quarter were down 7%. We had 6 percentage point impact from 4 fewer selling days. We knew this was going to occur so it's important to point out that we do not see the fourth quarter growth rates as a trend because of this impact. We make good progress during the quarter in executing our cost-out initiatives and we expect them to begin reading out as the new year unfolds.","Now, let's turn to slide 7 for a look at Water Quality Systems performance in Q4. Water Quality Systems reported core sales growth of 2% or up 8% when excluding the impact of fewer selling days. Aquatic & Environmental Systems led the way with nearly double-digit core sales growth on the same basis. The Aquatics business delivered growth against a very tough comparison and continues to make good progress in adding new dealers and introducing a steady stream of new products.","The Water Filtration business was down modestly when excluding the impact of fewer selling days. The residential side of Water Filtration was focused on reducing complexity during the year with a renewed focus on its go-to-market strategy to improve growth which was somewhat muted for the full year.","On the foodservice side of the business, we saw a broad-based pause globally in new installations particularly internationally. We were, however, encouraged to see an improvement in orders in the fourth quarter.","Now, let's move to slide 8 for a look at Flow & Filtration Solutions performance in Q4. With Flow & Filtration Solutions, we've been focused on reducing complexity and driving margin improvement. We made some progress in 2016 and we see some signs of stabilization improvement in areas like agriculture and North America infrastructure.","For the Water Technologies business, fourth quarter core sales excluding the impact of fewer selling days, declined 7%. The business faced a number of challenges in the quarter as commercial and international orders slowed along with continued declines in irrigation. This was further exacerbated at the end of the year as distributors slowed their orders.","Core sales for Fluid Solutions grew in the quarter, adjusting for the fewer selling days. The precision spray business grew for the second consecutive quarter in a soft agriculture market. This business has consistently demonstrated its ability to deliver differentiated growth through geographic expansion and expanding its customer base. On the beverage side of the business, we saw strong orders in both beer membrane filtration and biogas.","Finally, Process Filtration once again faced a challenging comparison and core sales were down, in line with expectations. But encouragingly, we saw orders increased for the second consecutive quarter.","Now, let's turn to slide 9 to discuss how Technical Solutions performed in the fourth quarter. Technical Solutions is the remaining segment with the broadest exposure to energy and industrial and, not surprisingly, faced a number of challenges in 2016. For the fourth quarter, our Enclosures core sales were down modestly, excluding the impact from the fewer selling days as we saw a number of telecom order deferrals. But we were encouraged with further improvements of the daily order rate in short cycle North American industrial orders.","Thermal Management faced two challenges in the fourth quarter: the end of three large jobs from the Canadian oil sands; and for the third consecutive year, deferrals and short cycle MRO sales. In Engineered Fastening Solutions, which represents our 2015 ERICO acquisition, the impact of the fewer selling days and a slow start to the quarter was felt in the short cycle distribution side of the business.","On the commercial side of the business, we saw our distributors pause activity in October. But orders returned to more normalized levels in December and exited the year on a positive note. On the infrastructure side of the business, we continue to see several jobs deferred, but signs are pointing to potential improvement in 2017.","Now, let's turn to slide 10 to discuss the purpose of our organizational change. With the pending sale of Valves & Controls, we looked at the organization holistically to address stranded costs and simplification as we continue our journey to become a more predictable organization or combining our two Water businesses into one Water segment. Our Technical Solutions business is being renamed to the more appropriate \u2013 Electrical segment. PIMS has been the cornerstone of how we do business for over 15 years and will continue to be the common thread that links the entire organization. As we move from three segments to two and from eight strategic business groups to six, we expect to be able to streamline our cost structure.","Finally, we believe a leaner, more nimble organizational structure will help us deliver, develop our talent pipeline better. There will be more line of sight to growth opportunities and clarity on investment priorities.","Now, let's turn to slide 11 to look at the streamline segment overview. This slide provides a snapshot of our two segments and six strategic business groups. In the appendix of today's document, we have included the past eight quarters' historical data as well as description of each business to help you understand the combined Water segment as well as the renamed Electrical segment.","As you can see, we have two sizable businesses with strong returns. Our Water segment generated $2.8 billion of sales in 2016 with a return of sales of 18%. We're one of the largest players in water, and we expect combining what was previously two businesses will help improve collaboration and focus our water strategy more clearly.","We have three businesses in Water with scale. First, the nearly $1 billion Filtration & Process business that we believe is well positioned in residential, commercial, and industrial applications. Second, Flow Technologies, also nearly $1 billion in size where we have a broad pump portfolio positioned in agriculture, infrastructure, and residential and commercial applications. Finally, we have a very successful $900 million Aquatic & Environmental Systems business that continues to fire on all cylinders.","Our Electrical segment is just over $2 billion and is one of the most profitable businesses in its space with a return on sales of 21%. All three businesses are well-positioned. Our $900 million Enclosures business is a leader in the North American electrical distribution channel and also has a good electronics business serving global markets. Our $700 million Thermal Management business is a world leader in electric heat-tracing with strong offering in industrial, energy, and residential and commercial applications.","Finally, we believe our $500 million Electrical & Fastening Solutions business, which most of you know as our ERICO acquisition, is very well positioned in commercial, industrial, and infrastructure applications. These two segments are already nicely profitable and focused on prioritizing the best opportunities to grow more consistently.","Now, let's turn to slide 12 to discuss how we plan to improve Pentair's performance longer term. Pentair has gone through a variety of changes throughout its 50 years and we believe the Pentair that is entering 2017 is well-positioned to optimize opportunities across the organization and get back to creating shareholder value.","Pentair has done a lot of things right through the years with some years more successful than others. As we simplify and streamline the organization, we're recommitting to drive the right priorities, focusing on right opportunities to make Pentair grow again.","As we move from three to two segments, we believe it will allow us to deploy expertise to drive performance more effectively and lead with our PIMS processes in lean, growth, and talent.","The smaller senior management team including both segment leaders will all be driven to optimize Pentair's performance, not just individual businesses or segments. We're functionalizing G&A to optimize efficiency across the enterprise and further improve costs. One thing you may have noticed is the new name and a new role within the senior leadership team. John Jacko has joined us as our new Chief Marketing Officer.","While Pentair has made good progress through the years with lean as the cornerstone of PIMS, our track record on growth has been spotty at best. Some of our businesses, such as Aquatics have built a predictable model of growth and we need to ensure that same discipline across the entire enterprise.","We've identified commercial excellence as a breakthrough process and John Jacko brings the richness, the capability, and experience that will help us strengthen these competencies. This includes richer insights into our markets and better growth strategies. It also includes product line management, sales deployment, sales compensation and, maybe most importantly, marketing.","We believe adding a senior growth leader coupled with two aligned segment presidents will allow us to further improve our growth outcomes. As a focused team, we'll work more effectively to optimize our performance, drive more consistency and deliver on our commitments.","I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our first quarter and full year 2017 outlook.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you, Randy. Please turn to slide number 13 titled full year 2017 Pentair outlook. As Randy mentioned, for the full year 2017, we're expecting overall Pentair EPS to be around $3.45 to $3.55 on an adjusted basis. This guidance assumes the sale of Valves & Controls closes by the end of the first quarter of 2017. We expect to achieve this guidance on core revenue of down 3% and margin expansion of 120 basis points, driven by simplifying the organization and the resulting cost-out from those efforts.","Please turn to slide 14 labeled 2017 forecasted revenue. Slide 14 walks our revenue from the reported $4.89 billion of revenue in 2016 to our expected revenue of approximately $4.7 billion, inclusive of the large jobs and foreign exchange headwinds. Starting on the left, we expect volume, inclusive of one dairy job in Water and three large oil sands jobs in Electrical, to impact revenue by about four points. Excluding the impact of the large jobs, we are expecting volume to be down around two points. We're anticipating one point of favorable pricing and about one point from tuck-in acquisitions already completed.","These two acquisitions consist of a small tuck-in to our Electrical & Fastening Solutions strategic business group and a biogas recovery acquisition in the Filtration & Process SBG. So, excluding the impact of year-over-year currency, we expect revenue to be down around 2%. Inclusive of another $75 million of revenue headwind at around $1.05 to the euro, we expect overall reported 2017 revenue to be down around 3% versus 2016.","Please turn to slide 15 labeled 2017 forecasted segment income. On slide 15, we're walking 2016 reported segment income to expected 2017 segment income. Starting with 2016, we expect about $20 million of total headwind of the net of volume growth, $8 million from the acquisitions, price and large jobs. We expect $135 million of gross cost-out from both material and labor and we expect to generate $60 million in net benefit after the impact of about 2% of inflation in material and wages. This drives about a 5% segment income growth year-over-year versus 2016. After the impact of about $10 million of FX, we are at $870 million of segment income at the midpoint, which is up about 4% year-over-year on a reported basis.","Please turn to slide 16 labeled 2017 forecasted adjusted EPS walk. Slide 16 walks EPS from 2016 to 2017. Starting from the left, you see there is about $0.15 of headwind from the large jobs and FX and about $0.30 or 10% expansion from net cost-out and growth in price. Another 10% or about $0.30 comes from the expected closure of Valves & Controls by the end of the first quarter and the resulting three quarters of interest benefit from paying down the debt or about $0.09 to $0.10 per quarter. This takes us to our $0.50 at the midpoint or up about 15% versus the $3.05 in 2016.","Please turn to slide 17 labeled anticipated 2017 sales and income seasonality. Slide 17 shows the expected 2017 seasonality of our revenue, segment income, and EPS versus 2016. You could see that revenue and segment income are in line with contribution percentages in 2016. The only difference is EPS, which is skewed by the interest benefit in Q2 through Q4 and no contribution of this interest savings in Q1. Excluding the interest, operational EPS would be in line with 2016.","Please turn to slide 18 labeled Q1 2017 Pentair outlook. Slide 18 shows you our expected earnings per share estimates for Q1 of about $0.61, which is flat with the comparable period one year ago. You could see that we expect core sales to be down around 4 points or down 1 point excluding the impact of large jobs.","We expect ROS expansion of 20 basis points, driven by the headwinds from the large jobs and the fact that we have yet to receive the full run rate benefits of the cost takeout which we are expecting in Q2 through Q4.","Overall, adjusted EPS for Q1 is anticipated to be flat year-over-year. We're expecting our tax rate should be 20%, which is consistent with 2016. We expect net interest expense of $35 million as we will not yet have any debt pay-down benefit.","Finally, we expect shares to be a little higher at 184 million, which does not yet reflect any benefit of the approximately $100 million in buyback that we anticipate to benefit us in Q2 through Q4. As a reminder, cash flow in Q1 is usually a usage, given our normal seasonality of cash flows.","Please turn to slide 19 labeled balance sheet and cash flow. My final slide shares with you our current balance sheet and cash flow performance. As Randy mentioned, we had another strong year of cash flow at $609 million or 109% of adjusted net income for our continuing operations businesses.","You could see our debt levels before our anticipated net proceeds from our Valves & Controls divestiture. We expect to use the proceeds to immediately reduce our debt levels.","I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for Q&A after which, Randy will have a few closing remarks. Matthew, please open the line for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Hey, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you just walk through the $135 million in productivity savings for next year? It's a pretty significant bump-up. What's the visibility around that?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. So, good visibility, first of all, Steve. I mean, the simplification of the organization is driving tremendous amount of opportunity to take incremental cost out. But if you think about it, we're going to \u2013 we're expecting to get $59 million or $60 million of material productivity against an inflation number of $45 million, $46 million. So, we're starting to be squeezed a little bit on the benefit and material productivity versus inflation. But we expect our net cost-out actions from the people cost minus any delta on inflation and\/or compensation to yield us close to $45 million on a net basis.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That makes sense. And then on just the interest expense, the run rate exiting the year is definitely lower than what we were expecting. Are you guys \u2013 is the refi of the debt kind of in line with what you guys had talked about previously? Or is there more debt pay-down? Anything changed on that front?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. It's just that as we collected cash in the quarter, we trickled down the debt a little bit, Steve. And so, we expect to be maybe slightly lower in Q1, and then we'll see the significant benefits in Q2, Q3, and Q4.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC. Your line is open.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Good morning, Deane.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Good morning.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Maybe just start with the 4Q kind of tone of business. One of the things you talked about heading into the quarter was don't expect any sort of normal seasonality, no budget flush, and kind of see more of the same deferrals of MRO and so forth. And so, how did it play out from a broad level in terms of what you would typically see in a 4Q?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Yeah. Across the number of the businesses, as I mentioned in the prepared script, October was soft. And then, we saw a return to more normal levels except in a couple of different segments where, basically, distributors weren't remotely close to getting rebates, so they were particularly slow.","The deferral in Thermal is not surprising given the \u2013 well, people are optimistic about energy. That has not really improved the spending, particularly in the larger companies. But I'd say that rates are stable and we're not assuming a bounce-back in our forecast in 2017 until we see something. So, that's how \u2013 I guess that's \u2013 (23:14)?","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then, in the change to the core revenue outlook, previously, minus 2% to positive 2%. You're now at minus 3%. You discussed, at a high level, the impact of the jobs. So, maybe just kind of next layer of detail, how did this play out in the quarter? Have you ring-fenced this in terms of its impact with regard to being at the lower \u2013 below the low end of the core revenues?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. I mean, just to cut through it, I think our core revenue, if you exclude the projects, is down about 0.6%. Let's round it to down 1%. That's generally where we were this year. And so, what Randy is saying is we don't see an improvement off of the run rates that we're at. I think we're as optimistic as anyone that we'll start to see some improvement in the industrial spending and also some return to normal spending on the downstream MRO activities. But right now, our forecast does not assume any of that.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Yeah. We've been head-faked on it before. We're not going to (24:21) again.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And just last question for me conceptually going to one segment in Water. You've got these SBGs. So, it's Filtration and Flow and Aquatics, but each of them has such a different growth potential, different end markets, different technologies. Will we still get line of sight and clarity into the SBGs on a go-forward basis? Will you have margin targets within them? Just kind of give us some color there, please?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Yeah, of course, we will. And what we see is more coherent strategy, particularly on much, much better coordination on the technology side between, say, the Residential Filtration all the way through to the process industry. I mean, these are technologies that can be applied and much more seamlessly and we can flow resources to the best growth opportunities. So, yeah, we will have separate targets. And for example in Water Technologies, it's still a margin. We can improve margin there. That's the focus there.","And on the Filtration side, it's driving growth like we already have good margins, we want to drive growth like we're getting in Aquatics.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good morning, guys.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Good morning.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Hey, Steve.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Can we just start \u2013 I guess I'm about to lose visibility of Flow & Filtration margins with the re-segmentation. So, where do you see yourselves in terms of the margin improvement initiatives that are going on? I could obviously see what happened in the quarter, but it doesn't really probably tell the full story given with 5% productivity versus price and all that. Maybe just in price, can you talk about that a little bit?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. I think one of the things that we wanted to do in Water is we want to make sure that we can rise up and invest appropriately across the entire water space. And when you subdivide into segments, you lose that ability to generate the cash and deploy the cash back to the best growth opportunities. And there are good growth opportunities in the old Flow & Filtration space. At the same time, there is margin needs and the need to get the complexity out of it, as Randy said, the pump side of the business where there has been significant competition globally in that space.","So, when we take a look at these margins \u2013 and when we get to Analyst Day, we'll certainly give you guys direction in where we are. But the real opportunity here is to say how do we disproportionally invest in the longer term. So, these are all high margin businesses with Aquatics being the highest margin and Flow being the lowest margin. But I think, ultimately, we think that they're all \u2013 got 20%-plus margin potential, Steve.","On the pricing side, we're getting a little bit more price and we expect to because of commodity inflation that we're seeing. And so, where we have the distribution-related businesses, we're seeing that work its way into somewhere around the 1% range. And then where we're in projects, where we're against global competition because of the challenges of the currency, we're not getting any price. And we're obviously taking a look at those jobs and making sure that we understand the currency impact in competing on that basis.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And on the reorganization, you talked about simplification and cost-out as being one of the benefits of this. But I didn't see any kind of restructuring built into the 2017 plan on that front. Maybe some idea of how you're thinking about that?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Well, a lot of the costs we're taking out \u2013 we have operating people at corporate in three segments. It's basically that the cost and the productivity that John talked about earlier, that's the real benefit of it. And we're taking out structure which we believe is going to improve our focus and our ability to execute.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah and...","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Without restructuring...","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","(28:36) of total restructuring cost is the estimate and that would have been spanned over the last Q3, Q4 and into Q1 of 2017.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Perfect. And just lastly on ERICO. That was, I think, really I hope to stabilize portfolio. Here's a quarter where it was down 4% excluding days impact on Engineered Fastening. Maybe \u2013 and I know you talked about some of the dynamics there, but was this surprising to you or how do you think about the dynamics of that segment?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","They surely saw an acute softness in October and it recovered. But we don't know whether we saw that in three separate businesses that were unrelated to each other. So, we think it was more channel softness that then firmed up again and there's more optimism now. So, yeah, we didn't expect \u2013 and we're back to where we thought we'd be.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. Just a question. There's a lot of talk throughout the release of the large jobs impact and you also mentioned the sort of merits of predictable growth in your prepared remarks. So, could we assume that there has been \u2013 or there's a potential change in focus underway, away from bidding on a lot of large jobs activity? And maybe give us some sense, overall, under your definition of large jobs, how much of that $4.9 billion sales base last year came from them.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. So, good question. I think when you take a look at the roughly $90 million to $100 million of job impact that we're expecting in Technical Solutions, which is now Electrical, that's all in Thermal. And in fact, we were actually up slightly in 2016 revenue versus 2015, and 2015 and 2014 were flat. So, we've run historically roughly this $100 million to $125 million through the pipeline of always having larger jobs. With what has happened in the global oil and gas investment space, that landscape is clearly changing, and I'll let Randy talk to that.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Yeah. I mean, we're excited to win those jobs even as the energy markets turn down. They had a longer tail now. And now that they've gone down, there just aren't a lot of those large projects in hostile environment. It's basically cold environments, it's where the thermal big projects are. And there aren't as many developments there.","So, we're not focused there. We're focused on making sure we get all of the MRO in Thermal we can and focusing on that more profitable. That was one of the challenges on our margins in Technical Solutions, those project margins versus MRO. And we are more focused on driving the MRO.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Thank you.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","So, while the top line gets affected by the lack of projects, we don't think the bottom line is as affected.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Understood. Thank you. And then my follow-up would be around just the margin opportunities on the sort of two new segmentation bases. Should we assume, I guess, the Water margins expand in 2017 at a much faster rate than Electrical just because there's less of a large jobs impact? And maybe talk a little bit about sort of medium term margin expansion across the two segments on the new bases.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Well, actually, Electrical, we expect margins to snap back. They took a \u2013 they went backwards in 2016 versus where they've been. So, (32:32).","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Well, yeah, I mean, we're looking at the same general margin expansions of both the businesses of low hundreds of basis points expansion. I think we get there in two different ways. I mean, we have a little bit more growth contribution in the Water side. And in the Electrical side, we have the benefit, as Randy mentioned, between not having the margin squeeze of the projects and we also have a fair amount of cost take-out planned relative to the volume rightsizing.","I mean, as we go forward, I mean, clearly, the biggest margin opportunity is going to be in the Water side, certainly in the focused areas that Randy mentioned earlier. And we're going to see the growth contribution in the Electrical as the markets begin to recover, generate some substantial drop-through as they're higher margin businesses already.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Your line is open.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Hey, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. So, just on the marketing hire, can you give a little more color on sort of why now and why create that new role now? I mean, the growth challenge has sort of been something that persisted for a while. So, why make the move now and what do you expect it to deliver?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Well, we've actually been working on the move for a while, trying to find the right person who had experience and capability in marketing and had actually done it in industrial. So, John has worked in a number of companies including Honeywell and Kennametal and his track record is very, very helpful.","So, he's going to work with our two Presidents, Beth and Karl, and me, to make sure that we have deployed people in the right place and that we are driving stronger execution on the marketing programs of the company.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, John, on the decisions around what to do with the proceeds from Valves & Controls, looks like you're pretty much mostly delevering a little bit of buyback. Can you just talk about the thought process of why you chose that route and then thoughts around relevering and ideal leverage ratio?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. I think first of all, just introducing some modest buyback is important to us. I mean, taking care of the creep and also just making sure that we're consistently doing that on a basis.","So, we're talking about $100 million, it's a modest amount. And as far as paying the debt down, we expect that we'll bring the debt levels down. We have strong cash flow generation that can fund bolt-on acquisitions. And if we need to borrow a little bit more, we got plenty of capacity to borrow under all of our current capacity lines to fund the bolt-on or tuck-in acquisition path that we expect to embark upon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Good morning.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","So, on the productivity side, just back to that $135 million. Could you just bucket out where that's coming from kind of highlighting what portion of that is stranded cost, and where the opportunity set, how that looks like? And the other piece is, obviously, from the other comments, Flow & Filtration remained the focus, but just a little more granularity.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. Good question, Mike. I mean, I think we are focused on the stranded cost in the beginning. But we're really looking at is enterprise-wide reduction. So, how do we get best optimal finance cost across the entire organization? How do we get the best HR cost across the organization?","So, what we've done is taken a look, as Randy mentioned, and functionalized the G&A aspects to the corporate executives and we've driven about a 10% expectation reduction off of those. And happy to say that we've made good progress against those, and embarrassed to say it was easy. But, I think we were doing a lot of costs to support the Valves & Controls organization, the global nature. And post-Valves & Controls, we have a much simpler organization to support. So, there's a huge opportunity there.","Other things, we're moving 52 selling teams to 6. Obviously, some big opportunity from a structure standpoint there. So, we didn't have, at the SBG level, the selling organization. Those exist today. And so, a ton of opportunities especially after \u2013 in the non-scaled regions in the fast growth areas, same with marketing, same with technology, same with all of those structures.","So, that gives you a little bit of an insight to, as Randy mentioned, the simplification of the organization structure. But more importantly, the accountability of the organization structure and the ability for us to have visibility to who's performing, who's not, and then how to partner with them to achieve it.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. That's helpful. And then just a clarification from earlier. It sounds like you guys are saying no fundamental improvement from current run rate assumed in the 2017 guidance. Do I have that right? In other words, pretty normal sequential pattern assumed through here. Is that the thought process?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yes.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","If you look at the waterfall that John showed, you don't see a lot of lift from growth and that's where we'd expect higher execution in sales and any recovery of market would read out.","Mike P. Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Appreciate the time, guys. Take care.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Good morning.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Good morning.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","So, I guess just going back to earlier question Deane asked around the Q3 framework. I mean, clearly, you would have had visibility into the projects back then. We're hearing from other companies kind of leveraged in the industrial world that things are getting better. It does sound like things obviously got better for you through the quarter. But are there any other kind of comments on why we're no longer looking at towards the high end of that or what would have to change to kind of get back to that framework?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","I think in our original thought process, in the framework, we did see and expect a little uptick in some of the core markets. And in this particular guidance range, we're assuming that those don't occur. Now, we're hopeful like everybody else that they will. But right now, in this guidance framework, we're not assuming that they do.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then, I guess, a question about the new segmentation. I guess thinking about it from a structural tax inefficiency way, is there any inefficiency from actually splitting Water and Electrical from a tax perspective?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","I don't know.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","I don't know.","John Fred Walsh - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. All right. Well, thank you for the color.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning. Two questions, one on organic sales, the little bit of lower guidance that you're putting out here today. Is that \u2013 I know you've just indicated that you're no longer expecting an uptick. But is part of the reduction maybe that you put pen to paper on these projects and said really kind of crystallize that for you in realizing that those are going to be non-repeats? Because that's a minus 2% for you? Is that part of it as well?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Scott, I mean, candidly, I will share with you that a big piece of what we're trying to figure out on a longer-term basis is the impact of a stronger dollar globally and the global competition and how that affects our growth views. And then there's a lot of global change that has occurred in the last three months, a new presidential administration, there's some emerging tax strategies there but none of that has been identified, none of that has been decided. So, what is the impact on that going to be to industrial investment?","And also what's going to happen in Europe and are there going to counterviews (40:53) to any decisions that our administration makes. So, we see a lot of uncertainty, from an investment standpoint, in the first half of the year that I don't think we have the ability to call. So, what we're forecasting is what happened in Q4 continue to exist until there is some type of change.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","John, that's a really good answer \u2013 thank you \u2013 particularly the FX, which I wish more companies would call out. The other thing that I wanted to ask was about the impact of the organic decline vis-\u00e0-vis the $20 million worth of \u2013 in the waterfall. Is the $20 million enough? Or is there so much pricing or is the pricing component here enough where the minus $20 million kind of works? I mean, obviously, you're assuming that that's what works. But I guess with just a minus 3-ish organic, the minus $20 million looks like it could be a little bit deeper.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. So, the projects themselves didn't yield very much return, right? So, they're usually quoted on a more of a gross margin rate that's normally equal to a segment income or operating margin rate. And we did have some overruns in some of those jobs that forced those down as we took you through in Q3 and Q4. So, the price is a big factor as you got about 1% price increase helps that drop-through quite a bit.","R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's great. Thanks a lot.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good color so far. So it seems that from your comments that channel distributor ordering activity is weak in the first half of the quarter, a little bit of \u2013 maybe some channel clearance. Just the inference would be that December was stronger and, therefore, given that's \u2013 I think you said, John, down 0.6% core sales ex large projects, ex days. So, therefore, that metric, would that be a positive number in December? Just thinking about the exit rate as we exit the year.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","You're talking about December of 2016?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","December 2015. So, just thinking about once we cleared out the channel impact, would we be back to growth in December?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Yes, a little bit, yes.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay. That's clear. But you're assuming that the run rate is for the quarter, not December?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","No. I think we got to take a look at the quarter itself as the run rate and we're carrying that...","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","4 days.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","...lesser days, yes.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, just back to the cost reductions. Obviously, it's a big part of the bridge. How much of that, just to be clear, how much of that target is driven by the formation of the Water segment sort of gone from two to one in that segmentation?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. I would say we think that there is an opportunity somewhere in the $15 million to $20 million range regarding that.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay. And then, just finally on the debt reduction, just to be clear, so the vast, vast majority of the proceed is being used to take down debt. Obviously, that includes some of the higher cost debt. Any sense yet on the breakage costs of doing that?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","No. But clearly, as the interest rate rises, it does make the costs lower for Pentair. So, obviously, looking at that every day, but we have not given guidance on what that impact is yet.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just one more, if I may. On the large projects, is the bulk of that washed through by the second half of the year?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","I think so.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. There is about \u2013 I'd say through Q3, the bulk of it is work-through, Q3.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. Great. Thanks, guys.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Or around Q4 (44:52). Yeah. That's on page 14.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Marketing [Markets]. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Hey, Jeff.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just with \u2013 you mentioned the presidential change and some of the moving pieces, can you just talk about border adjustments, tariffs, and how you're manufacturing footprint kind of aligns with that? Are you \u2013 in your Mexico footprint \u2013 and how some changes there might impact your thinking?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","It's all speculation now. We're keenly watching and listening. We have plants all over the world. So, we're cautious and prepared to react whichever way it goes.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just real quick, I don't know if I missed it, did you give a corporate expense number for the year?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","We did not but we should assume that it's right around $100 million.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Your line is open.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Hello, Nathan.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","John, could you just be a little bit more precise to what the total anticipated debt reduction is post the closure of the V&C deal?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","That's roughly around $2.6 billion.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So, pretty much all of it is going in there. I think you had talked before about planning to deploy a good chunk of that capital into either M&A or share repurchase. Can you talk about the decision over changing of that decision and to focus more on debt reduction now?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","I think we always intended to, A, reduce the debt. And then, B, was to re-establish a more normal recurring buyback which is what I said was $100 million. And then we believe we're going to have a rich pipeline of opportunities which we call tuck-in or bolt-ons, which tend to be the smaller, much more strategic and highly-accretive opportunities.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","And we'll lever up to do the ones that are prudent and create shareholder value. But we don't want the money sitting around on our balance sheet. We're waiting on that.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And then I think in response to Steve's first question, you talked about $45 million of cost out in 2017. When we talked about this a few months ago, that number was a fair bit higher. Is that number a fair bit higher on a run-rate basis, and it takes some time to work up to get that $45 million? And what's kind of the run rate that you would assume for simplification\/cost-out of the organization post the divestiture of the Valves & Controls business?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Yeah. Just a couple of clarifications, we showed $60 million of net productivity. So, think of that as $15 million of net material and $45 million of net labor. And we do have labor inflation globally and that's the difference between the numbers we previously talked about, and these are net numbers versus gross numbers. And the other was gross, right.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just on the project in cold areas, if the U.S. government now looking like they're going to go ahead and approve Keystone and Dakota Access, what kind of opportunity would that be for you guys?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","I think eventually, it probably will help the oil sands be more competitive, eventually when completed.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Is there any numbers you could frame around that?","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Could not.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","It would be speculative at this point...","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. Okay. Thanks, guys.","John L. Stauch - Pentair Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Just on the re-consolidating of Water, you split it at one point after the Valves & Controls acquisition. So, I'm just wondering what the idea was in previously splitting that, that didn't hold or maybe that was always an interim structure for a specified goal.","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","Chris, we did it then so we could have a focused leadership over the different parts. We were more complex when we picked up three businesses, when we did Flow Control. And we just felt like it would get more focused leadership that way.","What we've found as we simplified, right, and selling Valves, a (50:01) big a piece of the business, as we looked at simplifying the organization \u2013 I think we said it was like $27 million of stranded costs, we said there's really more we can do and there's ways we can streamline.","And also as we looked at growth and we looked at where resources were in Water, we really felt that we want to remove the barriers, organizational barriers so that we could flow \u2013 John mentioned earlier all the different sales forces. We're overstaffed in some sales forces, understaffed in others. We need to be able to make the organization more facile in moving those investments around. So, that essentially is the new thought.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. That makes sense. Was there any notion at any point that Flow & Filtration was under any kind of strategic review?","Randall J. Hogan - Pentair Plc","No.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay.

Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results.","Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which could be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. All references today will be on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated, for which the non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the Appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. In recognition that there are other calls this morning, we will target to be done in an hour.","[Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randall J. Hogan","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with our second quarter performance, which is on Slide 3 of the deck. Pentair's second quarter was strong for many reasons. We were very pleased with our 4% core growth in the quarter and saw 2 of our 3 segments grow, which highlights our narrowly diversified portfolios balance. All 3 segments drove operating margin expansion greater than 100 basis points, and Water & Fluid Solutions achieved a 15% operating margin, a record for that segment.","Our adjusted EPS came in at the high end of our guidance. It has been 9 months since we closed the flow control merger, and every day we see further support for the rationale of the deal. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on the synergy targets we've outlined given Pentair's proven track record of execution and the actions we continue to identify to drive our success.","This is important since many of our end markets around the globe are sending mixed signals ranging from sluggish and pessimistic to moderate optimism. Our continued North America residential recovery, strength in Food & Beverage, and steadiness in Energy, is helping counterbalance the ongoing headwinds in Industrial, where many had anticipated a second half acceleration does not appear to be materializing.","Before I go through the second quarter results in detail, I want to note that we will be discussing our operating results on an adjusted basis to better address the core operating performance of our businesses, and referring to 2012 on a pro forma adjusted basis to provide a more accurate apples-to-apples comparison that includes flow control in the results.","With that, here are the numbers. As I mentioned a moment ago, second quarter revenue grew 4% on an organic basis with foreign exchange neutral in the quarter. Adjusted operating income grew 13%, while adjusted operating margins increased 120 basis points to 13.7% as price and productivity once again more than offset inflation.","Adjusted EPS grew 19% year-over-year to $0.92, which came in slightly higher than our expected range. Free cash flow for the quarter was $331 million, which is greater than what we generated for all of 2012. And we expect to deliver full year free cash flow greater than 100% of net income once again. We continue to build momentum on the elements within our control, and we see opportunities to deliver double-digit EPS growth, even as we wait for better economic conditions around the globe.","Now let's turn to Slide 4 for a performance review of our largest segment, Water & Fluid Solutions. Water & Fluid Solutions sales were up 8% on a core basis, made up of 7% volume growth and 1% of price. Sales in the Residential & Commercial vertical, which represents roughly half of the segment, grew 8% in the quarter, as the North American residential recovery continued. We once again saw a double-digit sales gain in our Aquatics business and our Filtration and Flow businesses also performed very well. The European residential market remained sluggish, but the North American market is more than offsetting this continued weakness.","Our Food & Beverage vertical, which accounts for nearly 1\/5 of Water & Fluid Solutions sales, grew revenue 25% in the quarter with agriculture, beverage and foodservice all delivering strong double-digit gains.","Our Infrastructure vertical, which accounts for nearly 20% of Water & Fluid Solutions sales, was up modestly, as our North American break and fix business continue to shift from its backlog. And we're, at long last, seeing signs of stabilization in our European business, particularly with desal customers in the Middle East.","The right half of the page shows second quarter Water & Fluid Solutions operating profits and margins for the quarter. Water & Fluid Solutions adjusted operating margins improved 120 basis points and hit a record 15% as the benefits the productivity and price drove the expansion. With the North American residential recovery gaining momentum, we again saw a strong drop through to the bottom line as a result of the cost structure we built during the prolonged housing downturn. In addition, we made good progress with our recent repositioning actions, which have begun to show benefit, too.","In summary, Water & Fluid Solutions delivered a second consecutive strong quarter, driven by our Residential and Food & Beverage verticals.","Now let's turn to Slide 5 for a review of our Valves & Controls segment performance. The second quarter performance in Valves & Controls is beginning to show the power of PIMS adoption. Lean implementation continues to go better than we had anticipated, and we saw further improvements in on-time delivery rates for the business.","We've made good progress in Valves & Controls reorganization moves, and our clear focus on service has produced some nice wins. In addition, we continue to be more disciplined in pursuing large projects, as evidenced by improving margin in backlog. Also in the second quarter, we're encouraged that backlogs remain near-record levels and orders grew. We continue to expect to deliver low-single-digit growth for the full year based on our backlog and shipment schedules.","After our top line decline in the first quarter, Valves & Controls sales grew 4% in the second quarter driven by volume, as FX and price were both flat. Oil and gas and mining sales both increased at a low-double-digit rate, while power sales were flat and industrial process sales declined modestly. We also saw a strong growth in service across Valves & Controls, but the top line at low-double digits and MRO growing in a mid-single digit range. We'll discuss orders and backlogs in further detail in just a moment.","The right half of the page shows second quarter Valves & Controls operating profits and margins. Operating margins were up 160 basis points to 13.5%, owing to productivity improvements. We've seen broad adoption of PIMS, particularly in Lean enterprises, and synergies are also contributing to the margin expansion.","As we discussed last quarter, we have deployed 8 senior operating leaders to help accelerate the deployment of Lean and over 10,000 PIMS e-learning modules have been completed by over 4,000 Valves & Controls employees. In addition, over 1,000 Valves & Controls employees have participated in PIMS growth training already.","In summary, Valves & Controls growth in second quarter followed a modest contraction last quarter, highlighting that there may be some quarter-to-quarter variability around the timing of shipments, but our long-term outlook in this segment remained quite positive.","Now let's move to Slide 6 for a look of the orders and backlog for Valves & Controls. As you can see on Slide 6, the Valves & Controls backlog is broken down in 4 key industries, 3 of which fall into our energy vertical: Oil and gas, power and then mining, and one in our industrial vertical, which is the process business. Backlog was essentially flat overall and remains at a near-record level of $1.4 billion.","Process saw a small decline in its backlog, while orders grew. There continues to be some slowness in the Asia Pacific region, but North American quoting activity has picked up as a result of projects aimed to take advantage of inexpensive North American natural gas.","Within oil and gas, backlog remains strong globally and orders grew 10% after declining in the first quarter. The power business saw a decline in orders against a tough comparison, but backlog remains strong and we still expect the second half to show some growth in power shipments.","Second quarter orders in mining increased as a large project was booked, but the near-term outlook on the overall industry remains challenged. Mining backlog remains at a record level with many projects scheduled to ship through the remainder of the year.","Now let's move to Slide 7 for the review of Technical Solutions. Sales for the segment declined 4% for the quarter led by another double-digit decrease in Infrastructure, consisting largely of Datacom, telecom and networking, which remains weak, particularly in Europe.","Industrial sales declined 2% as many customers continue to delay capital spending. After seeing daily industrial order rates improved in April and May, we saw a decline in June. It's too early to tell if this is a further destocking of customers further lowering their capital spend, but the outlook for industrial remains less than favorable. Energy sales were down 9% as our Thermal Management business saw continued delays with megaprojects, mostly in Canada.","The right half of the page shows second quarter Technical Solutions operating profits and margins. Technical Solutions operating margin increased 200 basis points to 17.6%, owing the positive contributions from price, productivity and mix, which offset inflation in the quarter. As we've seen in the past few quarters, Technical Solutions' profitable business grew, while the lower margin Infrastructure business declined.","We expect the top line to remain pressured in Technical Solutions, as an anticipated acceleration in second half industrial activity does not appear to be materializing. However, we anticipate further margin improvement as mix remains favorable and standardization efforts continue to gain momentum.","Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at Pentair's growth in the first half. Given the top line challenges that persist and continued mix of economic signs, we thought it would be helpful to provide an update on the trends in our key geographies in our 5 key verticals.","The U.S. has been a bright spot in the first half as the long-awaited North American residential recovery gains momentum. We've also seen improvements in our Infrastructure break and fix business, where backlogs remained steady for over 4 quarters. Canada has been slower with a number of delayed projects in Energy, but we've not seen many cancellations. Western Europe continues to send mix signals, but we saw modest growth in the second quarter after several quarters of decline.","While the European Residential & Commercial business remains weak, we've seen strength in Food & Beverage and are starting to see signs of stabilization in Infrastructure, or at least tougher comps flattening out. Fast growth regions have also been mixed with China declining, Southeast Asia and Latin America growing at a double-digit rate and the Middle East showing nice gains.","Looking within our 5 verticals, we still expect Energy sales to grow at a low-single-digit rate for the full year. Based on our backlogs, we see second half growth in oil and gas, power and mining. As we alluded to earlier in our Valves & Controls discussion, Energy will be the vertical with the most lumpiness due to project shipment timing.","Industrial has been a wild card all year and the anticipated second half acceleration does not appear to be materializing. The process business in Valves & Controls as backlog has shift, but the shorter cycle Technical Solution business continues to see customers pull their purse strings tight.","Residential & Commercial is finally a bright spot, which we don't get tired of saying that after a 6-year downturn that we've suffered in North American residential. While there is some second half seasonality that should contribute to the growth rate moderating, we still expect mid-single-digit growth in Residential & Commercial for the full year. We have yet to see much in the way of recovery in commercial construction, so we expect sales of residential customers to continue to drive the top line in this vertical.","Infrastructure sales have been tracking as expected for the year with the rate of decline moderating, while sales in Communications customers within Technical Solutions remains weak. We've seen Water & Fluid Solutions sales in North America post respectable growth, and European sales appear to be stabilizing after an 18-month contraction.","Finally, Food & Beverage remains a great story. We're seeing strong gains in all 3 of our focus areas in this space. Agriculture continues to post near double-digit gains, driven by demand in both irrigation and crop spray. Beverage is seeing strong demand, particularly within the beer industry. And Foodservice is having a good year as the business is well positioned with key customers that are expanding globally.","Now let's turn to Slide 9 for an update on our guidance. We're tightening our 2013 EPS guidance to a range of $3.15 to $3.25 from a range of $3.10 to $3.30. We've seen positives during the first half, such as better productivity and synergies, but the outlook for the top line remains murky. In particular, the lack of second half in acceleration in Industrial, as well as FX becoming a headwind, has led us to bring down the top end of our range by $0.05. At the same time, the elements within our control give us the confidence to raise the lower end of the range by $0.05.","Now let's turn to Slide 10 for first half recap and full year outlook. We delivered on our first half expectations as our proven operating disciplines help to offset the ongoing external challenges on the top line. As we enter the second half, we've seen signs that Europe is finally stabilizing but don't see that as a signal that it's returning to growth. We expect price to continue to offset inflation, synergies continue to move ahead of our initial expectations and our record backlog to contribute to growth in the second half.","As mentioned previously, the top line will also be negatively impacted by FX translation in the second half, which in addition to the small divestiture that occurred at the end of the first quarter, has led us to trim our revenue forecast by 1 point.","In the meantime, we continue to execute on the elements within our control and we expect operating margins to expand in excess of 150 basis points, putting us on track to deliver strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We've completed $825 million of our $1.2 billion authorized share repurchase program and we expect our free cash flow to be greater than 100% net income conversion for the year once again.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John L. Stauch","Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide #11 titled Q3 2013 Pentair Outlook. For Q3, we are introducing guidance of $1.9 billion in revenue, around $245 million of operating income or about 13% ROS, and adjusted EPS of $0.83 to $0.87. There are a couple of meaningful assumptions built into this estimate. The first assumption is that what we do not see any sizable acceleration in global industrial shipments and that the current sluggish trends continue. The second assumption takes into account that we are expecting some shift in revenue from Q3 into Q4 in the legacy Flow Control businesses as we change our fiscal year end from September to December to align with the Pentair fiscal year end. Inclusive of these 2 events, we expect Q3 revenue will increase 1% to 2% for Pentair, with Water & Fluid up around 3% to 4%, inclusive of a couple of points of year-over-year project headwinds in the Australian pipe services business.","We expect Valves & Controls revenue to increase around 1%, inclusive of an estimated 2 to 3 points of shifted revenue from Q3 to Q4 due to the change in fiscal year end. And finally, we are forecasting Technical Solutions revenue down about 1% as we continue to experience a more subdued industrial recovery than previously anticipated and delays in larger projects within the oil sands at Canada.","We expect to begin to see a more pronounced expansion of operating margins across all segments as synergies accelerate, especially with contributions from sourcing and Lean and easier year-over-year comparisons. Overall, we expect adjusted EPS to be up greater than 20% with the tax rate still hovering around 25%, in line with the original guidance, an interest of around $16 million and share count of around 202 million.","Please turn to Slide #12, labeled Quarterly Linearity of Earnings, where I will describe briefly our view of the back half EPS estimates. On the top part of the page, we have laid out the 2011 and 2012 pro forma Q2 to Q3 operating income change and the 2013 forecasted Q2 to Q3 expectation. As you can see, Q3 of 2013 is expected to follow the same pattern as 2012. On the bottom, we have laid out some of the assumptions and shared with you our most seasonally affected businesses and their typical best to worst quarters. We hope you find this information helpful.","Please turn to Slide 13, where I will spend a few moments on our expectations for synergies and the internal funnels that help fuel our confidence. On the top left-hand side of Page 13, you could see our expected sourcing savings, our 2015 goal is $20 million. By the end of 2013, we will have realized 50% of our goal and have a growing funnel of projects. We have shared with you that we have been conservative in our sourcing expectation due to the fact that there is both expected base performance and expected synergies that are required.","We feel we have a solid sourcing foundation and global commodity teams that have been expanded into our new businesses and we are seeing great success in many global commodities, a few that we have listed for you, and across all major processes. We are very confident that we will exceed expectations and are muting our external goals only because we are not able to predict the inflation headwinds that may be ahead of us and the impact that it could have on our results.","On the lower left, we have shared with you our goals for Lean savings. We are targeting $45 million by 2015 and are forecasting that we will be around 100 -- or $10 million by the end of 2013. Again, fairly conservative expectations given our track record, our internal talent and our processes that are now embedded in the new businesses.","Our internal goal is $115 million, which would yield $1 million in savings per plant over a 3-year horizon, well below our experience. Again, these savings are needed for both base performance and synergies, so we are guarding against double counting and false victory by keeping our expectations lower.","On the top of Page 14, we have shared our external expectations for back-office standardization and repositioning. Our repositioning actions have already yielded an expected $85 million in savings for 2013, but we are just beginning the journey of simplifying the businesses to reduce waste and improve the customer experience. We are targeting internally a 2%-plus reduction in overall G&A, driven by efficiency of reduced complexity and standard working processes in the areas of ERP systems, data centers, legal entities, IT applications and accounting and payroll centers.","A few of our businesses are well down the path in this journey and the others will catch up. Doing this correctly and swiftly will allow us to make acquisitions in the future in our best growth platforms, which should be immediately accretive due to these efforts.","And the last bucket we have listed is our operating income expectations from expected revenue synergies. We are forecasting no net contribution in 2013, as most of our significant progress has gone to the funding the next wave of initiatives and investments in fast growth regions. Our current funnel of opportunities in recent wins are sample of the enthusiasm that is growing within our businesses for collaborating and sharing opportunities to enhance overall revenue but more importantly, to satisfy our key customer needs.","A few examples include: Recent wins in Brazil, where Thermal Management used a local equipment protection facility to secure a $5 million order where local content was required; an example of the systems business in Australia specifying Pentair membranes in all of their latest wins around water treatment; and the Valves & Controls business partnering with our Energy business in filtration and process around oil filtration capabilities; and finally, continued success with over $10 million of orders so far this year secured in Food & Beverage by expanding the breadth of products sold to existing customers.","Overall, we are on track to deliver our 2013 synergy targets and have 60% of the 2015 synergy secured and are accelerating the pipeline every day with new ideas.","Please turn to Slide 15, while I briefly touch on the synergies by quarter. This slide has become standard and it briefly brings you up to speed on our synergies by quarter realized and our forecasted synergies for Q3, Q4 and the full year. We delivered $29 million in synergies in Q2 versus a forecast of $25 million. The upside was from more cost takeout and we are pleased that help drive results to the upside of our Q2 guidance. As we head into the back half of the year, we will begin to see the sourcing and Lean savings accelerate as it begins to work through inventory and into the P&L.","For the full year, we are updating our synergy expectation to $105 million from $100 million, reflecting the Q2 beat. This should provide an exit rate of $140 million plus in annualized savings for 2014, or 60% of the 2015 target of $230 million.","Please turn to Slide 16 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. We had a very nice quarter as free cash flow was $331 million for the quarter, driven by over $80 million in working capital improvement. We still have substantial room for further improvement in our cash metrics in the legacy flow control businesses, and we are rolling out our receivable and payable policies and processes to them, as well as directing many Lean projects towards targeted inventory reduction.","On the debt side, we ended at $2.7 billion outstanding debt as we accelerated $343 million of share buybacks into the quarter. We have now completed $875 million of our targeted $1.2 billion of authorized share purchases. We are expecting $650 million of free cash flow for the full year. When we complete the final balance sheet adjustments in Q3, we'll bring back the measurement of ROIC into our cash metrics page as we are keenly aware of the importance of that key measurement.","Please turn to my final slide, Slide #17, labeled Full Year 2013 Pentair Outlook. For the full year, we are expecting $7.5 billion in revenue. As Randy mentioned earlier, this is on track excluding the impacts of the Aspen motors divestiture and an anticipated headwind from FX in the second half. This will drive organic sales growth for the year of greater than 3%, with a 5% to 6% growth in Water & Fluid Solutions, inclusive of pipe and services project headwinds; 1% to 2% organic growth in Valves & Controls; and flat to 1% growth in Technical Solutions. Overall, operating margins are expected to increase 160 basis points to 12.5%, and overall EPS is expected to be up greater than 25% at the midpoint of the range.","With that, I will turn it back over to Randy who will summarize and then we will open up for questions. Randy?","Randall J. Hogan","Thanks, John. My summary, my last page is on Slide 18. In closing, we delivered on our first half commitments and we will remain well positioned to meet our 2013 full year goals. While the anticipated second half acceleration in Industrial and a growing FX headwinds have dampened our top line expectations, we continue to see strength in North American residential and Food & Beverage in addition to backlog in Energy that remain strong.","Our integration and standardization efforts continue to build momentum and we now expect $105 million in synergies in 2013 versus our original target of $90 million. We're pleased with the success of the integration so far and realize that there is still a lot of work to be done, but the adoption of PIMS within the Flow Control businesses continues to exceed our expectations as we evolve into one Pentair.","Thank you, and operator, can we please take our first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question is from Michael Halloran with Robert W. Baird.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So could you just dig in a little bit to the Food & Beverage strength, and specifically what areas you're seeing it in? And also, if there's any tie-in to some of the things that you're doing with Tyco on the Food & Beverage side and any of the revenue synergies there that might be developing?","Randall J. Hogan","Sure. In what we call Food & Beverage, we have 3 focus areas. One is agriculture, where we have 2 positions, which is basically irrigation, largely North American-related and then crop spray, which is on tractor, on equipment spray technologies, that is actually a global business. We have what we call our beverage business, which is supporting the manufacturers, if you will, of Food & Beverage. And then we have the Foodservice business, predominately our Everpure brand that supports the restaurants and other foodservice players. All 3 of those businesses grew double digit. Irrigation has been -- irrigation and crop spray has been a strong focus of ours, and that growth is coming in North America and is the strength of the farm communities, essentially it's driving those, as well as the nice global initiatives with some of the winning OEMs. If you recall last year in the beverage side, basically dairy and soda and beer, last year was a tougher year where the projects we're in -- we were working on a lot of projects but they weren't shipment. This year, we won a lot of those and they're doing very well. Dairy in North America is very strong, as well as beer. Not so much in the developed markets, but in the developing markets, particularly Africa and Southeast Asia, the beer industry is growing very rapidly. And we have leading technologies in that arena. Also in that arena is where we are getting the synergies. John mentioned $10 million of orders to date because of the synergistic offerings we have between our membrane technologies, our hygienic valves and the broad valve line that came from Tyco, and that's where the $10 million win. So the synergies are helping there. And then finally, Foodservice. We are the strategic partner for the leaders and we have a lot of very state-of-the-art systems that they're adopting as standards. And as they grow globally, we're winning with them. So that's been a focus of ours for a long time, as you know since 2003 actually, when we bought Everpure. And it's nice to see it all working.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then the follow-up on the order side for the Valve business. Could you maybe just talk a little bit about the underlying momentum you're seeing there on the quoting and the bidding side? And what your team is saying for how they expect some of that to materialize as you get to the back half of the year and specifically, in the energy and power-oriented end markets?","Randall J. Hogan","Ill provide some texture for your and then John can add in. One of the things we've seen is fewer larger projects and a lot more smaller projects. That's reading out in service volume, it's reading out in MRO. And as we've said, we've seen more process bidding in the U.S. as capital, particularly for the chemical industry, cap spending in North America versus other areas has been rising. So we're seeing bidding activity there. I mentioned oil and gas is strong but lumpy quarter-to-quarter. And it's mostly upstream activity that we're involved in. There's a lot of midstream activity, but that's an area, I think, where we need to grow share. And then power, where we're the leader, we have a decent backlog. There's lots of activity in the developing world, we'd like to some of that to break free to shift. So John, if you'd add anything.","John L. Stauch","No. I think you covered it. I think, I'll just add to Randy's point, that I think it's not as predictable as certainly our business and we would like, but we're still seeing nice orders and we're still experiencing right now, record backlog.","Randall J. Hogan","Yes. One thing I'd say is the new organization that has been put in place has really clarified and simplified some of the decision-making there, so we're -- I mentioned in the script that we're seeing an improvement in the margin and backlog. We felt to shift some what I would call ugly projects that we've taken with more revenue in mind than margin. That's the process that's been fixed. But we still have to mind some of that through the backlog into sales over the rest of the balance of the year.","Operator","Your next question is from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So I just want -- just to be clear on Valves & Controls, is the shift that you're seeing 3Q to 4Q more because of the organizational change or because of projects moving around?","John L. Stauch","We think it's this simple, Jeff. I mean they had a Q3 fiscal year end and as you know, there is always a push for incentives and to ship as anything you can and book as many orders as you can by the end of whatever your fiscal year end is. The natural year end in this business, because it's a capital spending across an annual cycle, would normally be the Q4.","Randall J. Hogan","It would be the calendar Q4 like all the customers.","John L. Stauch","So what we're anticipating is that we will see a likely revenues that might have been accelerated into Q3, follow their natural course of action and likely land in Q4.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in Water, it looks like you're calling for core growth kind of in line with the first half or maybe a little bit lower, yet the comps are a lot easier in the second half versus what you went against in the first half. So is that, again, timing of shipments in some of this Food & Beverage stuff or are you seeing some deceleration in some of those businesses into the second half?","John L. Stauch","No. We're seeing strength across all of the -- what would be the legacy Pentair Water businesses. The only area that we have a little bit of headwind, Jeff, is we picked up a Water business in Australia, which is part of the Flow Control businesses. And there is a lack of projects in the backlog right now, primarily because most of the mining projects are being pushed into next year. So we don't have -- so we had a year-over-year headwind, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, relative to that item, and everything else is continued strength.","Operator","Your next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with MKM Partners.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Just to begin again on the Food & Beverage and the visibility there. I mean, it seems like that was a bit of maybe an unexpected tailwind this quarter, at least, versus what you had in first quarter '13. You're kind of doubling the growth rate through the balance of the year. And I think for such a small business, in the grand scheme of things, to add, I think on the consolidated basis, the point to full year growth. I'm just trying to understand, does visibility take you through the end of the year? Are there a chance -- is there a chance that you could get more project push and pull there quarter-by-quarter? Obviously, people are still grappling with the seasonality and I think so much volatility in the small business, any color there would be helpful.","Randall J. Hogan","Sure. Because of the range of different areas we're in, some of them are fairly short cycle. The irrigation business is sold through distribution and it's a shorter cycle business in North America versus the brewery business, which is -- we've got those scheduled out a number of quarters. We've got good visibility in that. So it's really kind of a mix. When you think of -- when I think about the strategy that's informed everything we've done to focus our company on going after the billions of new middle class people and the demands they're going to drive, this has been a big focus. And I wouldn't say that -- and certainly, 25% growth in this segment was a little probably higher than we would have forecast, and I'd like to get to used to forecasting that, but I don't think we forecasted that business for the second half, have we, John?","John L. Stauch","No.","Randall J. Hogan","The same rate.","John L. Stauch","Mid-teens.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Got you. That's helpful. And then just on the synergies. I think I asked last quarter as well, it's probably a little too early. But any more color you can provide on what the bridge may look like between the $105 million in synergies this year and the $230 million in 2015? And how we should think about 2014 as the bridge between 2?","John L. Stauch","Yes. I think I mentioned in my remarks, we're at $105 million and we're exiting at $140 million plus. The plus would mean that we expect to realize $140 million of synergies from the exit rate of Q4, there, Josh. Plus, if you take a look into the financials, we also took some incremental restructuring initiatives this quarter, which will not likely benefit us until 2014. Obviously, we want to get as much as quickly as possible for 2 reasons. One is we want to make sure that, that's the tailwind for us and the second reason is we're driving the standardization across the GBUs for if and when we can do acquisitions again that they can become synergistic and quickly accretive. So there's a push to get that as sooner rather than later as far as the total synergies. And by the way, there's no governor on what the total synergies can be. And as we were trying to hint, we've got a clear pipeline that should take us higher than the $230 million that we're driving to.","Operator","Your next question is from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","First question on the Page 20 of the reconciliation, you do mention the restructuring. It looks like you're saying it's complete for the year. Why is it 0 for 3Q and 4Q?","John L. Stauch","We don't have anything quantified at the moment, Steve. It doesn't mean we wouldn't continue to look at opportunities. I mean, I think every time we meet and learn more about these businesses we see more opportunity around the corner. And definitely if we're going to see a flatter industrial cycle over the horizon, we'll likely go back for more. But right now we don't have anything quantified and we don't have any specific projects in the pipeline.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Even in getting to that full $230 million number?","John L. Stauch","Yes. I mean, I think in the $230 million, I mean our goal would be if we look at '14 and certainly in '15, we've set aside what we call this integration standardization team budget and we should be able to handle annual restructuring within that context as we drive to the '14 and '15 numbers.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then second question on your margin breakout, you had 20 points on volume leverage, 260 price productivity mix and 160 offset on inflation. With 4% growth and even looking at minus 4 in Technical Solutions, I would have thought my math on a higher fixed cost base would have gotten me a slightly more significant margin on the volume side. And then maybe just give us a sense for productivity within that price productivity mix, just a little bit of breakout there to get a sense for what's really happening as a result of operations as opposed to sort of pricing or mix?","John L. Stauch","Yes. I think all your math is accurate. So the only 2 items that I would bring some color to, which were negative mix impacts or negative productivity is we were down double-digit in our Residential & Commercial EMEA business, that's a highly profitable business for us. So that's inclusive on that negative productivity or negative volume impact, Steve. And then the second one is, some of these beverage projects, these large systems that we are putting into the new breweries do bring through a little bit lower margin than when we get the replacement membranes through those systems. So those would be the only 2 things that I would add in addition to the math that you went through.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","One question, one follow-up as requested. What's your confidence, Randy, in being able to sustain positive price for the rest of the year?","Randall J. Hogan","One of the measures we always do when we talk about being in business where we can pull our own destinies, one of the proof positives of that is your ability to get some price. In our businesses that go through distribution, which are a lot of the ones that are growing right now, the Foodservice business, the Residential business, the irrigation business, the Aquatics business, through distribution, it's good structure, there's been no changes in competitive dynamics that would indicate to me that we shouldn't be able to sustain price there. The area that's always -- it's difficult to calculate price is in the project area. So in the project area, Food & Beverage, and the larger bids in Valves & Controls and Thermal, what we look there is that's why we're tracking margin in backlog. It's hard to say whether it's price, but the important thing is to get margin. So I feel good about our disciplines around price and I feel confident in our focus on price.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great. The follow-up question is probably more for John. John, the productivity target, forgetting about the synergies, but over and above that, the productivity target of 100 basis points per year in each side, the Pentair side and the Tyco side, has that changed at all? Are you tracking along the 100 basis points of your core block-and-tackle type of productivity in each business?","John L. Stauch","Yes. Scott, I mean, I think we're looking at about 160 basis points a year and we went public saying about 80 basis points a year from core and 80 basis points from the synergies and standardization. And against that 80, I'd say absolutely. And I think we feel like there's more on the court, too. I mean if we get more revenue growth or see more quarters of 4% and above, we should be inching that base higher than what we're targeting because volume leverage is a very powerful thing.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes. Fair enough. You always did say roughly 100, I think that you're probably rounding up, so 80. So it's on track, nothing has changed?","John L. Stauch","No.","Operator","Your next question is from Deane Dray with Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On North American water, maybe give us some color regarding some of the dynamics and product lines, this is one of the wettest periods that the Northeast certainly has seen in years, was there an impact? I know it's a lower margin on the sump pump side, and maybe comment how the spring selling season in full went?","Randall J. Hogan","The wet North East in particular was -- it slowed Aquatics a little bit, but not much. And it's certainly was a benefit in our Flow Technologies business. They had strong -- they had good double-digit mid-teens kind of growth, largely driven by flood-related Residential & Commercial spending. Interesting aside, right now, globally, we have about 50 projects that we're working on, on flood protection. And these are large projects, obviously, more along the lines of what we've done in New Orleans and other places like that, in The Netherlands. So flood continues to be the good focus for ours. But Aquatics, our market share position and because of our leadership and technology and innovation in Aquatics, we do really well within a lot of pools, and that's the South. So they were less impacted by -- they actually had a slow start to weather-wise in the South, but it wasn't quite as impactful as -- if we had just been focused in the Northeast.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And what was Aquatics year-over-year?","Randall J. Hogan","In the quarter?","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes.","John L. Stauch","We're up high-teens. And just to add to Randy's, and I think this was in his remarks. I mean, the North American residential segment as a whole grew low-double digits. So we saw that strength and clearly we had some easier comparisons on retail, in flow, and so those were up very, very strong. And even Filtration and Processes, Water softener market was up nearly 5%, which that's only the second quarter in a row now that we've seen that growth and that's a later cycle.","Randall J. Hogan","Yes. It's a later cycle recovery kind of product line. But I mean, yes, North America, I mentioned in the script that Residential & Commercial was up 8%, that was Europe down. So North America resi itself was up 12% to 14% overall in the quarter.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then a follow-up on Page 13, when you go through the key internal funnel, the $115 million. There's a line in there with a checkmark that says Pentair experience has been on a factory greater than $2 million in savings. And you've made a reference to the $1 million assumption, and I remember that was from the initial Tyco facilities. You're just showing that -- I'm trying to reconcile the $2 million, $2 million is what you've gotten previously in sort of the PIMS initiatives and showing that the $1 million assumption is conservative, is that...","John L. Stauch","It's obviously an average, but yes -- you can read into it that, that is below our experience level and we'd be disappointed if we only achieved that result.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right. That's helpful. And just lastly, the buybacks in the quarter that pace, do you expect to be able to continue that pace carried into next year?","John L. Stauch","I don't think it will be that pace. We haven't figured out what we're going to do yet, but we felt that it made sense to accelerate the buybacks given what we are looking at in the acquisition funnel and...","Randall J. Hogan","And the good cash flow.","John L. Stauch","And the good cash flow that we had. Obviously, we'll take a look at what Q2 and Q3 and the remainder of the segments look like, look at it at the appropriate time.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But you have the authorization and the cash flow to support that level if you wanted, though?","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, to the $1.2 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Randy, I was hoping you could give some more color on the second half industrial reacceleration not materializing. I assume that's broad-based? And any particular regions where it's worse than expectation? And also any views on further destocking and what you're seeing in July?","Randall J. Hogan","Sure. Let me parse it between the different segments. In the process area of Valves & Controls, we actually see some decent order activity and it's largely in the chemical arena and largely because of the low energy cost we talked about. Our second half assumption is around our Hoffman brand, the profitable juggernaut, if you will, of our Technical Products business, was that we would see the same kind of continuation in order rates. And as we mentioned, June went down. I wish we had better visibility and that's also through distribution. Right now, we just don't see the capital spending breaking out. So what we had was, we had a very profitable segment, a very profitable product line in Hoffman, where we didn't feel comfortable that we had the visibility on the base towards -- to continue with that base assumption that we'd see Industrial up 3% to 5% in the second half. So that's really what it is. I don't think that there's been a major draw down. We don't think there's been a major drawdown in inventory. We have really good visibility on our inventory in the channel. The thing that I've asked our business to do is find out we can see publicly which distributors are performing and we have a few peers left that we can track in terms of their growth. And seeing if we have been active enough in managing our distribution coverage to make sure that we are getting the add back where markets are growing. And that's an area where I'm not yet comfortable. We have adequate recovery, I'd say in the Bakken or some others that should be growing.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And just the follow-up would be on the Valves business. Could you give some color on what you're seeing on the aftermarket side for the Valves business? Some of your peer group is seeing some deferred maintenance still amongst customers, are you seeing that or it seems like your business is doing better on share gain? Any color there?","Randall J. Hogan","I don't know if it's that we're in different segments than our peers. But right now, as I mentioned, our service business is up, MRO is up. Now we have a strong focus on it. One of the beauties of the new organization is the clarity of focus we're getting on different areas and the teams rallying together really nicely. They really are running it as one valves team. And in particular, actually, we see the opposite in mining. We see a lot of the activity, particularly in Australia, moving since capital is down, we're seeing maintenance up, which makes sense right now. If you're not replacing equipment, you've got to maintain the equipment you've got. So I think it really depends on where your exposure is as to what you're seeing -- since mining, we've had a lot of focus on where we're losing -- where we're not seeing large projects, focusing a lot on smaller projects. And I think that helped us in MRO and I hope with share gain, but I don't know enough about the business yet to be confident in saying it is or not.","John L. Stauch","Just to follow-up on Randy's point real quickly. I mean, I think where we're seeing deferrals is in the larger projects. Then we continue to see those larger projects, as many of our other peers have said, being pushed out now. Now Randy and I were also talking that in the industrial space, the capital is at an all-time borrowing rates low, IRR is a really high on putting capital to work. And with the threat of increasing interest rates, at what particular point in time are we going to see that breakthrough, that's not in our forecast right now. But that's what we're monitoring and keeping an eye on.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","John, I think you had mentioned, there was a question previously by Steve talking about the conversion of the core business and you highlighted the Water & Fluid component. But actually, the Valves & Controls piece, it looks like the core conversion was fairly modest as well. Maybe can you address that? Was there something unusual in the quarter? And maybe how do we think about normalized conversion rates in that, excluding productivity and price and others?","John L. Stauch","Yes. I think Randy mentioned this earlier. We do have a few larger projects that are in the backlog that are working their way through, and they will probably be working their way through Q2, Q3 and Q4. Those were won previously. And as Randy also mentioned earlier, we've changed our focus to be more of making sure that we've got a better insight into what the margin backlog is. And quite frankly, our margin backlog is higher now, so that bodes well for the future. But what we've got is a little bit of the shipment that we still have to get.","Randall J. Hogan","It's like heartburn.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay, I got it.","Randall J. Hogan","We're working through the system.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","I see. And then actually, you mentioned FX, a headwind in the second half of the year. That just seems kind of contrary to what we see with the Europe for sure. I mean, why is that a headwind? Are there other significant exposures we should be thinking about for Pentair's business?","John L. Stauch","Yes. Two particular currencies. One is the Australian dollar, which is a big piece of this on $1 billion or so of Australian business we have in both Valves & Controls, the legacy Pentair businesses and also the flow or the pipe and systems business was inside of legacy flow. And the second currency would be the euro. And we did do this forecast at about $1.29. I do recognize that, that's slightly below where the current euro-dollar is. This was factored on about $1.29.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Can I slip one more, a quick one in? You mentioned process actually it's good in North America because of net gas, but Asia, I think the second quarter in a row you said it was weak, maybe you could touch on the trends there and all...","Randall J. Hogan","Well, it's really China. I mean, China for Valves & Controls and processes is down. And it's the slower capital spending that's going on there. We have a pretty substantial business there in Valves & Controls. And the rest of Southeast Asia is good. So it's really specific to China that's flowing. I mean, and I think everyone is talking about that.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Do you think China is actually pulling back because of the build in North America or is just an issue of the internal funding mechanisms?","Randall J. Hogan","I think it has more to do with just the general slowing of industrial activity there and them getting overshot. Most -- I think, every industry always puts in too much. When the growth rate changes, you really -- you have a bunch of capacity that gets put online that you don't need as soon as you thought. I mean it was true in the power industry in the U.S. and basically every -- happened to the pulp and paper industry over time, but I digress.","Operator","Your next question is from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Actually a follow-up to the last question on China and the fast-growth markets in the back half of the year. It was up 2% year-to-date for fast growth overall. Just wondering what your expectations are for the second half of the year in those regions?","John L. Stauch","Yes. And I'd say we've got it closer to high-single digits in Q3 and Q4. And I think the main reason for that, as Randy mentioned earlier, some of our fast-growth region volume is more project-oriented or related to where the orders in the backlog and the timing of that backlog is. So we do have forecasted higher single digits for fast-growth regions in total for the second half of the year.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And those would be non-China markets, I'd assume, is that correct?","John L. Stauch","Well, China would be a part of that as well. I mean one of the markets in China that's big for is power. And we've been building the backlog and throughout the last 3 or 4 quarters, and we do expect those projects to ship in the second half.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then just lastly, just on the full year guidance. First half of the year, you had exceeded your midpoint both quarters and you maintained the midpoint for the full year guidance, albeit narrowing the range. I can appreciate that you have more conservative revenue outlook that you cited because of the divestiture, plus FX. It seems like industrial is slowing a little bit, but Water does appear to be accelerating. Just wondering if you could walk us through your thinking on maintaining the guidance despite the strong first half of the year?","Randall J. Hogan","Yes. I would say it's less conservatism and it's more experientially-based. We always know it can go well. But we always know stuff goes wrong. And since we don't know what's going to go wrong, we're twice bitten, one shy. Once bitten, twice shy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair.","Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I think it was mentioned that some of the projects in backlog, some of your businesses are at lower margin than average and some are at higher margin, I think John just mentioned. Can you give us a sense for what the average margin of orders and backlog is relative to the 13.7% that you did this quarter?","John L. Stauch","I can tell you that the standard margin in backlog is about 1 point higher in the outlook than it will shift. So if I take a look at 2014 and beyond, it's about 1 point higher than what we'll finish shipping in 2013. And it's related to 3 or 4 larger projects or one about what, 18 months ago, Randy? And those projects are at a very, very low margin. And as Randy mentioned, we've changed that behavior to be more margin-focused, and so I think we have a richer more favorable backlog as we go forward.","Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then the legacy Tyco thermal controls business, I know it's about 10% of your sales after the merger, I believe. You mentioned some delays in that business, but are you seeing cancellations, is the oil sands business slowing? And what does the pipeline look like there?","Randall J. Hogan","Yes. We referenced Canada. It is the oil sands that have slowed down and we had impact there in the quarter. Year-over-year, there was a really large shipment in the oil sands a year ago that wasn't in the number this year. That was the big Energy down, if you will, in that business. That business has done a nice job growing the smaller businesses though, and nice improvements in profitability in that. So we think most of those progress will go. And when they go, we'll do fine. But in the meantime, we'll grow elsewhere.","Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So growth in that business over the next 18 months or how is the pipeline?","John L. Stauch","Yes. Just to remind everybody, what we did was we did go in and pro forma the financials for the thermal business, excluding megaprojects or large projects. So our forecast and the way we're looking at it is primarily base projects and product shipments. And as Randy mentioned, we believe we can grow mid to single digits at that business. And then these particular large projects that we're talking about, they would be phenomenal to have. But we don't have to have them in the way you described it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up to the -- a couple of follow-ups but to the last question. Just to be a little bit clearer on the Canadian business and the expectation for thermal. Did that imply we don't have any major projects coming in through the third quarter on a year-over-year basis?","John L. Stauch","That's correct, yes. There is no major projects in our Q3 or Q4 outlook.","Randall J. Hogan","One of the things that, and this is actually kind of fun, one of the things that we're doing as we come to be one Pentair is really to establish a set of principles around how we build the business and forecast it. And anything that we really don't control our own destiny, have really high visibility, let's put those above the forecast. And that's where the philosophy of these megaprojects that John just talk about it came from. We love them when they have it. But we're going to build a business were that's more than gravy. On top of...","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I can appreciate there's a lot of legacy business that you did not have. And if we look at the Australian business, what was the drag on that business? And was the pipe business profitable in the quarter?","John L. Stauch","Yes. It's actually a very profitable piece of the overall business. It's just that there is not a lot of large projects in the backlog and\/or in the shipments now. And as you know, the business can cycle up and down from, call it, 10%-ish margins to 20%, 25% at the peak. So towards the bottom of that assumption. And we think there's a political situation that's got to unwind itself as far as the tax on the mining groups. And as that unwinds, we're hopeful that the future is a lot better than the current environment that we're participating in.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And to be clear, that's a component of why you expect the Water & Fluid Solutions to step down in terms of year-over-year growth?","John L. Stauch","That's correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just to follow-up on that, the synergy and funnel comments. Would you -- I mean as you identified this additional funnel opportunities, is that something you think of as upside in '14 and 15? Or upside beyond '15'?","John L. Stauch","Well, Jeff, I think not to confuse you, but here's the way to look at it. When we look at the sourcing in Lean, there's both a base and a synergy. And as we've said before, it's hard to track what truly is a synergy sometimes versus what's the base expectation. So we have productivity funnels. We need those productivity funnels, and we've driving gross margin and making sure that volume is leveraged appropriately. Clearly, when we look at the operating margin of Pentair and we look at the operating margin of our businesses, there's a substantial amount of opportunity between where we are and where our benchmark peer groups will be at. And we're not going to lose sight of that opportunity and what we're really trying to do and Randy was talking to me yesterday, we have to drive the business models. And that business model creates that opportunity and these are rich pipelines, but I think they're going to continue to get richer as we go forward.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. But the $230 million is what's in your $5 number?","John L. Stauch","That's correct.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And so the 160 over is upside opportunity?","John L. Stauch","It would be if all realized, correct.","Randall J. Hogan","All realized below the base, yes. The point, Jeff, is that -- and you can even think about the $105 million versus the $90 million as higher yield of either productivity or synergies. And frankly, I mean, different because what we want to do is build business plans in each of these segments that incorporate both, right. And that's victory. That's only victory if it reads out at the bottom line. So we can't have higher synergies and lower productivity or vice versa. So that's the way we think about it. And that's what John was describing.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Randy, we had spoken over the last 6 months about you getting to the point in June or July where you expect to arrive at some conclusions with regard to several of the businesses that might fit better with other owners. How has that thinking progressed in the current environment? How should we think about that going forward?","Randall J. Hogan","Well, right now, we never don't think about that and you're right, I did say, I always put things out 6 months, that's probably what I did when I said that. But we're always looking at how things that -- right now, we're going through a process in our strategy where we're looking at dozens and dozens of platforms and looking at the priorities. And at the end of that process, we'll decide where we are. But in particular, a lot of people asked about Australia. As we've gotten into Australia, we look at it we're sort of at the bottom of a cycle in terms of mining and domestic water spending. So we're finding some nice synergies and we're finding some people who are really buying into what we're doing in Pentair, we've taken some cost structure out. So I think it's a better business than I might have thought going in.","All right. Thank you all. And operator, could you give the feedback or the call back number? Thanks.","Operator","Thank you for joining today, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. And for replay, the number that you would need to dial, okay, it looks like this call wasn't set up with an encore record line.","Randall J. Hogan","It's in the press release.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Lucas, you may begin your conference.","Jim Lucas","Thanks, Kathy, and welcome to Pentair's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. And with me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Borin, our Chief Financial Officer.","On today's call, we will provide details on our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 performance, as well as our first quarter and full-year 2019 outlook as outlined in this morning's press release.","Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-Q, Form 10-K, and today's press release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone an opportunity to ask their questions.","I will now turn the call over to John.","John Stauch","Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide number four, titled Executive Summary. 2018 was a very busy year for Pentair, and one we are very proud of. We completed the successful separation of nVent to shareholders, we developed a detailed and executable residential and commercial water treatment strategy, and we overdrove our 2018 commitments despite the impact of tariffs and inflation. In addition to financial performance, we returned nearly $700 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Our cash generation remains strong, and our balance sheet is in great shape.","To start 2019, we announced agreements for two strategic acquisitions that will help us advance our residential and commercial water treatment strategy. After Mark discusses our financial performance, I will speak more about these two deals. We are very pleased with what we believe was a successful 2018 for Pentair, and we continue to believe we are well-positioned for 2019 and beyond.","Please turn to slide five, labeled Financial Highlights. Before turning the call over to Mark, I wanted to spend a moment reviewing some of the highlights for the quarter and the year. In the fourth quarter, we saw core sales grow 6%, and our adjusted EPS grow 15%. For the full-year, our sales grew 5%. We expanded our return on sales 60 basis points, while making a number of strategic growth investments to position us for the longer term. Adjusted EPS grew 21%, and we generated over $400 million in free cash flow.","For 2019, we expect core sales to grow 4% to 5%, segment income to increase 8% to 12%, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share, an increase of 6% to 11%. Once again, we are targeting free cash flow to approximate adjusted net income.","While we expect some of the headwinds we face in 2018, mostly inflation to continue, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver on our commitments once again as we anticipate consistency, predictability, and sustained performance to return to Pentair.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mark to discuss the fourth quarter results and provide more details on our full-year 2019 outlook before I provide an update on our key strategic growth initiatives.","Mark Borin","Thank you, John. Please turn to slide six, labeled Full Year 2018 Pentair Performance. As John mentioned, core sales grew 5% for the full-year. Our Aquatic Systems businesses led the way with robust 11% core sales growth, while both the Filtration and Flow segments contributed low single-digit core sales growth for the full-year.","Segment income increased 8%, while ROS expanded 60 basis points to 18.1%. We are particularly pleased with our segment income and ROS performance for the year given the significant inflation headwinds we faced. Adjusted EPS grew 21% to $2.35 per share, which exceeded our initial 2018 guidance of $2.20 to $2.30 per share set last February. Finally, we generated over $400 million in free cash flow. With strong core sales growth, ROS expansion, and adjusted EPS growth, we were very pleased with our full-year 2018 performance.","Now, turn to slide seven, labeled Q4 '18 Pentair Performance. For the fourth quarter, we reported core sales growth of 6%, ROS expansion of 40 basis points to 18.1%, and adjusted EPS growth of 15% to $0.60 per share. We will provide more color on the individual segment performance shortly. Below the line, we saw an adjusted tax rate of 18%, net interest\/other expense of $6 million, and our average shares in the quarter were 174 million. As we mentioned at the beginning of the call, we bought back another 100 million of stock in the quarter.","Please turn to slide eight, labeled Q4 '18 Pentair Segment Performance. This slide lays out the fourth quarter performance of our three segments. Aquatic Systems delivered another strong quarter with 13% core sales growth and 10% segment income growth. We do believe that some of our distributors likely pulled forward some sales in an effort to beat the impact of our price increases. We believe Aquatics remains well-positioned entering 2019, and its industry dynamics remain favorable. Core sales were flat in Filtration Solutions, with segment income growing 8% and return on sales expanding 170 basis points to 17.9%.","Throughout 2018, we have been refocusing our filtration business to be less depended on lower margin lumpy project business and instead focused on our core component and systems businesses. Although the top line trends were less favorable than in 2018, we were pleased with the income and margin performance of this segment.","Flow Technologies reported 4% core sales growth, which represented its fifth consecutive quarter of improved sales performance. The segment income performance was adversely affected by rebate activity as increased volume levels in front of price increases occurred in the quarter. Overall, Flow Technologies is entering 2019 with its price realization more in line with the increased inflationary pressures that materialized in the second-half of 2018.","Please turn to slide nine, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. We are very pleased with the results of 2018 as we significantly reduced our debt levels, while returning nearly $700 million to shareholders. We ended 2018 with our net debt to EBITDA leverage at less than 1.5 times. Shortly before the end of 2018, we announced a 3% dividend increase for 2019, which will mark our 43rd consecutive year of dividend increases.","We announced agreements for two acquisitions that when completed we expect to invest $280 million. Although we do see some seasonal cash usage in the first quarter each year, we believe we remain well-positioned to invest in our core businesses, look at attractive strategically aligned tuck-in or bolt-on acquisition targets, and continue to return cash to shareholders.","Please turn to slide 10, labeled Full Year 2019 Outlook. Today we are introducing our 2019 outlook. We expect core sales to grow 4% to 5% which is comprised of about 3% of price and 1% to 2% of volume. We expect total sales growth of 5% to 6% with roughly 3% contribution from the recently announced acquisition, offset by 1% headwind from FX and another point headwind from divestures. We anticipate segment income growing 8% to 12% inclusive of acquisitions. While inflation is anticipated to remain a headwind, we expect price to principally offset inflation for the full-year and productivity to provide to our improved performance. We are introducing an adjusted EPS range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share, an increase of 6% to 11%.","Other items embedded in our guidance include corporate expense of $60 million to $65 million, a tax rate of 20.5%, net interest\/other expense of $37 million, and an average share count for the year of approximately 172 million shares. We wanted to provide some additional color on a few items. First, the increase in corporate expense is reflective of how we allocate some of our cost in addition to four quarters of our new structure as 2018 represented just three quarters given the timing of the separation of nVent last April.","Next, we are guiding our 2019 tax rate to increase to 20.5%, but this requires some further explanation. Late in 2018, the IRS proposed new regulations that if approved as final could present a headwind to our current tax rate of 18%. These proposed changes are not expected to finalize until June or July if they do indeed get approved as final. However, we are factoring in a 250 basis point increase to our full-year tax rate. We expect our first quarter tax rate will remain at 18% with any true-up happening in Q2 or Q3 if and when the regulations are finalized. Finally, our estimated share count of 172 million does account for us buying back $150 million in shares for the full-year, which is consistent with our previously communicated long-term plans regarding buybacks.","Please turn to slide 11, labeled Seasonality Expected to Continue. We wanted to remind everyone that our business does experience some seasonality during the year. The past two years have seen similar trends that we would expect to continue. We thought this would be a useful reminder as you think about the quarterly distribution of sales and adjusted EPS.","Please turn to slide 12, labeled Q1 '19 Pentair Outlook. We anticipate first quarter sales to grow 4% to 5% with all three segments contributing. We expect Aquatic Systems to be up 4% to 6%, Filtration Solutions to be flat to up 1%, and Flow Technologies to grow 3% to 6%. Segment income is anticipated to be up approximately 2% to 5%, and adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.52 to $0.55 per share, which would represent growth of 6% to 12%.","Below the line, we expect the first quarter tax rate to be 18%. Net interest\/other expense of roughly $7 million, and share to be approximately 172.5 million. While the first quarters are seasonally lightest period of the year, we believe we are positioned to see our core sales growth trends continue.","I would now like to turn the call back to John.","John Stauch","Thank you, Mark. Please turn to slide number 13, titled Pentair Strategy Summary. We have used this page consistently in our earnings presentations to remind everyone of strategy to the leading residential and commercial water treatment company and to share with you the areas where we are investing in growth. Our focused areas of strategy remained on advancing growth in pool and accelerating residential and commercial water treatment which requires investment at the business and the enterprise level.","Our approach to capital allocation remains disciplined. And we are committed to maintaining our investment grade rating, reinvesting in our most attractive core businesses and paying a competitive dividend. We also look at a balanced approach between M&A and intelligent buybacks with our M&A decisions being informed by overall valuations and the quality of assets available as well as our ability to integrate them successfully.","Please turn to slide 14, labeled Two Strategic Deals. We discussed throughout 2018 that accelerating residential commercial water treatment is one of our two key strategic growth initiatives. We also discussed throughout 2018 that we are building our M&A funnel, and we are very pleased to have announced agreements for two strategic acquisitions that help us further this key growth initiative.","On January 7th, we announced that we have signed agreements to acquire Aquion and Pelican Water Systems. We discussed last quarter that we are in the early innings of moving up the value change, from being a leading component supplier, to introducing smart, connected, branded products and solutions. We expect these two acquisitions to add roughly $110 million in revenue, and combined, have margins that are above the Filtration segment's average. Both of these acquisitions help us further our move up the value chain. We are really excited about Aquion bringing a national affiliated dealer network which is under the RainSoft brand. Aquion also brings a diverse line of whole home water treatment systems in addition to ozone and ultraviolet disinfection systems and internet-enabled solutions.","Pelican is an exciting acquisition for us because it brings us a direct-to-consumer model through a proprietary ecommerce platform. Pelican also has a number of innovative water treatment systems and services that we'll be able to sell through all of our distribution channels. We still expect these acquisitions to close in the first quarter of 2019 subject to customary closing conditions and necessary regulatory approvals. We remain excited about our opportunity to advance our residential and commercial water treatment strategy.","I would now like to turn the call over to Kathy, for Q&A, after which I'll have a few closing remarks. Kathy, please open the line for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Jones","Good morning everyone.","John Stauch","Good morning, Nathan.","Nathan Jones","Mark, I think you commented that you thought there was a little bit of pull-forward in aquatics business. I know it's probably pretty tough to try and estimate how much that was, but any kind of color you could give there, and if you think there was any kind of pull-forward in any of the other businesses that's worth calling out?","Mark Borin","Yes, I talked about it in the Aquatics business and also referenced a little bit in Flow as well. And if you think about it, it's probably about one to two points of growth in 2018 that then presents a headwind for 2019.","Nathan Jones","One to two points total for the year or just that in the fourth quarter you're talking about?","Mark Borin","For the year.","Nathan Jones","For the year. I would also like to talk about that productivity bar that you guys disclosed, which was fairly low in 4Q and in 3Q. Can you maybe talk about what the delays are there on seeing the productivity improvement? And then I think you talked about, for 2019, price offsets, inflation and productivity drops to the bottom line, so many any discussion about what you're expecting out of productivity in 2019.","Mark Borin","Sure. I think as you think about it amongst the three segments and then when you look at the segment performance in Q4 you can see that good performance in Aquatics and Filtration. And so really the productivity story for Q4 was driven by Flow Technologies. And they're main drivers of productivity there relate to some operational challenges in a couple of factories that manufacture large pumps. And so we saw that in Q4. The team has been focused on improving that, and we see that likely turning around in the first-half of 2019.","Nathan Jones","Okay, so a couple of discreet things there that are dragging the productivity numbers down in the second-half, they get solved in the first-half. Any idea what we should expect out of productivity in 2019?","Mark Borin","As we think about kind of our overall guidance for 2019, we talked about price and inflation kind of offsetting each other, and then the margin expansion coming from volume and from incremental productivity.","Nathan Jones","Okay, thanks. I'll pass it on.","Operator","And your next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Joe Giordano","Hi, John.","John Stauch","Hey, good morning.","Joe Giordano","Good morning. So, can you guys talk on the filtration side, I know this is a real focus for you guys. Can you talk about maybe the brand that you're building here, and as you're bringing in these new businesses you're getting out of some kind of non-core assets there as well. Can you talk about the value proposition and how it's changing and also like how consistent is the messaging around this one cohesive Pentair filtration brand, and kind of where you see this going?","John Stauch","Clearly it's not today. And it is our goal to have a Pentair brand that represents our filtration opportunity. And these acquisitions that we bring in are helpful in that regard because we have to get close to the consumer. And the consumer is making choices, and we have to make that a brand-based loyalty program in which then we can give the whole value chain of distributions in the products to the systems to also the services that are necessary, either through our direct channel or our affiliated channel. So, it's important as we think about building it out. I ultimately think that most consumers just want water as a service. They don't necessarily care about the products or the components that they're buying. They want a solution for the zip code or the geography or the country they live in, and that's where this is all heading, Joe. And that's why we think we need to have that consumer touch and be close to the consumer to be able to bring that story forward.","Joe Giordano","And as that kind of happens is that something that leads to like a sustainably more predictable higher margin business like consistently?","John Stauch","That's absolutely the goal. I mean, these are -- our residential commercial filtration business today is already higher margin, but I think you mentioned the predictable and consistency part of that is the main driver. And making sure that there's more of an annuity-based view of how we service that customer over time.","Joe Giordano","Okay, that's great. And then two kind of clarifications here, do you have any color on the margin guidance by segment into '19, and on your comment about price offsetting inflation, is that a consistent statement across all three segments as well?","Mark Borin","That would be consistent generally across all three segments. And no, we don't have specific guidance on segment profitability for 2019.","Joe Giordano","Is there anything with direction -- like we could do the math to get to it -- not a segment level, but is there anything you'd point out on an individual segment basis that we should take into consideration as we do that?","Mark Borin","I think if you think about our overall segment growth of 8% to 12%, and continued strong margins in aquatics and the upside that we talked about on flow technologies businesses that productivity in Q4 turns around, I think that would kind of frame the way to think about 2019 by segment.","John Stauch","Joe, we expect them all to improve, but we do want to maintain some flexibility for our strategic growth investments as we think about ramping up or ramping down the investment based upon how we see the organic growth. So, don't want to lock into specific targets by segment, but we're expecting them all to improve.","Joe Giordano","And Mark, can you just get into that tax thing that you mentioned, just -- I think there's some people who aren't sure exactly what this is. So what is this proposed regulation and how does it apply to you guys? And then I'll -- thanks.","Mark Borin","Yes, sure. I know that's a new data point. So, right at the end of 2018, the IRS published new regulations, and a lot of that related to them writing regulations around laws that were passed a year earlier. And specifically related to us, and not surprisingly part of our global structure, there were regulations specifically around the deductibility of interest in the United States, and it's those new regulations and the technical interpretation of those that applied to us, and that's where we see this headwind of 250 basis points, going from 18% to 20.5%. As I said in my prepared remarks, we've included that in our guidance for the year. The regulations are proposed right now, so they're not final.","As proposed, they're effective as of January 1st, 2019, which is why we put them in our full-year guidance, but they wont actually get finalized, we don't think, until the end of June or perhaps early July. And so that's why we guided to 18% in Q1 because they wont have been finalized, so we wont implement them in Q1, and then we'll see what happens in Q2. And if they're revised or if they're kept the same as they were originally proposed, and then that'll inform the tax rate in Q2 and the true-up that would happen in Q2 to get to a full-year rate of 20.5%.","Joe Giordano","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird.","Mike Halloran","Hey, morning everyone.","John Stauch","Good morning, Mike.","Mike Halloran","So, quick question here then on just underlying assumptions for the broader environment as you work your way through the year here. It seems based on the guidance that core trends are expected to be relatively stable through the year. Just want some clarification on that, and if there's anything that we should know about trajectory as we work through the year on the demand side?","John Stauch","Yes, I mean I think you read it right. I mean we're expecting about three points of price in this outlook, and we got one to two points of volume. And we're basically seeing the same core trends throughout the year, Mike. I mean as we mentioned, I think given the substantial price increases that were put into place in Q3 and Q4 we do think that distributors and dealers took advantage of buying a little bit ahead, so we'll probably expect a little slower start into Q1. And if you recall, we had a very strong Q1 last year, and we probably expect to have a stronger Q2 or 3 outlook as we did have such a great Q2. So, we're going to see that type of movement I think as we go through. But overall, core trends remain stable.","We're not necessarily a new housing install, we tend to be more of the aftermarket served, and certainly in the residential commercial space we're close to 85% in the aftermarket side, and so all those trends feel pretty much the same as they were last year.","Mike Halloran","Any regional variances you would point out that you're seeing right now?","John Stauch","No, I mean I think we're aware, and then we're hearing that China is slower. I mean it's a good news\/bad news story for us, I mean it's less than 4% of our overall revenue so we're not big enough to really matter in China. And our opportunity to continue to grow our business there is because we're not starting from a big base, so we have an opportunity to expand our revenue. So, other than that, I think Europe remains the way it generally was last year. It wasn't a huge contributory factor in '18, and we don't think it's a huge headwind in '19.","Mike Halloran","And then just one clarification, the Aquion and Pelican acquisitions, those are assumed in your guidance, and based on the divestiture acquisition contribution first quarter versus the rest of the year, it seems like those are soon to be coming in at the beginning of the second quarter, late first quarter, is that about right?","Mark Borin","That's right, so we're expecting to close sometime here in the back-half of the first quarter, and we've added them to guidance on that basis.","Mike Halloran","All right, great. Thank you for your time. Appreciate it.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Mark Borin","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick [indiscernible] with JPMorgan.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Had a few questions, but maybe first just on the cadence for the year, the first quarter segment income growth of 2% to 5% versus -- 8% to 12%, I think you mentioned maybe the pull-forwards impacting the top line a little bit in the first quarter, but what's impacting the margins, is it just inflation still a drag in the first-half and it gets better in the second-half. Just curious if you could help understand the underlying factors behind the profit growth in the first quarter versus the full-year guide being a little bit lighter.","Mark Borin","Sure, yes. John had mentioned before that Q1 last year was a really strong quarter, so that certainly the year-over-year comps are a part of that. I talked about the guidance around the corporate investment being up slightly year-over-year, and a fair bit of that comes in the first quarter, in particular because of the timing of the separation last year, and that our standalone structure was in place from May 1st going forwards. So, those are really the key drivers, the underlying operating performance is not that significantly impacted as you look quarter-over-quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. That probably answers my second question; I missed the first part of the call around corporate going up so much. That's probably because of that standalone structure not being in place, so my first -- I guess you had said that, I guess, earlier?","Mark Borin","That's right, and then just overall kind of the way we allocate to the businesses.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. And then just on interest expense. Is that just going up because of the deals?","Mark Borin","That's right, so that includes an assumption around the interest associated with the two acquisitions.","Unidentified Analyst","And then on tax rate, if finalized, can you just confirm the normalized rate for 2020 would be that 20.5%?","Mark Borin","That's right, 20.5% would be our new run rate.","Unidentified Analyst","And then are there things you can do capital structure-wise, to offset some of that, or was it kind of it is what it is?","Mark Borin","We're always looking for opportunities to effectively manage our structure, just like any company. So, we'll -- the tax team will be looking to be as efficient as possible, but based on our existing structure, the 20.5% is our estimate for 2019 and would be our run rate going forward.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. And then sorry, one last clean up for the first quarter, that the growth you expect is you're going to get the three points of price starting in the first quarter, or does that layer on more in the back-half of the year, you start a little bit slower there?","Mark Borin","Yes, most of the price was driven by the increases that we announced in Q3 and Q4 of 2018. And so it's pretty evenly spread throughout 2019. A little bit lower in the first quarter, and then slight ramp, but for the most part, pretty balanced.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck.","Mark Borin","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jeff Hammond","Hey, good morning, guys.","John Stauch","Hey, Jeff.","Mark Borin","Good morning.","Jeff Hammond","So, what's informing the better growth profile in the organic for Flow Tech?","John Stauch","Well, they had been building a backlog primarily around the commercial infrastructure, Jeff, and so, we were able to build that backlog up, and that's helping a lot in volume. We also had some buildup in the residential and irrigation side, you know, we had -- as we mentioned last year, we had one kind of global de-stocking incident that happened in the Middle East with the distributor. We switched over a system and identified that they had too much inventory. So those headwinds are gone as we look forward, and that's helping, yes.","Jeff Hammond","Okay, then just on the price cost dynamic, are you contemplating a move in the list three from 10% to 25% or how is that captured in your price?","John Stauch","Yes, our inflation assumption includes the increase from 10% to 25% in list three that's scheduled for March 1st. So that is built into our inflation assumptions for the year.","Jeff Hammond","Okay. And then on the last one, just on the acquisitions, can you talk about the long-term growth rates of those businesses, and what you're kind of putting in the outlook or expecting for those businesses in terms of growth in '19?","John Stauch","Yes, I mean, we see -- you know, the Aquion acquisition being somewhere in that 3% to 5%, longer term growth range, and then we obviously see Pelican, which has been historically growing at very strong double-digits, close to 20% as being at least for the near term, the expectations that we have upon it. So it's really about how do we think about these all at the right time, you know, and after we get regulatory approvals behind us, we'll take a look at the better longer-term outlooks for these businesses.","Jeff Hammond","Okay, great, thanks guys.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Mark Borin","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Jeff Reive","Hi, good morning, this is Jeff Reive on for Deane Dray. So just sticking to the deals, will the new e-commerce capabilities from the Pelican deal have any meaningful conflicts with your dealer channel?","John Stauch","Don't expect them to, which -- it's a different segmentation of the overall consumer market, and it's very specific and targeted to areas in which they feel like they can help, you know, more ZIP code by ZIP code. So we're excited to be able to explore it deeper. Again, after we get the regulatory approvals, and we're hopeful that we can maybe take that capability and expand it and really help our dealer channels as well.","Jeff Reive","Got it, thanks. And then maybe just more broadly, can you give us an update on your M&A pipeline?","John Stauch","Yes, I mean, we have a really well-thought-through strategy that we align with our board on, and I think it was an exhaustive global strategy that we feel really good about being aligned on, which really gives us a better visibility to the types of deals that we're looking at. So we're always looking at building the funnel. But it's also about, you know, do they meet the strategy and then ultimately, are they cultural fits and are they financial fits? And so, right now, I'd say we have a strong funnel, but what makes it to a final acquisition stage also has to get through that cultural aspect and also the financial aspects.","Jeff Reive","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brett Linzey with Vertical Core Research Partners.","Brett Linzey","Hi, good morning, guys.","John Stauch","Good morning.","Mark Borin","Good morning.","Brett Linzey","Hey, just want to come back to inflation. Sounds like that's an all-encompassing number with the tariffs included, you know, if I'd assume three points of price, you know, and you're going to offset commodities and inflation fully, that's about $85 million to $90 million. If you could just unbundle what is commodity inflation in that number, and then how much is tariff-related?","John Stauch","Yes, we've been hesitant to try to unbundle the two, because there's the direct impact of the tariffs, but then there's really the indirect impact of tariffs and that's been the trick is to be comfortable identifying that. So when we think of our kind of inflation number in total, it's really the combined impact of both of those things and there's the direct impact that tariffs is not really that relevant, it's really more important to think about the total.","Mark Borin","Yes, and also keep in mind about, you know, just a little under about 30% of that number as you do the math, next year is also wage inflation, you know, which is -- globally wages are up as well.","Brett Linzey","Okay, that's helpful. And then filtration, just want to understand the demand backdrop there, and what you're seeing, I mean, the business showed some signs of life in Q3, softened in Q4 and the Q1 guide implies a little bit of a slow start here, maybe just a little color on demand and what you're seeing from a regional perspective as well?","John Stauch","Yes, there's -- we have three different businesses underneath filtration. One is food and beverage. We have also a business focused on the industrial filtration side, and then the third one is our residential and commercial filtration where these two acquisitions fit. The residential and commercial has been relatively steady. It's a global business, and it's been growing in low-to mid-single digits for the last year or so. We have had a little bit of volatility as we mentioned earlier on some projects on the food and beverage side. We expect those to be behind us at the end of Q1. Don't want to continue those as an excuse, but we went out and really de-backlogged our large projects. On the food and beverage side, it really moved more to a component strategy which has also been a big lift to the margins in Filtration Solutions overall. So, once we get through Q1, we have that year-over-year impact behind us and then we are moving forward.","Brett Linzey","Okay, great. I'll pass it along.","Mark Borin","Thank you.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning. This is Rebecca on for Brian. Just following up on the filtration margins that picked up this quarter, I was wondering how of that was shifting away from the lower margin productions versus if price helped at all. And then, how we should think about the trend for 2019.","Mark Borin","Yes, sure. And price has a smaller impact in the Filtration business overall. John just talked about those three businesses price you really see that just in the residential and commercial side of the business. So it is less about price. It is about the mix as you referenced. And then also just core productivity in segment as they have opportunities to get after some of the lower productivity and lower margin businesses and improve that. So it's less price and more productivity and mix.","John Stauch","Yes, and sequentially we would expect the performance this year to roll in the next year. Obviously, the year-over-year impact will start to shrink as we realize that benefit of the mix in 2018.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then, just following up on that question about the ecommerce channel, can you provide a little more color on your strategy heading into 2018 in terms of the dealer channel? And then how much wholesale change do you expect for filtration in the U.S. and how you are struggling [ph] any potential customer channel conflicts?","Mark Borin","Yes, we are after the end consumer. And we believe by being closer to the end consumer, we can bring those leads back to not only the acquisitions that we're looking at closing. And again, we need the regulatory approval to close them. But also those leads can be also served by our independent dealer channel. And I think it gives us an opportunity to give to the customer the right solution that they are looking for. And so, that's where we are going with ecommerce platform is to make sure we've got a targeted solution by ZIP code that meets the consumer needs and then ultimately bring in the right solution through all of our channels to that consumer, and we will continue to built that out over time, and we will share more information when it's available.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks. I'll pass on.","Operator","Next question comes from Damien [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning everyone.","John Stauch","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","In Aquatics, could you elaborate a bit on your outlook for the 5% to 7% core growth there? I think you still have some solid price that's carrying over from the September increase. So could you maybe just talk a little bit about the drivers there, and how much recent growth investments are expected to contribute in 2019?","Mark Borin","Sure. So you're right, Aquatics is our strongest segment from a price perspective, so price certainly makes up a big chunk of the core sales growth for Aquatics. And then the remainder are coming from volume, and I mentioned in earlier questions around the impact of the pool and so thinking of 1% to 2% impact overall for the business and a lot of that coming from the Aquatics business. So that's factored into the way we think about our volume assumption for the year.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And I wanted to ask you about China, obviously, it's been a key strategic focus area for you, could you maybe give an update on how the region performed in the quarter and what kind of growth expectations you have for China and Southeast Asia for 2019?","Mark Borin","Yes. And it's less than 4% of our revenue, and I am not apologizing for that. It's just wise. It's going to be a strategic growth investment and why we need to get behind it and grow at a much faster rate. 2018 was a really solid year for repositioning, we were able to get four, five, new products launched here in the back half of the year and through the ministry of health approvals in China. Then we also were able to make some pretty bold moves through our distributor channel, and move more direct so that we can participate in the e-commerce platforms in China. So I think we repositioned and did all that in 2018. You know, we were lower on the growth side in Q4, you know, probably closer to low single-digits. As we head forward we're expecting double-digit growth in 2019 to continue, and we would be very disappointed if we weren't closer to 15% to 20%, because again, we're starting from a relatively low base.","Unidentified Analyst","Right, makes sense. Thank you very much.","Mark Borin","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, it's Jason on for Julian. Just one quick question on the pricing tailwind that three points expected in 2019, would the correct way to think about this be since it's contingent -- so, a portion of it is contingent upon offsetting a 25% of re-rating of tariffs\u2026","Mark Borin","No.","Unidentified Analyst","That is not -- never happens, you know, the pricing could come in a little bit lower, as not all of that would be necessary to offset the rest of inflation or is that 3% sort of locked in, and you would just see the inflation side of the equation come down and you would just enjoy a nice tailwind from that?","Mark Borin","Well, first of all, just in terms of determining price, so as I said the majority of that is from the actions that have already been taken, and then some that would -- still to be taken, but it's not going to be dependant on what happens with the status of the list three moving from 10% go 25%. And you know, how that all ultimately shakes out if and when that changes or who knows what else may happen with respect to tariffs, you know, that's yet to be seen. So right now our guidance is based on you know, the assumption that I talked about earlier. And we wouldn't expect that to change.","Unidentified Analyst","Definitely. And then just a quick one on the core sales guidance, infiltration solutions, you've given a lot of helpful color around Q4 and the Q1 trajectory, just given the wide range of outcomes that seem to be embedded in that 1% to 4%, could you kind of just talk to what it would take maybe in terms of the underlying demand environment to get closer to that 3% go 5% on the high-end organic sales guidance, and how that sort of differs from the Q1 environment right now?","Mark Borin","Yes, I think it's a good catch, I mean, it is our most global business and we have a wider range on Filtration Solutions because we do have more than -- you know, half of our revenue come in from outside the United States, so we see that the U.S. economy remains strong, and we feel like there's no real reason why see slowdown in Europe right now and as we mentioned earlier, we do see some volatility in China. So I think the range is there, because of its global aspects, and also, some of the industries that they're serving, food and beverage and also the industrial investments being tied somewhat to -- just industrial on oil and gas, so again there's more volatility in those spaces, and so, we just included a wider range to capture that.","Unidentified Analyst","Understood, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Aiken with William Blair.","Joe Aiken","Hi, good morning, just had a quick question looking at our model. Do you have any expectations for gross margin at least directionally in 2019?","John Stauch","Yes, no, I'd say -- right, we talked about the segment income margin assumptions, and we wouldn't go beyond that and talk about the gross margin assumptions.","Joe Aiken","Okay, got it, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Walter Liptak with Seaport Global.","Walter Liptak","Hi, thanks, good morning and a good year, guys. I wanted to ask about, you're sticking with this price situation and it sounds like you've got most of the price costs covered for this year, how would things play out if inflation reignites, what would be the timing on price increases and did you learn anything last year that might help you with price in 2019?","John Stauch","Sure, I mean, we'll continue to monitor the inflationary environment, but we feel like what we've got reflected in our outlook is certainly based on what we see the landscape looks like and our pricing actions are in place. So we're going to remain nimble, but right now we think we've got the right assumptions built into our expectations.","Walter Liptak","Right, okay. Now, I wanted to ask, the pools business, if I recall, last year -- your pool installers in not jamming them with a price increase, you know, I wonder how is the price increase, how is it accepted so far? You said there was a little bit of pull-forward, but it predominantly -- this was something that you are going -- you expect to see flow through, you're getting pushed back on some of the price.","John Stauch","Now, the comments last year on the timing of the price increase was really related to the pool season and the hesitancy to do an early price increase that would have put a price increase in the middle of the pool season, that's disruptive to the dealers and installers, but there is a time price increase that coincides with the pool season is what we talked about and that you know -- if that doesn't, we don't get pushback from our distributor or dealer channel as a result of that, so there hasn't been any blowback because of that.","Walter Liptak","Okay, great. Okay, all right, thank you.","Operator","And there are no questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to our presenters for any closing remarks.","John Stauch","Thank you for joining us today, and I hope you agree that we had a solid 2018 as we demonstrated our ability to use agility and prioritization to meet our commitments. By building up a track record of meeting and exceeding commitments, we hope to earn the trust and right to pursue a compounding growth strategy that allows us to not only achieve core growth in earnings, but to also utilize our strong cash flow and capital structure to pursue strategic, targeted and create a bolt-on, tuck-on acquisitions, such as the two we announced a few weeks ago and discussed on today's call. Thank you for your continued interest. Kathy, you can conclude the call.","Operator","Thank you, this concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q3 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Lucas. Please go ahead, sir.","James C. Lucas","Thanks, Michelle, and welcome to Pentair's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer.","On today's call, we will provide details on our third quarter 2013 performance, as well as our fourth quarter and full year 2013 outlook as outlined in this morning's release.","Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-K and 10-Q and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results.","Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. All references today will be on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated, for which the non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the Appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. In recognition that there are other calls this morning, we will target to be done in an hour.","[Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randall J. Hogan","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. It was on this call 1 year ago that we talked about a successful day 1 following our merger with Tyco's Flow Control business. Today, we can look back at a very successful year 1. The integration is ahead of schedule, and we again have seen synergies exceed our plan in the quarter and for the full year. Culturally, the 2 organizations are coming together as one Pentair.","While there's still more to be done, we're pleased with our progress in this first year. We have clearly demonstrated the power of the Pentair Integrated Management System and delivering on the integration. Now we look forward to delivering year 2 as a new Pentair.","Let me turn to our third quarter performance on Slide 3. Before I go through the results in detail, as has been our practice since the Flow Control merger, I want to note that we again will be discussing our operating results on an adjusted basis to better address the core operating performance of our businesses and referring to 2012 on a pro forma-adjusted basis to provide a more accurate apples-to-apples comparison that includes Flow Control in the results.","With that, here are the numbers. The third quarter met our expectations on the bottom line as margins expanded 210 basis points to 13.6%. Price and productivity more than offset inflation. Mix was positive, and synergies read out better than expected. Our adjusted EPS grew 25% even though sales declined 1% organically. For the quarter, sales were $50 million below our expectations due primarily to weak results in Australia that were not only related to the local economy, but also suffered a significant FX headwind.","While we were not pleased with the top line performance, we continue to see growth in many of our more profitable businesses, including stabilization in the North American electrical distribution channel. Residential continues to be a bright spot for us. Food & Beverage remains very strong, and encouragingly, we saw modest growth in Western Europe for the second consecutive quarter.","We continue to build momentum on the elements within our control. And because of our strong PIMS execution, we're targeting double-digit EPS growth for the year.","Now let's turn to Slide 4 for a performance review of our largest segment, Water & Fluid Solutions. Water & Fluid Solutions sales were up 1%, but improved 9% excluding the negative impact of the sharp decline that our Australian Water business experienced in the quarter.","Sales in the Residential & Commercial vertical, which represent roughly 45% of the segment, grew 12% in the quarter as the North American residential recovery continued, and we saw growth in commercial channels. We again had double-digit sales gains in our Aquatics systems business while our Filtration & Process and Flow Technologies businesses also grew well. Europe showed a modest improvement in the quarter, and while we are not expecting a rapid rebound, we're at least seeing signs of stabilization at last.","Our Infrastructure vertical, which accounts for nearly 20% of Water & Fluid Solutions sales, showed a sharp overall decline as Australian projects paused in 2013. In North America, we saw a strong double-digit growth as the break and fix pump business continues to improve. We also saw strong global Infrastructure pumps sales as a result of growth synergies generated by our global sales force selling the full range of Pentair products. While the global municipal markets remain challenged, we believe our sales growth is proof that our sales efforts and scale are yielding results. Global desalination opportunities are at a low level, not seen in over a decade. And while project activity remains very low, our win rate remain high as we secured 2 more significant orders in the quarter.","Our Food & Beverage vertical, which accounts for roughly 1\/5 of Water & Fluid Solutions sales, grew revenue 20% in the quarter. We saw double-digit sales gains in both beverage and Foodservice while agriculture sales continued to grow at a high single-digit rate, showing some moderation after strong growth the last couple of years.","The right half of the page shows third quarter Water & Fluid Solutions operating profits and margins for the quarter. Water & Fluid Solutions adjusted operating margins improved 280 basis points to 13.4% as the benefits of productivity and price drove the expansion. Although our Australian Water business saw a sharp top line decline, the team there responded aggressively by rightsizing their cost structure and achieving margins that were flat. In addition, we made good progress with our recent repositioning actions.","In summary, Water & Fluid Solutions delivered another strong quarter, driven by our Residential and Food & Beverage verticals masked somewhat by the tough market in Australia.","Now let's turn to Slide 5 for review of our Valves & Controls segment performance. The third quarter performance in Valves & Controls again demonstrated the power of PIMS adoption. Lean implementation continues to go better than we planned, driving productivity and improvements in on-time delivery rates for the business. We made good progress in Valves & Controls reorganization efforts, and our clear focus on service has produced some early wins. In addition, we continue to be more disciplined in large projects as the margin and backlog continues to improve.","Valves & Controls sales declined 1% in the quarter. It would have been up 1% if Australia were excluded. Oil & gas sales were flat in the quarter as we have seen many downstream customers defer annual maintenance shutdowns due to high activity. Mining sales were up 2% in the quarter as we continue to shift on a project in the Middle East. Power sales declined 10% as Europe remains weak and projects in China and India continue to be pushed out. Industrial grew 5% driven by MRO activities increases and growing investment by North American chemical customers. Many companies are taking advantage of lower input prices and adding U.S. capacity for the first time in quite a while. We will discuss orders and backlogs in further detail in just a moment.","The right half of the page shows third quarter Valves & Controls operating profits and margins. Operating margins were up 190 basis points to 13.1%, owing to productivity improvements. We saw accelerated adoption of Lean enterprise, and synergies also contributed to the margin expansion. Additionally, more disciplined pricing helped margin expansion. Our focus on service and MRO has also helped drive margin improvements with mild single-digit growth across all key verticals.","In summary, Valves & Controls faced a tough year-over-year comparison, but still delivered robust margin expansion.","Now let's move to Slide 6 for a look at the orders and backlog for Valves & Controls. As you can see on Slide 6, the Valves & Controls backlog is broken down in 4 key industries, 3 of which fall into our Energy vertical, oil & gas, power and mining; and 1 in our Industrial vertical, which is the process business. Backlog was essentially flat overall and remained at a near-record level of $1.4 billion. Process saw a modest decline in its backlog, and orders remained weak due to tougher comps in Asia. We continue to see North American chemical activity as many manufacturers take advantage of lower natural gas prices. Within oil & gas, backlog remains strong globally and orders were down year-over-year as large projects activity continued to be delayed. We believe this seems to be more of a timing issue as quoting activity remained healthy. In addition, we have seen many refining customers defer annual maintenance as they are not shutting down and continue to run near full capacity. The power business saw a slight increase in order as activity in China picked up. Third quarter orders in mining decreased as expected, and we expect this small piece of our Valves & Controls business to continue to be weak.","Now let's move to Slide 7 for a review of Technical Solutions. Sales for Technical Solutions declined 8% as our Thermal business not only faced a tough comparison due to a large project a year ago, but continued delays in Canadian project awards and slower European industrial sales accounted for the majority of the decline in the segment. Equipment Protection posted modest sales growth in the quarter as North American Industrial stabilized and we experienced growth in European electronic sales. Although Thermal experienced a sharp top line decline in the quarter, orders and backlog grew, reflecting our entering the seasonally strongest periods of the business.","The right half of the page shows third quarter Technical Solutions operating profits and margins. Technical Solutions operating margins increased 240 basis points to 20.6% on positive combinations from price, productivity and mix. In addition, the adoption of PIMS within Thermal has continued to gain momentum, and Equipment Protection experienced strong contribution margins with the improvement seen in Europe during the quarter, as well as strong productivity overall.","Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a closer look at growth year-to-date. Given the top line challenges that persist and slow economic recovery, we thought it would be helpful to provide an update on the trends we see in our key geographies in our 5 key verticals. In North America, U.S. has benefited from the continued improvement in residential, and we've also seen improvements in our Infrastructure break and fix business. Canada has been slower with a number of delayed projects in energy. We have not seen many cancellations. Western Europe is finally showing signs of stabilizing as many of our businesses that experienced a downturn early in the cycle are starting to see some volume growth. The last business to see the downturn, Thermal, is starting to see activity pick up as tougher comparisons begin to anniversary. Residential in Europe seems to be stabilizing, and we saw growth in commercial during the quarter. In addition, the European Equipment Protection business has returned to modest growth.","Fast-growth regions remain mixed, but China's declines appear to be slowing and we continue to see growth in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Middle East.","We talked in the past about opportunities that we see in the Middle East and we wanted to highlight a recent growth synergy. Earlier this year, we invested to localize our commercial pump line in the Middle East, utilizing the Valves & Controls plant in Sharjah. After only a few months, we are already booking orders and delivering pumps to serve buildings and other commercial applications there. We think these new regional product lines could add $25 million to $50 million in incremental sales over the next 5 years. So it's encouraging that we're off and running.","Looking at our 5 verticals, we now expect Energy to be flat for the year compared to our prior forecast of modest growth. When looking at our backlogs and timing of shipments for the fourth quarter, we expect to see growth sequentially.","We continue to expect Industrial to be down modestly for the year, but the stabilization we began to see later in the quarter -- second quarter has continued in line with our expectations. Further, the process backlog in Valves & Controls is expected to continue to improve based on the strong quoting activity we're seeing in North America.","Residential & Commercial has been a bright spot all year, led by North American residential. While commercial is smaller contribution for us, we're seeing signs of improvement in both North America and Europe. European residential has also stabilized at long last, which means it is at least no longer getting worse as we wait for signs of further improvement.","Our outlook for Infrastructure is now lower given the ongoing headwinds we expect in Australia, but we continue to expect a solid performance in North America. While the outlook for global desalination opportunities remain weak, we won a couple of jobs recently and our shift in investment from municipal to industrial are starting to pay dividends.","Finally, Food & Beverage remains a great story. We're seeing strong gains in all 3 of our focus areas in the space. Beverage has been a great story all year, driven by our Beer Membrane Filtration growth, and our backlog remains strong. Foodservice is well positioned with key customers that are expanding globally. Agriculture again posted near double-digit gains, driven by demand in both irrigation and crop spray. We expect the growth rate to moderate, but for growth to continue in the fourth quarter.","Let's now turn to Slide 9 for a year-to-date assessment and full year outlook. Our results through the first 9 months of 2013 met expectations as we've been able to over-deliver on synergies, productivity and price, which have offset some of the top line challenges we faced. We expect Australia to remain a headwind, but we continue to see solid backlogs in our longer-cycle businesses elsewhere. Europe is no longer a negative and we are experiencing growth in our more profitable businesses while driving standardization across the company GBUs.","We continue to execute on the elements within our control and we expect operating margins to expand in excess of 150 basis points, putting us on track to deliver strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We've completed $875 million of our $1.2 billion authorized share repurchase program. And we expect our free cash flow to be greater than 100% net income conversion for the year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John L. Stauch","Thank you, Randy. Please turn to Slide #10, titled Q4 2013 Pentair Outlook. As we close out the year, we're anticipating revenue and operating income for overall Pentair to be about the same in Q4 as it was in Q3. We are forecasting overall revenue to be about $1.8 billion, down slightly from Q3 and up 3% to 4% from Q4 of 2012.","Water & Fluid Solutions revenue is expected to be up 2% to 4%, reflecting continued Australian headwinds in our Water transmission business, no improvement in the Australian dollar and continued strong performance in our Residential and Food & Beverage verticals.","The shift in the fiscal year end had a negative impact in Q3 for Valves & Controls, but we believe it will help Q4 with expected sales growth of greater than 6% versus Q4 of 2012. Overall for Valves & Controls, we expect the seasonality of the quarterly revenue and income that we have delivered and are forecasting in 2013 to be the new pattern for their performance.","Finally, we expect that Technical Solutions will deliver their first year-over-year growth quarter of 2013 as industrial headwinds are now lapped and year-over-year large project comparisons in our Thermal Management business are behind us.","We are expecting strong adjusted operating income performance of around $242 million, down slightly from Q3 and up sharply from Q4 of 2012. We do want to remind you that last year's results included $20 million of transition costs associated with the merger with Flow Control. We believe operating income will expand over 45%; and operating margins are expected to be 13.4%, up 390 basis points, with strong contribution from all 3 reporting segments.","You may have noticed in Q3 and in Q4 corporate costs are lower. This reflects our final knowledge of incremental costs that, as of Q3, are now being allocated into the appropriate reporting segment. The reported corp cost of approximately $25 million now reflect the appropriate ongoing corporate expectation.","And finally, cash is important, and we expect to close out the year on a strong note and deliver the expected roughly $650 million of free cash flow for the year.","Please turn to Slide #11 labeled Integration & Standardization Update. This slide has become standard work and it briefly brings you up to speed on our synergies by quarter and our forecasted synergies for the full year. Of particular note is that we are now anticipating realized synergies in 2013 to be about $120 million, reflecting the overdrive in Q3 and the expected uptick in Q4. The increase of our previous estimates is being driven by sourcing and Lean savings in Flow Control and is a result of building momentum around our proven PIMS operating system. This is obviously great news as we are now exiting the year on $168 million annual run rate or nearly 73% of our $230 million synergy target.","What makes this performance even more impressive is that it does not yet take into consideration the significant synergies we still anticipate from Lean enterprise and our goal of reducing overall G&A from the current 8% of sales to the expected 6% of sales by 2015. All of those programs are still in investment mode, and we believe we will start to realize savings in 2014 and 2015.","Please turn to Slide 12 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. We had a very nice quarter as free cash flow was $206 million for the quarter, driven by over $173 million in net income and more disciplined working capital and capital spending policies. We still have substantial room for further improvement in our cash metrics in the legacy Flow Control businesses, and we are rolling out our receivable and payable policies and processes as well as directing many Lean projects towards targeting inventory reduction.","Ending debt was under $2.6 billion while we delivered over $100 million of cash in the quarter back to share owners in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We have completed $875 million of our approved $1.2 billion in buybacks through the third quarter.","Please turn to my final slide, Slide #13, labeled Full Year 2013 Pentair Outlook. For the full year, we are expecting $7.4 billion in revenue, up 1% to 2% organically year-over-year, reflecting near record bottom levels of projects in Australia, Canadian oil sands and EMEA, as well as the absorption of a global industrialization slowdown in slow, large greenfield sites globally, thus, giving us confidence in the prospects for accelerating organic growth into our 2014 and 2015 planning horizon.","Overall operating income is expected to improve by nearly 20% versus 2012. And overall adjusted EPS at the $3.20 midpoint range will be up over 25% versus 2012.","So one year into our merger with Flow Control, we feel like we have learned many things about the new businesses, introduced with speed our PIMS way of doing things and have seen 2 companies come together as a seamless one Pentair culture and we have a clear and achievable path to achieve our $5 of EPS target by 2015.","With that, I will turn it back over to Randy who will summarize, and then we will open it up to questions.","Randall J. Hogan","Thanks, John. Please turn to Slide 14 labeled Summary. In closing, we delivered on our commitments year-to-date, and we remain well positioned to meet our 2013 full year goals. The top line has been a challenge this year with delays in large projects and a greater-than-anticipated headwind from Australia. But on the brighter side, mix remains favorable, and we continue to see growth in Residential and Food & Beverage where we do control our destiny.","Our integration and standardization efforts continue to build momentum, and we now expect $120 million in synergies in 2013 versus our original target of $90 million for the year. We're pleased with the success of the integration so far. We realize that there is still a lot of work to be done, but the adoption of PIMS within the Flow Control businesses continues to exceed our expectation and we are adopting one Pentair culture.","Finally, I'd like to thank Mike Schrock for being a great partner the past 15 years. Mike and I started at Pentair a week apart and he's been a great contributor to building our operating agenda and our transformation from a holding company to an operating company.","With that, I'll ask the operator to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I just want to talk about these projects. I mean, you guys have said several times that you're kind of contemplating limited large project activity. And how much visibility do you have on these things quarter-to-quarter? I mean, clearly, Australia has been weak for a lot of companies and maybe that was something that could have been contemplated on the second quarter guide. And then I guess for the fourth quarter, some of the stuff you're accelerating on your core for the fourth quarter, maybe you could just comment on why your visibility is any different. Are there projects that slipped into October that have already been booked? I mean, maybe just give us a little more comfort around why we won't repeat this issue in the fourth quarter that we did in the third on the revenue front. And then I have one other follow-up.","John L. Stauch","Yes, Steve, good question. And we'll tag team here, Randy and I. I think, when you take a look at Q3 versus forecast, in summary, we missed about $50 million in Australia. Half of that was actually currency, which we did not see coming, and 1\/2 of that was roughly book and ship business that was expected in the quarter and now we don't expect that even in Q4. And we're anticipating that Australia becomes flat to the current levels in Q3 well into 2014, given the conditions there on mining and given the overall state of the economy. In Thermal, you notice the miss. On a year-over-year basis, it was large projects. We shipped a big Voyageur contract last year. We were not anticipating large projects in the quarter. It was actually Europe where they were the last to head into the decline mode. We have record backlogs in Europe and the projects started to -- or the ship dates on those book and ship businesses started to slip throughout Q3 into Q4. We've only put part of that into our forecast for Q4 and the rest of the uptick reflects what we think is the new normal seasonality coming out of Q3, which was the old fiscal year end for Tyco Flow and now reflecting the new year-end fiscal year end. And so a lot of these projects that would have been rushed to completion, if you will, in September on the order side, we now think have their normal completion in the Q4 timeframe. Randy, I don't know if you want...","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, the only thing I'd add, Steve, I'm much more focused on the bottom line than the top line, but we always focus -- we, obviously, want to get better at forecasting the top line. One of the things that John has it right, one of the things that we didn't know going into the third quarter was how much the shift from the third quarter closeout of the year to the fourth quarter closeout of the year would affect the behavior in the Flow Control businesses. And I think we saw some, I would call less aggressive closing of orders. John talked about sales. But in terms of orders, I think there was less aggressive closing out of orders in the quarter that we are, in fact, seeing close in the fourth quarter. So I think it was a learning quarter for us.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So x ForEx, you guys think you have -- the chances of us sitting here in January and you guys talking about another revenue slip, you're highly confident in that?","John L. Stauch","Well, Steve, yes. I mean, 2 things. I mean, first of all, you know Randy and I both work around large-project backlog businesses, you should not miss large project forecasts. And so I want clarify that's not where we missed it because you have your backlog, you have your shippable backlog. And even if you expect a little bit of slippage, you put that into your estimates. This is knowledge about, I think, the fiscal year end the seasonality of these businesses. And overall, I think we were able to manage through it effectively. And if you look at the year's forecast, as a matter of fact, what we've done, we've had some strong quarters of growth and we've had lesser quarters of growth. And I think that reflects more of the choppy seasonality last year within the Flow Control businesses than it does a normalized seasonal pattern that you're seeing start to form here throughout 2013.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. Okay, that's totally fair. Just one last question on the productivity side. If I take your synergies and then I add up all the productivity and synergies that you reported for the quarters, productivity looked pretty strong at, like, $25 million. It was a pretty good quarter. Anything unusual? And I guess, the bridge, I would characterize it as kind of like productivity and cost saves x synergies. Anything unusual this quarter? Or you guys seem like you're getting really good base productivity out of the business.","John L. Stauch","Nothing unusual. I mean, one of our goals when we closed the merger was to make sure we're focusing on margin and backlog, especially in the Valves & Controls businesses. We've been very disciplined on the types of orders and types of jobs we're winning and I think that's starting to show in the margin expansion in that business. So I think it's not just about growing, it's about growing profitably. And I think you're seeing the effect of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Deane Dray from Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On the fast-growth markets being down 8%, this is now the second quarter and likely some of this is still related to China, but if you could just separate out what the pressure is in terms of is it Food and Beverage, is it Infrastructure? How would you characterize the pressures there?","John L. Stauch","Yes, just a clarification. I mean, overall, fast-growth was up around 2% in the quarter, still not a great number. But overall for Pentair, it was plus 2. We did see clearly in Water & Fluid, we were down 8% and most of that really was India. And so I think, overall, we're seeing still strength in China in our product platform there. We're up 23% in the quarter in China. And where we were down in Water & Fluid, it was primarily India and a little bit of Middle East. And as Randy mentioned, I mean, there hasn't been a lot of desal programs going on in that region.","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, and it really is -- it's what we call the advance of water. It's the desal projects, it's the big wastewater projects that have been the net drag in fast-growth markets. Actually, beverage -- Food & Beverage has done very well.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then on the increase in synergies, I might have missed this, but what was driving that additional $15 million in savings? And then is there more in the tank on this? Are there additional projects you can be doing? Is the $120 million to be a stretch? And do you have line of sight on all those projects?","John L. Stauch","Yes, Deane. I think the upside was clearly sourcing and Lean, which I mentioned in my comments. And I think we always knew we were going to get that. I mean, we have a great Lean and sourcing culture here. I think the upside coming forward will be the Lean enterprise, which is all the back office structures that we think we can get more synergies through. And we've been planning for that all this year. We didn't expect any of that to hit in 2013 and we're set up nicely now for 2014 and for savings related to those projects. So we feel really good about where we are in the synergy road map.","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, I'd just echo that and mention that the Lean is off to a great start. It's helping -- it's really helping delivery right now. But it takes a little while for Lean to hit productivity and the sourcing. The sourcing productivity has been really outstanding. And we think the funnel still looks good there for more.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. Just last question for me is the -- we're all trying to gauge and calibrate the seasonality in the new combined business. And it looks like it'll be some -- a little bit challenging here for the fourth quarter just in terms of identifying what's a seasonal trend versus some one-offs. So like making adjustments for Australia here. Yes, Tech Solutions got a little bit easier comps. But how would you frame the seasonal impact that is something that we would now be seeing on a go-forward basis?","John L. Stauch","Deane, I think no one is working harder on that than us. And I think we feel more knowledgeable today than we did a year ago. I mean, clearly, as I mentioned, if you looked at Flow Control's results last year, they were bouncing around a little bit. I think we feel very good about the seasonality being delivered in 2013 in the normal execution. And to your point, Thermal, which is -- likes cold weather is going to have a stronger Q4 in that its normal shipping pattern because of shipping ahead of the cold weather, the anticipated cold weather. So that's the only real seasonal business other than Australia, which will have a stronger Q2 historically.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then congratulations to Mike. He's had a great run.","John L. Stauch","Yes, absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Halloran from Robert W. Baird.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So on the Valves side of the business, when you think about the order activity, backlog has been stable. Tough order quarter here. But it sounds like the quoting side of the Energy products and projects, in particular, still remains strong. So a couple of things there, one, maybe you could just talk about what the customers are saying today? What's driving some of the delays in getting the quoting through beyond just the timing with the calendar? And then what do you think the catalyst here is to start seeing a little bit more consistent order strength because not only you, but all your peer group, has been talking about strong order environment, or at least quoting environment, for a few quarters here but just haven't really got them to the finish line. So any color there would be great.","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, I would just say when we look and we talk to customers about their capital plans, which, obviously, the thing that drive the large projects, even the medium-sized projects for the oil & gas industry, the capital plans remain solid. And I would say not down, not up. Maybe slightly up, but not greatly up. And what they're doing is they're looking to save costs. For us, we're a valve supplier to large projects. So the valves are not a big part of those projects and there seems to be more intense conversations between the end customer and the E&P players who control the projects overall. So the activities are, I think, about trying to be more cost effective on the implementation of these projects. That's my read of it -- that's our read of it, not just mine but our team's read of it. But these projects are going to go forward. So a number of projects we saw in the Middle East, a number of projects we've seen in the power industry, they've sort of slipped into the right, which is a term I hate. But it's what we're seeing right now but not outright canceling, with the exception of a couple of really large projects that everyone knows have been canceled up in Canada that have been canceled before. We haven't seen any other cancellations.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That makes sense. And then on the Residential side of the business, obviously very strong trends this quarter, healthy expectations for the fourth quarter. Any signs of cracks there or at least the incremental slowing in the residential end markets you deal with in North America?","John L. Stauch","I would just say, Mike, and I'll have Randy make some comment, we like the trend there. I mean, we were -- this high single-digit type of growth pace that we're on is a good place for us to do well and then to make money in. And I think, we would have been more concerned if we would have saw the huge spikes and the overbuying of the houses or the over-delivery of the housing permits. I mean, I think, we still feel we're in a healthy environment. Obviously, 6 years of decline now coming back relatively strong and our pace of activity is flowing through as we would expect it, pool with the high-end consumer and there we've had strength because of our energy content. Also, we haven't seen a huge impact in Residential Flow, as you know. That's more of a weather dependent, not a new housing start. But we're starting to see in the quarter, finally, the water filtration plays and the growth in that space.","Randall J. Hogan","Right. And particularly in Europe, I mean, where it has lagged. But with residential returning to a more stable environment in Europe, that bodes well for us further because that's an important market for us in the Residential Filtration business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just first one, check my math. On the price versus productivity side, I count $78 million listed for productivity\/price and op income and roughly about $14 million on price on the sale side, which most of which drops through. So is your productivity-only number's closer to $60 million or $65 million?","John L. Stauch","Sorry, say that again, Steve?","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'm just -- what's your productivity-only operating income number, net of price?","John L. Stauch","Yes, it's about -- just about $55 million excluding -- well, $57 million excluding inflation.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. But include just that productivity\/price in op income that you've got...","John L. Stauch","It's about $70 million.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","$70 million, okay. And then on the -- on page -- on the Water & Fluid walk, you talked about $20 million of volume and sales, but 0 impact on the op income side from growth. What's going on there?","John L. Stauch","Well, that is net -- yes, it's the net impact of volume and foreign exchange and we dropped that through in op margin in that walk. And then the leverage of that or the lack of leverage comes in the productivity side of the equation.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, great. And then, finally, just on the top line integration impact, you talked about the Middle East commercial pump line and getting the $25 million to $50 million of sales over 5 years and all that, but how do you know -- to what extent are you confident that all of these massive integration activities happening across the portfolio did not have a negative impact on your sales for this quarter?","Randall J. Hogan","Well, that's certainly something we talk to all our presidents about and the businesses and there is a lot of focus on cost structure. But we've been very selective in terms of hitting cost structure on the go-to-market side. Most of the structure has been on what I would call the G&A side and then manufacturing side and -- but we certainly are aware of that risk. We've also been -- I mean, I do think that our focus on profitable growth probably has kept us from having as high a top line as we might have. But frankly, I don't want any more projects that don't make money. So if that's all we're losing, I'm okay with that.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Well, the word project selectivity is used by some of your colleagues and the former -- the other Tyco. I mean, is that -- are you going through a pretty significant change in comp and other things for the sales force to impact that -- there's more profitable projects or...","Randall J. Hogan","Well, we have. We've got clear focus on that margin. The Valves & Controls business was reorganized into -- from an end-market focus, which was really focused on market share and there were measures on market share and in growing in each of the verticals. And now, we're focused on product line profitability and functional excellence. And so I do believe that, that change has been beneficial in terms of making sure that we are taking profitable projects. I can't comment on what the rest of Tyco is doing.","John L. Stauch","We can measure the margin and backlog, though, Steve, and that's the measure if that backlog is a more profitable backlog than it is today.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just to close the loop on Valves & Controls orders, can you give us kind of the blended order, order rate and what the comp was for 3Q?","John L. Stauch","Meaning the -- you mean the total orders?","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes.","John L. Stauch","We got it by those 4 segments...","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And while you're looking for that, I mean, I kind of blended, come up with down kind of high singles, low doubles. But I'm just trying to understand better because it seems like there's some fiscal year timing changes, some focus on profitability. What's really just kind of timing here in the order or maybe a tough comp versus your real fundamental weakness -- weakening in the business?","Randall J. Hogan","Let me talk about while John's looking it up, let me talk about just in general. The Flow Control businesses used to close out their fiscal year at the end of September, if you recall, that we moved to fourth quarter after taking over a year ago. If you recall, all those businesses had weak fourth quarters and they had spectacularly strong third quarters. And so this is our first time through that change and we'll see -- we'll see -- we expect that there was some orders that would have been booked maybe in -- with a different fiscal year in the third quarter that will get booked in the fourth quarter.","John L. Stauch","Yes, I mean, the actual, if you add it all up, you should be somewhere around $562 million to $565 million, Jeff, in total orders. And clearly...","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And what was it last year?","John L. Stauch","Last year would have been, on the same basis, $636 million.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then...","John L. Stauch","As Randy reflected, they sequentially, from Q3 to Q4, dropped significantly well below $575 million in orders in Q4, reflecting a peak in Q3 and then a big drop in Q4. We're now expecting a more normalized pattern between Q3 and Q4 with a little uptick in Q4 versus Q3. So I think this is about the seasonality of the year end more than it is about an indication of what's going on in industry trends.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just shifting gears to Aquatics and Food & Beverage, you guys have had just great growth there. And it sounds like quoting's pretty good in Food & Beverage, but to what extent do we start to worry about tough compares there?","Randall J. Hogan","Well, we haven't given 2014 guidance yet. But when we look at Aquatics and Food & Beverage in particular, with the exception of agriculture, which has had some benefits in the U.S. with some tax treatments and they're going to expire at the end of the year, which I think is going to slow down irrigation and maybe crop spray. With the Foodservice -- in Foodservice right now, we have a lot of momentum and globally we've had a lot of momentum. And then Food & Beverage, we have a great backlog in the beverage and dairy business. So I feel good about that. In terms of Aquatics, Aquatics, as you know, has controlled their own destiny for some time. And now on top of that, they've got growth in the end markets. I mean, they were growing for 3 years while the market was declining, and now on top of that, the market's going up and they continue to innovate. So I have great confidence in Aquatics growth.","John L. Stauch","I think -- just a follow-on, I think as we take a look forward on the Food & Beverage side, I would think about 1\/2 of the year growth rate this year is what we would be anticipating next year with, as Randy said, ag being the tougher comps next year and the Food & Beverage and Foodservice side continuing to go forward. Clearly in Aquatic, we're not going to continue that rate of growth as well but high single digits is certainly something that we feel is achievable over the next several years.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","I just wanted to touch about -- on the funnel. So you had mentioned again your finding more opportunities in all the different buckets that you're attacking. If you aggregated the last quarter's funnel, you're talking about $390 million. I'm sure you don't want to get in the habit of quantifying this, but I mean, has that increased meaningfully versus where you were at Q2, if you could give a little color there and maybe where it's coming from.","John L. Stauch","I think the way I would describe it is what I said in my script was -- in my comments was that we're clearly, as a company, sitting around 8% G&A and that's well higher than historically Pentair has ever been. 6% is our targeted G&A for 2015. If you take that 2-point times sales and you start adding that to the current synergies and assume that we'll continue to get sourcing and continue to get Lean rollout, we feel very good about our potential ability to continue to expand margins. We're cautious about providing the funnels because as we said, this is about productivity and synergies and we need both. And so we're really driving a rate of margin expansion through ensuring that we're getting from both sides of the Flow Control and legacy Pentair the right amount of margin expansion in gross margin and the operating expense leverage. So we're working both simultaneously and the only way we'd win is the bottom line. So we feel good about what pipeline we have.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay, fair enough. And just back to Valves & Controls orders, you had been talking about selectivity. I think last quarter, you talked about maybe 100 basis point improvement in margin and what's in your backlog versus kind of what you're reporting. Can you give us an update on kind of where that stands today?","John L. Stauch","That's still about accurate.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And then finally, also just on the process side of the business, so it sounds like U.S. still fairly solid with MRO work; China or Asia, a bit weak. But just more focusing on the U.S. side, so we've heard a couple of get ethane crackers get announced by some of the major chemical companies. I'm just curious, I'm sure you're going to be competing for those, when should we anticipate that order profile start to inflect higher for Pentair? I guess, question more is kind of where do you sit in the construction cycle and when do you start to see the benefits of these large projects getting off the ground?","Randall J. Hogan","Well, we have frame agreements with a lot of those customers already, so we have, if you will, we have a preferred or at least a right to bid on those. So we will work those with the customer if it gets spec-ed in immediately, even before they announce them usually. So you can bet we're working on them. They will award them typically after the EPC awards so...","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Right. So a couple of EPCs have been awarded. I mean, are you talking about a couple of quarters after? Or is it a year later? And how do you intend on actually recognizing the revenues? Is that going to be a percentage of completion or would that...","Randall J. Hogan","Generally, on Valves, we recognize them when we ship them so -- but they'll ship in -- there's multiple valves, so they ship in multiple orders. And right now, we feel good about the process industry in general, in chemicals in general in North America and -- because of those kind of large but also a lot of smaller projects that are going in there. I can't comment specifically on when I expect those to -- would ship if we win them.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Is it safe to say orders from these couple of projects that have recently been announced would be a '14 event? Or is it later than that?","Randall J. Hogan","If I tell you it's '14, it'll probably be '15. If I tell you it was '15, it'll probably be '14. So I'm not going to give you a date.","John L. Stauch","And Brian, those are not -- those are -- I mean, a large order for us is going to be in the 10 million to 20 million of valves range and that's a large, large order. So I mean, we're talking about series of $2 million to $5 million orders here and those are all the types of things that continue to add confidence to the growing industrial process side.","Randall J. Hogan","It is right to focus on it though because -- I mean, we're focused on it because, I mean, when they're putting in ethylene crackers, they're making long-term bets on an industry and the market for those monomer streams. So they're -- they're there and there will be other investments to go along with it. I actually think it's a new day for chemicals in America.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from MKM Partners.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Just a question on Valves & Controls and I know that some of the comments you made at your Analyst Day last year we don't get a sense of the shape of the growth that you outlined. But to pick on that specifically, you have a 5% CAGR over the planning horizon, leaving kind of an 8% CAGR over the next 2 years. Do you think some of these project deferrals can lead to that acceleration in the growth? And if that fails to happen, do you feel like you have the synergy pipeline to overdrive on that? I guess, the way my math works, if it ends up being more like that 5% for the next 2 years, you're going to need another, call it, $30 million in EBIT. Clearly, you guys are finding upside there. I just -- help us calibrate kind of the growth versus synergy offset here with '13 coming in wider on the top line?","Randall J. Hogan","Let me talk about it within the whole arc of this merger. I mean, originally when we first looked at the forecast of the Flow Control outlook, it was pretty high. We took it down, on what you're asking, the 5%. And then you're asking is if the 5% isn't there, what can we do? And I would tell you that, clearly, the orders, themselves, have not been consistent with what we would have anticipated 15 months ago. But having spent a year with the business, the opportunities for productivity are even better than I thought. So my answer would be and then we'll see what John -- my answer would if the volume isn't there, I'm still committed to get to 5% and I think we know the way.","John L. Stauch","Yes, and then -- I obviously agree with Randy because he's really demanding. And I'd say when you look at Slide 6 and you look at our percentage of our overall revenue in backlog and -- it feels, as we were talking about earlier, that industrial process is starting to pick up and industrial has been flat throughout most of the year. And if you look at other people's order rates there, it's been improving. That's really the one we need to move forward into a mid-single digits to be able to contribute that higher single-digit growth rate. And we're feeling good about the activity there and we're feeling good how that's starting to unfold. As you could see, there's a lot of focus on mining. But for our mining business, it's less than 10% of our overall sales. So the downturn there -- or the upturn doesn't move the needle the way industrial process does.","Randall J. Hogan","Right.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","I mean, you could see mid- to high single-digit growth in that process business without turning? That's order of magnitude consistent with what they're able to do historically?","John L. Stauch","Correct.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one follow-up on the growth. Is it that these business need more investment -- I guess, stripping out the project timing things and these things happen especially in this macro environment, but do you feel like there's -- it's just more investment that's needed to get the growth? Is it a lack of opportunities for investments, so you guys are funding everything but there aren't enough ideas? Or are these businesses just more like grind it out than you originally anticipated? I guess, how do you...","Randall J. Hogan","One thing is we're not overreacting to the vagaries of the up and down. The standard deviation around orders is 10%, plus or minus, every quarter. So we're trying not to overreact to just the vagaries quarter-to-quarter. That said, we believe that we can do a better job of priority focus on growing the markets that are most -- growing in the markets that are most attractive. That may require us to fill in some product line gaps. We're not the strongest, for instance, upstream. We're not as strong upstream as we think we'd like to be, for example. But it's also to make sure that we're investing in the markets that are growing. We mentioned India was down. We need to be bigger in some of the markets. We want to be bigger in the Middle East. We want to be bigger in Africa. So it's both a geography focus and it's a product line priority. And that's what we're doing in the planning cycle now. We make sure that we're putting our best resources against those priority focuses.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Graham from Jefferies.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Congrats to Mike Schrock. I just really only have one question. And you guys have done a great job in increasing the synergies for '13 all year. And you're now expecting a nice little ramp in sales growth for each of the 3 segments in the fourth quarter. I was just wondering, are any of the synergies actually going back into the company, being reinvested to try to drive and make sure that top line growth acceleration, you're spending any of that toward sales?","John L. Stauch","Yes, Scott. I mean, I think, as Randy mentioned, it was a key focus of ours not to attack or go after the sales and marketing and the growth-related resource as a percentage of sales. We've held the percentage of sales, and in most cases, increased them. And so the focus has been on the Lean, the operations and also the back office driving the synergies and making sure that we're continuing to invest it. But as Randy mentioned earlier, now we're spending a lot of time making sure the money is being spent in the appropriate areas that can actually drive the most profitable growth and that's a big part of the 2014 planning activity.","Randall J. Hogan","And we've talked about some examples. I mentioned the investment we've made to localize commercial pumps in the Middle East, leveraging the Sharjah factory. We've invested even more than that in the Middle East. We've talked before about the investments we made to cross-sell valves in the Food & Beverage business. So some of the wins we've invested in MRO and that's up 6%, 7% in the quarter. So we're seeing results from the investments we made and we've talked about them.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So essentially, what I think I hear is that your -- the combination of the spending and easier comps, some of these timing issues we've talked about in a couple of businesses, you feel good about those fourth quarter sales expectations by segment?","Randall J. Hogan","I learned under a master to never be comfortable with the forecast. We're committed to the forecast.","R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's a good answer. I actually have a second question I just thought of and it's kind of a piggyback off the last question. If I recall correctly at the end of the Analyst Meeting last year, one of the things that I think you said very clearly, John, was that, hey, we don't have a crystal ball. We don't know what the top line looks like. It is our goal. We're committed to 5% growth. But if it doesn't happen, we're still confident in making the $5 number. I know you just kind of said the same thing, but it's just really a combination, not just of the synergies to get there, but you could also kind of pull the share buyback leverage to get there as well if you come a little short of that 5%, right?","John L. Stauch","Absolutely. And Scott, think what you're hearing from Randy and I today is we've had a year now to look at these businesses and understand what was in the core, what was in the base. You look at some of the projects that have come out in Australia, you look at some of the megas that were there in Thermal that are no longer there, primarily the Voyageur project, and we take a look at where we are in the base and the core growth rate in the base and it more than reflects what we want to on an ongoing basis. So we feel we're coming off of this base, knowing what's in there and the ability to grow organically, we feel very good with that and the cost structure to achieve our commitments.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Rose from Wedbush Securities.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","A couple follow-up questions. In the guidance, I mean, you've had some divestitures in the first half of the year, are we thinking about potentially more rationalization of businesses? And I mean, I imagine they are small, but how should we think about that in terms of the guidance? Generally, that's not reflected in the guidance, but it should impact your top line, nevertheless, is that fair?","John L. Stauch","Yes, we're not reflecting any of that at the moment. And we would feel it would be our problem to absorb and deal with that as well.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. So we can assume that if there are any divestitures, that won't be really be an excuse for the lower top line unless they're sizable?","John L. Stauch","Correct.","David L. Rose - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And within the guidance, I think this has been addressed before by others here, but you have the headwind from Sandy. It's not a meaningful headwind for you, but it's factored in your business. Are there other headwinds that we should think about in the fourth quarter that may not have been highlighted?","John L. Stauch","I think we feel like we learned a little bit about the Australian dollar in the quarter. And I think we've got that forecasted to not recover. And at some point, if a currency goes even much weaker, it should help its ability to export out. So right now, as of this date, there's nothing that we can factor in. But we're not weather forecasters either.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Randy, you mentioned some of the areas of opportunity where you have product line gaps. And with the Tyco integration kind of pulling forward quite a bit and going real well, I just wonder if you could update us on the timeline of your appetite for getting back to funding some bolt-ons in that area.","Randall J. Hogan","Well, we were active in the marketplace, looking at the different opportunities and we want to be as disciplined as we have always been, which is we start with what fits our strategy, so the product line gaps are, I'm not going to comment about specific ones, but the product line gaps are our key starting point for that. We got to make sure that we're disciplined in terms of the financials and that we continue to hew to the promises we made to shareholders in terms of our stock buyback program and the agencies and our overall capital plan. So I wouldn't predict as to when we might announce any kind of bolt-on.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, but it sounds like you're ready to go?","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, if the right thing came along.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just looking at next year, I think we have $85 million cost benefits from the 2Q restructuring this year, maybe $60 million to $80 million incremental synergies. Is that drop-through completely independent of growth if that should remain elusive?","John L. Stauch","That should be completely dropped through, correct. I mean, obviously, we have to manage inflation and those types of things. But that's why we're showing that chart the way we're showing it is that run rate should be incremental even on flat growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Drab from William Blair.","Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","First question, just on the order outlook. If we look at Slide 6 and you're thinking about the fourth quarter and taking into account everything that we've talked about so far in this call with the fiscal year-end situation, can you give us kind of a sense for these 4 end market outlooks in terms of order growth? What's this going to look like in the fourth quarter? Will we be up in orders in each of these end markets?","Randall J. Hogan","I think I mentioned we don't expect mining to go up. Power, we're seeing activity in power, but that's been sliding sideways. I think, overall, we expect orders will be up from the third quarter.","John L. Stauch","That's correct. And I think industrial process and oil & gas is where we'd expect them to go up. And as Randy mentioned, mining's likely to be down and power is likely to be flattish. Now you ask us to split hairs on a $2.5 billion business. So it's not something we usually do, is provide prospective orders by vertical market. But right now, that's indicative of what markets we think will continue to expand.","Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, yes. I'm just trying to make sure I understand the pieces that get to the aggregate order growth because we're looking at -- I'm just trying to reconcile a few things that were said this morning. It looked like on what is Slide 8 that you're expecting the fourth quarter to be better in the Energy and Industrial verticals in terms of revenue growth and you're expecting Valves & Controls -- and that, obviously, has a lot of bearing on Valves & Controls, expecting Valves & Controls to be up 6% in the fourth quarter. And you've had those order headwinds lately but then you made the comment, John, about 2014 returning to an acceleration in organic revenue growth. So I'm just trying to -- that would require, it seems to me, a fourth quarter recovery in orders?","Randall J. Hogan","Yes. Just remember, Brian, the backlog page there just applies to Valves & Controls. Most of our Industrial is booked and shipped. It's not the -- it doesn't run really through a backlog number. That's where the Equipment Protection business is. That's where, frankly, a lot of Valves & Controls and Thermal is, too.","John L. Stauch","And I said in my comments, in 2012, in Energy and Thermal, there was a Voyageur project in which we anticipated in the beginning of the year having that Voyageur project continuing within '13. That project, as Randy mentioned, is canceled. So the last year-over-year headwind in Thermal Energy related to projects was in Q3. And that's a big piece of the turnaround as you look at Q4 and full year.","Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And that's kind of a segue to my last question here. Yes, of course, we're aware that Voyageur was canceled. But we, of course, knew that coming into this period and it looks like the guidance for Technical Solutions was flat to down slightly. The legacy Pentair business did well. Thermal Controls, you saw some projects delayed or can you give any more granularity there in terms of was that several projects, one larger project...","John L. Stauch","There was some project, book-and-ship Industrial in Europe. Record backlogs and the shipment timing was delayed from Q3 into Q4.","Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","But you mentioned oil sands here for -- within Thermal Controls.","Randall J. Hogan","Voyageur was oil sands, right? Industrial oil sands has nothing to do with Europe.","Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. I just want to be clear then. When you say oil sands, you're talking only about the Voyageur project, nothing incremental to what we already knew going into the quarter?","John L. Stauch","That's correct, that's correct.","Brian Drab - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And MRO in the oil sands was solid?","John L. Stauch","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Garik Shmois from Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","I have a question on mix. I called out some favorable mix benefit on the op income line, particularly in Water and Tech Solutions in the quarter. Just wondering, as you look in the 4Q guide, you've got very good incremental margin expansion. I recognize part of that is seasonality, part of that is continued productivity. But how much of a mix benefit do you continue to expect into the fourth quarter? Maybe how sustainable is that as you look out to 2014?","John L. Stauch","We think it's sustainable because what turned down substantially was a lower-margin Australian business, which is on the lower end of the margin within Water & Fluid. So our results in Q3 reflect that. And in Q4 and beyond, we don't have any recovery in that product line anticipated due to the economy there. In Thermal, as we mentioned, it was the impact of larger projects, which are still nicely profitable but nowhere near the drop-through of the pure product shipments. Again, not planning any large project activity in the near term as well.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, can you remind us how much of the percent of sales Australia represents for you?","John L. Stauch","Australia, on a full year basis for 2012, was about $1 billion, just under $1 billion of total revenue within the overall Pentair. And in Q3, it represented just under $200 million. So we've -- we're down about $50 million, as I mentioned, year-over-year. So it kind of gives you the rate of change.","Operator","And your final question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a question on the aftermarket business in Tyco valve. You spoke about an increased focus on service. Maybe if you could give us a sense of how that business is running? Is it up mid-single digit? What's the growth look like there? And then how much of that business is aftermarket now? Is it still around 35%, 40%?","Randall J. Hogan","Well, first, for everybody, it's no longer Tyco valves. It's Pentair Valves.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sorry, Pentair Valves.","Randall J. Hogan","Anyhow, the parts and service business, which is a focus for us, a greater focus, and it was up between 5% and 7% pretty much across all verticals. We sort of look at that as service and parts MRO. So interestingly, on the service side, a lot of the services is done on other people's valves. We think that's a nice growth area with this keener focus on the service side. So I would expect it to continue at that kind of a range.","John L. Stauch","I think it has an effect in MRO and you'll hear this from others as well. I think when the refineries run full out as they did in the quarter, it does delay some of the MRO spending. But overall, you're right to think about 55-ish percent is the installed base for us and that continues to do nicely.","Randall J. Hogan","Yes, right.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And just to follow up. On the Technical Solutions side of the business, it seems like margins there are close to peak. But in fact, it seems like mix is potentially negative to you right now. I know there's been some re-segmentation post the Tyco transaction. But could you talk about how you feel about margins going forward in that business? I know you've done a lot historically on the channel and operationally and on the cost side to get margins up in that business.","Randall J. Hogan","Well, mix was actually positive in the Technical Solutions segment because there was more product sales and less big projects, right? I mean, the big projects have lower margin, so that was a positive mix in the quarter. I never believe a margin should be -- is at peak. I mean, I think it's the fact that we booked -- it's over 20% this quarter proves that. I think other people in the past have said it's an 18 peak or is a 19 peak and now we're over 20. So I would say there is no peak.","John L. Stauch","And to follow on to Randy, I think we're still as optimistic. I mean, I believe and Randy has been -- has this experience, too, great businesses get even greater and they see more. And this our business that's been after Lean for the longest period of time. And we continue to think that the margins will expand from here.","Randall J. Hogan","All right. Thank you, all. And operator, if you could give the replay, please. Thank you, all, for your attention.","Operator","Thank you, everyone.

Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the executive summary on page four. There's no doubt that 2015 was a challenging year for Pentair and most other industrial companies. But we were encouraged that our fourth quarter results met our expectations operationally. Overall, earnings came in higher than forecast due to a better ongoing tax rate. And our ability to forecast sales demonstrates that the quarter-to-quarter volatility in some of our served markets may finally be showing signs of stabilizing.","While our businesses serving the Energy and Industrial markets will likely face continued challenges in 2016, the two bright spots in 2015, Food & Beverages and Residential & Commercial, appear to still have more upside. In addition, we've finally seen signs of stabilizations and some green shoots of growth within our smallest vertical, Infrastructure.","We understand why Valves & Controls has been the focus of many of our investors as our efforts to right-size the business in the face of this significant energy \u2013 in the significant energy industry reset remains a big priority. While we're now seeing sales and orders in Valves & Controls meet our forecast for the second consecutive quarter, gross margins remain under pressure due to project pricing and mix.","Our acquisition of ERICO, completed at the end of the third quarter, is delivering what we expected and the integration is well underway. Cash flow, which has historically been a hallmark for Pentair, did come in slightly short of our forecast as we had foreshadowed on our outlook call last December. This is due exclusively to working capital timing and we're fully committed to demonstrating our cash flow prowess in 2016, expecting greater than 100% adjusted net income conversion as we double down on working capital, following the dramatic top line challenges faced in 2015, principally within Valves & Controls.","We're maintaining our 2016 full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.05 per share to $4.25 per share. We made good progress on further reducing the tax rate as demonstrated in the fourth quarter. While this improved tax rate will add just under a dime compared to our prior forecast, we've lowered our Valves & Controls forecast by a similar amount given the degree of margin compression the business has faced due to project pricing and uncertainty around the timing of the recovery in the short-cycle business, which slowed in 2015. Overall, we're pleased to have met our fourth quarter expectations and our 2016 outlook remains intact.","Now let's turn to slide five for discussion of our Q4 2015 results. Fourth quarter core sales declined 4%, which was a modest improvement from the 5% decline in the third quarter. Valves & Controls was slightly better than our sales forecast, and the rate of decline is stabilized in the mid-teens. Water Quality Systems delivered strong 7% core growth. Technical Solutions' core sales were flat and Flow & Filtration Solutions showed further signs of stabilization on the top line. Overall, FX remained a headwind in the quarter, and ERICO contributed positively and in line with our commitments.","Segment income declined 7% and margins were down 90 basis points to 15.9%. As expected, Valves & Controls was the major contributor to the margin contraction, while Water Quality Systems had a very strong margin quarter. Flow & Filtration Solutions had another quarter of margin expansion, which is why we believe this segment is well positioned for further gains in 2016.","Due to end-of-the-year tax adjustments, the tax rate in the quarter was favorable and our full year rate finished just north of 21%. We believe this is an ongoing rate and expect further improvements to the tax rate in 2016. Free cash flow ended the year at $643 million, which was short of our $700 million forecast. As mentioned, free cash flow has been impacted by working capital timing due to the top-line softness we've experienced so quickly, but we expect the free cash flow to return to greater than 100% of adjusted net income in 2016.","Now, let's turn to slide six to discuss Pentair's Q4 2015 performance elements. Our performance by vertical was similar to the third quarter with solid gains in Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage being offset by ongoing pressures in both Energy and Industrial. Encouragingly, infrastructure was flat in the quarter and continued to show signs of stabilization and potential return to growth in 2016.","As you can see on the right-hand side of the page, we had another solid quarter of productivity, and with price, they more than offset inflation. Our cost-out actions in Valves & Controls continued through 2015, and we still expect over $135 million in savings to read out in 2016. Negative mix impacted both Valves & Controls and Technical Solutions. But our other two segments, Flow & Filtration Solutions and Water Quality Systems, delivered improved margins.","Now let's turn to slide seven for a review of Valves & Controls. For the fourth quarter, Valves & Controls' core sales declined 15% which was a point better than our forecast, an improvement from the 18% core decline experienced in the third quarter. FX remained a considerable headwind at 7%. Backlog was down 4% which includes the negative FX translation. Core orders declined 15% which is consistent with the double-digit rate of decline the business experienced throughout the year.","Core sales declined in three of the four sub-verticals served by Valves & Controls as mining showed growth in the quarter on the result of one project shipping. We continue to see weakness in our short-cycle business as many of our customers have cut their operational budgets in addition to their capital budgets including scaling back maintenance turnarounds. We do not expect this trend to reverse in the first quarter, but we remain optimistic that customers will begin spending more in maintenance as 2006 (sic) [2016] (7:31) progresses. As we indicated last quarter, we've seen a trend of customers delaying shipment, but there are few order cancelations at the current time.","The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Valves & Controls segment income and margins. While we continue to drive productivity, which offset inflation, it was not nearly enough to overcome the dramatic top-line drop experienced during the quarter and the year. We've aggressively been rightsizing the cost structure, but it does take time for the benefits from those actions to read out.","In addition, we've seen higher-than-normal margin compression due to pricing pressure within the project business. Mix has also been a headwind to margins as the higher-margin short-cycle business has remained under pressure.","Now let's turn to slide eight for a look at the Valves & Controls backlog. As you can see on slide eight, Valves & Controls' backlog is broken down into four key sub-verticals, three of which fall into our Energy vertical, oil & gas, power, and mining. And one, in our Industrial vertical, which is the process business.","Orders declined in all four of our sub-verticals, with oil & gas the only business to not decline double-digits. As 2015 progressed, we saw customers continue to curtail spending as they assessed their long-term plans and adjusted to the new reality of lower oil prices. Many expected oil and gas to feel the pressure, but delays in project timing have extended to other areas like LNG and petrochem.","As stated previously, it has not just been projects that have been delayed or cut. It's clear the customers have been delaying maintenance spending as well. It's still too early to call a bottom. We're encouraged at orders and (9:06) forecast for the second consecutive quarter. It's uncertain when the short-cycle business will return, but maintenance cannot be deferred forever, and we're watching for some signs of improvement beginning in the second quarter this year.","Now, let's move to slide nine to discuss the Q4 performance of Flow & Filtration Solutions. Flow & Filtration Solutions had an 8% top-line decline with core sales down 2% and foreign exchange translation, a 6% headwind. The fourth quarter showed signs of stabilization for this segment, and we continue to expect the business to return to growth in 2016.","We did see all four serve verticals contract in the quarter. Food & Beverage was down as growth in our Beverage business was not enough to offset the ongoing headwinds within agriculture. We would note that our sales decline in our agriculture-related businesses was not as bad as the overall industry. Residential & Commercial was down due to product line exits we made to better position the business longer term. While Infrastructure overall was down, this was the result of a tough comparison last year when we had a large filtration project shift.","We were encouraged to see further improvement in the trends within our North American municipal pump business. Segment income was down modestly, but margins expanded 40 basis points to 11.3%. This marks the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion and believe it is a positive sign that the actions taken in 2015 positioned the segment for further gains in 2016 and beyond.","Now let's move to slide 10 for a look at Water Quality Systems. We believe that the slower top-line growth seen in the third quarter was an anomaly and the fourth quarter growth performance was validation that Water Quality Systems remains on a positive track. During the quarter, sales grew 4% which consisted of 7% core sales growth offset by a 3% FX headwind. Both Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage grew at high-single-digit rates in the quarter.","Our aquatics business led the way once again in pre-buy activity as a good foretoken that 2016 should be another good year for aquatics. Our water purification business saw favorable growth in Europe but China remained weak as distributors exhibited caution in their order patterns.","Food service had another solid quarter and saw growth return in China after a pause in the third quarter. Segment income grew 30% and margins expanded an impressive 450 basis points to 22.3%. This dramatic improvement was a combination of strong productivity execution and positive mix on top of an easier comparison against last year's fourth quarter results.","Water Quality Systems has proven to be a consistently high performer, and we remain committed to getting all of our businesses to the same level of performance.","Now let's move to slide 11 for a look at how Technical Solutions performed in Q4. Technical Solutions reported 23% growth for the quarter, which consisted of flat core sales, a 6% headwind from FX, and a 29% positive contribution from ERICO. Industrial sales were down 2% overall as we saw further caution exercised by North American electrical distributors, offset partially by our ,industrial heat tracing business.","Energy was down 3% after growth the past few quarters, as a couple of larger heat tracing projects began to wind down. Infrastructure saw modest 2% growth following tough year-over-year comparison for the past two quarters. Residential & Commercial showed strong 7% core growth in the quarter, and ERICO, which generates a large portion of its sales from commercial, tracked with our expectations.","Segment income grew 17%, while operating margins contracted 130 basis points to a still-strong 22.6%. Principal factor contributing to the margin performance in the fourth quarter was more project shipments than product shipments within industrial heat tracing, and the margin differential between them created a negative mix impact.","ERICO met our income expectations, including synergies. While 2016 will see headwinds with the absence of two energy projects and expected first half softness continuing in the short-cycle industrial business, we remain focused on driving productivity and have taken further cost actions to deliver in this typically high-performing segment.","Let's now turn to slide 12 for a look at our full year Pentair results. For the full year 2015, our core sales declined 4%, as performance in Water Quality Systems and Technical Solutions was not enough to offset significant challenges faced by Valves & Controls served markets. Segment income declined 12%, and margins contracted 60 basis points to 15.5%.","Our tax rate ended the year at just over 21%, which was better than the 23% we projected at the beginning of the year. We believe this improved tax rate is sustainable, and would expect further improvement in reducing the tax rate in 2016.","We're not pleased with our free cash flow performance of $643 million, which represented only 90% of adjusted net income, but we know this is due fully to working capital timing, and remain committed to correct it in 2016. Overall, 2015 was a challenging year where we saw two of our segments deliver strong performance, one segment stabilize, and we're addressing the reality of the other segment.","Now let's turn to slide 13, to the 2016 outlook assumptions. Before I turn the call over to John to provide additional insight on Valves & Controls and to discuss our first quarter and 2016 outlook, I wanted to update you on what has changed since we issued our initial 2016 outlook in mid-December. As you can see on this slide, the majority of our key assumptions remain unchanged. We continue to expect solid performance from our businesses serving Residential & Commercial and Food & Beverage.","We've seen signs of stabilization within Infrastructure. Industrial is expected to continue to have a challenging first half of the year, but comparisons become less difficult in the second half, and we're encouraged that distributors may begin ordering once again in the back half of the year. Foreign exchange has been tracking to where we plan. We all know that this can change at any time.","The one area that has worsened is Energy, particularly the further decline seen in the price of oil. We've seen several major energy companies announce capital expenditure plans that call for additional 20%-plus cuts following similar reductions in 2015. Further, the delays in the short-cycle business give us pause. Don't expect any signs of improvement in the first quarter, and we'll watch the second quarter trends closely to see if customers stop deferring their maintenance spending. The other bright spot we have is the improvement in our tax rate. This added structural improvement provides an offset to the further weakening in Energy and gives us increased confidence in maintaining our full year guidance.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Randy. Please turn to slide number 14, titled V&C update. We thought it would be helpful to provide an update on our Valves & Controls business and the further deteriorating conditions in its space since issuing our initial 2006 (sic) [2016] (16:18) guidance last December.","We continue to see pressure on incoming orders, and now expect orders to be down as much as 5% for the full year of 2016. The well-publicized decline in oil prices is just one of the factors that leads us to remain cautious about the timing of order stabilization. But even more, we are watching the short-cycle business for signs that customers will begin to accelerate maintenance spending. As a result, we have modestly lowered our full year revenue forecast for 2016.","We continue to see pricing pressure on the project side of the business, and this shows up as margin compression. While we have aggressively implemented cost-out actions, we expect industry uncertainty to persist, and we plan to remove additional cost from the business. When forecasting where we see sales and orders, coupled with further anticipated margin compression, we now are forecasting return on sales in Valves & Controls to be 100 basis points lower than our original forecast, at 10.5%.","Please turn to slide number 15, labeled Non-Cash Goodwill Impairment. We performed step one of our goodwill impairment analysis as required by the accounting rules, and concluded that the fair value of Valves & Controls is below its carrying value. The carrying value was determined when we completed the Flow Control merger in 2012, when oil was over $100 that year. Since 2012, the energy industry has reset significantly, and uncertainty remains around the timing of any recovery. We are finalizing the analysis, but we currently estimate there'll be a non-cash impairment charge in the range of $400 million to $600 million, to be recorded at the time that our 10-K is published.","Please turn to slide number 16, labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Our balance sheet changed significantly with the closing of the ERICO acquisition. We added the \u2013 ended the year with $4.6 billion of net debt inclusive of cash on hand. While our balance sheet leverage at 3.75 times is higher than our targeted 2.5 times leverage ratio, we expect to bring that leverage ratio to around 3.3 times by the end of 2016.","Our ROIC ended the quarter at 9.9% as our operating income came under pressure with the top-line challenges experienced within our Valves & Controls segment. Although free cash flow ended the year at roughly 90% of adjusted net income, this was due exclusively to working capital timing and we expect a 100% conversion rate in 2016.","Please turn to slide number 17 labeled Q1 2016 Pentair Outlook. For the first quarter, we expect core sale to be up a modest 1% and total sales to grow 7% inclusive of FX headwinds in the ERICO acquisition. On a core sales basis, we expect Valves & Controls to be down roughly 7% which is a slower rate of decline than we experienced throughout 2015. Flow & Filtration Systems (sic) [Solutions'] (19:09) core sales are expected to be up 4% on an easier year-over-year comparison and project shipment timing.","Water Quality Systems' core sales are anticipated to increase approximately 5% on continued strength in aquatics. Finally, Technical Solutions' core sales are expected to be up 4% as industrial heat tracing and electronics help to offset ongoing sluggishness and closures. We have not made any changes to our ERICO forecast or expectations our synergies. We're expecting segment income to decrease modestly and return on sales to contract 110 basis points.","Below the operating line, we expect an improved tax rate of around 20.5%, net interest and other around $33 million, and the share count around 183 million. Our first quarter adjusted EPS guidance is $0.70 to $0.72, which is roughly a 7% year-over-year decline. We expect historically typical free cash flow usage in the first quarter, but turning positive as the year progresses as we continue to focus on improving our working capital performance.","Please turn to slide number 18 labeled Full Year 2016 Pentair Outlook. We are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS outlook of $4.05 to $4.25, although the components have changed some from our initial outlook provided in December. For the full year, we expect core sales to decline approximately 2%. Valves & Controls' core sales are now anticipated to be down 8%, which is 3 points worse than our original forecast, as I highlighted few slides ago.","We now expect Flow & Filtration core sales to be up modestly for the full year. Water Quality Systems' core sales are anticipated to grow approximately 4%, and Technical Solutions' core sales are expected to decline 4% for the full year. We expect segment income to be up 9% and return on sales to expand 100 basis points to 16.5% with three of our four segments delivering full year margin expansion.","We expect overall corporate costs to be approximately $90 million; net interest and other to be around $135 million; our full year tax rate to be around 20.5%, and the share count for the full year to be around 183 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be up 5% at the midpoint of the range. Finally, we expect a strong year of free cash flow, expected to be approximately 100% of adjusted net income with our working capital opportunities providing potential upside.","Jordan, can you please open the line for questions? Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I'm sure there's going to be plenty of Valves & Controls questions but I just wanted to switch to the other segments. And you've raised organic outlook by about 1 point across the board and you called out Infrastructure looks a bit better in 2016 then perhaps back in December. So maybe just comment on what you're seeing in Infrastructure that makes you feel more confident. And perhaps within TS, given the midstream CapEx outlooks getting cut, what gives you confidence that that would be better than back in December?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, infrastructure is looking better but also aquatics is looking better. The Water Quality Systems, aquatics is the pool business and it exited the year with a really good tailwind. But in terms of Infrastructure, we've seen the order rate pick up and our backlog pick up in both pumps and in filtration. So it's been a while building and we expect that to actually lift growth for mostly Flow & Fluid (sic) [Filtration] (23:00) Solutions next year.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then...","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","(23:05)","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then within TS, Randy what gives you more confidence there?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","(23:14) question.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Nigel, what gives us a little more confidence in Technical Solutions...","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, Technical Solutions.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We' were waiting to see where ended the year with the backlog in the industrial heat tracing solutions business primarily around the projects. And it ended stronger, and therefore, the shippable backlog heading into 2016 was slightly higher and that was the (23:31).","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I see. Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Your line is open.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, wanted to touch on Valves & Controls first and maybe you can update us on what the 2016 customer CapEx decline assumptions that you're making. We know with since December oil has worsened and you cited customers' CapEx plan at 20% plus down. But how are you thinking broadly if you divide that up between upstream, midstream, downstream?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I'd say first and foremost, I don't think we see a lot of upstream activity and a lot of these projects were in the process of being cut throughout the year, Deane. So, we look at front log which is the things prior to coming into the quote funnel. So, what are the opportunities we might be quoting in any given year? And that front log this year is significantly low as it relates to upstream activity.","When we get into midstream, midstream still has a fair amount of the front log activity and we are still quoting a significant amount of midstream activity. And then the downstream business, we would've expected that to be a productivity-based investment. And we've seen delays in the quoting activity there. So, we've got an order outlook next year as we suggested that's down further than what we anticipated. And then we expect the conversion ratio of how many of those orders that we convert within the year to be down further. And hence, that's why we've taken down the Valves & Controls forecast even further.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. What I'm actually looking for is your broad market assumption about how much will your customer CapEx declines be in 2016? So, we've seen estimates as high as down 35% in the upstream side. So, I just wanted to know, what assumptions are you making for your customers on their CapEx plans for 2016?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. If I could \u2013 Deane, we haven't in the past shown a really good relationship between the CapEx numbers of the \u2013 the big CapEx numbers and then what really happens to our orders numbers. We've had \u2013 obviously, we've gotten better at forecasting our sales.","What we focus on is what John called that front log. We've seen a lot of projects that were being thought of that are no longer in that front log, or things that we're chasing. So, we're focusing on what's in our backlog and what we can ship and what is in that \u2013 what real projects are in that front log, and what's our probability of getting them. And that's how we come to it.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's fair. And then, just on the pricing side, you called out pricing pressures on projects. We've seen that now for a year and half. Maybe you can give us some sense of how much pricing is down, size that. And then, we've started to see pricing pressure on the short cycle. Look, everyone's seeing this maintenance deferral. We're seeing that sector-wide, but give us a sense of what that's impacting on pricing on short cycle as well.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, the short-cycle pricing, Deane, is called out on our Valves & Controls walk because we list prices part number to part number and, therefore, the standard product is a light product. And so, you get a sense of where that price is. And right now, that's roughly around 1% today. We're anticipating that to get a little bit tougher as we head into 2016.","The majority of what we call margin pressure is around the project side and the fact that the projects are coming through at a slightly lower margin. But we're also experiencing a mix differential between less standard product on the short cycle and more of the projects coming out of the backlog, and that caught us by surprise in Q4, especially around December, and we've loaded in those expectations continuing into Q1 and ramping a little bit better as we get the cost benefits reading out in Q2, Q3 and Q4 from our efforts.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And just last question for me. On the free cash flow, you talked about this in December, so it's not a surprise that you came up short on the 2015 target. But just to clarify, was there any extension of payment terms for customers at year-end? We saw this in some of the other flow names that, to help customers at year-end. Was that a factor in this? And then real specifically, when do you expect to recoup those receivables?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The short answer is no to the first question, Deane. It's not something that we've done or needed to do. And as we think about recovering this year, we felt like we had realized the impact of the working capital builds right when I took over in the interim role and we've been after reducing those inventory levels and therefore getting after those receivable collections. So, we're very focused on getting the cash in here in Q1 and Q2. And we feel like we're going to make very good progress.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's good to hear. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That chart that you guys gave, I think slide number 10 from your Investor Day where you talked about Valves & Controls' backlog and orders. First of all, the scheduled backlog of $990 million, is that still intact or has there been some movement in that? And also, how do I reconcile the orders down 8% in that slide and the orders of flat to down 5%? Is that just short-cycle orders you're talking about?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, real quickly, we're down about $40 million to $50 million on the starting backlog position, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And that would represent movements out of 2016 into 2017, and that's what we know of today.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The orders on the slides are still the same number. I apologize. One's core and one's inclusive of FX so roughly the same.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And what we're having a little bit of change to our forecast on is we usually convert about half of those orders within a year, but we're expecting the orders to be a little bit more back-end loaded and therefore, we won't be getting as many of the orders shipped in 2016 as we originally anticipated.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then the start to the year in Valves & Controls, this 6.5% margin, I don't recall it being that seasonal historically. Is there something, I guess, just it's a function of the timing of the cost-saves ramping throughout the course of the year. Anything unusual here in the first quarter to have that \u2013 and that's kind of an unusually low-margin rate.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think there's three things, Steve. One is we have an unusually low shipment number of 385, and we haven't been below 400 in this business in some time, and that reflects the shippable backlog. But it also reflects the number two issue which is we're expecting the standard product to be slow again in Q1 as we wait for our customers to get their expense budgets aligned and decide where they're going to spend the expense and maintenance dollars, so we have a low mix ratio related to that and also a lower expectation.","And then the third element is exactly what you said. We've recognized about $11 million to $12 million on a quarterly basis with a cost takeout of $150 million and that ramps throughout the year. And the first quarter reflects what we have to do with the inventory accounting and putting that into the inventory and then shipping the old inventory first, before we can recognize the benefits. So, those are the three unusual aspects to Q1.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. One last quick one. You mentioned weakness in LNG. I know it's kind of a slow-moving train here over the course of the next couple years, and should roll down dramatically toward the end of the decade. I guess, are you surprised at how early you're seeing some weakness there? Is that just \u2013 are they cancelling some projects? Is there a destocking going on there? I know that some of the compression orders at others have been very, very weak on that front. I'm just trying to kind of understand the timing, because...","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","(31:43)","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Just on the timing of the LNG stuff. What you're seeing there.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Our view is ultimately, LNG is going to play a bigger role in the energy mix worldwide and the U.S. will be, and should be, a net exporter. There were a lot of projects in pre-feed, in planning. They've all been pretty much put on the shelves, and some of the other ones that actually were in design have been slowed down. So that was the reference that we're talking about. Because what we're really looking at, things we were expecting to be happening in the near term versus \u2013 they may still happen, but they may be two or three years out now instead of 2016, 2017.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think we were hinting at Analyst Day that, although people were bullish about that activity because of low feedstocks, you got to look at global demand. And the global demand just isn't there at the rate that would support all of those projects coming through. So, I guess to answer your question, are we surprised in this whole energy reset aspect? No, we're not surprised.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No, no. I get that. I'm just trying to get an idea. I think LNG is going to be kind of a debacle at some point in the next couple years. But I guess the timing is kind of hard to nail down, just because of how big these projects are and the multi-year nature of them. So I'm just more of a timing question than anything else. Thanks, guys.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks and good morning, all.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey Steve.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, can you maybe comment on Resi & Commercial construction a little bit further? It sounded like you're still bullish here, but maybe a little more of what you're seeing out there and the kind of rate of deceleration, or a finer point on what actual growth do you expect in that vertical this year?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, this year, we're expecting mid-single digits in the U.S. And actually, we've seen some life in Europe as well. We actually saw some growth in the fourth quarter in Water Quality, and a little bit in the aquatics business \u2013 excuse me, in the water purification part of Water Quality, both of those both being Water Quality Systems.","So, stronger Europe than last year and continuing strength in the U.S. Multi-family and then continuing, as home prices increase, the pool business is back. And the innovation and the switch to energy-saving products and more sustainable products are still \u2013 that conversion is still happening ,and we're the leader in that. So, all of the things that's been working for us in aquatics are still working.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Do you think there's upside to the $0.40 number from ERICO then?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You know what? I want to get that $0.40 number, and then we'll talk. But I was pleased with the fourth quarter, and the order rate, the execution rate. And there's some clear sales synergies that we weren't counting on, that are being worked, that I'm hopeful we'll see read out, even this year.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Steve, I would just add on that we're really impressed with the talent that we got with ERICO. It's a great sales and marketing capability, and really excited about the opportunities across the channels that their selling team and our selling team combined can bring to bear.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And just one more comment on, or question on impairment, the non-cash goodwill. The $400 million to $600 million impairment, what's your sense that this is kind of the last impairment that we'll see here?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think the goal of any impairment is that it should be the last that you see.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah. But I guess, when you were quantifying this in the first level, were you taking a look at \u2013 were you assuming that the energy headwinds would sort of tail off and come back by 2017? Is that kind of embedded in the valuation?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. If that were the case, there wouldn't be one.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So maybe going back to Steve's question earlier around the V&C margin ramp post 1Q. It looks like you guys stepped up your cost-outs to $150 million. Should we be thinking about the benefits coming through in a linear fashion, starting in 2Q? Or is there a ramp as the year progresses?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","There's a ramp when we \u2013 as we progress. I mean, we hit a full annual rate right around Q3. And it really is more about the manufacturing cost-out having to work its way through the inventory side. The benefits on the selling and marketing and the benefits on the G&A are linear, and we've got most of those behind us. And so those are going to be experienced in Q1, Q2 and Q3 and Q4 pretty evenly. And the manufacturing side has to work its way through the inventory, and we have to move the old inventory out first. And we don't have the quickest inventory turns in this business, so that's why it takes till the end of Q2 to really get on a full run rate for Q3 and Q4.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We also believe the mix between short cycle and projects \u2013 short cycle, and then aftermarket and projects, is going to improve.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. And maybe \u2013 and Randy, if for some reason it doesn't improve, and especially in V&C, if the orders turn out to be worse than flat to down 5%, are there other areas within the cost structure that you guys can continue to take cost-outs? Or are we getting closer to the maximum amount that you could actually take out before you start to impact any service levels?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I never like to say never, but I think we'd have to think differently about \u2013 I mean, the team there has done a heroic job of adjusting the cost structure to one of the most precipitous drops in sales that I've ever seen. And they're executing well. We're going to have to think about it more creatively if we need to do anything else in terms of costs. I mean, it's just conjecture at this point.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think as a forecast that John showed you is one \u2013 and I understand, first quarter is lower than was expected. But it really is that mix and it's the cost readout in the overall volume level, as John said.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There hasn't been a shipment volume below $400 million in our records.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. We didn't have it in our numbers either. And maybe one broader question on just Valves & Controls, and as you kind of think about the portfolio longer term. Clearly, when you bought this asset back in 2012, it turned out to be a lot more cyclical than you guys initially anticipated. How do you guys think about the long-term opportunity for Valves & Controls within this portfolio? And is there an opportunity to maybe think about whether Valves & Controls should actually even be part of the broader portfolio?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It may be hard for people to believe but we still believe this Valves & Controls business is a high-quality business with good people, and a lot of the product lines are real crown jewels. Not all of them, but a lot of them are.","Right now, it certainly is a boat anchor to the rest of the business which is rising. And so, we want to correct that. And we wanted this diversity, this exposure to energy. I would say this is much more than just a cyclical turn. There hasn't been anything as deep as this since the 1980s. And so, I think it's too early to conjecture.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think either way, I mean what Randy's asked me to do is think about this business being much more \u2013 how do we think about it as more predictable, consistent earnings stream, meaning a lot less project dependent and a lot more aftermarket installed-base dependent. And then, making sure we understand what our customers value of what we sell and what they don't value of what we sell. And then, thinking about the fact that when you lose this amount of revenue, what's more important is your income and your margin dollars as you think forward.","So, either way, we've got to make this a really good business, and I think we have the opportunity to take what Randy's direction is and have it contribute value in the future.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is open.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Morning, guys.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Shannon.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. In terms of this watching the short cycle in Valves & Controls and the maintenance spending, there's been the view from you guys and others that you can't defer maintenance forever and this should come back. But we're probably a few quarters past where a lot of people thought it would have started to come back already. So, do you have any more visibility into, could this really continue to get pushed? Are people finding other ways to actually operate without doing the typical maintenance just because \u2013 go ahead.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We have real examples of people servicing a valve instead of what they would have replaced before. In-sourcing service to keep their people busy, if they have them, versus where they would have usually contracted it. That sorts itself out. It laps itself. But we saw it was worse in the second half than the first half, and it was worse in the fourth quarter than the average of the second half. And that can't continue.","These are a lot \u2013 these are mission critical products that are part of processes that are precision and can be \u2013 well, by law, they have to be serviced. And so, they can't do it forever. I mean, right now, as I think you know, crack spreads have been great. So, the longer you can run a refinery, the better. But ultimately, you have to maintain them. So, that's the other thing, those two things. One is a shift to lower-cost ways of servicing and then there's the fact that if they can run them a little bit harder when the crack spreads are high, they make money on the refining side.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then similar question on the Industrial side. As you look at Hoffman, anything changing there on the margin? Do you think we've worked our way through any more of the destocking dynamic or just general malaise? Anything in the market there that you think things changing?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Our assumption for the first quarter and the first half is that it's going to be like it was in the fourth quarter. And in terms, if you just look at the stocking in North America distribution, in the fourth quarter, it was down. I think the whole uncertainty around CapEx is distributors always freeze a little bit more. And so, I think we aren't seeing anything for this first half. It's different than the fourth quarter, but the fourth quarter wasn't good.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Randall J.

Your line is open.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, Randy, John, Jim.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey.","Jim Lucas - Vice President-Investor Relations and Strategy","Hey, Nathan.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","If I could just look at the mix issue that you're talking about, Randy, I understand that short-cycle orders or probably short-cycle revenues drop off before project revenues do, but I'm (44:34) that eventually, project revenues will decline more than the short-cycle revenues, and you will actually flip that mix from being a headwind to a tailwind. Can you talk about how that progresses through the year or into next year and what kind of impact you'd expect that to have on margins as we progress through that mix shift?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. You got to look at it business by business. In Valves & Controls, actually, the short cycle held up much better than projects. And it was really in the fourth quarter where the decline was about the same. So, we would expect that to \u2013 we don't think it gets better in the first quarter. That's why I was saying that we're watching to see whether there's improvements and we're certainly taking actions to help improve that in Valves & Controls. In the case of Technical Solutions where we have the industrial heat trace projects, which a lot of them are not oil and gas related. There are other industries. And the backlog is good there.","There is the Hoffman business being down versus those projects. That gets better in the second half because, just by comparison. Because Hoffman was down in the second half and we don't think it's \u2013 as we get to lapping that, we don't think we'll see further down. So, there should be a mix improvement in Technical Solutions in the second half.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","But Nathan, I think you're right long-term, is that as you work the backlog off and you work the large projects off, those do have a lower margin and mix overall. Over time, should be a mix benefit. Now that being said, as Randy was just saying, we ship about $900 million of short-cycle. So, it would take a lot of incremental short-cycle sales to make up for the project sales that are declining.","So \u2013 and we've got to fill the factories as well, as you know, and work our way through this, so. I think it's a short-term issue on the mix challenges and I think the business will sort its way out. And I think there's still productivity opportunities and I think it's into 2017 before we see that turning favorable.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Is it possible to quantify what the positive mix impact will be or what the negative one has been thus far?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we did give a hint that the negative one so far, which is total standard margin, has come down about 600 basis points over the last two years.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And you did make a positive comment on the North American municipal pump business. Can you give me some more color on what that's up, how it's progressing, what your expectations are for 2016 and beyond?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I did make \u2013 I think I may have a positive comment about that. No, the order rate has picked up and so that's gone into the backlog. So, we're expecting improvement. We saw improvement in the fourth quarter. And after \u2013 it was down in the first half, flat in the third quarter, up in the fourth quarter. The backlog is good. I think as governments healed a little bit with tax revenue, they were able to get back to spending.","Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the help.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Jeffrey D. Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys.

Your line is open.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Brian.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Just coming back to the free cash flow. So, with the working capital disruption you mentioned in 2015, I would've suspected you would've had some early collections in 2016. So, why \u2013 I'm making the assumption that that's not coming through in the first quarter, and maybe just extend on that. Why wouldn't the full year be better than 100%?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We certainly will attempt to do that. And the first quarter is always a negative quarter for us because we pay taxes, we pay bonuses, we're building working capital in the businesses that didn't do a bad job in working capital which is the water businesses and as getting ready for their seasonal highs in the second and third quarter. So, that's why.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","But would the working capital that was pushed, are you expecting that in the first quarter or is that (50:29) sometime later in the year?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, Brian, if you're asking will the Q1 usage be better than the Q1 usage last year, the answer is yes. We believe it will be better.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. Okay.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","But our seasonality is we do use cash in Q1 and we start to deliver significant cash in Q2, Q3 and Q4.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got it. Okay. And then, just the commentary about maintenance starting to improve, why \u2013 I mean, are you confident that this is not more of a secular change about in-sourcing or internalizing some of that maintenance? Do you just provide a superior economical offering, where that's probably only temporary, where your customers are able to do it themselves but maybe, over the long-term, it's not worthwhile for them to do it? Why are you confident...","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, part of it is we'll...","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We'll start lapping the declines and it'll be flat year-over-year, number one. Number two, ultimately, when they really want to adjust costs, they should outsource it. And so, right now, this is in major industry changes. And before, you'll see people in-source work to bridge a soft spot, if you will, and then, when they realize that there's a structural change, they start looking at their cost structure. Look at BP's announcement, for instance. And then, when they don't have the people, they have to go outside the (51:58).","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","But, Brian, just to clarify, we did not say it's improving in Q1. Matter of fact, we said it is not improving in Q1.","Randall J.

Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","In the future.","John L.

Your line is open.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Josh.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Just from a high-level perspective, and I want to make sure I'm understanding this correctly. So, maybe versus mid-December and, John, I think you put up a slide about normal EPS seasonality. And that would have read out to something in more like the high $0.70s versus the low $0.70s for the first quarter. And, I guess, if I'm understanding this right, a lot of the issues in Valves & Controls just come from being kind of below threshold in the first quarter on shipments. But, I guess I'm not really seeing a lot of the incremental caution that you're talking about, whether it be from price or from delayed maintenance spending readout. Is that the right way to think about it, or are those happening and then just some of these pockets of surprise growth versus a month ago in the other segments are offsetting that? I guess, if you were just to zoom out and look at it from the highest level.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, let me go back to that seasonality. I agree that we put that up. I think we have two elements that I will draw attention to. One is, our corporate costs are going to be significantly higher in Q1 than the rest of the year. That's related to vesting schedules of options in restricted stock, directors, officers, chairmen, as well as just general corporate spending. And that's about $0.04, Josh, to that level. And that is different this year than it has been in prior years.","The other element is that we feel that the shippable backlog and ability to do better than the shippable backlog in Q1 in Valves & Controls is at its weakest opportunity in Q1. And those are the only two things that we're reflecting differently than the normal seasonality schedule that we shared with you.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess, just as a follow-up from an earlier question on midstream as it pertains to, I guess, both Valves & Controls and Technical Solutions, I kind of lost the answer somewhere in there between the quote log and shippable backlog and what your customers are seeing and how those all interplay. But is your expectation that that market is okay this year? And how should we think about that from a timing schedule into 2017 or beyond, I guess, just given some of those big cuts that we've seen at some of your customers?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think it all reflects it, if you think about the front log of what I'd say the projects that we're looking at, or the opportunities before we're even quoting, you should think about that being down at least 25% versus normalized levels. We then have to then quote, and we're going to get our fair share of products where we're automatically specced in or we're the likely player, and that's what represents the quote log, and then the orders are an output of that.","And as you can imagine, that's a moving funnel of opportunities where, every single quarter, you're converting each of those. So, I think the news that we're sharing today is that we still think we're going to get our fair share of what our opportunities are, but the opportunities are lower. And we think that continues through 2017.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Gotcha. Okay.

Good morning.","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Chris.","Jim Lucas - Vice President-Investor Relations and Strategy","Morning.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Just a question about the capital structure, and what are the shifts in urgency and priority bias right now? Because we've clearly seen that leverage is out of fashion in terms of its impact on equity values, and maybe it's a more durable dynamic than to say merely out of fashion. And would you say the bar has raised on what qualifies as a viable deal prospect?","Randall J. Hogan - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say so.

Your line is open.","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks. I just wanted to ask about the progression of EPS and organic revenue growth in 2Q, 3Q, 4Q. If we're going to do about $0.70, $0.71 in the first quarter, how do we think about EPS in 2Q, 3Q, 4Q? Is this going to be more like a $1.10, $1.10, $1.25? Or \u2013 any direction there would be helpful.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think we gave out seasonality before, and we kind of took a look at what Q1 is. And as we mentioned, there's a reason, or two reasons, that Q1 is slightly lower. But we would then expect that our normal seasonality, which is reflected in last year's delivering on that EPS, to be appropriate.","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Then for organic revenue growth, 2Q, 3Q, 4Q?","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ramping throughout the year. As we suggested, our year-over-year comparisons get a little easier in Q3 and Q4. So we have the trends out of Q1, or Q4, continuing through Q1 and into Q2, and then we begin to get a little easier comparisons in Q3 and Q4.","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","John, that's a little confusing to me just because in first quarter you're going to be up 1% in core sales and then for the balance of the year forecasting down 2%. So there's got to be \u2013 you're going to be down from 1%, right? So it's not really progressing up throughout the year.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, yeah. No, no, no, no. I get that. I'm sorry. I mean, we have some projects that are running out and those are in the Technical Solutions side. And so absent the Technical Solutions projects, my point is that Q2 is our seasonal quarter.","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah.","John L. Stauch - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And then Q3 is down due to the fact that we tend to have the August. But on a year-over-year basis, everything other than the projects in Q3 and Q4 are about the same. And, Brian, I'm just not going to give you Q2 EPS guidance on this call today. That's where I'm going there.","Brian P. Drab - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After your presenter's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Jim Lucas, you may begin your conference.","Jim Lucas","Thanks, Rob. And welcome to Pentair's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, and with me today is John Stauch, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Borin, our Chief Financial Officer.","On today's call, we will provide details on our second quarter 2019 performance as well as our third quarter and full year 2019 outlook as outlined in this morning's press release.","Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the Company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent Form 10-Q, Form 10-K and today's press release.

Please turn to Slide Number 4, titled Executive Summary. We are pleased to deliver second quarter results in-line with our expectations, even as weather issues lingered throughout the quarter. We continued to believe that the underlying demand trends in our businesses remain healthy and we have plenty of growth opportunities ahead of us. Our second half outlook demonstrates progress against unprecedented inflation inclusive of tariffs and we now believe that we will get back to our 18% tax rate for the remainder of 2019 and for 2020.","Our recent acquisitions Aquion and Pelican are performing in-line with expectations. Further, both deals help us accelerate our Residential Water Treatment strategy, which I will provide an update on later in the call. We are continuing to invest in our top growth priorities and I will provide more color on our focused opportunities after Mark shares details on Q2 and our updated guidance.","I will now turn the call over to Mark.","Mark Borin","Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 5 labeled Q2'19 Pentair Performance. For the second quarter, we saw core sales increased 1%, segment income fall 6% and adjusted EPS was down 3%. We will provide more color on the individual segment performance shortly. Below the line we saw an adjusted tax rate of 18%, net interest\/other expense of $10.6 million and our average shares in the quarter were 170.5 million. We had originally expected our tax rate to increase in 2019 due to proposed IRS rule changes, because the proposed rules have not yet been finalized and enacted, as well as actions to help mitigate the expected impact; we now believe our full year adjusted tax rate will be at the 18% level we reported in 2018.","Finally, free cash flow was well north of $300 million and in-line with normal seasonal patterns. As John, mentioned in his opening remarks, we are pleased to deliver operational results in line with expectations, despite the lingering weather issues.","Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q2 19 Pentair Segment Performance. This slide lays out the second quarter performance of our three segments. As this slide illustrates two of our three segments delivered core sales growth in the quarter. The one exception was Aquatics, which continues to be impacted by weather delays and excess channel inventory. Aquatic saw segment income declined 4% on a 2% core sales decline.","Filtration Solutions returned to growth, delivering 1% core sales growth. We commented that the first quarter results were impacted by a number of one-time issues and we believe that the second quarter performance shows that many of those issues have moderated. Segment income was down 4% and margins declined 250 basis points against a very tough comparison last year and negative mix during the quarter. We saw growth in our industrial and food and beverage businesses, while residential was relatively flat in the quarter. We continue to focus on positioning Filtration Solutions to drive more consistent and predictable growth and anticipate margins mixing up over time.","Flow Technologies delivered 5% core sales growth as price continue to read out and we also saw improvement in our commercial and infrastructure businesses. Although the agriculture markets continue to be down for us, agriculture performed in line with our revised expectations. Segment income declined 6%, however, the segment margin decline was half the rate we experienced in the first quarter. This was the last tough comparison around inflation and we are expecting flow margins to turn positive in the second half.","Please turn to Slide 7 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. We are pleased with our second quarter cash flow performance and delivered $343 million in free cash flow, which is in line with normal seasonal patterns. During the quarter, we successfully completed a $400 million 10-year note offering, which was used to repay debt incurred to fund our first quarter acquisitions, and will also be used to help fund our second half debt maturities. With the new offering, our debt structure is now predominantly fixed and we continue to have strong balance sheet optionality. Also in the second quarter, we repurchased 150 million of our shares in line with our annual share repurchase plan.","Please turn to Slide 8 labeled Q3'19 Pentair Outlook. We anticipate third quarter sales, core sales to decrease 1% to 3%. We expect Aquatic Systems to be down 8% to 10%, as we continue to focus on making sure channel inventories return to more normalized levels by the end of the year. We expect Filtration Solutions to be up 1% to 3% and Flow Technologies to be flat to up 2%. We anticipate segment income to be approximately flat to up 2%, as we expect inflation comparisons to ease and price to fully read out and we continue to drive productivity. We expect adjusted EPS to be in a range of $0.54 to $0.56 per share. Below the line, we expect corporate expenses to be approximately $14 million to $15 million. We expect our third quarter tax rate to be 18%. We also expect net interest other expense of roughly $9 million and shares to be approximately 169 million.","Please turn to Slide 9 labeled Full Year 2019 Pentair Outlook. Slide 9 looks at the different components of our updated 2019 outlook. For the full year, we expect core sales to be flat to down 1%, as we continue to expect price of roughly 3% for the full year. We expect flat to up 1% with roughly 2% contribution from the recently announced acquisitions offset by 1% headwind from FX. We anticipate segment income to be approximately 2%; we expect full year adjusted EPS to be approximately $2.35 per share. Other items embedded in our guidance include corporate expense of $60 million to $65 million, a tax rate of 18%, net interest other expense of $37 million and an average share count for the year of 171 million shares.","As we look at our 2019 second half and full year expected performance, it is important to consider the unusual circumstances we have experienced in 2018 and the first half of 2019. Starting in the second half of 2018 and through the first half of 2019, we experienced significant material inflation partially driven by tariffs of over $120 million. In 2018, we implemented price increases in part to address this dramatic increase and inflation and the net result was a significant increase in inventory levels in our distribution channels. Through the first half of 2019, as these elevated inventory levels are being worked down, several of our key markets and pools in agriculture were hit with historically wet cold weather, resulting in a delay and inventory channel levels being worked down.","We believe this perfect storm of unusual external factors resulted in far from normal experience in the first two quarters of 2019. As we look forward to 2020, we expect to return to a more normalized level of performance more in-line with our long-term expectations.","I would now like to turn the call back to John.","John Stauch","Thank you, Mark. Please turn to Slide Number 10, labeled Focused Strategies. I wanted to provide an update on our two focus growth strategies. We recently completed a comprehensive North American residential consumer segmentation, which has provided great insights into how to better position two of our key businesses pool and residential and commercial water filtration for differentiated growth. The segmentation analysis gave us granularity as to our customers' needs, behaviors and key attributes. These insights allow us to better understand their buying behaviors, as well as customer journey mapping in future product insights to meet their needs. These insights are critical to driving our marketing efforts and to be more targeted in the types of personas that we want to engage with in the future and how to best connect them with our channel partners.","As we focus on advancing pool growth, we have opportunities in both the new and replacement markets. Whether only about 75,000 new pools built a year, we see opportunities to increase our content per pool, particularly around automation and connected solutions, as well as new products in the areas of remote monitoring, advanced energy efficiency and simplicity of maintenance. These are also similar opportunities with approximately 5 million installed in ground pools, we continue to look at the poolpad as pools ecosystem. Through this lens, we are developing more efficient treatment technologies as well as smart, an IoT enabled products that seamlessly configure and operate more effectively together. These solutions are being managed by what we believe are best-in-class apps that enable a superior user experience, as well as opportunities to drive improved levels of customer service.","Accelerating residential and commercial water treatment is our other primary growth opportunity; the first area we are focusing on is end-to-end residential consumer filtration. Here our two recent acquisitions are playing an important part. Aquion brought to us systems capabilities as well as affiliated RainSoft dealers. Pelican brought an online capability that expands our omnichannel reach.","Similar to what we have done in Aquatic Systems, we have been looking at water treatment applications throughout the home as a system offering. Through this work, we have identified many customer back opportunities to create differentiated water treatment products and systems. We are developing more efficient treatment technologies tackling some of the challenges that are top of mind for consumers today, such as lead removal and delivering great tasting water at every tap in your home.","We also been developing and we will soon be launching the Pentair home and Pentair pro apps that bring our new suite of smart IoT enabled products to life. These sets of apps seamlessly connect consumers, water treatment service providers and Pentair to provide product performance monitoring, control and service.","The second opportunity we see is building our commercial filtration business. We have enjoyed strong presence in foodservice historically and we plan to continue to focus in this area. There are other areas such as commercial office water that offer additional growth opportunities over time. We believe that these are two significant and focus growth opportunities that can accelerate our organic growth rates and create significant share on the value.","I would now like to turn the call over to Rob for Q&A, after which I will have a few closing remarks. Rob, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Steve Tusa","Just thinking about the fourth quarter, I mean, how are we -- how do we think about kind of the comp there in Aquatics, there is a lot moving around, obviously you had a bit of a pre-buy last year, you're still saying it's going to be I guess, up what -- are we comfortable with that?","John Stauch","Hi, Steve; when you say up -- time up, revenue up, income up, just trying to\u2026","Steve Tusa","Yes, I guess whatever revenue and income, I think it's up -- I don't know, I'm sorry I've been in another call, so I didn't -- I'm not -- maybe I missed that. Just talk about -- just talk about how you approach the comp in the fourth quarter I guess?","John Stauch","Yes, first to talk about Q4 overall. So, with respect to Aquatics, Aquatics on the top-line is when you work out the math is down slightly.","Steve Tusa","Okay.","John Stauch","In volume, so that is kind of acknowledging a bit of the comp from the prior year, as well as are the continued working down of the inventory that we talked about previously. The other two businesses, we do see those as improving from a revenue perspective some of that's driven by price and some driven by volume. And when you look at the bottom line and think about kind of the year-over-year we start to get, we get more help from price, we are less of a headwind from inflation. We certainly had the acquisitions are embedded in there, so those start to add as well. And then productivity gets better in Q4, if you remember last year we called out some challenges in the Flow business, so we start to see some productivity improvements. They start to read out in Q3, but then continue to ramp up in Q4.","Steve Tusa","And when you think about the myriad of items, the kind of hit the other businesses, the non-Aquatics business in the first quarter could you maybe just discuss any changes in some of the bigger moving parts in the first quarter? You know the negative items like there were some weakness in Europe in Filtration, there were few things. And any kind of changes on those front that bounce back or anything here, I mean, it looks like it was a little more stable and a little better in those businesses.","John Stauch","Steve, I think that's the right way to think about it. Things were a little more stable, you know, in particular -- in filtration, we did call out a number of what I referenced a sort of unusual or one-time type items in Q1. Those stabilize and moderated in Q2. We didn't see certainly a headwind from Europe, for example, in Q2, in filtration and the businesses was better performance in Q2 and we would anticipate seeing something similar as we work through the balance of the year.","Steve Tusa","Okay.","Mark Borin","Steve, the only issue we had in Q2 outside of Aquatics was weather impacting our irrigation businesses and flow in Q2 and that didn't get better off the Q1, but other than that is we don't think that's a lingering effect because the seasons kind of come and gone.","Steve Tusa","And then are you guys buying back stock? Did you buyback any in the quarter? And what's your appetite for the second half?","John Stauch","Yes, so we've bought back 150 million shares in the quarter and that represents our plan for the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is open.","Nathan Jones","Good morning, everyone. I'd like to focus a little bit on the productivity line here. It was a headwind of $6 million bucks to operating income in the quarter. I know your net growth investments against underlying productivity there. So, can you just give us a little more color on what led to that $6 million headwind in the quarter?","Mark Borin","Yes, Nathan. It's frankly it's a number of sort of small items that you know that individually don't really amount too much, but overall what drives the $6 million. I think one of the things that we see is, we do see productivity starting to build. As you know productivity, as we start to work through, it takes a little time to work its way through inventory. So, we can see that building up in inventory and that's what gives us confidence that we will start to see that, that productivity number churn as we work our way into Q3 and Q4, and we see our operational and supply productivity actions starting to read out.","John Stauch","Nathan, I would just add that we have significant progress on sourcing that we're making up on against the inflationary issues and that is a positive, and we feel confident about that continuing. We had one lingering productivity issue, which is our larger pump flow business and we're continuing to experience headwinds there that we feel confident, we've got the on-time delivery back up and we've got most of the past due being worked down as we head into Q3 here. So, we feel good about that turning around to a positive in the back half of the year, as Mark mentioned. And I just, like, lastly mentioned that these two growth initiatives, we have a great pool business and we're continue to invest in it despite what's going on with the weather headwinds. So, we're putting a fair amount of sales, customer service support against that. And then also on the end-to-end residential solutions, which is our Pelican business; we're investing heavily to build out the brand in the marketing efforts there. So, those are some negatives against what I think is a sustained positive productivity that you should see in Q3 and Q4.","Nathan Jones","Well, I wouldn't call growth investments in negative even though that does negatively affect that productivity number. But maybe I could push you a little bit further on this because I did go back and read the transcript from third quarter last year. And there was talk about productivity improvements coming from sourcing improvements that would come at a later date. There was talk about some of these inventory, the productivity improvements building an inventory and three quarters later, we're still seeing a negative number here in productivity. So, any color you can -- if more color you can give us on where the confidence comes that we are going to see a turnaround in that number in the second half of the year, when it's been quite a long time coming here.","John Stauch","Yes, Nathan, all I can say is that, as I said, we do start to see it actually reading out in inventory, which would then come through and we see it through the P&L. And the funnels that gives us the confidence are built in a very detailed granular level action start to build up and we see them starting the anniversary and carry over. So, I can't comment on sort of the relationship to last year, but certainly when we look at this year and the activities that the teams are working on, we feel confident about the Q3 and Q4 trajectory there.","Nathan Jones","Would you be prepared to give us a number that you'd expect out of that productivity line in the second half of the year?","John Stauch","We wouldn't specifically comment on that other than to say that, it certainly is going to improve over the number that we see for Q2.","Nathan Jones","Fair enough. Okay, thanks for the help. I'll pass it on.","John Stauch","Nathan, I share your energy and passion around this. I think we feel good about the sequential run rate of our cost structures, if they go forward. When you look at a year-over-year, I mean, if you take back at Filtration Solutions Q2 last year and the ROS that they had, you saw a pretty high ROS. So, we've got some year-over-year comparables in this Q2 that aren't the same comparables as we head into Q3 and Q4. In growth is such a huge component of this drop through that, that's why Mark is not going to give you an exact number at this time.","Nathan Jones","Fair enough. I'll pass it on. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is open.","Joe Giordano","So I just want to start on Aquatics just talking through the progression throughout the year. So, we make last quarter we kind of readjust everything, we have some -- you had some tough comps coming through in the back half of the year. And so what, -- what when you look at that landscape today is different versus three months ago outside of like some of the weather impacts, when you think about second half specifically for the revenue side of things for Aquatics?","Mark Borin","Yes, really, Joe, the underlying fundamentals continue to be similar to what we commented on at the end of the first quarter, it's really the impact of continued wet cold weather in April and May that significantly impacted sort of our ability to bring down those inventory levels, and so the inventory reduction is led to the right and now that's what's effect in Q3 and Q4. That's really the story for a products, both on the top-line and then when you think about the drop-through on to the bottom line as well.","Joe Giordano","And then when I think you mentioned in the slides commercial office water, I'm not sure I remember hearing too much about that in the past. Is that something new that you guys are working on, can you kind of talk to that opportunity what that landscape looks like?","John Stauch","Yes, thank you for bringing it up. I mean it's really as we have a good foodservice relationship and when you take a water in foodservice it's really critical and important to our end consumers even the form of making coffee, pizza dough, making sure they got safe clean water and good tasting water for their restaurant customers. We also have all those products that we sell into the commercial office water space. And what we're seeing with the office space is being reconfigured and redone, as people want the good tasting water more at the tap, or the capability and then we feel we have superior technology around carbonation capability and also mineral dosing or flavor dosing capability.","We could bring that either through OEM partnerships. We can bring that through our existing channels or we're looking for ways to accelerate that through service or total water management in the commercial office water space. So, it's an area that we've been strategically working on for the last 18 months and we really feel like we've got great technology and great products to bring to market there and just wanted to highlight it is an area that we're going to be focusing on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Deane Dray","Let's stay with the commercial office water opportunity because it does seem like a natural fit for Pentair that whole sector is seeing a disruptive change getting away from that five gallon jug business. But it does bake the question, how do you approach this from a growth ambition how much would be organic, you're looking at M&A in this opportunity? Some folks have approached it with rentals, other outright sales through dealer networks, but some additional color would be helpful as well as a timeline, if you could?","John Stauch","Yes, Deane, I appreciate it. You know clearly the market from a service or delivery perspective is highly fragmented, which has always been a challenge to kind of breakthrough and make sure that your products and capabilities are there. I won't mention by name, but several large OEM producers are looking to get in this market, primarily around delivering the flavored and\/or carbonated water needs as well as there's other partners that are thinking about how we bring heated water for tea and coffee to bear. So, I think the movement of having fresh new differentiated technology advanced products is a great opportunity for Pentair, to certainly partner and bring those products through. As far as going to the services end, or doing the last mile, Deane as you mentioned, I think that would have to be more likely an inorganic strategy, which is not what I was addressing today, but I was talking about bringing those products to market.","Deane Dray","Certainly, that makes sense. We'll be watching that space carefully. And then going back to the Aquatics and the inventory and the channel, you had sized it previously at $60 million excess. Where do you think that stands today? And then, just remind us on what the weather impact because that has you get lower utilization of pools, fewer starts and some of those starts just don't happen that they get pushed out to next year, but just share with us the ripple effects of the weather and how that's reflected in your guidance?","Mark Borin","Yes, sure. As I mentioned, when we look at Q2, we had assumed some level of inventory reduction and because of the weather impact continuing from Q1 into Q2, we didn't see that. So, the overall level of inventory did not go up. It's not that we built inventory in Q2. It's just that the planned reduction did not happen at the rate we had anticipated. And so now that, that inventory level that existed is got to be worked down further in Q3 and Q4. So, think of that, if you think about the level in which we adjusted the guidance for Aquatic Systems revenue that's reflective of the further need to reduce inventories, driven primarily by weather.","John Stauch","Deane, if I could just add that I mentioned 75,000 pools, new pools being built. If you put that in context, I think, we estimated at the beginning of the year be close to 80, which is generally what last year was. So, clearly we're seeing in your point the 80,000 going to 75,000 being the labor constraint on that pool construction build and that's likely to slide to the right. Now, we're confident based upon the demands in the area that we think we're going to see those pools get built actually next year based on the overall demand. But weather had to have an impact we think on pushing some of those pools outside of this year's building build cycle.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","So, just to continue down the Aquatics path here. John, just between the absence of destocking and you talked a little bit about the weather push outs. And I know you individually, you probably don't want to make too big of a deal out of each one of those is maybe positive drivers for next year. But if you add all these things up plus some of the commercial initiatives, is Aquatics a business that instead of being a mid-single-digit grower can go to something more like high single-digit next year, just as you start to sell the underlying demand versus destock, and maybe catch up on some of these weather anomalies, whether it's push out or just kind of an unseasonably rainy year?","John Stauch","Yes, normalize this business has grown mid-to-high single digits Josh, if you go back. I think fundamentally you know overall demand in the aftermarket on the 5 million pools needs to have more penetration of the new pool pad, which is what I'm really pushing here to say that if you put more content into the new pool. And you expand your average pool content you will build your aftermarket capability to basically replace those with like-for-like product. If that like-for-like doesn't exist then you're looking at a channel that needs to go sell your products or upgrade the consumer for you. So, I think we got to take advantage of a shift in focus here and make sure we're spending as much time building out the new content in those 75,000 pools and then benefit from that aftermarket revenue stream as we go forward.","The big shift we're having here and where I think we're going to see a huge penetration is on the connected pool side itself, Josh. But I am challenged the team I said, that's a different sale right. I mean it's a technical sale and it requires a little bit more customer and consumer support. So, we're very bullish about what this business can continue to do because we see substantial opportunity in front of it. I cannot guess what weather is going to do next year if we learn one thing from all of this, it's that we've got to have contingency plans against whether not unfolding the way we wanted to.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","That's fair. But I guess mathematically just selling the underlying demand next year, yes, gives you a few points head start anyway right?","John Stauch","We do think the labor constraint that affected us this year will be in catch-up mode and we do think we'd be entering next year with a relatively healthy backlog, correct.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Got it. And then, just one more on the more commercial filtration initiatives. What's your sense on the channel penetration or kind of that channel build out your presence with dealers. Because I know you have a great business on more the national account side, but in markets that are perhaps a little bit more fragmented or, it sounds like there is something a lot of investment on the product, but is there product in the right dealers hands and is that dealer base something that you can penetrate easily?","John Stauch","Yes, that's our opportunity, Josh, and I wanted to call it out today, because we are focused on building out the acquisitions around the residential side. But we don't want to forget the fact that we have a really good commercial offering and we're also simultaneously working on that. And what that means is getting back to what we used to be great at and what we are going to be great at, which is selling the spec and working with our global partners to convince them that we have a superior product and that they should be designing and specking that, that product into their expansions. I think a global hotel chains, think of all the hospitality efforts, think of anybody who's moving their stores overseas, those are great opportunities for us to make sure that we're designing in our Everpure product in all of those instances.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Thanks, John. I'll leave it there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Hammond","Good morning. Just wanted to go kind of touch on price cost and productivity, it looks like you're kind of got price matching inflation this quarter. How should we think about that delta in the second half. And then on productivity, I think, you're nicely positive in 1Q and went negative. I know you mentioned the one large pump business, but what's the change there?","Mark Borin","So, you kind of hit it on price cost, so we do expect, as we sort of thought throughout the year that the price that we referenced about three points of rice should offset inflation. So, that continues to be the point of view. And then just on productivity, as we talked about, there is some negatives that affected us in this quarter. John referenced the fact that last year was a pretty solid quarter for us so the comp is there and that kind of read its way through year-over-year productivity. And then we've got all the actions in place that have been worked and we are starting to see read out through inventory that will then find their way into the P&L starting in Q3 and Q4. So, we've got good visibility to the actions and the things that are going to take place in the Flow and Filtration businesses that should drive that incrementally improving productivity.","Jeff Hammond","So, price versus inflation, you still think is neutral in the second half, you don't get a net positive with some of the deflation?","John Stauch","No, I mean no, because you get the deflation and also just the timing of price. So net-net, it continues to be kind of a push. I mean, I think Mark you were also -- you're putting labor inflation in there as well.","Mark Borin","Yes, total inflation, but not just the material inflation.","Jeff Hammond","And then just last one on Aquatics. If you kind of our successful kind of getting inventory down, within line with what's kind of this new guidance? Where do you see inventories entering 2020 versus normal? Thanks.","Mark Borin","Yes, our plan and what our updated guidance is reflective of is inventory levels being brought to a more normalized level. So, -- and when we do that, we look at sort of days on hand on a forward basis and think of it that way. So, we're looking at it, what it was historically and then bring in the inventory levels down to sort of that more normalized historical level on a day's basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Lee","Just maybe on filtration again, can you elaborate a bit on the trends you're seeing there, it seems like you had a nice rebound off of 1Q, you had the one-time issues there. But you mentioned food and beverage was up, resi is down in the quarter, but maybe any more color there and also the trends you're expecting heading into the second half?","John Stauch","Sure. Yes, so just thinking about the different businesses, residential and commercial I think of them as sort of flat in the quarter. And then as I mentioned industrial was strong and food and beverage was moderating. We see those trends kind of continuing. We start continue to see residential and commercial improving as we work our way through the year. Within residential is where those two acquisitions exist so those is, as we referenced are performing in-line with expectations, but we're really seeing some exciting opportunities from a growth perspective there and starting to see the rationale for why we did those deals starting to read out and really giving us some confidence that there is some great ideas there, they're going to help us continue to grow those businesses, but then also help us think about the broader residential portfolio. So overall, we're seeing the trends going in the right direction and seeing that continue through Q3 and Q4.","Brian Lee","Okay, fair enough. And then just maybe a follow-up on since you bring it up on the new acquisitions, I noticed that a subtle tweak here. But it seem like you're taking down the full year contribution from 3% to 2% in the updated guidance, maybe if you could comment on what's driving that as well?","John Stauch","Sure. We haven't talked about it necessarily, but we did announce earlier in the quarter that we were getting out of what we refer to is the aquaculture business. So, that wasn't actually reflected in our original plan or guidance and so that's the slight tweak. So, it's not that the acquisitions aren't performing at a level of expectation, it's that we've included an additional divestiture that, you're right that's pulling down the top-line acquisition number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys, this is Jason [ph] on for Julian. How are you?","John Stauch","Good. Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","All right. Just a couple of quick ones on Filtration and Flow in general trends, I know you guys have said that the residential and commercial trends are improving throughout the quarter. I just kind of wanted to clarify that, that is sort of an underlying demand commentary and not a reversal of maybe sort of one-time issues that you saw in both of those businesses in Q1. And if so, is there any sort of bifurcation in the differences of strength between the residential and commercial underlying market?","John Stauch","Let me hit part of that first. I mean, as you recall, when we talked about putting in the price increases last year in September, relative to the tariff and the inflationary impacts, we did see some inventory pull aheads in the residential and commercial flow & filtration space as well. We felt like we work through all of those in Q1 and work those inventory issues behind us. So, we had already started in a better inventory position in Q2 and that is continuing to read out here as we head into Q3 and Q4, meaning that we don't have those same challenges that we had in Aquatics. Mark, I don't know if you want to add.","Mark Borin","No, I think that, I mean, I think you picked up on that correctly. So, it's not -- it's underlying fundamentals rather than reversal of anything specifically one-time other than the things, John, that you mentioned.","Unidentified Analyst","But I guess just as a quick follow-up, would you characterize the underlying demand as sort of improving? Or is this sort of just an inventory issue that was being worked through as a result of pricing increases across last year? I guess what I'm trying to get at is, is it sort of, are the customer conversations getting better, or is that, you know, the issues that were present in Q1 are just completely behind you and now Q2 and Q4 tell sort of the different story?","John Stauch","On filtration, residential and commercial are improving. We're excited about the awareness of the products and the offerings available in the channel and the migration towards more of those making into the consumers' hands. In irrigation flow, I'd say no. The weather patterns did not read out in Q2 and we think we're going to be relatively experiencing the shipment demand as we head into Q3 and Q4 as well. Those are submersible wells.","Unidentified Analyst","Understood. Thank you for your time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak from Seaport Global. Your line is open.","Walter Liptak","You commented about the perfect storm in the channel inventory. I wonder, first, is it -- or is it not far enough behind us where we can do a postmortem on the situation with the inventory build from tariffs and weather? And then I don't mean to -- Monday morning quarterback, but have you learned anything from it? Like what could you have done differently? Because I don't think that the tariff issues or weather are going to go away. What is about the channel that you can do to keep this from happening again?","John Stauch","Yes. We're hopeful that this goes in the category late '08-'09 financial crisis of the learning that we don't have to ever use again. When you can think about 10% material inflation over the course of a couple of years and then raising prices to mitigate that impact, we did not anticipate that the channel would buy so much ahead of that demand. You know and we realized that and we corrected course as you're -- what did we learn from that, I think we have a lot of sell-through metrics, we have a lot of information available to us that we're now looking at to make our own assumptions of what's in the channel, so that we will rely on partners it's one thing, but we also want to make sure that we're triangulating that information and ensuring that we feel like the sell-through is reflecting what we know it to be.","So, there's always a learning and I'd say that's the learning and I think we're more informed now and we have a better idea of what our actual end sales are through the channel versus into the channel.","Walter Liptak","Okay, great. And then switching gears over to your comments about segmentation, you know, we've seen other companies like IDEX do a really incredible job with segmentation. And it sounds like you're doing product segmentation, I wonder if you're doing channel or customer segmentation too? And then as a follow-on on the product question, the R&D spending, what do you do -- doing the track some of the incremental R&D? How much is R&D going up, just some looking for some data or details about the kind of return you're expecting from some of these investments?","John Stauch","Well, first of all, thank you for noticing the segmentation comment it is in fact a consumer end user segmentation. And it was pretty exhaustive and a particular piece of marketing that we're using significantly and you can sense by our confidence level that gives us extreme confidence because as we start to target these personas, or we start to understand these personas better and we've used marketing campaigns, we're actually seeing the results from it. And you know these personas and the consumer needs, attributes and behaviors that we're spending time to understand are true and they're ringing out. And now we're building product sets and customer support around those that we can continue to grow faster. So, thanks for noticing.","On the R&D, I'm a big advocate that we need to spend more and have the right differentiated and innovative product. I think these marketing insights that we're creating will give us a better connectivity to what's needed. So, I don't know, in the short run if it's spending more, it's spending more wisely and having the right products available to the right customer set.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brett [ph] from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, just want to come back to Q3, if I'd just assume normal incremental margins and progression you talked about in flow and filtration. Basically implies you need some margin expansion in Aquatics in Q3 to get to the midpoint of the guide, I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that right?","Mark Borin","Yes, that -- maybe slightly, but that -- but not the margin decline that we've seen in the first -- in the first quarter and the second quarter.","John Stauch","Think about it as what we had half a month worth of price benefit last year and we're getting a -- that's we're getting the carryover of this year of that price and what we're seeing is the price in inflation headwind year-over-year significantly positive across all three businesses.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. So, despite the lower absorption, you expect to see you think you can overcome all that?","John Stauch","Yes, yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, good. And then just geographically, maybe just walk around the different regions, we didn't really talk about China. I think, last quarter you said Europe was a little bit weaker than you had expected. How was Europe specifically in the quarter and then maybe any color on China and what you're seeing there?","John Stauch","Sure, yes. So, overall, we saw Europe kind of get back from some of the negative commentary made in Q1 to growth in Q2. So, Europe it was a positive story and we think that's going to continue through the rest of the year. China continues to grow. I mean, so as we've talked before it's not a huge market for us overall, but we see strong growth in China, that's a continuation from the trend that we saw in Q1, continuing in Q2, and we expect to see that as well continuing through the balance of the year.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, good. Thanks. I'll pass it along.","John Stauch","Thank you. All right, thank you for joining us today. We continue to believe that we will exit 2019 positioned to deliver more normalized performance in 2020. We are accelerating PIMS and sourcing and strengthening our productivity culture. We are funding the two key strategies discussed earlier in the call, and we hope you share in our excitement for these two key growth strategies. We have a strong capital structure, solid free cash flow generation and we will continue to invest in our strategy to be the leading residential and commercial water treatment company. Thank you for your continued interest. Rob, you can conclude the call.","Operator","Thank you, sir. And ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation today.

My name is Don, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Pentair Q4 2012 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","Thank you. Mr. Jim Lucas, you may begin your conference, sir.","Jim Lucas","All right. Thanks, Don. And welcome to Pentair's fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us today. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer.","On today's call, we will provide details on our fourth quarter and full year 2012 performance, as well as our first quarter and full year 2013 outlook as outlined in this morning\u2019s release.","Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and today's release.","Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results.","Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. All references today will be on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated, for which the non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation.","We will be sure to reserve time for questions-and-answers after our prepared remarks and recognition there are other call this morning we will target to be done in just about an hour. With that, I\u2019d like to request that you limit your questions to one and follow up, and get back in the queue for further questions, so that everyone has an opportunity to ask their questions.","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randy Hogan","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with our fourth quarter performance which is on slide three. This marks the first quarter for Pentair since we successfully closed our merger with Flow Control at the end of September last year. As you saw in this morning\u2019s press release, there are quite a number of moving pieces with the size of its merger.","Our objective is to give you needed insights into our company, so we will provide detail on how the merger cost impact the fourth quarter results, and John will cover some of the larger one-time events in his prepared remarks.","I will discuss our operating results on an adjusted basis to better address the core operating performance of our businesses. Before I begin to discuss the fourth quarter results in detail, I want to spend the moment explaining why the numbers are presented in the manner they are.","For the full company results, the fourth quarter of 2012 includes Flow Control\u2019s results combined with Pentair, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 which includes of course only Pentair results.","As we discuss the segment results, however, we will present the results on a pro forma adjusted basis as if the results were on apples-to-apples comparative basis. You will find reconciliations of this for the segments in the appendix at the end of the presentation.","With that here are the numbers. Fourth quarter revenue increased 103% on a reported basis, but excluding the impact of Flow Control and FX core revenue was flat in the quarter.","Adjusted operating income grew 59%, while adjusted operating margins contracted 240 basis points to 8.5%. Majority of the margin compression relates to transition costs incurred during the quarter, which we discussed in detail on our Investor Day in November. As a reminder these transition costs includes such things like branding and signage, packaging, inventory and warranty adjustments.","Adjusted EPS came in as expected with the decrease 16% year-over-year due to the impact of the deal, particularly the doubling in the share count from the comparable period one year ago. Adjusted free cash flow for the year was over $300 million and exceeded 100% of adjusted net income again.","The topline and adjusted operating income were in line with our prior guidance. We make good progress in building the action plans to deliver the $90 million in synergies we outlined in November. In addition, the first $400 million of our share repurchase will be completed by the end of January. So, overall, we\u2019re underway as expected.","Now, let\u2019s turn to slide four review of Water & Fluid Solutions segment performance. Water & Fluid Solutions sales were up 1% as reported and on organic basis since FX was only a modest headwind in the quarter.","As a reminder, Water & Fluid Solutions represents the legacy water segment for Pentair plus the West business from Flow Control. Overall, price delivered the growth in the quarter as volumes were flat.","The residential commercial vertical which represents roughly half of the segment grew 2% in the quarter as we are seeing continued signs of our North American residential recovery. While the growth in the fourth quarter in North American was modest, distributor inventory levels are relatively low and overall demand seems to be getting healthier.","Western Europe continued to be a challenge, particularly due to distributors maintaining lean inventory levels and having minimal order activity at the end of the year.","Within Food & Beverage which accounts for approximately 15% of Water & Fluid Solutions, we saw continued low single-digit growth in the food service sector, while several beverage projects were postponed at the end of year as many of our customers were watching their capital spending at the end of the year.","Infrastructure, which is nearly 25% of Water & Fluid Solutions was down 3% in the quarter as an absence of global desalination projects has hampered our European infrastructure business.","In the U.S., however, we have continued to see healthy gains in our backlog, which was up 5% in the fourth quarter following double-digit growth in the prior two quarters","As a reminder, we\u2019ve not seen much of a rebound in project activity but the break and fix category continues to improve. We believe our strong backlog position in North American infrastructure bodes well for growth in the first half of 2013.","The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Water & Fluid operating profits and margins. Water and Fluid adjusted operating margins contracted 250 basis points to 7.5%, as we accelerated transition costs in the fourth quarter to position us better as this year begins. Absent the transition costs in the quarter, price and productivity continued to offset inflation.","In summary, Water and Fluid Solutions exited 2012 with some potential tailwinds emerging in North American Residential and infrastructure, and we expect the actions taken in the fourth quarter will put the segment in a good position to build momentum on operating margin expansion in 2013.","Now, I\u2019ll turn to slide five for review of our Valves & Controls segment performance. This is the first quarter for Pentair\u2019s Valves & Controls segment. Overall, we are pleased with the results delivered, following the strong last quarter\u2019s part of Tyco and their first quarter\u2019s part of Pentair.","Revenue grew 3% organically on solid volume gains. The energy vertical grew 2% mostly on strength in oil and gas. Within the industrial vertical, the top line was up modestly as several projects were delayed, which was a recurring theme we saw in many of our project related businesses in the fourth quarter.","We\u2019ve not seen any cancellations, but as I mentioned when discussing water, customers seem to be holding on tightly with our capital in the fourth quarter. And we would expect many of these projects to resume in the first half of 2013.","The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Valves & Controls operating profits and margins. Valves & Controls operating margins were down 40 basis points to 7.6%, owing to mix and the acceleration on transition costs that were mentioned at the beginning of my remarks this morning.","In summary, Valves & Controls first quarter as part of Pentair went well as the fundamentals for their business remain intact and the integration and standardization efforts made good progress, particularly with regards to training on PIMS.","Now, let\u2019s move to slide six for look at the orders and backlog for Valves & Controls. Not only is this our first quarter with Valves & Controls as a segment, but this also marks our first time discussing orders and backlogs for the segment.","As you can see on slide six, the Valves & Controls backlog is broken down in four key markets, three of which formed were energy vertical, oil and gas, power and mining and one our industrial vertical which is the process business.","Backlog grew 2% to a near record $1.4 billion. With oil and gas, backlog remained strong globally but orders declined to the mid-teens rate due to project delays and a tough year-over-year comparison.","Mining, one of small piece of Valves & Controls saw strong double-digit growth in orders. The power business saw decline in orders, but the outlook there points to a pickup globally as 2013 progresses. Finally, backlog within process remain relatively steady, our orders grew modestly.","Now, let\u2019s move to slide seven for a review of Technical Solutions. Technical Solutions comprises Pentair\u2019s legacy equipment protection business and Flow Controls Thermal Management business.","Sales for the segment grew 1%, led by strength in energy and seasonal strengths with Thermal Management business, as distributor stocking occurs prior to the weather getting really cold.","Industrial declined 1%, as inventory destocking continued for many of equipment protections customers. In addition, this quarter mark the end of a large project within Thermal Management.","The right half of the page shows fourth quarter Technical Solutions\u2019 operating profits and margins. Technical Solutions operating margins were flat at 17.4%, owing to positive contributions from price, productivity and mix which helped mitigate transition costs in the quarter. While we expect the top line to remain challenge in industrial, it remains good runway in margins and we expect overall improvement in Technical Solution as the year progresses.","Now, let\u2019s turn to slide eight. For the full-year 2012, sales grew 28% on a reported basis largely due to the contribution from Flow Controls for all of the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating margins contracted 60 basis points for the full-year to 11.1%, as the aforementioned transition costs in the fourth quarter were spent to help better position our businesses to deliver on our targets in 2013.","Adjusted EPS were relatively flat for the full year given the dilutive impact of the share count doubling, following our transformational acquisition of Flow Control. For the full-year, adjusted free cash flow as I mentioned earlier was just over $300 million and exceeded 100% of net income.","We believe the strong backlog in Valves & Controls and Water and Fluid Solutions infrastructure business are encouraging entering 2013. Further, we believe continued strength in global energy and a rebound in North American Residential also offer positive indications for growth to accelerate as 2013 progresses.","Now, let\u2019s turn to slide nine. This slide is a comparison of the top line growth components in 2012 on a pro forma basis, as both Pentair and Flow Control have been together for the entire year and what we expect the growth components to be in 2013.","As you can see, we are expecting a little less contribution from volume in 2013, but FX should be less of a headwind and we are anticipating some top line synergies to begin to be realized in this New Year. Overall, the growth components remained similar from 2012 to 2013.","On slide 10, we wanted to offer a similar look at operating income growth as we presented on the prior slide, when looking at the top line growth components. The key takeaway in this slide is that we expect our base businesses would be up for the full year, but the real boost will come as we deliver on our targeted $90 million of synergies. The result is well over a 100 basis points of anticipated margin expansion as synergies read out.","Now, let\u2019s move to slide 11 where we discuss our 2013 expectations. In November at our Investor Day, we laid out our initial expectations for 2013, which we are affirming today. For the full-year 2013, we are expecting sales to be up 3% to 5% to approximately $7.6 billion.","As mentioned previously, energy and North American Residential are two of the verticals where we see continued positive trends. Fast growth regions are still growing, and we are excited about several areas such as the Middle East where our presence has grown as a result of bringing these two organizations together.","Well, we expect Western Europe will remain a challenge, we should see some easing on the foreign exchange headwinds from 2012. We continued to target $950 million in adjusted operating income and roughly 20% growth in adjusted operating margins approaching 12.5%, driven in large part by the fourth quarter repositioning actions and the synergies we\u2019ve discussed both at the Investor Day and in today's call.","As highlighted in the prior slide, we expect our base businesses position to deliver near double-digit operating income growth and synergies will drive additional upside. Our adjusted EPS guidance remains in a range of $3.10 to $3.30, or 22% to 30% growth for the full year. In addition to strong operating income growth, we are forecasting a 25% tax rate and continued benefit from our share repurchase activities.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John Stauch","Thank you, Randy. Please turn to slide number 12, labeled reported to adjusted 2012 items. As result of the merger and integration activities, Q4 and full-year 2012 results include a little bit of noise. Therefore, we want to provide some additional clarity around those items so you can better understand our adjusted operating performance.","As a reminder, as Randy mentioned earlier, the key financial numbers by quarter and by reporting segments are included in the press release for 2011 and 2012, excluding the impact of these items.","Our adjusted EPS for 2012, which reflects three quarters of Legacy Pentair alone plus one quarter including Legacy Pentair and the Flow Control acquisition were $2.39 for the year.","Acquisition related costs, which include deal costs, customer backlog and inventory step-up, plus a few other items for a loss of a $1.41 per share. This was in line with our previous estimates.","I would like to remind you that we expect the inventory step-up and customer backlog to continue to the first two quarters of 2013.","Restructuring totaled $0.35 of EPS with the majority coming in Q4. To date, we have identified approximately 85% of our expected $75 million of repositioning actions for 2013. And we expect to take a few more actions in Q1 that we\u2019re closing the gap under 2013 expected benefit. These actions will primarily be around functional standardization and back-office consolidations.","The next item to discuss relates to trade name impairments associated with our brand migration strategy and greatly reducing many of the complications that occur by trying to maintain numerous brands. Many with limited perceived value yet require a lot of cost for growth and maintaining.","This is a non-cash charge and we are happy to be carrying these smaller brands in our portfolio as we accelerate -- happy not to be carrying these smaller brands in our portfolio as we accelerate our marketing and branding efforts around fewer and more impactful brands. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we elected to change to a more preferable method of accounting for pension and post-retirement benefits.","Historically, we recognized actuarial gains and losses annually as a component of stockholders equity, amortizing them into operating results over future periods. We will now immediately recognize these gains and losses and operating results in the year in which they occur. These gains and losses will be measured annually as of December 31st and will be recorded in the fourth quarter of each year.","For the fourth quarter of 2012, the company recorded charge of $142 million for actuarial losses. This change in accounting principal will be applied retrospectively. The impact of prior periods is summarized to the schedule attached to press release. This was done in conjunction with a pre-funding of $193 million to our U.S. pension plans and moving to a risk mitigating investment strategy within the plan.","We are now fully funded in U.S. domestic plans which has currently invested 92% in fixed returns. We believe that based on current borrowing rates the transformational deal we did and the importance of removing the uncertainty to our employees and retirees, this was the appropriate time to implement this change. With this now behind us and allows us to focus on what we do best, running the company.","And finally, the last major adjustment was the extinguishment of the private placement and public bonds that allows us to create more advantageous capital and tax structure while completing the merger. While all these adjustments drive us through important GAAP loss for 2012, they were combined with completing an exceptional merger with flow control, and we believe all position us nicely for the future.","Please turn to slide number 13, labeled integration and standardization update. Let me start by reiterating that we're definitely on track to realize the expected $90 million in synergies for 2013. Please focus on the left side of the chart. We\u2019re trying to give you perspective of how we will realize these synergies throughout the year.","A couple of key points in this slide, first, the anticipated savings ramped throughout the year for a couple of reasons. One, because of the way the operational synergies need to flow through inventory, they're not expected to be realized until the second half of this year. And two, even though the majority of notifications to employees on the repositioning have taken place, most of those employees will not be leaving the organization until the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter.","Additionally, we are celebrating some investments in the first quarter of 2013 around tax planning, small manufacturing plants and building closures and ERP consolidations. These actions have a little bit of headwind, net of savings within the first quarter. However, you can see that we expect our exhibit in Q4 to give us a nice acceleration into the first couple quarters of 2014.","Please turn to slide number 14, labeled balance sheet and cash flow. Being mindful of time and wanting to leave enough for your questions, I would just hit a few of the highlights on this cash flow page. First, obviously a large adjustment of $339 million, this is detailed in the lower left section of the slide and consistent with the adjustment to EPS that I shared with you earlier.","Second, our current debt level of $2.5 billion was exactly where we thought it would be and is inclusive of approximately $330 million of stock buybacks executed in the fourth quarter. As of today, we are approximately $260 million of cash on hand, mostly located in foreign entities. It will be focused on efforts to utilize this cash more effectively in 2013 and \u201814.","Please turn to slide number 15, labeled Q1 2013 Pentair outlook. Now, on to the first quarter of 2013, where the focus will turn to execution of our committed goals. You will probably need a little time to absorb the pro forma numbers that we have included to better understand the new seasonality of the company.","We've excluded from the pro forma numbers three main items. First, we\u2019ve removed all sanctioned country, revenue and profits from the base of 2011 and 2012 for Valves & Controls to provide a better year-over-year comparison. This excluded revenue was associated with sales produced by an acquisition completed by Valves & Controls in 2011. These jobs were delivered upon until shipments for these customers were declined prior to the closure of the deal. This result in substantial charges to income in Q3 of 2012 and we have moved all impacts of that from the results.","Second, we have restated all the segments for corporate allocations and new depreciation and amortization, consistent with 2013 and forward expectations and assumed corporate cost in 2011 and 2012 to be equal to the Pentair go-forward cost in 2013. We've also moved any large projects or jobs and divestitures that have no shipments in 2013 and beyond and technical solutions for clear comparisons of organic revenue growth in the future.","And third, we have adjusted the tax rate in 2011 and 2012 at the expected 25% rate for 2013 and put the share count in 2011 and 2012 at 214.5 million shares, which was the share count on the date of closure. We hope you find the way we\u2019ve restated the numbers to be helpful in focusing on our operating performance and removing the noise.","So after all that, we expect Q1 sales will approximately be $1.8 billion for the total company, which would be up around 1% year-over-year in an organic basis. We expect Valves & Controls sales will be up slightly compared to the first quarter last year where they were up over 20% year-over-year.","Water and fluid solutions should get some tailwind help from North American residential and other recovering markets. And technical solutions is still navigating choppy markets after difficult end to 2012. We remain cautious about our markets in the start of the year and feel that operationally there's a lot for us still to learn about the new businesses.","We believe this approach helps us focus on what we can control cost and hopefully markets deliver sales upside in 2013. We expect adjusted operating income will be up slightly versus 2012 pro forma, reflecting that we have about $10 million of headwinds associated with the items I mentioned earlier regarding cost to get the synergies and only around $5 million of expected synergies to be realized in Q1.","Overall, adjusted operating margin should be above flat and adjusted EPS should be flat to up slightly on a pro forma basis. We\u2019re expecting interest to be between $18 million and $19 million and we are expecting the average share count in the quarter to reflect 207 million shares. The tax rate as I mentioned should be around 25% for the full year and quarter.","Please turn to slide number 16 labeled full year 2013 Pentair outlook. For the year, our expectations are consistent with what we told you at our November Analyst Day. Our revenue outlook growth assumptions remain up 3% to 4%. However, we might notice that the overall revenue is slightly lower reflecting removal of the large job and divestitures shipped or sold in 2012 and \u201811.","The $790 million of pro forma in 2012 adjusted operating income is consistent with the starting point we share with you at the analyst meeting. It means we need to deliver about $160 million of operating income year-over-year to hit our $950 million commitment. As Randy mentioned, this is about $70 million from the base consistent with 2012 pro forma performance and $90 million of synergies, of which $75 million is expected from repositioning actions that are already complete or will be completed by Q1 of 2013.","We are affirming our full year 2013 just the EPS range of $3.10 to $3.30 and we are focused on delivering detail growth action plans to demonstrate a higher level of organic growth and detail productivity plans to not only meet 2013 expectations, but we will continue to invest and deliver on our $5 goal for 2015.","Please turn to my last slide, slide number 17 labeled Q4 2012 Summary. We closed out Q4 as expected, markets were sluggish but we plan for that. We executed against our commitments and believe we are well-positioned to deliver going forward. Hence will be the way we ensure consistency around organic growth, productivity, standardization and common values and language in the larger company, it will give us a stability around actions and culture required to know that we are delivering consistent high-performing and repetitive results.","Standardization of the back office is requirement to reduce complexity and simplify and improve the customer and employees experience. We're well on our way to roadmaps and we are encouraged by the early progress in the first quarter as a combined company.","I will now turn it back to Randy. Randy?","Randy Hogan","Thanks, John. Please turn to slide 18 labeled also summary. To close, let me tell you why we are better position entering 2013 just to wrap everything up. While the fourth quarter had a lot of moving pieces resulting from the acquisition. We are also busy accelerating actions in the quarter to deliver cost benefits and grow synergies in 2013, and we\u2019re really on track.","PIMS adoption by Flow Control has exceeded our expectations today and we see a lot of opportunities improve in areas such as delivery and cost, but also driving working capital improvements.","We continue to see some win shifts and some tailwinds emerge particularly in North American residential market where the peers were no longer bouncing along the bottom after six of that and now rebounding at a moderate pace. Infrastructures grown its backlog and we continue to see strength in energy and food and beverage.","Our balance sheet remains strong and our focus in the near-term will be on share repurchase and dividends, some businesses we have such as aquatics and thermal management, which are already well down the standardization path. We are in the right to grow through bolt-on acquisitions.","As other business units progressed on the standardization path, they too will have bolt-on acquisitions re-enter their mix. But the principal focus in 2013 for the whole company is delivering on our and executing our plan for integration, standardization and growth, and as always, we\u2019re going to remain discipline in our capital allocation strategies.","So operator, we are ready for questions. So -- take the first.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies.","Randy Hogan","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","Hey. Good morning.","Randy Hogan","Yeah.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","Just a one question and one follow-up, you guys made a comment about the power market, kind of being sluggish right now, but expecting an improvement as the year progresses? Could you give us little bit of more color on why you think that? And then I have one quick follow-up?","Randy Hogan","Yeah. In power -- and power is an important market particularly for Valves & Controls. And there was a real slowdown in building a power plant and they are big in Asia and they are big all over the world. And we are seeing an increase in activity, bidding activity in that space which gives us some encouragement.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","Okay. Great. And you indicated that the some of the branding and other transition costs that you were accelerate in the fourth quarter? Did that come in as expected as you indicated on your from your Analyst meeting and your last quarter guidance?","Randy Hogan","Yeah, Scott, it did.","Scott Graham - Jefferies","Very good. Thanks.","Randy Hogan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital.","Randy Hogan","Hey, Jeff.","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital","Hi. Can you hear me?","John Stauch","Yeah. We can.","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital","So, I just want to understand this pension change a little bit better. What\u2019s kind of the annual cost savings and what\u2019s kind of reflected in your \u201813 guidance around that change?","John Stauch","Yeah. Jeff, let me just step back. I mean, as you know when you do a large merger like we did, these losses are put to purchase accounting on the target company and we were doing accounting acquire. So we were going to take all the market-to-market and put it in purchase accounting for Tyco.","It seemed like a logical thing to do and we entered Analyst Meeting, we were going to do this and in conjunction with putting those losses behind us, we have fully funded the plan and moved to a fixed strategy.","So, as we look at \u201813 guidance on a go-forward basis, it always reflected the benefit of this. Now, I can't predict what it would be or wouldn\u2019t be, Jeff, because I don't know how the market gains were worked out and what that positive or negative was. So, Legacy Pentair on an annual basis, we were looking somewhere maybe around $7 million, $8 million operating income a year of headwinds associated with these.","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital","Okay. So the guidance is unchanged because you were contemplating that. But what\u2019s kind of the year-to-year delta of the change?","John Stauch","It\u2019s just hard to say. I mean, I would have said the $7 million to $8 million is reflective. But maybe what we might have avoided in the short run. But as the benefits pick up, we also avoid the benefits in the long run. So really don't know how to predict that.","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital","Okay.","John Stauch","So the change was becoming affective, we are fully bonded, removed to fix whichever relatively small adjustment every year that we take into mark-to-market because we no longer are subject to the uncertainty related to the investments within the plan.","Randy Hogan","But that was intact with anyone, yeah.","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital","Okay. That's helpful. And then just quickly on the growth rates, you are looking for 1% growth in the first quarter and 4% in the full year. And I understand the cadence on the cost savings. But I mean on the top line, what are you seeing that give you confidence in kind of this reacceleration as we move through the year versus the weaker 1Q?","Randy Hogan","Yeah. Well, fourth quarter was -- we saw 4,000 projects, we saw some strength in our residential but not all of it. So we are more cautious. That\u2019s the one reason where we see 1% in the first quarter, as we don\u2019t think it\u2019s just a throwing a switch from the fourth quarter and first quarter as the projects blew up. But we haven\u2019t seen cancelations. And there is really good fundamental growth in the economy and particular in residential.","And so as I said, we think energy, particularly oil and gas looks good. We think North America Residential looks good. In the food and beverage space, we saw a lot of projects that just got delayed and whether it\u2019s fiscal cliff or whatever reason, companies -- they didn\u2019t cancel these projects, they just delayed them. So as the world gets little more certain, we think that they may be coming back and we\u2019ll welcome when they do.","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital","Okay. Thanks, guys.","John Stauch","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Thanks. Good morning.","John Stauch","Hey, Chris. Good morning.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Just one more on the pension being fully funded, that sounds great. I think you said 90% kind of fixed income in the composition. I\u2019m wondering if that's -- the returns on that are enough to maintain fully funded status.","John Stauch","It\u2019s certainly a great question. Once we get to 100%, we hope it will be and really what we are dealing with is that your discount rate movement should reflect the bond purchases, Chris. And then I mean, we\u2019ve done our best to try to hedge it but you can never be 100%.","Randy Hogan","And to match it\u2019s certainly not possible. With interest rates where they are today, it was just a great time to borrow the money and to fund it. And our employees, we had a lot of questions becoming a Swiss company and technically Tyco buying Pentair, lot of our employees were retirees asking questions about what about my pension. So it\u2019s a nice improvement in the employee relations too.","John Stauch","And, Chris, as you know it doesn\u2019t affect you on a rating agency basis. And I think what we didn\u2019t want to do is have to manage this as a potential cut or benefit into the earnings stream going forward. And I think now it allows us to focus on the operational performance of the business and deliver on the $5 per share that would drive into in 2015, and the way that I think you would expect us to.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Okay. And the transitional costs, call that a couple hundred basis points gets $35 million or so. So pertaining to that, just wondering if we could allocate those dollars roughly by segment, and is the transitional costs all accounted for now in the fourth quarter.","John Stauch","Yeah. We try to get as many of them into Q4 as possible. I mean, I don't know if we can ever be certain that we included it all, but I can tell you we will mentioned it to you in Q1, meaning the businesses what they couldn\u2019t get into Q4 have absorbed them and their plans for next year.","They are broken out in the back, Chris, but I will say that I don't think in those numbers, we fully captured all the thermal and Valves & Controls because I don't think they were aware of the process in which kind of we look at, what\u2019s in their results versus what\u2019s in corporate. But they are focused on branding, primarily.","They were focused on things related to our confidence level on customer collections, and also our ability to think of potential warranty issues and to address those and that makes up a majority of it. And as I mentioned before, you can see the difference in the back.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Okay. Great. And you said you won't be calling them out going forward, John.","John Stauch","It would not be my inspection. It would not be Randy and ours intention to share with you transition costs in Q1.","Randy Hogan","We want to get -- we want to get back to -- I mean our whole objective here was to get as quickly to a normal base of well operating companies. So we\u2019ll just get back to being an operating company and as quickly as possible.","John Stauch","So, Chris, just to remind you, this was signed exchange on Tyco. This was accelerating the migration away from the Tyco packaging the brands. This was addressing within the Legacy Pentair water business. The small brands that weren\u2019t funding anymore, and that\u2019s what we got after. And we gave our businesses a six-month head start to try to get all that behind them and it\u2019s our intention and view, that that's done.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Okay. And then lastly, I think you're intending about $20 million more restructuring in the first quarter. Restructuring is very small in the fourth for Valves & Controls, so is that that where kind of the first quarter charge is likely to locate?","John Stauch","Without calling a particular segment out, I think there is more potential cost structure which really was a result of where the cost were between corporate and the segments. And we believe on the functional standardization journey, there\u2019s opportunities there. ","The other areas that we are finishing and completing our fast growth market alignment and deciding what sales office and what region will best be serving the overall Pentair, and we see an opportunity around real estate consolidations and the likes in those regions that we also expect to get completed during Q1.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Thanks and good morning.","Randy Hogan","Hey, Steve.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Hey. Just first question. So, I guess you hate your hundred day plan on January 9th, right. That was the intention and I\u2019m reading the words and your dialogue about the benefits, the lean and sourcing benefits delayed to second half. Just give me a sense for what was delayed in tech as expected and what was not expected?","Randy Hogan","Let me address the narrow part of that question and get back to the broader one. Basically, at anytime you have, we have very low turns in our new businesses. And anytime you have any kind of labor saving, anything that goes through cost of goods sold has to go through inventory. So actions taken don\u2019t show up.","If you have four turns, you kind of wait at least the quarter. If you got two turns you get to wait six months before if something -- before a cost benefit flows through to the P&L. That\u2019s number one.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","That shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, right. Randy?","Randy Hogan","No.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","That part was not a surprise.","Randy Hogan","That\u2019s why we are on track to hit our 90.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Yeah. Okay.","Randy Hogan","Basically, as I look at it halfway through the year, we actually we did better on financing, we did better on -- we are in better shape on tax, we are in great shape on corporate costs. We got a lot of momentum on that 90, I think 75 and the 90s really in hand already and the other 15 we know, we know how to get. So, I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to think that we think we delayed on anything because I don\u2019t believe we are.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","And then the broader question, I guess is that addressing sort of as you step back and look at your hundred day plan?","John Stauch","Steve, I mean just to reiterate what Randy said, I mean I always had the sourcing and the lean savings back end loaded in the plan. And then the other thing that\u2019s earlier in the year is we do have a couple of small plant closures that we are working on, which as you know provides a small headwind. And the tax rate is very important to us, especially for \u201915.","So we are going to spend the investment required in the first half for this year to position ourselves for making sure that we realize that lower Swiss tax rate long-term. Other than that from a timing perspective, everything as Randy said is on track and we control the destiny on the cost out on the repositioning and we feel good about it.","Randy Hogan","Everything in our control is on track or ahead. The only thing that isn\u2019t good as I would like would be the end markets.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Right. And to that point, your price productivity and mix ended up 40 basis points less in volume and inflation on the out margin impact, right. And I was trying to reconcile that with the growth number of $3 million up, so it\u2019s all FX I take it on the volume side or just maybe help a little bit. As you think about volume and inflation being offset by price productivity and mix, maybe go into the components a little bit, that might have been a little more than you thought.","John Stauch","Yeah. I mean I think some of that productivity is being distorted by a little of the transition costs, Steve. I think going forward, we do think inflation continues to be sub to in the first part of the year, first half of the year and then just gets slightly above 2% in the back half of the year.","We are planning on about a point of growth, a point of price I\u2019m sorry for the full year. I think we hope to do better than that. I mean, if we get more MRO activity in the Valves & Controls business and more standard product in thermal, I think we will do better than that. It is the projects that tend to compress the pricing.","So, I think we are in line with what we are saying and I think what we were saying, and what Randy is sharing with you is that there is a piece that we can control. And we\u2019re pedal to the metal on that, doing everything we can and then some to make sure that we send the right message internally around cost control, making sure we get the repositioning done and making sure the market alignment is lined up.","We are hopeful the markets are better. And there is reason in the business units for them to believe that they are. We would just like to make sure it's guaranteed versus something we are planning for and that does come.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Maybe just sneak one last thing. On the business unit portfolio side, as you look at the new portfolio when you are considering not just where you'll add bolt-ons overtime as the business units earn it as you\u2019d point out. On the flip side, with that maybe calling out the specific units, are you actively pursuing processes or early-stage processes in terms of pruning the portfolio where it makes sense?","Randy Hogan","Yeah. I think we mentioned at the Investor Day that we actually -- we talked to all the businesses. The level of materiality for our business is $50 million bucks now. If it can't be $50 million or more than I really don\u2019t want to waste any strategic or capital interest on them.","So that\u2019s part of our strategic review this year. There is a couple that we have underway now, smaller business $20 million, $30 million that are in process of being sold now. And I expect that once we get our full round of strategy reviews through with the seven business units that we may identify some more.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Great. I will pass it on. Thanks.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research","May be just first. I know you guys\u2026","John Stauch","Brian, how are you?","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research","I\u2019m good. How are you doing, guys? Just question on, now, that you guys have a quarter under your belt, you guys are able to kind of dive into the businesses and go to market more as a cohesive brand and whatever you attempt, you may do that. Maybe you could talk about the early indications of abilities to cross sell where you\u2019re seeing the opportunities, anything that submerged to date or things that might be more of a challenge than you previously expected.","Randy Hogan","Well, we've identified and we talked before about food and beverage product line where we sold a combination of the Pentair legacy products in food and beverage along with some keystone valves and there was a real win-win. I mean, we ended up getting twice as much volume on that project. Maybe they would've done one separately but for sure there were one together.","And so in that -- in those process industries like food and beverage, there is some real good -- and I would call them right now they are project work. We don't yet have -- and this is the next step to put in a process, so that that happens regularly. So that gets into who gets the sales credit, how is the gig covered, all of that. That\u2019s work that they actually talk least and the growth team will be working along with each of the GBUs.","We think energy is another place where we see some good cross-selling. We\u2019ve got some leads in process technologies, basically separation technologies as a result of the Valves & Controls people. Again some early wins and how do we institutionalize those in terms of profits.","So that\u2019s -- I think we validated that there is a lot of cross-selling opportunities, some exciting cross-selling opportunities in the Middle East as well around what I would call middle-easternized products from the Far East that would be a capability we have there, we can be launching. And so again it\u2019s taking those ideas and institutionalizing them to drive the growth, that\u2019s our focus.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research","Got you. And John, if I could just ask real quickly, just on FX. So you guys actually reduced the expected headwind for \u201813 but you still see it as a one-point challenge to revenues. I mean, with the \u20ac135, why do you expect to see an FX headwind at all. I would've thought it would be a tailwind at this point?","John Stauch","Yeah. Just to clarify, it rounds to 1, it\u2019s actually 50 basis points and all we do is take the euro as one of the currencies at the end of the period and forecast it forward. And you're right, I mean the euro won't be that much of a tailwind. There were times when we\u2019re slightly higher than that but there is other currencies in the portfolio being $2 billion exposed to fast growth markets. There is other currency fluctuations that make up of the remainder of that 50 basis points that we\u2019re referring to.","Randy Hogan","600 plus Australian dollars.","John Stauch","It was lot more modest than last year and right now a huge headwind as we had in the year at this particular position?","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research","And if I could ask, just sneak one more quick one and I know you guys talked about pension and talked about the funding and the employee relations but I mean, what interest rates are actually starting to creep up here. I mean, you just split a $192 million funding that back up. I mean why wouldn\u2019t you just want to grow out of that?","John Stauch","Well, I think that that is a strategy. We certainly considered it. I mean there are other points in the scenario especially over the last three years that you could have looked back and said that same thing and it didn\u2019t exactly go in your favor. But I want to remind everybody the really reason we did it is, half the company which was Tyco, we were going to have to adopt this anyway by putting it into purchase accounting.","And then we get into a situation of trying to create a path where everybody's on the same plans. Everybody is in the same position, there is no favoritism within how we look at those plans and its just make sense to adopt moving forward.","The other thing is in putting branding behind us, putting the restructuring behind us, now pension is behind us and it's not something that this company needs to concern itself with anymore on these North American domestic plans and certainly not something our shareowner has to think from year to year is that going to be a tailwind or benefit. I don\u2019t think any of us can predict where that\u2019s going to go.","If the interest rates going to go up like you're right and our returns are going to go up, I mean those are natural hedges to other things that occur, right. So this is all part of a constant look at what\u2019s the appropriate capital allocation strategy for the company. And if you think about it, we had a whole back $200 million of any form of investment to cover this from the way the rating agencies looked at it any way.","So that was what I think on that money. So when you\u2019re not earning anything on cash, it seems a lot easier to fund it, put that headwind behind you and move on with what we feel we do best, which is the operation results of the company.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research","Got you. Thank you very much guys.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with MKM Partners.","John Stauch","Hey, Josh.","Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Hi. Good morning, guys. Just a couple of clarification questions here. First in the analyst day presentation, you guys talked about share count at 203 million squiggle for the year and now worth 205 million. Is that -- am I missing any kind of offsetting guidance or is that just kind of a bias now that maybe a couple of pennies lower in the range?","John Stauch","I think our range is still intact with that. I mean, obviously those are the types of puts and take that are going to occur. We can't predict what the buybacks are going to be. We\u2019re still on pace to buyback the 400 million in addition to what we bought before. And there is going to be fluctuations on what the purchase impact is and where the share price puts the dilution. But all the assumptions are the same other than the math that creates what the end point is, Josh.","Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then just -- can you walk me through the progression and technical solutions, obviously, exiting the year at a pretty healthy margin rate given where you\u2019re planning on starting. How should we think about the cadence of that and then as we look out into, I\u2019ll say, 2014 but pick any normalized year. Is that -- should that be more linear going forward?","John Stauch","Yeah, I think, I mean, first of all Pentair had a seasonality that I think our shareowners and certainly us get used to. And being 40% exposed in North American residential in legacy Pentair, we saw a pretty big kick up in Q2. And we still have that same amount of money into less percentage of the company, so Q2 will be a season that continues.","What we\u2019ve learned about the new business is sort of as follows. I mean, Valves & Controls are the capital dependent business and their strong quarters are in the second half of the operating year as those capital expenses of their customers and as Randy mentioned get agreed upon and then get less.","Randy Hogan","One thing, I\u2019ll add though in this capital, it comes in tens of thousands of transaction.","John Stauch","Sure. And so it\u2019s a lots of these projects. So they\u2019ll tend to be more backend loaded, Josh. And that plays on the seasonality. Thermal, which is a business that we love, has a very strong Q3 and Q4 in our system and that\u2019s primarily because they are weather dependent and they stock up the distribution channel and there is a seasonality in that business.","And finally valves which is the other business we acquired in Australian market. And as we know the seasons in Australia are different than what they are here in the United States. So I don\u2019t think we picked up anything that helps our Q1 seasonality. We certainly picked up businesses that helped Q2 and Q3 and Q4. And I think that needs to be understood and as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve got a timing of the repositioning savings in the way we have to recognize the sourcing benefits that we know as Randy mentioned. We\u2019ll have to flow through inventory and those tend to be backend loaded here.","Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Got you. Understood. And then just one last one, on inflation, I know, it came up on the analyst day but it\u2019s looking like a pretty big year-to-year drag in '13. I\u2019m sorry, if you already addressed this. How much of that is kind of material cost versus employee inflation that you can see coming?","John Stauch","Yeah, I mean, we are annualizing somewhere around three-ish percentage on employee costs and that varies by country and region obviously and areas like China and India are seeing enormous inflation. But overall that\u2019s what the employee base is. I think we have planned material inflation somewhere in the 1.5% to 2% range that is slightly higher than we\u2019d been experiencing and realizing and candidly who knows, right. I mean, I think this is the way we plan for it and then we go out in every negotiation we deal with individually. There is an expectation that there will be modest inflation in the back half of the year higher than what we experienced in the first half.","Randy Hogan","As the economy","John Stauch","As the economy does better.","Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Sure. But I would imagine the offset to that though is that price is probably a little bit better as well?","John Stauch","It\u2019s probably.","Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","It seems like the -- at least the cycle so far, however you want to define a cycle, I guess, that the upside surprise is that price has done a lot better job offsetting inflation than maybe it did in the past.","Randy Hogan","That\u2019s true. That\u2019s correct.","John Stauch","Josh, the other thing I would say is I think Randy and I and hopefully you guys who give us credibility for this. They are very faster learners but there is lot to learn about the new businesses. And we need to understand them, we need to understand their patterns. We need understand the commitment levels, the project execution, the timing in delays and that\u2019s in our particular outlook as well.","Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Understood. Appreciate. Thanks guys.","John Stauch","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi Research.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Thank you. Good morning. ","John Stauch","Good morning, Deane.","Randy Hogan","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray - Citi Research ","There's been a lot of questions about the pension move. I just maybe I missed this, but is this the same international pension standard that Honeywell moved to four years ago?","John Stauch","It is.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Okay. Great. Because from our perspective, the timing on this seems right for you guys. In fact, you are fully funded, that is a big plus. And this whole move to going to fixed in the assets is the move that everyone else is trying to get done. So kudos to you to having done this now and the timing looks right.","And just a couple of operating questions for me. This is the typical time that we would be asking about pool, but I'll say it in Aquatech\u2019s. What is the early buy? Was there any activity there? And you made a comment about inventories being low, but just if you could flesh out those comments, please.","Randy Hogan","I think the inventory comment -- pool, Aquatech\u2019s is doing quite well, had a quiet good early by, which I think portends well for the season. The comment about inventory is really looking at the pump in the filtration channels. Those are the ones that we\u2019ve been looking for some rebound in residential. Haven\u2019t quiet seen it in pump yet but see it now in filtration and treatment. So there was, what those inventory comments were about -- and I don\u2019t know John how we fill about the channel and pool.","John Stauch","I mean I think we fill good, Deane. I mean, as Randy mentioned, I mean it grew double-digit again in 2012, Aquatech\u2019s did. They had a -- in fact, they regularly buy and I think the overall pool channel feels fairly optimistic about mid-to-high single digit growth again next year.","It is affluent buyer and these are warm weather states where it\u2019s almost a must to buy them. So I think that part of the industry we feel really good about. As we\u2019re tracking housing starts and as Randy mentioned on filtration pump, we\u2019re mindful of urban build versus more rural and suburban and the impact that has on well and water softening components. At the same time, we still have a significant opportunity of point to use filtration that comes with all purchase.","Randy Hogan","The exciting thing for Aquatech\u2019s is, it looks like certainly Florida and Arizona, two of the biggest pool markets in the country and two of the markets that were slammed the most in the housing downturn are beginning recovery which means that will be on top of the innovation -- the innovation thrust that has been driving the growth in that business. So we feel good about that and about where they are in aquaculture as well.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Hey. That\u2019s all good to hear. And then maybe I missed this in earlier comments, but what was the impact from the Sandy storm, specifically on both the sub pumps and the retail side, some of the bigger dewatering pumps? And can you quantify what the impact was?","John Stauch","Yeah. I\u2019ll be specific to the pumps because it\u2019s the only place we can really measure and track it. But we thought we saw $10 million to $12 million optic on the pumps that we sell into the North East on revenue. As you know Deane, those are under highest margin pumps but it was nice to see some lift and so that\u2019s kind of how we framed it.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Thank you. Just hade one question, on the Valves & Controls business, do you guys have a sense of how much better the margin profile is of what you\u2019re currently booking in that business versus maybe a year ago and maybe if you could also address how much of that business you think is after market. Any color you can give would be helpful? Thanks","John Stauch","Yeah. I mean, I think this well known at the bookings and the large orders in oil and gas across the industry don't bring the margin that rest of the segmentation as Randy mentioned bring. So as those become less of a component in the overall backlog, the overall margin should get better.","But there is still future margin pressure from the large oil and gas jobs that that have been booked in the past and were mindful of that in measuring to that. The MRO activity is picking up and it represents when we think about after-market service and book and ship business that represents right around 50% of the overall shipments within a year.","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair.","Brian Drab - William Blair","Good morning.","John Stauch","Hey Brian.","Randy Hogan","Good morning.","Brian Drab - William Blair","Just a question on the revision of the 2012 revenue, so looks like originally we\u2019re expecting 7.5, any revise that this 7.3 roughly and the fourth quarter was in line. So you said, you excluded some big projects, may be I missed but can you give a little more detail around which segments those projects we\u2019re in?","John Stauch","Yeah. And again this is a pro forma but I don\u2019t want you have to dig through it. But there is a large project in technical solutions north of $100 million that shipped in \u201811 and \u201812, which we removed. There is no shipments planned for that project at all in \u201813 or any large projects in \u201813 for that matter.","We also removed divestitures and technical solutions that will make up the delta that you're seeing. And then in the Valves & Controls side, it was primarily just related to as I mentioned earlier the sanctioned country revenue","Randy Hogan","And disposition.","John Stauch","And one disposition.","Brian Drab - William Blair","Okay. Okay. On the technical solution side, that wasn't in the legacy business was it? That was in the Thermal Control business?","","Randy Hogan","No it\u2019s in thermal.","John Stauch","It\u2019s in the thermal side.","Brian Drab - William Blair","So I just -- I'm curious as to what -- how you can -- why you had to adjust for that business typically is the business where you\u2019re going to see large projects. It\u2019s just the inherent in the nature of that businesses, isn\u2019t it?","John Stauch","Yeah. I mean but I think as they comment as they\u2019re large. I mean obviously we will share what they are and what we\u2019re doing with. I mean I think the other.","Randy Hogan","We\u2019re not in a position to talked about that project. We were involved in it and anything going forward, we will be able to talk about it.","John Stauch","And we just didn\u2019t want to mention fourth quarters in a row, I mean.","Brian Drab - William Blair","Yeah. Okay.","John Stauch","We would have to stay without these projects here though it was, so inability of looking at the pro forma numbers. We also took out the operate income associate with those project as well. So that we would be able to concentrate on the revenue required to hit the targets and therefore the conversion on the operating income side.","Brian Drab - William Blair","Okay. And then I just one other thing that I may have missed your discussions but the inventory step-up and customer backlog, your forecast for the fourth quarter at one point was $80 million, came in at 180, if I\u2019m looking at the numbers correctly is it. Can you talk about that change and maybe categorizing different?","John Stauch","Yeah. I think there might be categorizing more differences there. I mean I think the 180 -- there is a higher degree of impact on Valves & Controls. As you know, we have to take all the projects and basically strip all the margin out of all those and that one came in a little bit higher and that makes up most of the component of that change.","Brian Drab - William Blair","Okay. I follow-up more. Thank you.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.","John Stauch","Hi Gary.","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","Hi. Thanks. Just a couple of real quick housekeeping question for me. Can you provide me an update as to much new U.S. residential now represents for your business?","John Stauch","Roughly 20% of combined revenue.","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","That will new residential as opposed to\u2026","John Stauch","I\u2019m sorry. That will probably closer to 5%.","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","5%. Okay. Thank you.","John Stauch","5% or less.","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","And then just a question on the buybacks. You are on track for $400 million through the end of January. I'm just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on how you are viewing buybacks through 2013, maybe the cadence of buybacks as you move through the year. Is it going to be more seasonal in line with cash flow or could it be more linear?","John Stauch","The way we are thinking about is more value average, so probably doing it more ratably over the year, it\u2019s planned here and what I think is likely.","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities.","David Rose - Wedbush Securities","Good morning. This is actually a follow-up to a prior question on the inventory. If you could, my understanding was the inventory and backlog would be amortized through Q3 in 2014 respectively, backlog through 2014. And given the increase in backlog for Q4, how does that dynamic change then? I understand the call that you are now going to be finished by Q2, the step-up and the backlog.","John Stauch","That\u2019s our goal, yes. I mean, we are trying to aggressively get it all out and get it behind us on the first half of 2013. I mean, we\u2019ll update you if we feel there is a leakage in the Q3 right now but the real issue is to try to put the noise behind us and look on to the numbers that represents the full drop to the EPS.","David Rose - Wedbush Securities","Was there any inventory obsolescence that we saw in the fourth quarter then?","John Stauch","Yeah. There was a little bit of that.","David Rose - Wedbush Securities","Ballpark, I mean, was it meaningful?","John Stauch","$3-ish million, probably.","David Rose - Wedbush Securities","Okay. And then lastly, if you could on the fast growth markets that, you have some pretty bold numbers compared to what historically you\u2019ve been excited about. So maybe you can provide a little bit of more color in terms of did the dynamics within those fast growth markets Latin America, China, India, yeah, what are we\u2026","John Stauch","I think we think we have significant opportunity, we are focusing on six fast growth regions and if you kind of go around and you think of Latin America. I think we are being a little bit more modest is, Randy has given direction to the team and we are actively working to have higher levels of sustainable revenue growth around large more impactful projects and\/or product lines.","Randy Hogan","Yeah. Initiatives.","John Stauch","Initiatives, and I think what we\u2019ll see is, a focus and a prioritization on those particular vertical markets some of it Randy highlighted energy, power, mining, oil and gas, industrial process, where we think  we can bring an aggregated sale to the end customer base and begin to position ourselves into a lot more of a sustainable business model, then some of where we have gone with a particular product and there has been not a follow on localization of that product, so I think we are going to see a lot of strategy work done here in \u201913 and I think we positioned our fast growth markets, there still be a contributor, but we want to be profitably contributing and I think we have the ability under the Pentair sales offices to do so.","Randy Hogan","I would just add, we the numbers right now are the summary of what did you say, they are not saying not about what market back ideas are and that\u2019s a big objective as we put these businesses together in the fast growth region. We have 2600 employees now in China. Where do we want to be in China, I mean, would that kind of scale, we are further along actually in the Middle East on that thinking, we are probably enough 1500 employees, and we are further along there and we -- clearly the opportunity China and Southeast Asia seeing. So we haven\u2019t really -- the numbers not yet informed by our strategic intent.","David Rose - Wedbush Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is a follow up question from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital.","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital","Hi, guys. Just to be clear on the guidance change on revenues, so that the $100 million lower revenue, I guess the $7.6 versus $7.7, that\u2019s purely a function of prior year comps?","John Stauch","Yeah. The year-over-year expectations are the same, and obviously as we dug in and got to know some of the components of the revenue, Jeff, there is clearly some revenue that will be primarily at the divestitures and the sanctioned country. And then as we mentioned earlier, we stripped the large project out.","The numbers are there with and without it and you guys can certainly look at it, however, you feel it best serves you. We just did as we wanted to focus on going forward and talking about the cadence of building the revenue and growing. We want to make sure you had the basis to what you are launching from.","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital","Okay. But if you kind of applied the 30%, 35% incremental to that, what\u2019s kind of offsetting that within the unchanged guidance?","John Stauch","I don\u2019t think there is a lot there other than some of the components of that revenue were all that profitable, which I don\u2019t think the 30%, 35% will reflect all of that. And I think one of the things as I mentioned that we\u2019ve taken out is also the 20-ish million dollar impact of the sanctioned country write-offs associated with no longer providing those products to their customers and I think that changes the base a little bit there too, Jeff.","Jeff Hammond - KeyBanc Capital","Okay. Thanks, guys.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Randy Hogan","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. We will now turn it back over to our presenters for any closing remarks.","Randy Hogan","Okay. Thank you. I think we are done. So you can give them the calling numbers.

My name is Karenna, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Pentair's Q4 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasury you may begin your call.","James Lucas","Thanks, Karenna, and welcome to Pentair's fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. We're glad you could join us. I'm Jim Lucas, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasury. And with me today is Randy Hogan, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Stauch, our Chief Financial Officer. On today's call, we will provide details on our fourth quarter 2017 performance, as well as our first quarter and full-year 2018 outlook, as outlined in this morning's press release.","Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the Company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-Q and today's press release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today and the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results.","Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. Any references to non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation. We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up in order to ensure everyone has an opportunity to ask their questions.","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randy Hogan","Thanks, Jim. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us today. 2017 was an exciting year for Pentair\u2019s who saw organic growth return, strong margin expansion, robust cash flow as usual and the announcement of plan to separate our Water and Electric businesses into two publicly traded companies.","We had two goals in 2017, first, to deliver on our 2017 commitments, and second, to prepare to stand up two independent companies. We accomplished both and believe the momentum we have exiting 2017 will continue into 2018.","Our top line continue to gain momentum, driven by improving end markets and also by growth investments in both of our businesses. We saw very strong margin expansion in the fourth quarter and for the full year. I'll discuss the specifics around this in just a moment.","We\u2019re also introducing our 2018 outlook today, which is approximately $4 per share for the full company, expecting double-digit EPS growth once again. The $4 per share represents approximately $2.25 per share from Water and roughly $1.75 per share from Electrical for the full year. John will discuss the outlook in more detail later in the call.","We remain on track to spin our Electrical business in the second quarter and are targeting April 30th for completion of the spin. 2017 was the year that's our predictability return to Pentair and we believe that both Water and Electrical are well positioned as we approach our separation into two focused growth companies.","Now let\u2019s turn to slide 5 for discussion of our full year 2017 results. In 2017 we saw adjusted core sales increased 2%, which excludes the impact in 2016 of three large jobs in our Electrical business and one large job in Water\u2019s that did not repeat.","We saw the growth rate increase throughout the year, particularly within Electrical, as industrial end markets continue to recover. Segment income increased 7% for the year and return on sales expanded an impressive 100 basis points to 18.2%.","We achieved these results due to the cost actions we took in 2017 read through and positive leverage from sales hit the bottom line, all while still making growth investments in the business.","Adjusted EPS grew 16% and our free cash flow was over $600 million. This was a 100% of adjusted net income when excluding a one-time tax payment. Overall we were very pleased with our results in 2017 and we\u2019re optimistic that this path of improvement is sustainable.","Now let\u2019s turn to slide 6 for discussion of our fourth quarter 2017 results. Our fourth quarter results showed strength across almost all financial metrics. Adjusted core sales grew 4% in the quarter with Water up 3% and Electrical growing 5%.","Segment income increased 11% and return on sales expanded 80 basis points to 18%. Although material inflation remains a headwind, we continue to drive productivity and pricing actions to help offset the impact.","Adjusted EPS grew 19% and met our guidance of $0.93. Free cash flow was over $200 million in the quarter. So we ended the year on a positive note indeed.","Let's turn to slide 7 for a look at Water's performance in Q4. Our Water segment delivered adjusted core sales growth of 3% and 6% growth overall. Segment income grew 15% and return on sales expanded 160 basis points to 19.2%.","Our Water business delivered margin expansion of over 100 basis points every quarter in 2017 due to strong productivity and improved product mix. We don't expect this rate of margin expansion to continue, but we believe the cost structure is right and mix should remain favorable.","Filtration solution saw core sales declined 2%. It remains a tale of two stories, our residential and commercial filtration sales which represents nearly two thirds of the business remains strong, especially in food service. These are higher margin businesses and are a contributing factor to the positive mix comment made earlier.","The smaller process business continued to be hampered by low global diesel activity and muted spending in the beverage industry. Although we've been disappointed with the top line performance of that part of filtration solutions in 2017, we expect the business to face easier comps in 2018 and we believe the higher margin residential and commercial business is well positioned to keep growing as we continue to invest in this very attractive space.","Flow technology saw the top line grow for the first time all year, as core sales were up 4%. We saw broad based strength across this business for the first time in quite some time, with agriculture, residential and commercial all up.","Our smaller engineered pump business saw some short cycle recovery and the longer cycle backlog continues to improve, which you believe foretells improvements in 2018 and 2019.","Aquatic systems ended the year on another strong note with core sales up 5% in the quarter and delivering 7% growth for the full year. We saw normal early buy activity and overall demand remained strong, as we continue to gain ground from advanced product adoption and ongoing dealer gains amidst to market ops \u2013 optimism.","Now let\u2019s move to slide 8 for a look at Electrical\u2019s performance in Q4. Adjusted core sales grew 5% in the quarter and were up 7% overall. Segment income grew 6% and margins were down modestly, as price and productivity were not enough to offset inflation. We expect material inflation to continue, there's a roadmap to productivity accelerating in 2018, while price headwinds moderate.","Enclosures core sales grew 8% in the quarter and the strength was broad based. The uncharacteristic productivity shortfalls are isolated to Enclosures. Recent plant closures and a distribution center relocation resulted in some near term delivery challenges compounded by very strong demand. We see this demand remaining strong and expect the issues that impacted productivity in 2017 to abate in the first half of 2018.","With the stability of these capacity investments and a strong outlook, we believe Enclosures is poised to stabilize margins and grow income in 2018. Core sales declined 3% in thermal, but this was due solely to the top line headwind in the three large energy jobs last year in Canada that we outlined at the outset of the year and I mentioned earlier.","Excluding these large jobs, thermal grew once again on both the small project and product side of the business with particularly strong sales in the industrial MRO business. Even more positive is that the business dramatically improved its margins in 2017. As a result of its realigned cost structure and better overall mix from higher margin product sales, making this an even more attractive business for Electrical.","Electrical & Fastening Solutions saw core sales increased 7%, as commercial remained strong and infrastructure showed growth for the first time all year. More important price cost within EFS has gotten back to a more favorable position than we saw at the beginning of the year.","Now please turn to slide 9 for an update on our planned separation. Before turning the call over to John to discuss the financial outlook in more detail, I wanted to provide an update on our planned separation.","We made tremendous progress preparing to stand up two companies in 2018. The nVent Form 10 has been filed and the review process is ongoing. The leadership teams for both Pentair and nVent are now complete and the new teams are coming together well.","Enterprise separation activities, such as finance, treasury and IT are all on or ahead of schedule. As we prepare for the separation we expect that both capital structures determined by the end of the first quarter. We're looking forward to sharing our excitement for the prospects of both companies at the Investor Day as we're hosting in New York on February 13. There are both management teams will present their strategies and discuss their futures in more detail.","We remain excited for Pentair's next chapter as we create two industry leading pure play companies in Water and Electrical. We strongly believe that both companies are well-positioned for long-term growth and value creation with the scale and strength to control their own destinies.","The increased focus of both companies should help to raise the execution even further and drive higher differentiated growth. We believe that our performance in 2017 has demonstrated our ability to better forecast our business and execute against our commitments. Both companies can become appreciated for the jewels that I believe they are.","I will now turn the call over to John.","John Stauch","Thank you, Randy. Please turn to slide number 10, titled balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the year with our balance sheet in the best position in over two years. Our ending debt balance was $1.4 billion, which does not include just over $100 million of cash on hand at the end of the year.","Our free cash flow into the year was over $600 million and represented 94% of adjusted net income. However, when excluding a one-time tax settlement payment from a prior year in 2017 free cash flow once again equalled adjusted net income. Our ROIC continued to improve and ended the year at 11.6%.","Please turn to slide 11 titled 2018 outlook. Today we are introducing our 2018 adjusted EPS outlook for all of Pentair of approximately $4 per share, comprised of core sales growth of 2% to 4% and margin expansion of roughly 20 basis points.","Embedded in our guidance is corporate expense of %100 million. Interest expense of $50 million and an effective tax rate of 18%. While we recorded a fourth quarter charge of roughly $85 [ph] million related to US tax reform, actually a gain of $85 million related to US tax reform. We believe the expanded - the expected 18% go forward tax rate to be an improvement over our current 20% tax rate and sustainable.","The share count for 2018 is expected to be 183 million shares, inclusive of a completed share buybacks and before any incremental repurchases. While we have not yet finalized the capital structure of both companies heading into the separation, we continue to target investment grade metrics for both companies and our interest expense forecast reflects this target.","We are also introducing 2018 adjusted EPS guidance for Water or RemainCo of $2.20 to $2.30 per share, on core sales growth of 2% to 4% percent. While we continue to make growth investments, we believe return on sales should expand approximately 40 basis points. I would remind you this follows a 140 basis points expansion in 2017.","Corporate expense for Pentair RemainCo should approximate $55 million and interest expense is expected to be around $20 million. For Pentair Electrical or nVent, we are introducing 2018 adjusted EPS guidance of a $1.70 to $1.80 per share, based on core sales growth of 2% to 4%, flat return on sales, corporate expense of $45 million and interest expense of $30 million. Both companies will have more details on their 2018 outlook at the upcoming investor days on February 13 in New York City.","While 2017 was a year of many changes for Pentair, both businesses have seen improving fundamentals and improving growth rates. As a reminder, the key rationale of the separation was to create two focused growth companies, which would require some dedicated growth investments in 2018, which should result in improved top line growth, EPS expansion and robust cash flow to be allocated in a disciplined manner to create share owner value.","Please turn to slide 12 titled seasonality present in both businesses. We wanted to remind everyone that both businesses, particularly Water do experience some seasonality during the year. The past two years have seen similar trends that we would expect to continue. We thought this would be a useful reminder as you think about the quarterly distribution of sales and income for both businesses.","Please turn to slide 13 titled Q1 2018 outlook. We are targeting that the first quarter should represent the last time we will report earnings as one company. With Q1 as a launch point for both companies, we are estimating core sales growth to 3% in both businesses for the first quarter.","Segment income is expected to increase about 6% and return on sales is anticipated to be flat at 15.5%. Also we are expecting a tax rate of 18%. Net interest of around $13 million and shares to be roughly 183 million. Overall adjusted EPS is expected to be up over 20%.","We exited 2017 continuing to build top line momentum, and while we continue to make growth investments in both Electrical and Water, Electrical\u2019s also correcting its productivity issues and dealing with significant inflation challenges. We believe both businesses are positioned to deliver strong overall results, while preparing to stand up as two well positioned industry leading companies.","I would now like to turn the call over to Karenna, after which Randy will have a few closing remarks. Karenna? Please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Steve Tusa","Good morning.","Randy Hogan","Good morning.","John Stauch","Morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","So first of all just on kind of the top line trajectory in \u201918, you know, your growth this quarter was okay, but not great in the context of the economy. I mean, I think 2% to 4% seems you know, reasonably conservative. Is there anything you know maybe in the Electrical business that you'd want to point out that you know could potentially be an upside surprise you know into next year, whether it's Enclosures or anything else?. Maybe just talk about the profile of some of the sub-segments as you set up in the next year, especially in Electrical?","Randy Hogan","Yeah, I think - I think that our outlook is realistic, but there's more upside than downside. I mean, we have - a lot of people calling synchronous growth. First time I've seen in 30 years. The markets are good for gaining momentum in Electrical, specifically we've got some the disappointing execution in Enclosures that we have. We've got that stabilized, it\u2019s not productive yet, but now it's stabilized. I would hope that we could gain even more share and get back our rightful share that maybe we lost a little bit of it in Enclosures\u2026","Steve Tusa","So how fast - so how fast do you think the Enclosures market is growing?","Randy Hogan","I don't have that number right in front of me, but I'd say\u2026","John Stauch","High singles.","Randy Hogan","Yeah.","Steve Tusa","Okay. So you think that it's possible to kind of - if that trend line slows maybe a tad next year you think it's possible to kind of work your way into that. You know something above mid single digits at some point here in the near term as those issues get remedied?","Randy Hogan","For Enclosures, yes, yes.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And what exactly are the issues again?","Randy Hogan","You know, we had a number of plant moves \u2013 just a consolidation of a distribution center that we started in 2016, it took a little longer to get them done. And then the market took off and that's just the additional demand just basically overwhelmed the moves. They weren\u2019t stable. So we're getting to the end of that, that's why the first quarter outlook is what it is.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then just on the margin side of Electrical, you guys give you know, pretty good bridges as far as you know price inflation, et cetera. Can you just give us a little bit of color on how we get to the you know, margin you're guiding to for next year with regards to Electrical and if you are not kind of prepared to do that maybe just a little bit of color on what you're assuming on kind of the you know the price cost side there?","Randy Hogan","Let me give you an overview and then Beth will go into it in more detail on the 13th, I think it's fair for her to let her do that. But basically we were very cautious on price while we were having these delivery challenges because of the operational faux pas.","And so price \u2013 price is still going to be a headwind in the first part. And we're not counting on productivity in the first you know, five months or so, four months of the year\u2026","Steve Tusa","And inflation - and inflation?","Randy Hogan","Kind of run rate continues\u2026","Steve Tusa","For Electrical?","Randy Hogan","In the fourth quarter we didn't get any productivity.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then one last question, your ForEx up 1% what rate is that based on?","John Stauch","Roughly a $1.20, the euro. You know, obviously lots of currencies, Steve, but that\u2019s the main one.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot guys.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Randy Hogan","Morning, Deane.","John Stauch","Good morning.","Deane Dray","Hey, maybe start with John, if you could give us some insight into the puts and takes in tax reform, you can count us among the people that were pleasantly surprised to see you actually benefiting more than what we expected. So on top of this whole separation, you also had to flow through tax reform. But just give us a sense of how it turned out that it's as favorable as it is.","John Stauch","Yeah. So I mean, I think when the legislation emerged we thought we'd - just like you did probably thought we'd have a slight headwind and a couple of things went favorable for us. One is there's less of a border adjustment tax impact on us, you know, US manufacturing tax than originally assumed and then also we were able to carry forward our deferred tax assets related to debt and debt restructuring for an infinite period of time which allows us to utilize those in the future. Those are the two main changes.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then going back to the Water discussion in Randy's prepared remarks, and I'm not sure if Randy answered this or John, but the idea of the mix being more favorable on residential and especially on foodservice's side remained strong, and Randy said where you look to invest in this business going forward. So what are the kinds of opportunities for investing? Is this internal growth or are these acquisitions?","Randy Hogan","Well, I think you know we'll talk about this definitely in length on the 13th. But first and foremost, we have lot of organic growth opportunities. I mean, one of the reasons we want to separate both these companies is they both have the ability to focus on organic growth.","Organic growth is you know - delivering that growth muscle for us is key and what that means is we're going to focus on where we're really good, which is residential, commercial water treatment. That is our strong position globally and we want to continue to invest in that area and maybe deemphasize a little of the other pieces of portfolio.","Deane Dray","That's helpful. And just last question for me. Is there any news or development on the hurricane impact, the rebuild especially on the Aquatic side?","Randy Hogan","No, I mean, we continue to see the order rates continue in that area both in - definitely Florida and the Houston area. So you know, as both the states continue to rebuild outside of that hurricane damage that they suffered.","John Stauch","The optimism - I mentioned this in the prepared remarks, the optimism in this business is as high as I've ever seen it. Its - growth is really, really solid there.","Deane Dray","Great. Thank you. See you on the 13th.","Randy Hogan","Exactly.","Operator","Your next question is from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jeff Hammond","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Randy Hogan","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Hammond","Just on - back to Electrical margins being flat you know in the guide, outside of this Enclosures issue it sounds like it'll be you know cleared up by 1Q. What are the other kind of headwinds to not getting you know more leverage out of Electrical?","John Stauch","I want to see more yields from price, right. And you know I'm taking a bunker attitude here, you know, which is don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes. In other words, let's see some delivery here.","This is a business that just delivers. So it's - I expect to be an anomaly what we're seeing now.","Jeff Hammond","Okay. And then on Thermal, I mean, it looks like the - you know the big projects you're lapping, kind of the big project com, you know, we're at $65 oil, it sounds like after markets been better. Can you just maybe carve out where you think the outlook is for that business into \u201918?","Randy Hogan","A shout-out to the Thermal team. They did an incredible job this year. You know, if you look at their overall and the top line coming down those was big projects. They not only right sized cost structure, but actually made investments, they made investments against driving MRO and driving product sales only much higher margins than the products that were coming down.","So we saw a nice increase in margins in that business and frankly with a little bit of mojo behind capital spending in energy that's going to bode well for the smaller projects and the product sales and our investments we made in MRO. I expect another dazzling year for Thermal.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Randy Hogan","Hey, Mike.","Mike Halloran","So on kind of a comparable question though you guys have been answering on the Electrical side, maybe similar puts and takes on the Water side for the margins into next year, just how you're looking at the price cost curve and also how you're looking at productivity?","And then for the cumulative company also some thoughts on the restructuring side how much benefit for both Electrical and Water you're assuming in numbers for next year?","John Stauch","Yes. So Mike, you know, on the Water side, we had a strong productivity year in 2017. But you know, we have to get back to investing in organic growth. So for 2018 we've got some $25 million of incremental investments in primarily sales, marketing and innovation technology into the outlook for 2018. And we want to get back to investing to control our destiny as far as the future and begun to build an organic growth muscle.","So we're excited about the opportunity to you know focus on where we think we're strong, which is residential, commercial, water treatment and then starting to invest in the longer term growth trajectory.","So other than that, price cost for us is not as big an issue as it is in Electrical you know, we deal with the trades channel and usually have the ability to take the price and cost and mitigate them through our channel. So we're a little bit blessed in that regard. And then Randy, do you want to add to the Electrical.","Randy Hogan","Well, I just did on the margin side, I think I\u2019ve...","Mike Halloran","Yeah. No, no I was comfortable on the Electrical side. Was there any restructuring benefits for either the two pieces into next year?","John Stauch","Oh, yes, significant. I mean, both groups have taken the opportunity to optimize their portfolio and both sides are looking at you know some tailwind associated with 2017 restructuring.","Randy Hogan","And kudos to John and Beth both as they - built the structures as you recall when we first said we're going to separate, we thought we might have a $20 million headwind in the corporate cost and we actually came out with a neutral, no headwind. A lot of good work too.","Mike Halloran","And any willingness to give a dollar number on those or too early and just want to leave it up to the individual companies over time?","Randy Hogan","Too early.","Mike Halloran","That\u2019s fair. And then on the engineered pump side, first positive commentary in a while there, maybe just some thoughts on what you're seeing in the market and sustainability of what could be an early turn toward something more positive?","Randy Hogan","Yeah, the market is definitely recovering and has been recovering throughout 2017. And we have built the order backlog for the breaking fix side of primarily municipal. So I think we \u2013 we\u2019re now moving from what used to be a headwind to let's say a slight tailwind.","Mike Halloran","Sounds good. Thanks for the time.","Randy Hogan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Scott Graham from BMO. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Scott Graham","Morning, Randy and John, Beth.","Randy Hogan","Morning, Scott.","Scott Graham","Couple questions for you. You know, where we were talking in 2017 about what felt like about a 1%, maybe 1% to 2% headwind to sales from businesses that were sort of - let's just call it being run off so to speak.","Could you tell us kind of what that is in Water and if there's any in Electrical as we stand today still happening?","John Stauch","Yeah. So what we are referring to is you know, we shipped some projects in 2016 that had a headwind you know, and we looked at those as being somewhere around a point of headwind on the Water side. And then you know, larger impact in the Electrical side, primarily all in Thermal, which was the large jobs that had completed in 2016 that had no revenue in \u201817.","That's all behind us now. And as we look forward we no longer have those challenges and each of the businesses will produce the organic growth or the core growth that - that will be just reflective of no longer having those year-over-year challenges.","Scott Graham","Right. I guess, John I was referring to and what I thought and may - correct me if I'm wrong, that you were even in some of like the lower margin Water businesses, residential, maybe you were walking away from some customers there, did I have that wrong?","John Stauch","No. I mean, it was more about more geography prioritization. You know, we as two smaller focused companies can't afford to be in every geography in the world. And you know, it gets very difficult to have a small scale and compete in Russia or a small scale and compete in Brazil and so both sides we\u2019re looking at optimizing those opportunities.","But those will be some surrounding headwinds next year, Scott as we look to move the revenue that we have to a distribution or an alternative channel, but we removed the costs \u2013 associated [ph] structure, being cost structure of being local there.","Scott Graham","Got you. Last question from me.","John Stauch","Okay.","Scott Graham","You know, as these companies take their - you know, each independent paths, have you - I know that there's a lot of work going on behind the scenes in terms of what you want to be and all that and the separation mechanics themselves.","But if you thought about M&A pipelines. I know you mentioned John where you kind of want to be just now, but have you started to identify some things on the Water side and on the Electrical side. Is there one of the three platforms you maybe want to develop a little bit further?","John Stauch","So I'll handle the Water side. I mean, clearly you know, disciplined capital allocation is important for both sides. And I think in the near term we think we have a significant amount of organic growth opportunities and I'd like to see our businesses demonstrate the organic growth that that they have and then tuck in behind it the M&A.","So yes, we're identifying them. I think you know, where we have strong organic growth and they probably have a readiness and an ability to move sooner. But I really want to see the discipline around that steady consistent organic growth and then putting the fuel behind them as a bolt on. Randy, if you want to answer the Electrical\u2026","Randy Hogan","Yeah. In Electrical you know, there's quite a few parts of the business, if you look at all three of what will be the segment, they are actually all three very attractive from a profitability standpoint and they all have opportunities on the M&A.","But I would say 2018 as a prove it year from an operation standpoint and a continuation year from driving the organic growth that we're really building great momentum on.","At the same time there have been and there will be opportunities I think to do little plug and play acquisitions, particularly in the EFS side, Electrical Fastening Solution side and maybe some Thermal too. But again, I think Beth could talk more about that on the 13th.","Scott Graham","Got it. Thank you.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from John Walsh from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","John Walsh","Hi. Good morning.","John Stauch","Good morning.","John Walsh","So one question about the Q1 top line guide, in prior slides you'd called out you know, a days comparability issue on a on a year-over-year basis, we obviously lived through some of that in 2017. I think the last update I saw Q1 \u201818 actually has one less selling days from your prior slide. Is that still the case or how should we think about that?","Randy Hogan","Yeah, I would say it's a rounding error. I mean, a day is not all that meaningful and that's reflected in what we have in the core guide for Q1.","John Walsh","Okay. And then you know, clearly good cash conversion execution here. You know I like or applaud that you do it on the adjusted net income. As we think about next year, you know, in working capital I mean, clearly as you execute on that it does get harder to keep getting gains out of that line.","You know any particular cash items you have visibility into next year that give you know, confidence in that 100% conversion on the adjusted net income, whether it's on the inventory line or payables or anything like that?","Randy Hogan","Yeah, the first thing I'd like to state, maybe it's clear already, is both Water and Electrical have and will convert at 100% level. So the capability is on both sides. There's a seasonality in Water that John talked about that's important, but for the year both will deliver.","I believe that Electrical it does because of the distribution - short term distribution challenges that I just talked about will have some inventory opportunities, as well as we've really only begun to think - make - scratch the surface on EFS opportunity on inventory.","John Stauch","Yeah, I think the biggest tailwind opportunity for both companies as we go forward is to read \u2013 the reducing of the separation related costs and the severance and restructuring costs. I mean, on the gross cash rate both companies will start to you know get into more of a stabilized mode and no longer have these large restructuring actions that have hurt us on the cash flow side.","John Walsh","All right. Thank you.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Nathan Jones","Morning, everyone.","John Stauch","Morning, Nathan.","Randy Hogan","Morning, Nathan.","Nathan Jones","John, on the Water side, you talked about focusing on the areas where you're seeing good growth, where you're having strong positions and maybe deemphasizing some of the other businesses. Given the opportunity you have with the split, is -- have you given a thought and consideration to perhaps disposing of some of those assets using that capital to bolster the businesses where you have better and stronger positions?","John Stauch","Yeah. I don't know if we're there yet. I think it's really about the fact that it's prioritization. And you know, we've been - we have a lot of great growth opportunities across all of Water, but we have to focus our energy and focus our actions - our actions.","And so you know, it's about not chasing the large jobs that are one and done. It's about focusing on the aftermarket. The annuities, the stability of our customer base and that's really what it's about at this point Nathan.","Nathan Jones","And then I know you guys said you're looking at investment-grade balance sheet for both companies. But judging by the interest expense line that you have there, Electrical is going to get more of the debt on what is a somewhat smaller company. Does that indicate that you guys believe that the Water business has more opportunities for M&A?","John Stauch","Obviously that that reflects roughly what we think will do. As you recall you know, now that we've retired all - retired the debt with the proceeds from Valves & Controls, while money is fungible, the debt that remains is really around EFS.","So I just think by rights it sort of an Electrical debt, which is the guiding principle. I think there are more opportunities on both sides, but Waters is been on the sidelines for first because of Valves & Controls and secondly because of the EFS acquisition for a while. So those are the guiding principles that I gave the team to use as they put this together, still have to finalize things though.","Nathan Jones","Okay, fair enough. And then the $25 million of incremental investments, I think that was related to Water. Can you quantify what incremental investments are related to Electrical? And then maybe talk about some of the major initiatives, some of the major investments that you're making to drive growth here in the future?","John Stauch","Yeah, about 50 basis points on the Electrical side. You know, and again I mean, those are to further off the automation, get the delivery and quality issues and also to be creating the one event opportunities across the portfolio for some of the key initiatives that they have, like rail and data centers.","So I mean I think each of these companies feel that the incremental investment in 2018 is really going to create a sustained and more predictable organic growth in \u201919, \u201820 and beyond. And so obviously if it doesn't materialize that's an opportunity, but it would be disappointing if we weren't able to invest that in the future growth.","Nathan Jones","Is that a number that you think is a run rate number? This $25 million in Water, 50 basis points in Electrical, is this a step-up for 1 year that will step down again? Or a step-up to a level that you would imagine sustaining as we go forward investing in growth opportunities?","John Stauch","We'd like to sustain it.","Randy Hogan","I think we need to build the business model to be able to sustain that, so we keep it going. John made a good point earlier about these large projects that are won and done. And I mentioned earlier about Thermal, as redirecting and restructuring their cost to go after smaller sustainable MRO and product that's really an opportunity in Water as well, which as John said that those investments should sustain, those investments should give us more reliable organic growth.","Nathan Jones","Excellent. Thanks very much for the color.","Randy Hogan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Josh Pokrzywinski","That was closer, John.","John Stauch","Hello, Mr. Pokrzywinski.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Yeah, I thought it was closer. We're again improving, hopefully another 10 years and we'll be all the way there. So John just to follow up on something you said about you know, emphasizing versus deemphasizing points within Water.","Does deemphasizing you know, could that mean outright sales of businesses? And you can kind of ring fence you know, maybe not the exact lines of business, I don't want to spoil the fun for the Analyst Day. But you know the rough size of businesses that could be in that deemphasization [ph] you know bucket?","John Stauch","Josh, let me take - let me take it and of course, probably will come up again on the 13th [ph] But you know, the fact is that, we have always focused on capital allocation, if look at all the things we did, I mean, we just - we sold the pipe business right after we bought Tyco. We ended up making different calls and selling valves.","You know we have trimmed and pruned the business, as well as replanted it. And so that sort of I think almost in the DNA of the business to think that way. And I would expect both businesses to continue to do that.","Randy Hogan","Yeah, Josh, I mean to put it into context, 85% of what we do falls into one bucket in Water called residential commercial water treatment. I want to focuses to be there. We've moved to more of an enterprise model where we have the ability to look at marketing across the enterprise you know, in innovation across the enterprise and we want the extra energy to be focused on where we think we can differentiate against the competition and differentiate on behalf of the customer.","One of the big areas that we have to invest in is digital marketing to pull the consumer through our professional channel and that's going to be done first on the residential commercial side.","The technology is transferable, I mean when we take a look at what we have and what we do in Industrial Filtration that technology is useful in residential commercial, it hasn't been used that way in the past. And so it\u2019s more about a redirection as we go forward than it is necessarily an asset sale.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got you. So when you think about that - the 15% that doesn't fall into the core, we shouldn't you know think about Pentair long-term is maybe parting ways with those as we add in other things that are closer to the core. That's not necessarily in the agenda?","Randy Hogan","That's correct.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Okay. That was all. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Drab from William Blair. Please go ahead. You line is open.","Brian Drab","Morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.","John Stauch","Good morning.","Randy Hogan","Morning.","Brian Drab","So back to Water if I could just for a second, you mentioned that the pace of margin improvement in Water shouldn't continue, but you are guiding up 40 Bps for \u201918 and this is really good operating margin in Water in the back half of the year here and really for the whole year.","I guess my question is just can we continue to track up above 20% and as I look back at the old reporting structure, you know Water quality was of course sustain margins above 20, but flow and filtration was well below that. And I'm just wondering if you know combined what is the longer term trajectory for this combined business?","John Stauch","Yeah, what Randy meant was even though we delivered a 140 year-on-year this year and we're up 100 every single quarter, we did not make those future investments in the growth that we're doing in 2018. So if you add back that $25 million of incremental growth I shared with you it suggests that these margins continue to expand before that growth. And I would just look at it that way.","The other thing we did and you know we used a playbook that's been proven in the PIMS for some period of time and we did a lot of product rationalization, SKU rationalization and reprioritizing some of the lower margin product and really didn't suffer all that much in the top line - significantly expand margins.","So I mean, there's a ton of opportunity still remaining in these businesses from an operational standpoint, but we want to invest in future growth.","Brian Drab","Okay. But we shouldn't think about 19.6 or wherever we are as a ceiling in 2019, 2020 we can continue to move up?","John Stauch","No, and our peer group demonstrates that too. I mean, if you take a look at some of the older water peers they have really nice margins as well.","Brian Drab","Yes, for sure. And then if I could just a couple of questions on Thermal. Are you starting to see demand specifically in the in the petro-chem market. You know, there's talk of - a lot of talk of a second wave of investment there in over the next few years, could that be a tailwind for you?","John Stauch","Yeah, we are we're seeing a pretty broad base. As we mentioned before, particularly now with the tax law change, I expect - I would expect the investments in petro-chem on the chem side, right, on the plastic and monomer side is going to be quite substantial here with low cost natural gas in North America. The whole industry should be here. So with the tax law change you know, I think it could be - we could have a sustain capital spending even at this oil price level, that would be pretty exciting.","Brian Drab","All right. Okay. Thanks. And then just one last quick one. You mentioned MRO again is picking up steam in Thermal and in the Americas. And can you kind of break that down into what\u2026","John Stauch","It\u2019s also in Europe, its everywhere.","Brian Drab","Okay.","John Stauch","Now if you want to go back and just look at the energy side, you know, now they're back $65. You're back to more normalized maintenance level and this is a business and has a wonderful MRO flow. And our focus now on our investment as we took down the elephant hunting, forgive me - forgive the metaphor, but of the large projects we invested in the things out to more aggressively focus on getting that after marketing and serving it and we're enjoying that. So I expect it to continue.","Brian Drab","Okay. So my question is going to be, just thank you for that. But my question is going to be within the Americas are you seeing the same kind of momentum in Canada versus the US and kind of broad based across end markets or are there any specific pockets of strength?","John Stauch","As I mentioned it is broad based. So it is Europe. It has come back from Canada, it has \u2013 it is strong in North America.","Brian Drab","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie","Good morning, guys.","John Stauch","Hi, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","Hey, maybe I'm going back to Electrical for a second and your commentary earlier around price cost. So if I kind of take a look at 2017 it looks like you've been running last few quarters about $10 or $11 million price cost negative last few quarters and it sounds like that's going to continue now at least through next four or five months.","On top of that you've got strategic investments call it $2 to $3 million a quarter in Electrical. What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to bridge to flat margins. Is there any expectation then as we get into the back half of the year that price costs reverses or are there other things that are coming through on your bridge to get to a flat margin guidance for \u201918?","John Stauch","Yeah, I mean the productivity \u2013 the stabilization then leads to positive productivity and you know that's more in the third and fourth quarter as opposed certainly not first quarter a little bit the second that I think about it.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. So is there an expectation also from a pricing standpoint and I guess my understanding was that and I could be wrong here with that typically you guys put price increases through at the end of the year, early part of the year and so I'm just wondering whether there's an opportunity for you to get additional pricing as the year progresses?","John Stauch","Let me say this carefully, but I hope there is an opportunity. You know, we haven't broken that process. But this business, I mentioned it's an anomaly and most in the Enclosures business for this kind of performance. So controlling your destiny means controlling what you can.","So there's been a price increase but do we count on that or we count on the productivity that we own and we drive, you kind of what you can - would you own and drive that's what controlling our own destiny means. If the price really read through that would be good. But we want to deliver on our commitments in any case.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. And maybe then just kind of following on what you can control, which is partly the cost angle. Do you guys plan to typically hedge any of your commodity costs or are we just kind of going to roll through because we've seen a little bit of an increase here in copper and steel and just wondering like you know, whether we should \u2013 what kind of headwind we should be expecting from that?","John Stauch","What our process is you know, we're not commodities traders. So what we'd like to do is we would like to lock in our price so that we can have good operating plans and predictability in our business. So we typically are locked out about 6 months on those commodities and copper is one of them.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. Okay, guys thanks very much.","John Stauch","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Winoker from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually Chris on behalf of Steve. Can I just - can we just go back to the price cost and productivity kind of topic. You know, you guys said that you control your own destiny with regard to productivity. Are you seeing customers being more reluctant to accept price. Is that kind of something that you know you're seeing with their customer base right now?","Randy Hogan","Well, again, talking about Enclosures, it\u2019s really hard to actively set price when you can\u2019t get deliver, right. And so we've got stable and we'll see whether they accept it.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","John Stauch","But I mean, people are seeing inflation, so any material inflation that typically in that business has led us to be able to achieve some price.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then you know, I know you said you're not - did the elephant hunting is a thing of the past, but in terms of just project activity in general, I mean, are you - is there more activity or is there anything you guys are seeing there or is the growth going to continue to be kind of more shorter cycle in nature more MRO kind of mix there\u2026","John Stauch","In this kind of a robust economy there will be - there will be larger projects, but we want projects to come to us and we want to own other parts of the business. And so it's a different - we certainly will accept them as they come. But we're not going to have the major effort that we had in the past and the cost structure associated with that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And again just one more, on Electrical & Fastening, I know there was year-over-year comp, but you know the strong sequential acceleration there. Is there anything more to that and how should we kind of expect that to flow through \u201918?","John Stauch","Well, the CADDY business, the CADDY brand product line which is largely commercial is seeing \u2013 it saw some variable growth in EFS, but CADDY was pretty solid, it was it was really solid in the fourth quarter and then the industrial - the infrastructure business was - really came back and I think again in this economy with what's happening, I would expect infrastructure to continue with some strength.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks a lot.","John Stauch","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions on the phone at this time. And turn the call back over to presenters.","Randy Hogan","Thanks for your questions and your attention. Just to wrap things up, we remain on track for the separation to be completed by April 30th. But this still remains work to be done. Both businesses are well positioned entering the New Year with improving top line fundamentals. We expect both companies have strong balance sheets upon launch. We report to updating you further on February 13th with Pentair and nVent presenting their strategies and we hope you share our excitement for the future of both companies.

On today's call, we will provide details on our Q1 2012 performance as well as our full-year 2012 outlook, as outlined in this morning's release.","Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's 10-K for the quarter ended December 31, 2011, and today's release. Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results.","Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website. We will reference these slides throughout our prepared remarks. All references today will be on an adjusted basis unless otherwise indicated, for which non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation.","I\u2019d like to also point out that the Q2 and full-year outlook does not include any future impact related to the pending Tyco Flow deal that we announced on March 28, as stated in this morning\u2019s release.  And we\u2019ll be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. With that, Randy. ","Randy Hogan","Thanks, Sara, and good morning, everyone. Before we get in to the Q1 Pentair performance, I\u2019d like to touch on the announced merger with the Tyco Flow Control, beginning with a quick refresher on Slide 3. ","We\u2019re very excited about the proposed Tyco Flow Control merger announced at the end of March. We believe this transaction is a great strategic fit, increasing our global presence and exposure to high-growth attractive sectors. ","We\u2019re confident in achieving our previously-announced financial targets, making the transaction very compelling, with $200 million of expected operational cost synergies and enhanced growth prospects and a stronger balance sheet. By any measure, the new Pentair will be a stronger company with exciting platforms for future growth and substantial value creation opportunities for all stakeholders.","Let me provide an update on the transaction timeline, what we\u2019ve been up to in the last 26 days, and what\u2019s still to come. ","From a regulatory perspective, we completed the HSR filing last week, and now we\u2019re in a waiting period with several other regulatory filings under way in foreign jurisdictions.  ","We\u2019ve established a integration management office and announced Todd Gleason, a proven Pentair executive, who many of you know, to drive a global integration planning, reporting directly to me. He will lead a team of approximately 25 to 40, functional and business unit team leaders, including those from Tyco Flow Control, once the transaction closes. These initial integration planning efforts will be critical as we ramp up towards the expected close at the end of September.","From a business reporting structure, our intent is to add the three Tyco Flow businesses, led by their current business leaders, to Pentair\u2019s existing five businesses, and report these eight global business units, or GBUs, in three segments. The three segments are Equipment Protection, Flow Control, and Water and Fluid. ","Importantly, the GBU leaders will be focusing on, and held accountable for their business unit performance, while the integration team will work closely with them, and with corporate to help ensure we achieve these synergies. ","Shortly, we\u2019ll be filing the preliminary proxy statement in Form F-4 for SEC review. This will contain more detailed information regarding the transaction and the filings expected by early May. Still to come, our other customary regulatory approvals, mainly foreign, and of course, Pentair and Tyco International shareholder approvals. ","So we\u2019re off to a good start in the planning for the pending combination with Tyco\u2019s Flow Control business. As we work through these regulatory approvals and SEC filings, we\u2019re limited in further commenting on the transaction. So we\u2019d ask you to keep your questions focused on today\u2019s main topic, our Q1 performance and outlook for the year.","Now let me turn to the focus of this morning\u2019s call; Pentair\u2019s first quarter performance, and let\u2019s start on Slide 4. ","The operating performance was solid in the quarter; we grew sales 9%, expanded adjusted operating margins, drove operating profits up 10%, and delivered adjusted EPS of $0.64, which was up 23%. ","While lower flood-related pump sales and further weakness in Western Europe tempered top-line growth in the quarter by roughly 4 points, we saw continued strength in many of the sectors we serve; industrial, agricultural, energy and pool, we\u2019re all up double-digits in the quarter, with new products and expanded coverage helping propel our growth.","Fast growth region sales were off to a slower start, but still grew faster than the overall Pentair. We continue to expect double-digit growth for the full-year in fast-growth regions, as we execute and have success with our growth plans. Margins increased another 20 basis points to 11.3% in the first quarter, better than we planned, even if sales were not.","Our teams did a nice job driving greater productivity and executing pricing actions to offset material inflation and fund growth investments. I\u2019m particularly proud of our Reynosa, Mexico operations team, who was recently recognized with a silver medallion Shingo prize award, that\u2019s like the Nobel prize for top lean enterprise companies. It\u2019s a great award. ","In Q1, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.64 compared to the $0.52 in the prior year, reflecting solid operating performance across both segments, along with an unforecasted $0.07 tax-related benefit, which is the main driver of our updated earnings outlook for 2012.  ","On cash flow, we reported a net cash usage, as is typical in our first quarter, but we\u2019re on track to convert more 100% of net income to free cash flow, something we\u2019ve done consistently eight out of the last ten years. ","All in, we delivered another quarter of solid operating performance with well-executed productivity initiatives, good price realization, and continued growth investments, which we believe positions us well for growth in 2012 and beyond.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 5 for a review of our Water and Fluid Solution segment performance. Water and Fluid Solution sales grew 14% year-over-year in the quarter, largely driven by the CPT acquisition, which added $68 million in sales. Excluding CPT, Water and Fluid sales grew 2% in local currency. Price realization was good, up 2%. Growth was impressive in Pool and Process Technologies, but lower flood related pump sales in a weaker Western Europe, tempered top-line growth in the quarter by roughly 5 points in this segment.","As we announced early this year, we repositioned our Water business to better capture the CPT cost synergies, address the realities in the developed markets and support global growth. We combined our two flow businesses, Residential and Engineered Flow in to one business, which we now call Flow Technologies, and aligned our other businesses under Treatment and Process, that includes Water Purification and Process Technologies, and Aquatics, the new name for pool. ","I\u2019ll go through each starting with the newly-combined Flow business. In Flow, sales decreased 3%, or 8% excluding CPT and foreign exchange. Due to a unseasonably dry winter and start to spring, flood-related residential pumps were down an estimated $15 million year-over-year. Additionally, as expected, municipal project pump sales remain soft, down roughly $10 million versus prior year. The remainder of the Pump portfolio performed well, with agricultural equipment sales up over 20% in the quarter and good growth in our commercial, fire and HVAC pumps. ","We\u2019re seeing early successes of a broader integrated global pump portfolio. We\u2019re increasing penetration and distribution in places like South America and South East Asia, and winning new orders through combined Pentair CPT sales efforts, in Qatar, Romania, and Kuwait for example, all helping to boost pump backlog over 12% from year end.","I believe we\u2019ve only just begun to see the benefits of our combined sales coverage, technology platforms and product portfolios in Flow Technologies. Within treatment and process, water purification sales were flat year-over-year in local currency. Fast growth region sales continued to grow at double digits, with India more than doubling again, as we expanded coverage and added new products. ","In contrast, sales in developed regions were down 6% in the quarter, largely in line with our expectations, as channel and discretionary pressures in residential softer components continued. Importantly, we did see U.S. inventory levels stabilize in European distributor sentiment improve from the October and November low points. ","New product launches remain on track, including a new treatment valve in Q2, and our industry changing innovation, Hybrid DI. This product, Hybrid DI, is scheduled for a limited launch in late June, with a broader launch in Q3. The Hybrid DI innovation system combines the benefits of reverse osmosis, or RO filtration, with those of a water softener, using compasitive DI innovation to remove hardness and total dissolve solids from water, all without employing salt.","In addition to residential use, this ground breaking system can be used in a wide range of applications, including at hotels and restaurants, and the broader commercial sector. We\u2019re excited about all these applications for this new product.","In process technologies, sales were up 97%, were up 12% excluding CPT, and 14% excluding foreign exchange. Across the board, energy, food service, and advanced water systems, all posted double-digit growth in the quarter. Within Advanced Water Systems, we continue to see nice growth and desalination through the distribution channel, along with some project work. ","Food service has steadily added to sales each quarter as we grow with channel distribution partners and restaurant chains, especially the multinationals. We also continue to expand reach, globally and within key verticals, for example growing in Turkey, and adding new customers in convenience stores.","Most notably, system sales and energy grew an impressive 41% in the quarter, as we pursue larger system sales, penetrate new applications within refineries and gas production, while growing recurring revenue and maintaining above average margins.","Our Q1 performance demonstrates the great strides we\u2019re making with our Polar X extractive separation system. This is the product that we took from the refining industry and are now applying in gas development. ","Our technology and system expertise provide alternatives to conventional natural gas treatment method, including [inaudible] at a fraction of the cost with better efficiency and superior environmental performance. While we see plenty of growth potential here, we believe dehydration could be what\u2019s next for our separation technology in the gas production stream.","On the acquisition front, CPT added $68 million in sales in Q1, contributing to both Flow and Treatment Process. While less than expected, due largely to a weaker Western Europe, backlog was strong and growing, in fact it was up some 50% from year end, which we believe sets up, sets us up nicely for 2013.","One of our focus areas has been growing CPT sales in the U.S. These sales doubled in the first quarter as we increased penetration in dairy, beverage and water markets. We also have some exciting innovations with both our Megablock and Anaerobic-MBR solutions, now both in the marketplace.","As we shared last quarter, we\u2019re also developing a new technology platform around Hollow-Fiber nanometer Filtration. That improves performance, uses less energy and reduces the footprint compared to the usually applied RO solution.","The first targeted application is the removal of silica from water in high-purity applications. While not set to launch full scale until the end of 2012, we\u2019ve already won several projects in India, where many water sources have high mineral content, and the removal of colloid silica is critical for high purity applications. And in fast-growth regions, we won our largest order ever in Brazil with a strategic win in beverage selling a broad array of our product solutions, along with a recurring service contract.","We continue to make great progress leveraging the CPT technology and cross selling opportunities in pump infiltration while driving more profitable growth.","Turning to our Aquatic Systems business, we had another great performance. Sales were up 18% in the quarter, reflecting continued share gain, innovation, and good pricing, and likely some benefit from the good weather.","Growth fundamentals remain strong in pool, with continued investment, a significant installed base, growing energy rebates, and good secular trims around sustainability, efficiency and automation. ","Our Eco-Select products continue to far outpace the industry growing over 40% in Q1. Leading the way were impressive IntelliFlo pump sales, which were up over 50% in the quarter. We continue to expand coverage in penetration, adding another 150 dealers in the quarter, and add new products to the lineup, such as the newly-launched automated residential cleaning system that is more energy and cost efficient.","In addition, we recently completed the acquisition of Sibrape, a $20 million pool manufacturer and distributor in Brazil. With our innovation leadership and Sibrape\u2019s critical dealer relationships throughout Brazil and South America, we\u2019re poised to accelerate sales and strengthen our position in this important region.","Share gain, targeted international expansion, and innovation investments, continue to drive great growth in our pool business. Aquatic shows that momentum is a beautiful thing. The right half of the page shows Q1 water and fluid operating profits in margin. Water and fluid operating margins decreased 20 basis points at 10.8% in the quarter, reflecting lower CPT margins.","Successful pricing actions and strong productivity help to offset persistent inflation, while CPT seasonality negatively impacted margins by roughly 100 basis points.","As we reach the first anniversary of the CPT acquisition, mid-Q2, we expect year-over-year improvements in CPT margins, giving our focus on lean and synergistic cost takeouts. With lean leaders now in all of the CPT sites, we\u2019re making great progress, with 20% higher salt capacities in many of the plants, and improved sourcing cost already.","Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with the water and fluid segment performance for this quarter.","Now let\u2019s move to Slide 6 for a review of Technical Products. Technical Product sales were roughly flat to prior year and local currency, while operating profits grew 5%. Price realization was good, but volumes were down year-over-year, largely due to two factors, softer-than-anticipated Western European sales, and an expected end-of-life Telecom project.","Communications, which accounts for nearly 20% of technical product sales, was down 23% in the quarter, with more than half of the decline resulting from the Telecom program going end of life, and the rest due to challenging market dynamics. ","Virtually all of the other verticals we serve continue to grow, with industrial and energy up double-digits, and commercial and infrastructure up mid-single digits.","Cooling, a key growth initiative for Technical Products, grew an impressive 22% in the quarter, as we expand coverage and penetration with new products. In the quarter, we also had a nice win in the rapidly growing electric vehicle market, with a German energy company supplying Smart car charging stations.","Like Water, Technical Products also saw fast-growth region sales slow in the quarter.  We do expect sequential improvement in Q2 and a stronger back half helped by new localized production in Mexico and Brazil along with higher cooling orders in China.  ","Even with flat sales, technical products grew operating profit 5% and expanded margins another 110 basis points to 18.6%.  This marks our record margin performance for any quarter for this business.  ","We believe we are well positioned to deliver the expected 100-plus basis point margin expansion in 2012 as pricing initiated in March reads through along with continued productivity, repositioning benefits and better growth.  ","Bottom line in technical products is we continue to see nice growth in the core and drive productivity in lean to grow operating profits and advance margins.  ","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 7.  For our standard work, detail of free cash flow are on the left of the slide and a summary of our debit levels are on the right.  ","On cash flow, we reported net cash usage of $82 million, as is typical in the first quarter, and continue to target another year of great-than-100% of net income conversions before deal costs.  On dividends, we returned approximately $22 million to shareholders through dividends with an annual payout ratio of 32%.  We continue to make steady progress on ROIC, which is shown on the bottom right hand section of the slide.  Return on invested capital increased nicely from year end, up 40 basis points to 9.4%.  Our goal continues to be driving ROIC back into double digits.  ","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 8.  In sum, we\u2019re off to a solid start.  We entered the year with the realistic view of the topline challenges, recognizing these realities, we were proactive in our repositioning efforts and leverage on productivity while remaining committed to new product and growth investments.  ","In turn, price realization was good and operating performance was great, putting us on track to deliver our full-year operating profit target.  ","We continue to meaningfully advance our strategy, expanding in new products, solutions and markets that directly align with the biggest mega trends that I believe are driving the world today and in the future.  The population of wealth growth, or what we call the New, New World, is putting incredible pressure and demands on food, water, energy and industrial infrastructure.  From [inaudible] to the transformational Tyco Flow deal, we continue to better position Pentair to serve this new world.  ","In addition, we remain committed to organic investments for growth in serving these attractive trends, sustaining a higher R&D level to deliver customers what they need including better efficiency, sustainability, automation and safety.  ","With that recap of Q1, let\u2019s turn to Slide 9 for a look forward at our sales growth expectations.  As you saw in the release this morning, we remain well on track to deliver our full-year operating profit targets.  We\u2019ve adjusted our full-year revenue assumptions a bit to reflect more modest growth and flow and a tougher Western Europe probably offset by a stronger pool performance.  ","Again, beginning with flow, we now expect organic topline growth in the low single digits, reflecting the lower Q1 flood-related sales.  All other assumptions are largely unchanged from where we saw things as we began the year, including a healthy replacement market in Residential Pumps, increasing contributions from Agriculture, and continued weakness in Large Project Municipal sales through 2012.  ","In Treatment and Process, we continue to expect strong high-single digit growth with leading technologies and expanding applications in Beverage, Energy and Advanced Water Systems, there\u2019s some exciting product launches for the back half of 2012.  ","In Aquatic, we now expect roughly 10% growth in 2012, up from the mid-to-high single digit growth expectations.  Continued success of our Eco-Select product line, dealer gains and pricing actions are yielding great results. ","Although small today, we\u2019re making great inroads in Aquaculture, attending trade shows around the world, including one next week in Australia.  And taking another step in thought leadership with Pentair sponsoring and leading a two-day conference on circulation aquaculture systems.  ","These efforts in Aquaculture meaningfully expand our address to global market, from $3 billion in pools to an estimated $5 billion including Aquaculture, giving real meaning to our newly renamed Aquatic Systems business.  ","In Technical Products, we now expect topline growth in the 2 to 4% range versus 4 to 6%, entirely related to Western Europe.  We continue to see growth in key sectors; Industrial, Energy and Infrastructure and expect fast-growth regions to accelerate in Q2 in the back half as we expand our global cooling mission into Latin America and execute our in-region four-region plan for China, replacing the lost telecom project in the U.S. with products and solutions serving the regional needs.  ","In sum, we continue to see nice growth in our best businesses and Pens continues to deliver, or as I like to say, ring the bell.  ","With that, I\u2019ll call it up \u2013 I\u2019ll turn it over to John.  John? ","John Stauch","Thanks, Randy.  Please turn to Slide 10, labeled Operating Margin Expectations.  We\u2019re starting off 2012 nicely.  With 20 basis points of overall expansion, despite roughly 70 basis points of headwind from our soon-to-be anniversary CPT acquisition.  ","For the year, we expect overall margins to expand 50 to 80 basis points inclusive of CPT.  Lean discipline and productivity enhancements, along with some repositioning savings lead margins higher in Q1, all while continuing to invest more in R&D, technology and selling and marketing growth initiatives.  ","Roughly 3 million of repositioning savings was delivered in the quarter, in line with our expectations and keeping us on track for over $20 million of full-year savings.  As a reminder, this equates to approximately 1\/3 of the top end of the net productivity range we are assuming for the year, which gives us a higher level of confidence in our operating targets while helping us fuel future growth.  ","Our price cost dynamic improved in the quarter with broad-based pricing of 1.3% offsetting material inflation.  For the full year, we continue to expect pricing from approximately 150 to 200 basis points as we fully realize the benefit of Q1 and early Q2 pricing actions.  We continue to expect material inflation in 2012, but much more moderate than the plus-4.8% last year.  ","Another key enabler of our margin expansion will be improving CPT margins as we anniversary the CPT acquisition mid-Q2, along with volume leverage, we are driving material sourcing savings, lean transformation and a tighter profit focus to increase profitability.  ","As demonstrated in Q1, we\u2019ll continue to prioritize and pace our investments with productivity funding, R&D and sales and marketing investments critical to driving share gains and delivering long-term sustainable growth.  ","On margins, we\u2019re off to a great start in Q1 with ramping productivity, repositioning savings and pricing benefit expected to drive further margin expansion as the year progresses.  ","Please turn to Slide 11, labeled Q2 Outlook.  For Q2, we expect Water and Fluid revenue to be up approximately 10% compared to the prior year quarter with Technical Products flat to down 2%, reflecting lower Western Europe sales and the remaining end-of-life Telecom project.  This puts total Pentair revenue up 6 to 8%, including the contribution from CPT of approximately four points, or roughly $40 million in sales.  ","We expect operating income to grow 7 to 12%, which equates to operating margins of between 13.5 to 14%, above the Q2 2011 margin of 13.3%.  ","We expect water and fluid margins to be modestly better than prior year\u2019s adjusted 14.2% at roughly 14.5%.  ","We expect Technical Products margins to expand another 100 basis points at roughly 18.5%.  ","Below the line, we expect interest expense to be about $3 million higher in Q2 of this year versus Q2, 2011 as we anniversary the CPT acquisition mid-quarter and a tax rate between 28 and 29%.  ","Overall, we expect earnings per share in the quarter to be between $0.79 and $0.82, which equals growth of 5 to 9% over last year.  ","We are expecting cash flow of $180 million as we move towards free cash flow conversion of greater than 100% of net income for the year.  ","Please note that if you turn to my last slides, slide number 12, labeled Full Year 2012 Pentair Outlook, that both the second quarter and full-year outlook do not include any future impact from the pending merger with Tyco International\u2019s Flow Control business, including the acquisition and acquisition-related costs as discussed earlier in the call.  ","For the full-year 2012, we are updating our previous revenue guidance to reflect the Q1 performance but importantly, maintaining our full-year operating profit targets and raising our full-year earnings outlook.  We now expect revenues to be up 6 to 8% to about $3.7 billion, reflecting a weaker Western Europe and the first quarter weather related sales shortfall.  ","Our operating income guidance range of $445 million to $470 million remains unchanged with the strong start in Q1 lead by increased productivity, better price cost performance and prioritization of key global investments.  This operating performance should yield 50 to 80 basis points of margin expansion in 2012.  ","We continue to expect another solid year of EPS growth with earnings per share at 2.65 to 2.80, up 10 to 16%, which reflects the first quarter results and a modestly higher diluted share count. ","We expect free cash flow in 2012 to be at least 100% of that income.  Furthermore, we are still targeting a greater-than-60 basis point increase in ROIC by the end of 2012 as we drive to improve returns for our shareholders.  ","Now, let me turn it back over to Randy for the summary on Slide 13. ","Randy Hogan","Thanks, John.  The start of the year showed great Pens execution and nice growth in our business.  Growth in initiatives are yielding results with increasing contributions from Agriculture, Energy and Industrial Process where we\u2019ve been investing in innovation from global capabilities.  Greater productivity and operating efficiencies should fuel continued margin expansion.  A key measure of progress and execution is ROIC, which is fast approaching double digits, a significant mark for Pentair.  ","We believe we\u2019re well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable profitable growth in 2012.  With that, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.  Simon, could you come back on and open the line?  ","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator instructions).  Your first question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse, your line is open.","Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Good morning, thank you.  The first question is just on revenue \u2013 on your revenue expectations. I\u2019m just trying to understand, you know, how much of this was timing and how much is incremental weakness in Europe and some of your other markets because, you know, guidance isn\u2019t really changing but it seems like the moving parts are. So I\u2019m just trying to better understand that.","John Stauch ","","Let me start with the flood-related piece.  As Randy mentioned in his comments, it was about $15 million. If we go back six, seven years, we average anywhere in the flood SKUs in Q1 between 45 and $50 million. We were close to the $30 million level and obviously that\u2019s related to the lack of snow and the lack of melt. ","I just remind you that that\u2019s retail related, primarily, and it doesn\u2019t come with huge margins.  So even though it\u2019s a headline as far as the sales, you know, it was something we were able to handle within the operating income performance. ","As Randy mentioned, we were able five points lighter in Europe. You know, for us that was 15 million-ish and most of that was in Technical Products versus forecast. Again, not one of our higher-margin product lines, but those two things, as we move throughout the year, the flood is unique to Q1.  I mean, there is a mild flood season that occurs in Q3 from hurricanes, but that\u2019s not of the magnitude that we see in Q1.  And Europe gets easier on a year-over-year comparison basis, you know, as Q1, to Q2, 3 and 4 last year was on a downward slide.  So these year-over-year headwinds get a little easier for us to handle. ","And finally, we were a little bit off in fast growth, but a little bit of that was strategic in the sense that we were identifying that some of our sales and products into those products were finding them way back into Europe and North America, as normal, in distribution businesses. So we adjusted our SKUs and our product lines reflect that.  And we, once again, know that that corrects itself at Q2.  So, you know, as you kind of look at the Q1 headline growth and we look at those trends in Q2 to Q4 we see the flood turning around completely and the Europe piece easing and the fast growth accelerating.","Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse","","All right, that\u2019s very helpful.  And then on your North American residential businesses, maybe if you could comment on where you think we are in the cycle there.  I know we\u2019ve been in a downturn for a while.  It seems like the pool business is doing well, [inaudible] filtration may be mixed. You know, how much of that business is replacement versus new?  Are you seeing a turn there? Anything you can give us color on in that business.","Randy Hogan","","We think, basically, it\u2019s over 80%, it\u2019s all replacement now.  You know, and we characterize it as [inaudible] on the bottom. As we think about U.S. residential from our perspective there\u2019s three different market drivers. If you take a look at what\u2019s driving pool, it\u2019s the fact that people that have homes or in homes or even if they\u2019re buying homes and they maintain their pool and because of the innovated products we have to save energy, to save chemicals, it\u2019s a really compelling economic justification and there\u2019s over 30 utilities now that are rebating upgrades of those products. ","So it\u2019s really innovations in a market that has money. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving pool and so, you know, there is an increase we\u2019ve seen at the markets of some pools builts, which is nice. But I think it\u2019s really the innovation and the demographics of continued growth in the south where people have pools is \u2013 we\u2019re back to that. ","Then there\u2019s the, what I would call the, flow business, it really is more related to replacement, it\u2019s probably closer to 90% replacement right now. We\u2019ve, for us \u2013 for ourselves, you know, we had a few years of lost market share and that was corrected in 2011 and we had slight uptick and I think we\u2019re in a very good position now in residential flow. ","Admittedly we do have a weather affect that we just talked about. And then finally there on the filtration side, that really does tie \u2013 the water softener business and the filtration ties closer to what I would call a discretionary spend in a house or a housing start related, which is why we see that softener affect right now. And we weren\u2019t counting on a turnaround right there, that\u2019s why that business actually performed well versus expectations in the first quarter despite the fact that sales were down.  And we\u2019re introducing innovations there that could really change the game with Hybrid DI. ","So we weren\u2019t counting on a residential recovery in 2012, and I would say we were right about that, even though housing prices look like they at least, the last report they were stabilizing. You know, it is the more stable market today, but we\u2019re, again, not counting on a big step up from housing starts this year. Nevertheless, we think all three of the businesses we have in residential are going to perform well this year.","Hamzah Mazari \u2013 Credit Suisse","All right that\u2019s very helpful, appreciate it, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citigroup, your line is open.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","","Thank you, good morning.  As we get ready to anniversary CPT, you called out a couple of interesting data points in terms of the performance in the quarter and I wanted to start first with doubling U.S. sales, and that was the big opportunities since CPT had lost their distributor.  And so now, just kind of refresh us on the go-to market strategy and when you say double sales, is that a channel fill or you\u2019re actually getting a sell through?","Randy Hogan","","It\u2019s mostly project business.  So let me just back up, Deane. CPT had lost earlier basically their market partner in Ionics when GE bought them, which really took them out of the water space. We\u2019ve had some modest success in the U.S. in the water space, but right now the water spending is still pretty low. The real driver that we\u2019ve picked up is in dairy and beverage.  And what we did is we took the sales force and we really focused it and said,  it\u2019s a direct sale, it\u2019s a project sales business, it\u2019s selling, you know, a whole array of products that we have from the valves to MBR\u2019s to CO2 recovery to diagnostic equipment. And by focusing the team there and then beefing up that team and really building better strategic relationships, our hit rate is going up and it\u2019s exciting. You know we\u2019ve talked about the Anaerobic MBR plant, we\u2019ve got to go down there and take some folks down there, which we\u2019re really excited about.  But we\u2019ve had some great wins in the brewing industry and we have more than we expect. So it\u2019s really \u2013 what I would call it, it\u2019s really more technical selling and investing and focusing on the food and beverage side. And we\u2019re improving the relationships on the water side.  We\u2019ve had a couple nice winds, but again the market rate there is not really recovered and it will be tough until municipalities have built a little bit better cash flow.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","","And the backlog being up 50%, I don\u2019t really \u2013 you don\u2019t think of CPT as a big like longer-recycle backlog business.  Is this related to project timing, can you size that for us please?","Randy Hogan","","Well, we think, and you know certainly going forward we\u2019re going to talk more about backlog and more about origin sales. They are more of a \u2013 they do sell cartridges, you know, they sell membranes but a lot of them get sold in projects.  And so I would say over half of their business is longer cycle. ","They were a little disappointing in sales in the quarter but on orders they blew it out. So we\u2019re talking about right now just on the filtration side, them going from 100 to $150 million in backlog, which is a meaningful level of backlog improvement. And then we took the smaller pump piece and put it with flow technology and that\u2019s up, as I said earlier; those are up 12% in orders even though the sales are flat. We\u2019re going to talk more about that.","Deane Dray- Citigroup","","Great, any update on the endocrine inhibitor, the new products that you talked about earlier in the \u2013 last year? ","Randy Hogan","","Yes, you know, we talked earlier about the Phase I of the nanofilters, which is focused on Silica and, you know, we caught Alpha. So we\u2019ve got an Alpha launch on that and that\u2019s where we\u2019re, you know, we\u2019ve sold these products in India and we\u2019ll have a Beta launch which is the next step before the full commercial launch because it is a technical sale in the third quarter. ","We\u2019ll also have \u2013 the next phase is focused on color and clarity, and that product will launch by the first quarter of next year.  And then the endocrine, which is the most technically advance, we\u2019ll have that in what we would call Alpha test in the first quarter of 2013. So we\u2019re going in that sequence as we have talked about before. And we like the Silica application but the commercial opportunities in color and clarity and endocrine disruptors are much bigger. So we\u2019re keenly focused on getting there.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","","That\u2019s great to hear.  And just last question for me if I could. One of the things we learned in our visit to Aquatech last fall is your focus on building skidded systems as opposed to selling individual pumps is, just refresh us, where is that \u2013 is that business in the treatment process side of water, how big are the skidded systems today, and a little bit about the engineering know how in putting those together.","Randy Hogan","","Right, as you know we were in that business before we bought CPT.  And one of the things we wanted to do \u2013 let me answer your question.  It\u2019s largely on the water side. So it\u2019s water treatment and it could be both for drinking water and for wastewater.  So largely, those are the skid systems. We do some systems work as well in food and beverage and some of those are skidded, but the ones we\u2019ve talked about and showed were largely on the water and wastewater side. ","So what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019re focused on trying to drive to more of a manufacturing standard on these skidded systems so that we have standard products and we\u2019ve raised the content of the product. ","As I said, the water business has been slower than the food and beverage business but we\u2019re making progress in terms of improving the margins in that business and importantly, skids aside, we\u2019re also focused on building straight X-Flow membrane sales to other people that play in that space, which I\u2019m very encouraged in, which while they\u2019re still brand at X-Flow, is along the lines of the strategy to try and improve our private label branding, if you will. ","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","","Great, thank you.","Randy Hogan","","Thanks, Deane.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Lucas with Janney Capital Markets, your line is open.","Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","","Thanks, good morning, all.  ","Randy Hogan","Good morning, Jim.  Bigger picture question, you know, if you look at the first year of owning CPT as the integration has gone along can you talk about lessons learned, both the pros and the cons in terms of Pentair having this long history of being an inquisitive company, just what you taken away from CPT integration process.","Randy Hogan","","My first \u2013 the first thing I\u2019d say is, I really do believe we\u2019re getting to the point where applying Pens to business as standard work. I\u2019m really \u2013 we\u2019ve raised \u2013 I toured two factories and they both gave me capital plans when I first toured them because they were out of capacity. Neither of those plants \u2013 we didn\u2019t have to spend any capital and we\u2019ve increased the capacity in those two plants by 20%. ","So we really are getting good at applying the inside the four walls lean enterprise. So that\u2019s the first item I\u2019d say, the second learning is that we\u2019re getting better at combining in the marketplace, in the sales. Just in this quarter we had $2 million of sales that I can identify in just on the Flow side, the Pump side. $2 million of business from the combined efforts of CPT and our Flow business and our legacy Pentair flow business and that\u2019s, you know, if you will, the legacy Pentair folks are selling an [inaudible] product or vice versa. So you know, those examples I talked about, [inaudible] and Romania and Kuwait, those are examples of both of those and Nihouse and Fairbanks Morris product being sold by the alternate sales force. ","So those are positive.  I think the other learning is technology is very, very exciting and the food and beverage business is very, very exciting. As we get deeper into that we see more and more opportunities to apply it. ","And the \u2013 I guess the last thing is, you know, as we\u2019ve talked about before, their margins at the start were a little weaker than what we would\u2019ve liked but we\u2019re still committed to get them to the double-digit level as soon as we can.","Jim Lucas \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","","Okay that\u2019s very helpful.","John Stauch ","","And Jim, I\u2019m just going to add to that.  I mean, clearly understanding, and we knew it going in, but we learned that as you see a business that\u2019s for sale like that, you might have projects in the backlog that don\u2019t have the margins that you would historically like and you know we\u2019ve burned those off now and as we mentioned we\u2019re positioning more towards industrial, a little left to municipal, which for them we\u2019re easier to win. So I mean, those are things that are worked through as a year anniversary and we\u2019re ready to go now.","Randy Hogan","","It\u2019s a good point and actually if I could weave that \u2013 your answer back to Deane\u2019s question as well in terms of that systems business \u2013 standard systems business. You got to make money in systems and so what John was saying was there was a lot of systems in the backlog without much margin in them and we\u2019ve corrected both the pricing and the costing on that and getting in place disciplines to basically check the as-built versus as-bid profitability to ensure execution.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","","Okay.  And then a two-part questions, just a more of a housekeeping related.  One, in tech products, the end of last contracts, how many more quarters does that run.","Randy Hogan","","One more.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","","One more, okay.  And then secondly, you know, you talked a lot about India, Southeast Asia, could you give us an update on what you\u2019re seeing in China specifically right now.","Randy Hogan","Well, China was lower in the quarter than it has been.  But we still expect it \u2013 that was one of the places \u2013 that was the place that John was referring to when he talked about getting better channel discipline in place so that we don\u2019t get any back channel cross zone.","John Stauch","","But Jim, India was up north of 25% percent worth in the quarter overall. Brazil and Latin America still strong, Middle East very robust, Southeast Asia would be more in the mid-single digit level at the moment.  And China, absent of that particular SKU changer back channel I mentioned, would\u2019ve been up nearly double digits.  So not quite 20 but, you know, still doing pretty well as far as north of DGP. So I still think these are huge fast growth regions for us. I think we\u2019re well positioned with localized manufacturing, localized design, localized marketing now, and I think we\u2019re positioned to see these in the 10 to 15% range for the year.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","","You\u2019re next question comes from the line of Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer, your line is open.","Chris Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","","Thanks, good morning.  ","Randy Hogan","Hi, how are you? ","Chris Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Good, thanks.  Just wanted to look at the water margin in a little more detail, some upside to your guidance despite revenues, distinctly little on the light side. Just wondering if this is reflecting CPT a little crisper operationally out of the gate here than maybe expected or initially committed to?","John Stauch","","Yes I think as we mentioned the margins in CPT are improving, that\u2019s indicative of what we\u2019re seeing as far as anniversering and seeing the expansion.  And it has a lot to do with the types of products we\u2019re winning and the type of project we\u2019re delivering on. Also we are seeing a mixed benefit on these flood sales that aren\u2019t going to be there. I mean they are lower margins so we are getting a little kicker on that.","Randy Hogan","","And price realization was good, and I think our supply team is doing a better job of managing inflation.","Chris Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","","And second quarters looking like a heck of a free cash flow quarter. Just wondering if you have plans to kind of apply that to debt in the near term?","John Stauch","","Yes, and I know, Q2 seasonally is our quarter and it\u2019s primarily from what we do in the early buy in pool and then we collect that cash in Q2, that\u2019s why we see that seasonality and the all-near term applications will be to continue to pay down the debt.","Chris Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","","Okay and then last one just on the interest expense just a little light on the quarter, what factored there?","John Stauch","","Yes, there was a little bit, call it roughly about a half a million related to the tax benefits, you know, the accured interest you have on those particular accruals. And the rest is just a little bit lower debt assumptions, being debt and interest.","Chris Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","","Okay, so it that a run rate going forward, the first quarter then?","John Stauch","","I would think no, I think the tax is not a run rate but if you just add that half a million back to where we\u2019re at that\u2019s about the run rate.","Chris Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.  Your lines is open. ","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hey, good morning.  ","Randy Hogan","","Hey, Jeff. ","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Just back to the issues in Western Europe and fast-growth markets that were weaker, I mean, I guess on Western Europe, what gives you confidence that that starts to normalize.  I mean, a lot of companies have talked about certainly some stabilization, but still some consternation in that market.  And just a finer point on that, on the China, you know, strategic move, is that just a one quarter dynamic or could that leak? ","John Stauch","","Let me \u2013 I\u2019ll take the first part and then I\u2019ll let Randy comment in addition.  Just to give some color, you know, we saw, if you recall in Q3 and Q4 of last year, Europe got a little bit weaker in water.  It was still decently strong in Technical Products.  If we kind of take a look at where we are in Q1, the year-over-year delta in water has moderated substantially and Tech Products saw nearly a 15% decline.  Now, I\u2019m not saying water\u2019s an indicator, I\u2019m just saying that we saw it in the distribution channel on water first and we\u2019re starting to see the year-over-year pressure ease.  ","And as far as the things in China, yes, that is a one-quarter.  And I would say they\u2019re every several years, I mean, every once in a while our pricing gets a little challenged and we take a look at our global product lines and our distribution and we make sure that we\u2019re not seeing any of that back channel come through.  And a couple product lines in China, we\u2019re seeing them and hearing from customers that they were coming into Europe and North America so we adjusted. ","Randy, do you have anything you want to add in Western Europe? ","Randy Hogan","","Well, I mean, I think you said it well.  In fact, Technical Products saw it a little bit later and given the amount of exports they serve, they serve a lot of customers that export out of Europe.  We\u2019re counting on as big of decline, which was \u2013 it was a double digit decline in the quarter.  So you know, hence the adjustment we\u2019ve made in the rest of the year to reflect that.  They believe they have a handle on it now and they\u2019re adjusting their cost to protect margins and that\u2019s going to pace.  That was really the only place we were surprised by Western Europe.  We had it nailed really in the first quarter on the water side.  And I think we got \u2013 we got a better look at it in Technical Products. ","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, and then along the same lines, I mean, it seems like a lot of these things that kind of went against you were lower margin and some of the things that maybe worked in your favor from a variance were favorable margins.  So I just want to understand on the margin upside, you know, how much of that is mix versus surprise to the upside on productivity? ","John Stauch ","","You know, first of all, we locked in a third of the productivity as both Randy and I mentioned on the repositioning, actions we took last year.  So I\u2019d say that\u2019s reading out.  Okay.  Second, we\u2019re prioritizing our strategic growth investments to reflect those businesses in those programs that are working.  ","As Randy and mentioned, both on the CPT side, we feel better about the projects that we\u2019re winning and how we\u2019re delivering them.  And so I think the mix had a small impact on Q1, but you know, I want to remind everybody, I mean, we\u2019ve always said that we\u2019ve got excess capacity in residential today in North America and when any form of recovery or growth comes on that side, we\u2019re going to see higher productivity and higher margins on what was historically a very profitable side of our business.  ","So when we see pool shipments and we see any form of uptick on where we are in residential filtration, that\u2019s going to have nice healthy margins to it.  ","Jeff Hammond \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, thanks. ","John Stauch","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.  Your line is open. ","Brian Konigsberg \u2013 Vertical Research","Yes, hi.  Good afternoon, gentlemen.  Just coming back to the pool results in the quarter, obviously very good.  You mentioned weather as a contributing factor, but really didn\u2019t emphasize it whereas maybe listening to some of the pool distributors, you know, they kind of emphasized it more and thought there would be more of a kind of \u2013 there was a pull-forward affecting Q1, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you see that.  Do you attribute that dynamic to winning more distributors throughout the year or maybe you could just give us some context around this comment. ","Randy Hogan","","Yes, I mean, clearly, the pool year started earlier.  When you open a pool, you \u2013 it really drives chemicals and it drives, you know, the startup, you\u2019re putting your shock in the pool, a lot of chlorine, ozone in.  You\u2019re not changing out equipment unless it broke.  So our distributors sell a lot of chemicals, so that\u2019s one difference between what they say and what we say.  ","The second point is these upgrades, which they benefit from too, are ones that can sustain.  And when a pool \u2013 when the pool season starts early, it usually means it\u2019s going to be a good one.  You know, for instance, in the Northeast, the old rule is, if someone\u2019s thinking about putting a pool in, if you don\u2019t have one hot sweltering weekend before Fourth of July, it\u2019s lousy for the pool business.  We\u2019re expecting \u2013 we\u2019re seeing a return to sort of those kinds of dynamics.  I think clearly, you know, when we get an 18% growth in the pool business in the first quarter, and we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll sustain at that level, we think we\u2019ll sustain at a pretty high level.  We expect it to be good.  ","And you know, when we add 145 dealers, the reason we\u2019re getting those dealers is we have the most compelling suite of products.  We\u2019ve got 35 \u2013 we personally don\u2019t, but there are 35 utilities around the country that are meaningfully rebidding the products that we have the best products.  ","So those dealers are coming to us because of the solutions we have.  Once we get them, we get all of that they sell usually.  So that\u2019s why I call it a beautiful thing, momentum is really something.  ","As we look out in the channels right now, we believe inventory is pretty low.  So we don\u2019t believe that they\u2019re over inventories.  We think there will be good sell through.  ","Brian Konigsberg \u2013 Vertical Research","And just going to the balance sheet, I notice that inventories actually picked up quite a bit, a little bit more than you would expect even though Q1 typically is a stronger quarter for inventories, but it was a bit higher than even what seasonality would call for.  Can you give us a little bit insight to what\u2019s going on there? ","John Stauch","","Yes. I think I\u2019ll answer with two quick things.  One is some of the project backlog that Randy mentioned, as you know, as the backlogs grow, our inventory level is going to grow, as we need that demand. ","Second of all, there\u2019s probably a little bit of pro-channel and retail-related sump pumps in the channel.","","Randy Hogan","","We were ready for that extra $15 million.  Our service levels are superior to everybody else when it comes to flood, and we maintain inventory, and what doesn\u2019t see through, it stays on our books. So it\u2019s way off  next couple quarters.","Brian Konigsberg \u2013 Vertical Research","","Yes, the guidance provided in Q2, is that reflecting some of that liquidation of inventory there?","John Stauch","","No, it\u2019s primarily more the liquidation of the pool, as I mentioned earlier, which will be reflected in the pool sales.","Brian Konigsberg \u2013 Vertical Research","","Okay, great, thank you very much.","John Stauch","","Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with the UBS.  Your line is open.","Robert Barry \u2013 UBS","","Hi, guys.  Good morning.","John Stauch","","Hi, how are you.","Robert Barry \u2013 UBS","","Good, thanks.  Thanks for taking the questions.  Just a couple of things.  One, I wanted to clarify the comments earlier on the residential new construction.  It sounds like you\u2019re not seeing a significant lift from it, and I know you may be weren\u2019t planning for it, but housing starts are up a lot, albeit off a very low base.  So is it just that we\u2019re not kind at some critical mass level yet, or there not being started in the right places, just a little more color on that would be helpful.","Randy Hogan","","There up, but when replacement is 80 to 90% where it used to be 50, you know until you get to a million housing starts a year, you know, you\u2019re not really at a normal level. What\u2019s nice is our distributors are actually back to a more normal stocking levels, and so that\u2019s good.  ","On the water softener side, people don\u2019t have to put them in.  You only need water softener in certain areas of the country, and it\u2019s something that you can put off if you need to.","John Stauch","","And Rob, a couple of things, it\u2019s John. First of all we look at single family housing starts, so I\u2019d look at those numbers, and even though they\u2019re bouncing around, it\u2019s nothing to get excited about what those growth rates are.","Second of all, we thought for sure you\u2019d love that Shingo prize, so.","Robert Barry \u2013 UBS","","Congratulations on that.","John Stauch","","Thank you.  I appreciate that. ","Robert Barry \u2013 UBS","","I wanted to also then just clarify on what\u2019s happening with tech products in Europe.  It sounds like on the water side things have gotten a little better in Europe and where the deterioration was versus last quarter was on tech product, and I think you said it was down 15%.  Do you have any sense of how much of that was destocking versus market demand, etc.","Randy Hogan","","Technical products is largely direct to customer, as opposed through distribution.  So it was really the reduction and market demand.  You know, these are going to control builders or equipment builders largely in Germany and Poland, and France.  So their business was down, and generally they don\u2019t stock a lot.  So I think its direct demand in that department.","Robert Barry \u2013 UBS","","And then just finally, I think you mentioned fast growth now for the year up 10 to 15% roughly?  Is that excluding CPT benefit?","Randy Hogan","","This is just the organic.  Obviously when you put CPT in there, it\u2019s much higher, much higher rate.","Robert Barry \u2013 UBS","","Okay. Thank you.","Randy Hogan","","Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.  Your line is open.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Thanks. Just a couple of clarifications.  Hey John, did you recalibrate currency in the forecast at all, and if so, any significant impact there to note?","John Stauch","","No. What we usually do is we take wherever the ending rate is, and that\u2019s kind of how we look at the currency, assuming we\u2019re not any better at predicting it then the market.  So, it\u2019s right around that 130,131 rate, and that doesn\u2019t create a significant delta to the prior forecast.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Okay, and so just then transition that into the discussion on water organic.  I guess it looks you\u2019ve gone from 6 to 8 from 7 to 10 on the organic for water. Is that right?","John Stauch","","You\u2019re rate for water, yes on the organic that\u2019s about right. If you break that it will be about 2 point to price, and about 4 to a little north of in value.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","And then, I wonder if you can just give us some collars to, for the segments, preferably the old but I kind of expect the new, around that 6 to 8 around the 4, however you want to give it to use in terms of just the organic expectations.","John Stauch","","Yes, I think flow is clearly going to be, you know, the lower single digits. Call it 4 to 5.  You know, driven by obviously agriculture being substantially in the double digits, and as Randy mentioned we\u2019re not expecting to recover this retail portion in flood pumps. If you think of the organic of our treatment business, clearly we\u2019re expecting double digit organic with obviously CPT and the old filtration solutions leading the way there, and water purification in low single digits. Still seeing nice fast growth penetration, and not seeing anything substantial in North America residential side.  And then aquatic probably just south of double digits or right around double digit growth organically.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Did you take aquatic up for the year or no?","John Stauch","","Yes, maybe a point.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay.  Is there anyway of characterizing the margin, may be you did and I missed it, in water in the first quarter excluding CPT?","Randy Hogan","","It would be up around 80 to 100 bases points including CPT.","Terry Darling \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Super, thanks very much","Sara Zawoyski","","We\u2019ll do a quick check on time, just given the time here, how many people do we have left in the queue?","Operator","","We currently have three remaining in the queue.","John Stauch","","Okay, we\u2019ll take all three and we\u2019ll just go quickly with our answers.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies & Company.  Your line is open.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies & Co. ","","Hi. Good morning.  So, I just wanted to maybe ask a more holistic question here.  If you look over the last four quarters at the companies average organic sale growth is averaged in the 2 to 3% territory.  And the second quarter guidance suggest 5 maybe something a little bit lower than that and your targets 7.  A target which I think personably is reachable given your portfolio and the megatrends and all that.  What\u2019s missing?  Why are we able to may be skirt of these individual quarter issues, and put on a couple of points just from some of these trends that are out there wherever they might be.  Is the situation with the company just needs to may be hatch more organic growth projects?  It just seems that there\u2019re so many opportunities you\u2019ve laid out that we shouldn\u2019t be where we are now.","Randy Hogan","","First of all, you know, to your point, we got a couple of points headwind from Western Europe. Okay, so we\u2019ll just say that\u2019s a big market, that\u2019s down mid-teens or double digit, it\u2019s hard to overcome that completely.","The second one is right now CPT is still going through acquisitions, and as soon as CPT comes back into the core, you know, that\u2019s a business that we expect to grow 15 to 20% on an annual basis, and their growth is being reflected in the acquisition line right now.  So, clearly I agree with you. I mean we still feel water is, you know, high single digits on an annual growth basis aided by fast growth and it being better position to serve the new new world as Randy mentioned.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies & Co. ","","My question was, what\u2019s missing within all that?  Why isn\u2019t it a little faster.  I mean, I understand CPT is going to\u2026","Randy Hogan","","CPT is mid-teens growth.  It\u2019s not yet in our organic growth rate.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies & Co. ","","But where we had a higher organic growth rate a year ago target, before CPT was part of the business, it just seems that you have a lot opportunity, and there just doesn\u2019t seem to be a connection to all that opportunity.","Randy Hogan","","Couple things: Not getting any help from North American, which is North American Residential, which is still a good chunk of where we are in our water revenue. And as I mentioned we got 2 point for headwind from Western Europe. But I think core and aligning growth is definitely in line with what we expected to be in. And I think given the prioritization portfolio, I totally expect to be back there in a couple of quarters.","Scott Graham \u2013 Jefferies & Co. ","","Okay, Randy thanks.","Randy Hogan","","Thank you, Scott","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Drab with William Blair. Your line is open.","Brian Drab \u2013 William Blair","","You guys still sure that you want to continue the call?","John Stauch","","No problem.","Brian Drab \u2013 William Blair","","I\u2019ll just ask one quick question, most of mine have been answered.  Regarding the tax benefits in the quarter, can you help me bridge from this 13% rate to the 20% rate, counting the adjustments, and then from the 20% rate to the 29% rate that you said would have been the effective tax rate in the presentation?","Randy Hogan","","I mean first of all we think our effective rate could be the rest of the year estimates will be closer to 28 to 29% reflecting incremental tax planning, which are those permit things that you can do to help your tax rate. An unprecedented amount of settlements in the quarter, you know, these are accrual. None of them, you know, more than a half a million and we settled the 2005 to 2009 audits, and went through the appeals process.  As Randy mentioned, this certainly wasn\u2019t forecasted.  It all came to use in Q1.  And then the only difference between what we put in adjust and reported is we take a look back at where we took the accrual, and if we didn\u2019t take the accrual in the adjusted earnings category we released the accrual down and reported, so it doesn\u2019t impact where we took it and where we released it.  So, if I bridge that for you it\u2019s about 4 \u00bd in the difference between reported\/adjusted, and then you can take the difference between the tax rate and it\u2019s roughly just south of 7 million of favorable tax items in Q1.","Brian Drab \u2013 William Blair","","Okay, great.  Thanks.","John Stauch","","I wish I could forecast them, but you just can\u2019t.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of David Rose with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","","Good afternoon.","John Stauch","","Hi David.","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","","Hi, how are you.  Two quick questions.","One is on, if there were any specific actions taken to accelerate the improvement in margins to offset the topline weakness in the quarter?  (inaudible) pretty clearly about what took place, but was there anything specific when you looked at the shortfall in revenues and said \u201cLet\u2019s accelerate this item\u201d.  Was there anything of that nature that took place?","Randy Hogan","","No. It was that we, you know, we were targeting to get to get the price realization.  We were targeting productivity.  We had good readout, it was just basically good execution.  So, I would say that, you know, if in fact growth had come through, we would have beaten it by more than a penny, it would have been by a lot.","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","","That\u2019s what I was going to ask you.","Randy Hogan","","That\u2019s if we had gotten the revenue that we had thought.","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","","That\u2019s helpful.","John Stauch","","(inaudible) look out the window and you can see the flood impacts no happening, and as we mentioned earlier, that\u2019s not our highest margin item, so there wasn\u2019t a huge panic related to that level of fail ship. ","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","","So, you really built in a fair amount of cushion in the quarter to begin with?","Randy Hogan","","I wouldn\u2019t say we had a fair amount of cushion. I\u2019d say we had really good productivity. ","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","","And then lastly, I\u2019ve see some fairly impressive wins on the X-Flow pretreatment side of the business, and was wondering if there are any crossover selling benefits from those pretreatment sales into other parts of either a new house or Pentair, even extending up beyond into (inaudible) we start to see those mega project pickup in 2013.","Randy Hogan","","We do see that, you know, we now have a special line of housing that have been built for ","X-Flow so it\u2019s pulling through that directly.  There\u2019s other filters that can get sold in or around them helping us get better at that on the pumps around the larger projects. And, you know, on the smaller standard systems side, you know, we\u2019ve gone internally to X-Flow where we obviously we\u2019d buy them from other people before.","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","","So, even on some of those legacy contracts like, (inaudible), we could see some benefit on your side?","Randy Hogan","","Yes.  Even, as I mentioned, we have housing for the X-Flow but, you know, we\u2019ve gotten housings for the RO membranes, we don\u2019t make RO membranes. We\u2019re the leader in them now, and our hit rate in that has improved. As I mentioned our (inaudible) performance wasn\u2019t just CPT related, it was our core of total line business.  So we definitely, I believe it\u2019s helped us with (inaudible).","David Rose \u2013 Wedbush Securities","","Okay, thank you very much.","Randy Hogan","","Thank you.  Go ahead and wrap it up.","Operator","","There are no further questions at this time.  Speakers, do you have any closing remarks.","John Stauch","","No, just give them the replay.

I\u2019m starting on page 4. We are pleased with our second quarter results which came in at the high end of our expectations. The top line was consistent with our forecast and income and margins were slightly better than our expectations driven by strong execution and continued benefit from our cost-out actions.","Integration of ERICO is meeting our expectations, we remain on track to meet or exceed the $10 million in synergies we targeted.","Free cash flow was once again a positive story and we\u2019re very pleased with our performance here. For the first half of the year we\u2019ve generated $304 million in free cash which is over a $150 million better than what we delivered in the first half of last year. We\u2019re updating our full year adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $4.05 to $4.20 which is bringing a nickel off the top end of the range. Valves & Controls have started to become more predictable, we\u2019re seeing the negative impact of sales mix in both Flow & Filtration Solutions and Technical Solutions.","Now I\u2019ll turn to slide 5 for discussion of our Q2 2016 results. Second quarter core sales declined 1% which is slightly better than our previously communicated expectations. Water Quality Systems delivered solid growth once again against the tough comparison, our Flow & Filtration Solutions felt the impact of continued difficult agriculture markets. The declined Valves & Controls sales moderated and Technical Solutions was flat compared to our expectation with a slight decline in the quarter. ERICO contributed positively with sales in-line with our expectations.","Segment increased 7% and return on sales expanded 30 basis points to 16.8%. Water quality systems saw 200 basis point expansion and Valves & Controls slightly beated second quarter income and margin commitments which were big steps up from the first quarter. Adjusted EPS grew 3% to $1.11 per share and was at the high end of our guidance of a dollar rate to an $11. As I mentioned previously free cash flow was very strong in the quarter.","Now let\u2019s turn to slide 6 for more detail on Pentair\u2019s Q2. Our sales performance was mix by vertical with strong growth in residential and commercial and infrastructure. We saw signs of stabilization industrial with a rate of decline continue to moderate and energy did not get worse. Food & Beverage was down in the quarter due to ongoing declines in agriculture who we believe our beverage business remains healthy. Our largest vertical residential and commercial saw 2% sales growth with strength in residential and water quality systems and ongoing strength in commercial in both Flow & Filtration Solutions and technical Solutions.","Well, ERICO\u2019s performance is not captured in core results yet, we would point out that commercial markets remain solid for it too. Infrastructure was positive once again led by continued growth in both North American Municipal Pumps and improved project activity in Process Filtration globally. We\u2019ve been looking for Flow & Filtration Solutions to see infrastructure growth this year which has played out as expected and we\u2019re encouraged that biding activity remains healthy as well.","The rate of decline within Industrial moderated further and we believe that this our largest vertical appears to have found a bottom. There we\u2019re not looking for a second half rebound comparisons even in the second half and should reported results.","Food & Beverage declined for the second consecutive quarter as Flow and Filtration Solutions continued to feel the impact of agriculture the decline to the double digit rate for us. Energy declined at a low double digit rate for the second consecutive quarter, but we expect energy sales to find a bottom in the second half based on the bottoming and sequential orders we\u2019ve experienced.","As you can see on the right hand side of the page, productivity remains strong and more than offset inflation. ERICO contributed strength to the bottom line and strong underlying performance in synergies.","Now let\u2019s turn to slide 7 for a look at water quality systems performance in Q2. Water quality systems delivered another strong quarter with 3% core sales growth. Although growth rate declined sequentially with the tough comparison as the second quarter last reflected slightly different timing in the North American cool season then what we\u2019re experiencing this year. Although timing is different, we believe the North American cool season remains very healthy. Water filtration grew sales 1% as both our residential filtration business and our food service business faced tough comps. Segment income grew an impressive 11% and return on sales expanded 200 basis points to 24.7%.","Robust operating leverage was the key contributor to margin expansion in the quarter. Timing of growth investments may mute the rate of margin expansion in the second half but we anticipate the prospects remain strong for water quality systems.","Now let\u2019s move to slide 8 for a look at Flow & Filtration Solutions. Flow & Filtration saw core sales decline 1%. We had anticipated the segment to return to growth in the second quarter and rather infrastructure growth came through as expected, but food and beverage performance was negatively impacted by very challenging agriculture sales. Water Technologies core sales declined 3% at strength in residential and commercial and infrastructure pump shipments were more than offset by double digit declines in irrigation pump shipments. This is very similar to what we saw last quarter in this business.","We expect both the residential and commercial and infrastructure businesses to see continued growth, irrigation headwinds will likely persist, this comparisons remain challenging given the drought conditions in the west that helped our sales last year. Core sales in Fluid Solutions declined 3%, well beverage returned to growth in the quarter and experienced strong orders growth as well. The precision spray presence was negatively impacted by the beleaguered agriculture markets.","Process filtrations up core sales growth of 10% as we continue to see momentum build from our focus on industrial water reuse solution and return to growth in infrastructure with some desalination investments. This business has some lumpiness given the timing of projects that we believe we continue to gain momentum from our focus on industrial water reuse.","Segment income and return on sales contracted modestly this negative mix weight on the segments results. We believe this is just a pause in the margin improvement journey in the Flow & Filtration Solutions and there is still a long runway ahead for further margin growth.","Now let\u2019s turn to slide 9 to discuss our Technical Solutions performed in the second quarter. Technical Solutions reported 32% sales growth for the quarter consisting a flat core sales growth and 1% headwind from FX and a 34% positive contribution from ERICO. Core sales in Enclosures declined 5% or encouraged by the stabilization in the daily order rate which reinforces our view to easier comparisons in the back half of the year.","Thermal Management delivered core sales growth of 7% helped in part by two projects in Canada that we previously discussed that are reaching completion. We\u2019ve talked this year about our Industrial Heat Tracing business continuing to win small projects and unfortunately we\u2019re seeing no sign of downstream MRO spending growth return yet. All the results of ERICO are captured as acquisition contribution, the business performed in-line with our expectations. As a reminder over 75% of ERICO\u2019s sales are into commercial end markets which remained very healthy in the quarter. We remain on track to deliver over $10 million in synergies for the year on top of the base business profitability which is performing as expected.","Segment income grew 30%, the return on sales contracted 60 basis to 20.6%. The margin contraction was isolated to our Thermal Management business as the growth we mentioned in projects versus higher margin MRO product sales negatively impacted mix. ERICO has performed as we had anticipated, Enclosures are seeing signs of stabilization. The performance of these two SPGs was not enough in the quarter to offset the impact of the negative mix experienced in Thermal Management on the ROS.","We\u2019re not expecting downstream MRO spending to rebound in the second and we expect this will undoubtedly have an impact on third quarter margins for Technical Solutions. So with ERICO and Enclosures performing as expected Technical Solutions remain well positioned long term.","Now let\u2019s move to slide 10 to discuss the Valves & Controls performance in Q2. For the second consecutive quarter Valves & Controls met or beat its forecast for both sales and margins. Even more the heavy lifting we\u2019ve done to right size the cost structure of the business read out in the nice gain and margin sequentially. And orders appear to have stabilized.","Valves & Controls reported a 13% decline in revenue with core sales down 11% and a 2% headwind from FX. Backlog was down 7% sequentially, which includes negative FX translation. Core orders were down 27% year-over-year against the tough comparison, but as stated we did see a flattening of orders sequentially. Core sales were down 6% in aftermarket and down 17% in projects. In line with our expectation, the aftermarket business remained weak as OpEx continue to be constrained along with CapEx at many customers. We believe the order funnel overall is beginning to strengthen, which reinforces our view that orders will bottom in the second quarter and will begin to expand near double digit rates sequentially starting in the third quarter.","The right half of the page shows second quarter segment income and return on sales, which both met our forecast. Return on sales of 10.1% was slightly ahead of our forecast and up significantly from the first quarter as our cost-out benefit registered in line with our previously communicated expectations. The Valves & Controls team has done a courageous job in realigning the business to reflect the significant energy industry reset. It executed in the cost side while aligning the business with the opportunities exists today and over the next several years. We continue to believe that Valves & Controls is well positioned for an eventual recovery in its end markets beginning in 2017 and will continue to enjoy rising margins sequentially even before that.","Now, let's move to slide 11 for look at Valves & Controls backlog. Much of the backlog decline we saw has come as a result of progress we're making in reducing our past dues. Last year we booked roughly 100 million in orders from projects greater than $5 million. However, we have not booked even one order greater than $5 million during the first half of 2016. Yet orders of bottoming out sequentially and as our customers sort out the spending plans, we expect to see a return of some larger projects. So we believe that the second quarter marks the bottom for orders and we're expecting orders to improve in the second half of the year from the depressed first half levels. For the past three quarters, the business has improved its forecasting capabilities and with aftermarket orders now approximating 55% of orders that should improve the margin mix.","We're encouraged with Valves & Controls meeting or beating its forecast on sales, orders and income for the second consecutive quarter. There has been tremendous progress made on right sizing the cost structure of the business and better alignment between sales and operations has improved forecasting and execution ability of the segment. We believe the order funnel will continue to strengthen and while the top line will not show it right away orders bottoming and margins improving show brighter days ahead. With that, I will turn the call over to John.","John Stauch","Thank you Andy, please turn to Slide number 12, titled balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the second quarter with $4.6 billion of net debt inclusive of cash on hand. This was an improvement from where we ended the year as we used our strong cash flows in the quarter to reduce our debt levels. As Randy mentioned earlier, free cash flow increased over 150 million during the first half of the year versus the comparable period last year. We continue to expect to deliver free cash flow greater than adjusted net income for the full-year.","Our ROIC ended the quarter at 9.6%. Our forecast for capital expenditures remains a 150 million as continue to invest in businesses that have earned the right to grow and drive standardization and productivity across the enterprise. We remain focused on generating strong cash flow and further debt reduction.","Please turn to Slide 13, labeled Q3, 2016 Pentair outlook. For the third quarter, we expect core sales be flat and total sales to increase 7% inclusive of FX head wins and a positive contribution from ERICO. As a reminder, we closed on the purchase of ERICO just before the end of Q3 last year. And starting in Q4, ERICO will be included in the core. On a core basis, we expect water quality systems to grow approximately 8%, while flow & filtration solutions is expected to see core sales decline approximately 1%.","Technical solutions is expected to be flat on a core basis and valves & controls is anticipated to see core sales decline 6%. We expect segment income to increase approximately 11% and return on sales to expand roughly 60 basis points to 16.7%. Below the operating line, we continue to expect the tax rate to remain around 20.5%, net interest in other to approximate $35 million and shares outstanding to be around a 183 million. We expect free cash flow to continue to be strong during the quarter.","Please turn to Slide 14, labeled full year 2016 Pentair outlook. As Randy at the beginning of the call, we have taken a nickel off of the top end of our range and our full year adjusted EPS outlook is now $4.05 to $4.20. For the full year, we expect core sales decline 1%, water quality systems full year core sales are anticipated to be up approximately 6%, which is slightly better than our prior forecast. We now expect flow & filtration solutions to see a core sales decline of 1% versus our prior forecast of modest growth for the full year. Technical solutions core sales expected to be flat for the full year, which is slightly better than our prior forecast.","Finally, valves & controls expected to see core sales decline of approximately 9%. We expect segment income to grow roughly 8% and return on sales to expand approximately 70 basis points to 16.3%. our revised forecast factors in slightly better operating performance from water quality systems and valves & controls, or technical solutions and flow & filtration solutions are expected to see margins impacted by negative mix related to unfavorable market conditions.","We anticipate full year corporate cost to be just under 90 million, net interest in other are roughly a 140 million and the share count to be roughly a 183 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow approximately 5% at the mid-point of the range. Finally, we remain on track to generate free cash flow in excess of adjusted net income for the full year.","Emily, can you please open the line for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Your line is open.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Good morning, guys.","Randall Hogan","Good morning, Shannon.","John Stauch","Good morning.","Shannon O'Callaghan","So, I guess maybe just start with current assessment of strategic views on valves & controls and given news items and also does the fact that executing so much better impact your view of set. How do you think about that currently?","Randall Hogan","Well, I'm not going to comment about speculation, if we have anything to say, we would have said it. But I'm really pleased with the progress. There is a lot of doubters, there is doubters in a lot of places about how well our actions would read out. And I think this was a proved quarter. And to go from the margins we had in the first quarter, the second quarter, and see the bottoming of orders, I'd say valves is a like has a like clear future today than it had in the first quarter.","John Stauch","Yes, and I would add. This is a great business in the difficult market condition and 2014, we're nearly 17% margins and roughly 400 million in segment income. And what we feel like is a trough year, we're still going to be 11.5% ROS. We're slugging through it, I mean, obviously seeing some sequentially bottom of the orders is a good sign and seeing the order funnels start to become a more robust time in Q3 and Q4 give us excitement that we can feel like we can start contributing more and more as we go forward in valves & controls.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. And then, maybe just within valves & controls but even technical and more broadly some things you're saying are bottoming. You talked about I think within valve's essential double-digit order increased sequentially in 3Q. But then there is other things like downstream you said you assume, you're not expecting any recovery. I guess, where do you expect sequential recovery and where do you think market is still going to remain depressed?","Randall Hogan","This is just a weird time. I mean, there's such a mix geographically and between verticals in terms of the growing and not growing and I think that reflects the greater uncertainly in the world. We feel really good about industrial and commercial, we feel like infrastructure is coming back with some momentum, as I mention the orders not only a sales op but orders act, order activity has remained up. And while the agriculture continued muted spending in agriculture, mutes our Food & Beverage like. We feel really good about food service a beverage overall.","So, we think a lot about what individuals are spending money on, is good, residential, commercial, food and beverage and even in industrial. The fact that we're getting to the point where we're seeing flattened daily order rates and industrial tells us that we're, that's why we are seeing the bottom there. We just don\u2019t expect it to increase a lot in the second half yet.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Randall Hogan","Thanks, Shannon.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC. Your line is open.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Randall Hogan","Good morning.","Deane Dray","Hey Randy, I was hoping you could expand on a comment you made in your opening remarks regarding that negative sales mix. I think you addressed it pretty clearly, you're on the Valves & Controls business. But I'd be interested in hearing where else you're seeing a negative mix as it relates to customers in this environment instead of buying such and such, they're opting for either a cheaper replacement. But how does it translate into your customer behavior into a negative mix this quarter?","Randall Hogan","Yes. Thanks Deane for asking that, so I can clarify. It's not the mix, the mix we're seeing is not mix between a customer saying buying a lower margin, lower performing product for the same application. It's specifically in flow and filtration, our Ag business has higher margins than our residential and commercial business. And so when Ag goes down and residential goes up, we get a negative mix. So, it isn\u2019t product substitution in application, it's just a mix of what's growing and what isn\u2019t. And in the Thermal business and technical solutions, again products MRO has high margins, project doesn't.","So, we actually expected MRO to come back, maybe that was Pollyannaish, probably was but it didn\u2019t, and therefore all the projects that we were happy about winning kind of overwhelmed margins for Thermal.","Deane Dray","And just to clarify, when you say in your reference Ag, this is irrigation pumps that you primarily exposed?","Randall Hogan","There is two pieces in there, both in inflow and filtration that we're talking about that have seen big negatives. One is irrigation and year-over-year it held up pretty well last year because we have pretty high share where there were droughts and then was a lot of activity drilling new wells because of the drought. We don\u2019t have that impact this year. And the second is in crop spray, where we had we've actually been listening to the graveyard a little bit because we've been not declining the shaft as the market, and this is largely OEMs and distribution where we sell these precision spray systems that are used in agriculture as well. And that market remains depressed.","Deane Dray","Thank you. And then on as unrelated topic. We had the opportunity last month to see Pentair as attractive new business in China for residential water treatment. So, this is a brand new market for us to see. And estimates reported like 20% to 30% growth annually and you all have being recognized as one of the leaders in this business, are basically mini RO systems for home appliances that are being bought by the rising middle class who just can't drink the water without boiling it. So, I haven\u2019t seen you talk about this opportunity before but we saw everyone's talking about it. Maybe you can talk about what the opportunity is, how it fits, what the ramp is and what kind of contribution you should expect?","Randall Hogan","Yes. I probably should talk about it more, stop fighting fires. What's really interesting is there is much more awareness about the importance of safe clean water among the middle class and the developing world than there is in the US and Europe. Now, for sad reasons, there is increasing awareness in the US. We say a bump in the US because of the concern about drinking water in cities and schools and we could see that in our orders. And we are the largest provider of equipment for residential water treatment and filtration in the world.","That business has been growing nicely. The little bit in China, we do have a nice exposure there, it has been lumpy because a lot of ours goes through distribution and it's been as credit has been harder to get there. Some of our distributors have had to slow down. But if you take a look at it over the last few years, it has been growing very substantially. And I move that business to Karl Frykman and his WQS team a couple of years ago because we were the largest player in that business but we weren\u2019t the best performing in that business. And we made huge progress under Karl's leadership in taking that order, filtration, that part.","It did water filtration, water filtration is made up of that residential and commercial and the foodservice piece, the Everpure brand, if you will. And a lot of the margin expansion you saw in WQS is actually because of the momentum we're gaining there. And we'll talk more about it.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Steven Winoker","Thanks and good morning folks.","Randall Hogan","Good morning.","Steven Winoker","And can maybe talk a little bit through the progress Bess is making in flow & filtration and kind of I mean it's still early days in many ways. But just talk about where you are in that task and how the quarter as you sort of look forward where you think this could head at least to over the next four quarters?","Randall Hogan","Yes. I think Bess' progress is good. I mean, no one was more disciplined, it was not getting growth in the second quarter than she will. And I think we need to get more traction and she believes we need to get more traction on the things we're investing in the grow. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised by what happened in irrigation. We need to be more intimate and close with the customer. And we need to keep driving on the areas that are working, like the shift to industrial water and capture as much of the infrastructure and rest as soon as possible.","We still believe that there is probably more growth opportunities in the offerings that she leads and the markets that she served and any other business we have. There's no reason FFS shouldn\u2019t be able grow and perform just like WQS.","Steven Winoker","And what are the biggest ones that jump out of you in that, beside sort of the in Chinese water, when we all saw over the last year?","Randall Hogan","Yes. Well, I mean, the infrastructure globally, there's a return to investments particularly in the [indiscernible] Moses and other water filtration on the municipal and the commercial scale. We have leading positions in advanced technologies for water we use, methane capture, CO2 capture for food & beverage and we're having promising early results, we need to flood this own and get more advanced in those businesses.","And also, just in terms of our membrane technology. I think there is too narrow of focus of where we're applying our technologies and we need to be planful about it but the opportunities for us to be if you well Pentair inside, on membranes in a lot of applications which we are component supplier to high value applications.","Steven Winoker","Okay and Randy if I could just come back at that Valves & Controls answer you gave earlier, I guess something come out little bit differently which is considering how you are thinking about Valves & Controls from kind of day one in terms of strategic fit with the rest of the portfolio and the opportunity, I mean to what extend is for getting price and everything else here, to what extend is the strategic fit of that segment important to how Pentair grows going forward in your mind and then the importance to the other segments or from some other perspective that would suggest that it's really still going to be worth more to you than somebody else.","Randall Hogan","Well, I see a good runway ahead for performance improvement there and what are we good at. We are good at performance improvement. So I think we have really turned the corner in the business. I am not going to strategy right here but it gives us great scale and it has great scale. I mean it's a large player in a large fragmented business and we speculated before on what needs to happen in industry we are not going to speculate anymore right now.","Steven Winoker","Alright, that's helpful. I got it. Thanks very much. I will pass it on.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Steve Tusa","Hi guys.","Randall Hogan","Hi Steve.","Steve Tusa","Thanks for the color on Chinese water business, I appreciate that. The tech product segment, the margins were cut there and you talked about mix is there any how do you look kind of price cost dynamics there and how much deal do you guys buy on an annual basis?","Randall Hogan","How many deals we buy in? A lot, I mean there is couple hundred million dollars Steve but I think we take a look at the technical solutions margins. It's really simply that there was expectation that we would see the MRO in the aftermarket product side which is a very, very high margin product line kind of basically not gravity and it was going to where they were planning on to be flat to up and it's down double-digits in Q2 and so we are seeing a margin squeeze between that products fall off and it was an expectation that that would rally in the second half and we have taken away that expectation to second half now and the anticipation that we are not going to see any recovery in the aftermarket side. We deferred that aftermarket. We covered it to 2017 and so that product decline of double-digit is really impacting the squeeze in the margins for technical solutions.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Got it. It's ritually the thermal stuff, I mean what are you seeing in the chain in technical I mean Wesco reported today pretty weak volume number and all these distributors and Rockwell talked about push outs in their business. So what are you seeing in the - you talked about the stabilization but -for Enclosures, for the core Enclosures business?","Randall Hogan","Yes, for the core Enclosures we did see, we have seen stabilization in our daily order rate and it's interesting there is quite a mix of what we are learning from what distributors are saying and clearly ones that are deeply industrial facing are facing more challenges than one more balanced are skewed towards commercial and we do serve multiple market. So maybe that's why we are seeing the flat.","Steve Tusa","Okay and then one last question just on Valves, does the order I know like things bottom sequentially but I mean historically I think seasonally Q2 kind of an average single business in the world is better than first quarter so not sure what that tells us I think you said double-digit increase sequentially in the third quarter, something that the order comp year-to-date probably? Sorry.","Randall Hogan","Double digit.","Steve Tusa","Yes, double-digit. Okay. So that kind of brings the year-to-date probably year-over-year to down still down double-digit does that change the complexion of how you are feeling about 2017 or does this sequence to the sequential dynamics now kind of like really make feel maybe little worse in 2Q but better in 3Q make you feel like you are still on track for that kind of flat EBITD type of hope for 2Q for 2017.","John Stauch","Yes Steve, I think what we feel is that we have got a fairly high past two backlogs that we are still working on from standpoint of on time delivery roughly 70% not great by any standard I mean not horrible in the industry but not great by Pentair standard. So we are working at past two backlogs that's helping revenue. When you take a look at the orders and what Randy mentioned not getting any large orders it means that our conversion ratio is going to be higher. So we feel like as we head into 2017 even ending the year with lower orders in 2016, we think our conversion ratio is going to get back to historical norms which is around 51% of orders that are booked in the year and shipped in that year. That trough last year around 43% so I think we feel like we are starting to get that mix up as we mentioned with more aftermarket standard and so we feel like right now 2017 is an up year versus 2016 for me from the income side for sure. And orders will continue to rally in 2017 from this point the way we are looking at.","Randall Hogan","Exactly and the other thing I would add is that we have really fixed funnel, we are looking at has been cleansed, high quality.","Steve Tusa","Pretty attractive for any buyer out there. Thanks a lot guys.","Randall Hogan","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie","Hi, thanks. Good morning guys. I am going to ask Steve's questions slightly differently. And so, if you look at your expectation for double-digit sequential order growth that would imply that your orders for the second half of the year were down call it like roughly mid single-digits. Comps would kind of get you to down mid tens and so there is underlying improvement embedded in that number and I am just wondering like did the things get much better, is the quarter progress and what\u2019s given you the confidence in the underlying improvement in the order number in the second half of the year?","John Stauch","Yes, I hit on this in Analyst Day last year and then we have had several sessions with the business since. But we have a fairly sizable project contribution as we worked our way through the 2014 and 2015 timeframe and as Randy mentioned not having a single order greater than $5 million over the last several quarters means that we have got a rich backlog or rich funnel of shorter cycle orders, higher margins. So I think where we are is that we do believe we are going to start to see some projects and we are working on those on the funnel and those will be contribution but if you look at the order rates and the order levels absence of those large project orders is actually a pretty good contribution and so when you think about that as a base and that base moving fairly stable, any orders on top of that gives you great excitement that we are going to start to see a ramp from here.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. Okay but is there like any specific end markets that are driving these improvements?","John Stauch","Yes, we are starting to see the downstream investment again. The OpEx has been turned off for some period of time. We are starting to see a fair amount of aftermarket consolidation. So our customer spending with the scale providers which gives us great excitement of being the largest valves supplier in our space that we are going to see a lot more aftermarket consolidation and that's a big growth opportunity for us. And then, we also are back in the game in the Middle East and we are starting to see order contribute to the Middle East where we have been out of that game for some time.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, alright. Maybe one follow-up and it looks done a really nice job on the tech solution side, I guess the question I have is you saw a little bit margin degradation this quarter on flat growth. Your expectation for the back half of the year is for growth to be down from margins to flatten and actually improve versus 2Q and so maybe just kind of talk through some of the puts and takes there on the tech solutions margin from the second half?","John Stauch","Yes, we are finishing a job in Q2 that was a six bit job in thermal and we had some overrun on the labor side on that project. So that job is ending early Q3 and so with that behind us we are back to more of a normal project margins and normal product margins so it was one large job that we worked through last year and we have the final labor runs going through Q2 and early Q3 and then it's behind us.","Joe Ritchie","And what was that impact John?","John Stauch","It was a project order and it was fixed hourly or fixed fee and we over ran the labor to install it and complete the job. And so it ended in Q2 and Q3 so it's finishing up here in July and then we are going to see those orders or see that margin get better from here.","Joe Ritchie","Okay I have a follow-up on impact later. Thank you guys. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Mike Halloran","Hey good morning everyone. So, a couple full filtration questions. First on the water reuse side obviously you got some lumpiness in your process filtration piece in general. Maybe you could just talk about in the underlying momentum there what the core trends from the industry look like and then how your positioning is and how are you doing on a relative basis?","John Stauch","Just the process filtration piece?","Mike Halloran","Yes, and I have a second one on the hag side.","Randall Hogan","Yes, I think that we have a lot of capability and we have not fully achieved ignition in the marketplace. Infrastructure we have pretty good reach globally to basically the components that go in the large projects and we do pretty well there. Our hit rate when we compete for industrial is pretty good. We need to get more FX on that. And similarly I think that there is a vast opportunity for us to sell membrane bundles and not just modules and systems. So I think we are early days in terms of all the growth opportunities of the process filtration have.","Mike Halloran","And then, on the hag side obviously some challenging comps year-over-year some challenging trend industry wise, talk about the sequential trends are you seeing any signs of stability in industry relative to what a normal sequential would look and what\u2019s the thought process going forward?","Randall Hogan","You are talking about full filtration in total? Well, given the lack of good predictability that we have going in the second quarter I will be less confident in answering we expect to see some improvements in crops rate coming and but irrigation I think is going to be we are - this is irrigation season. So the fact that it wasn't up now it means it won\u2019t be up in the third quarter. It tracks pretty closely with farm income unless you have an issue like we have with the drought.","Mike Halloran","Right but I guess I am more asking stability emerging at on that side for you guys with all the headwinds there or do you think that there is still more swing ahead?","Randall Hogan","Not worsening, not bettering no. I would say. ","Mike Halloran","Great. Thanks guys. ","Randall Hogan","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning gents. Hey so $20 million of steel purchases you called out is that just for TSO, was that Pentair wide?","Randall Hogan","Pentair wide","Nigel Coe","Okay that's what I thought. I just wanted to clarify on that point. So on BNC margins can you maybe just help just to from 2Q to 15% do we still have a FIFO tailwinds into the second half-of-the-year or is the gap between low doubles to mid tens is that primarily cost saves at this point?","Randall Hogan","This is small little tailwind from the variances associated with last year productivity working its way through Q1 and Q2 but most of it is the momentum of the incremental cost saves on the operational side and also some momentum around material savings working its way through the shipments.","Nigel Coe","Okay and I guess the fact is that there is no price and degradation in the margin bridge, its board line shocking I think we were all expecting that to be price and headwind this year is that because the price in the markets is, we just haven't seen price cuts because the end market conditions are so awful? Or is it just primarily a function of Pentair walking away from low price projects maybe a bit of a mix issue as well. Maybe any kind of color on pricing would be helpful?","John Stauch","Yes Nigel, just to be clear and thank you for asking the question our price that shows up in the Valves & Controls chart is a like product to like product. Sub-standard product and it's an aftermarket usually and it's a like for like. We are seeing as we have talked about over the last several quarters the project margin headwind that works its way into the growth and the FX bar on the right as far as segment income so we are seeing that project mix and project pricing work its way through that and that is stabilized but it's still on the year-over-year basis pretty large as you can see there.","Nigel Coe","Okay and then quick clarification FFS, the three point delta the true down on the full year, is that a little -- issues or is there something there?","John Stauch","That's pretty much just the hag issues.","Nigel Coe","Okay, great that's good. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Your line is open.","Nathan Jones","Good morning everyone.","Randall Hogan","Morning Nathan.","Nathan Jones","Just a follow-up on Nigel\u2019s question there we have heard company talking about demand is so lousy and some of those oil and gas kind of markets that there is no point in telling price. Would you expect that there could be any increased pricing competition as orders do rebound as spokes to compete for that volume?","Randall Hogan","Yes, I mean I don't know if it gets worse from here, Nathan but I don't think we are planning on getting too much better from here on those projects. I think I personally believe that a lot of that reset in pricing was the foreign exchange resets since a lot of these valve producers are outside United States and the euro going down major products more affordable and I think the big EPC is taking advantage of that and so I think it's stabilizing now as most people have taken up the capacity but I don't think it's going to recover to the levels that it used to be at either.","Nathan Jones","So you wouldn't expect to say in the back half of the yea order rates improve any additional pricing pressure as people compete for that volumes.","Randall Hogan","We don't think so, no.","Nathan Jones","Okay. Then my other question on water quality solutions you talked about growth investments in the second half can you give us some more color on what those growth investments are and maybe what the impact on margins is in the back half-of-the-year and if there is continuing investments or disgrace investments?","Randall Hogan","Yes. Before I get into the specific investment so what we meant was that we had such a nice increase in margins I just don't think people should expect it to be that good and we gave you some insights on what we expect the margins to be. The investments are basically in two. One is product innovation and the other one is in channel in geography investments and sales coverage. So maybe it's 50 bips a quarter in the investment increase and one is it's a business that as the conversation about China and the conversation we talked earlier about pool business it really is a business that is yielding the innovation so product innovation pays and then as I mentioned we are applying some of the pool playbook to water purification to get more eminent and closer to the customer and those are the geography and channel investments we are making.","Nathan Jones","So it sounds like continuing investment that you grade the rewards on the top line?","Randall Hogan","Right, right.","Nathan Jones","Thank you. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond from KeyBanc, your line is open.","Jeffrey Hammond","Hey good morning guys.","Randall Hogan","Good morning.","Jeffrey Hammond","Not to beat this too hard, but the I am just trying to - get a better sense of where you are seeing this sequential improvement visibility that 10% improvement what sub verticals and is it your customers telling your or actually in order rates or --","Randall Hogan","You are talking about valves?","Jeffrey Hammond","Yes.","John Stauch","Yes okay. Great. Yes, listen we are - we have had a fairly sizable frontline for a period of time and I think as Randy mentioned we scrubbed it. We have discounted the larger projects from the expectations that those were closed this year, but what we did when we reorganized the sales force is put a lot more energy and effort in the aftermarket side and one of the things we bring to the table to a lot of the larger customers is the ability to service a vast majority of valves and the way that we are servicing those right now is on an aggregated buy basis from those customers and then also working inside their factory to their plants to be able to benefit from that. So that's the big piece of it.","The second one is that there has been some Pentair demand on the downstream side especially the MRO downstream and as we always said we don't think that that could be deferred forever and we\u2019re starting to see that start to come in. So, we are not declaring victory yet I think we are saying is that we believe the Q2 represents the bottom of the orders and we are starting to see the increase from here. A double-digit increase of the Q2 is still a modest level of orders that we - versus what we are used to but at least the sign that we are going to see that downstream investments start to come back.","Jeffrey Hammond","Okay helpful and then just free cash flow came in a lot better how are you thinking about upside the free cash flow for the year?","John Stauch","Right now we are committed to the 100% of that income and we are tracking as we said $150 million better than last year but we are focused on this and obviously getting our debt paid down.","Randall Hogan","We are not only $150 million ahead of last year we are ahead of where we thought be this. ","John Stauch","Yes, but Jeff I think we got to see another quarter too before we obviously - we will too have it but anyway we need to see another quarter before we are going to declare that there is upside to that number.","Jeffrey Hammond","Okay thanks guys. ","Randall Hogan","Thank you. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scott Graham","Hey good morning. I have a question on water quality system first not Valves & Controls. You are looking for a nice bump up in organic in the third quarter and we are just hoping you can give us little color around that?","Randall Hogan","Yes, there is a couple of factors. One is the Europe comp in water purification in the second quarter was tough so we didn't show growth there. We think that it gets better. And then and we talked about the pool timing. And the pool marketing you can look at comp, there is few comps you can look at. The pool market is really quite strong and we think that more that will read out too. You will see that more because of the timing comp, the timing won\u2019t mess up the comp.","John Stauch","Yes, the weather can have an impact on the timing of the pool season Scott and last year there was a very, very strong Q2 and we are now back to more of a normal trend on a year-over-year basis in Q3 and as we shared I mean our product and environmental system business has been growing yearly double digit now for four five years in a row so we feel really good about the visibility to the summer and feel very good about the growth rate for Q3.","Scott Graham","Yes, makes sense. Thank you. The other question I had was simply on the shrinkage of the footprint in the past you have given us some metrics of improvement that where it was whether it was facility or people or otherwise anything you are willing to share this quarter?","John Stauch","No. I mean we have few more factories in the works to reduce. So we are just under 100 total factories to Pentair and we expect to have reduced it by around five or six by the beginning of the year to the end of the year so we are modestly addressing it where we feel we have excess capacity due to the end markets that we are serving but we are not aggressively reducing the factory at this time.","Scott Graham","Alright, very good, thank you.","Randall Hogan","Thank you. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski from The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Your line is open.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Hi good morning guys. I have heard all at this point. I will put them on the roster with the rest of them.","Randall Hogan","Joshua Pokrzywinski go ahead. ","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Yes, just to come back to tech product side, I understand there is some mix issues that you are talking about in thermal but we have heard a lot of companies call out particularly price cost obviously it's a steel intensive business. I would have imagined a bit more support from price cost in this quarter particularly on the Enclosure side and maybe a bit more turnaround headwind in the second half and I guess all the questions or responses around tech product seems to be focusing more on thermal than on Enclosures or ERICO so just trying to dimension out within I guess Hoffman or maybe ERICO specifically how you see mix evolving there, how you see some of the margin read out particularly it retain price cost?","Randall Hogan","Yes, we have done really well on the price costs on both ERICO and Enclosure so we did single out the thermal business Josh primarily because that is not really steel related it's more of the heat tracing cable versus the labor and the integration cost to bring that project to there so when we take on the projects and we are doing the design the engineering and the install and then we\u2019re bringing the cable along we are going to have a compression of margins when the product side is down. And as we mentioned the aftermarket MRO sometimes goes to distribution or go direct to the end site and again installed and that's the part that's been down double-digit. So we are up significantly in the project side. We are down in the product side and we\u2019re experiencing an overall mix issue even though we are up in the revenue.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","But just to be clear on Enclosures and ERICO, no change increase, decrease in the margins versus 1Q for the full year outlook?","Randall Hogan","No change and we have probably experiencing a little bit modest headwind on Q3 and Q4 and I save a couple million dollars in the rising cost of the steel, but not anything significant.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Got you and then just shifting gears to water quality. I think I know you mentioned the easy comp in Europe is that a low mix dynamic where you wouldn't see lot of pool through profitability on that I guess having just said there is a late start to the pool season maybe that's still over in the third quarter you got the strong volume quarter coming. I would imagine that margin would look little bit better than what you showed or what you are showing in guidance?","Randall Hogan","Well, water purification in Europe pool isn't that big in Europe but the water purification side is and margins there are bad. Is there little mix\u2026","John Stauch","I think there is, Randy mentioned, there is the desire to do significant growth investment and this is a business that absolutely deserves to do these growth investments and we factor them in at the business, spending them. The likelihood that they would actually spend them would be low.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Got you but there is no blue bird in the second quarter apart from just good mix - okay.","Randall Hogan","No. not at all.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Got you, alright, thanks guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is open.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks good morning. Hey so the tech solutions trends overall shown a little revenue upside but some negative mix on the thermal side. With the intuition be for 2017 to have some favorable mix versions on margin and little bit of net organic pressure or you kind of see thermal more likely to compound the growth?","John Stauch","Early to call that but I think your intuition are about right. ","Randall Hogan","Yes, I would certainly start with that. William started that.","John Stauch","I think your intuition we are doing now is correct. ","Christopher Glynn","Okay and then just comment on how to size the corporate line in the second half?","Randall Hogan","Yes, I think you should look at around $43ish million divided equally between Q3 and Q4.","Christopher Glynn","Great, that's all I got. Thanks. ","Randall Hogan","Thank you. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Robert Barry from Susquehanna International Group, your line is open.","Robert Barry","Hey guys, good morning, so I wanted to clarify in Valves the improvement you expect in the second half, is that on the aftermarket?","John Stauch","Yes, we've got a little bit more short cycle, product shipments and also getting up with past two backlog, so we see that we're expecting to get a slightly higher standard margins we move that through the shipments, and we also as we mentioned that we took in a fair amount of deferred variances from last year, which I think we spent more than we should have on the labor side and we had a belief that off in the first couple of quarters this year, so we have a little tailwind associated with that.","Robert Barry","Got you, and I think in an answer to an earlier question you alluded to some of the deferred maintenance starting to show up, is that refinery maintenance you're seeing come through it?","Randall Hogan","I don't think refinery, we're seeing more of the petrochem spending come through, which has been actively being bit, one thing that seems pretty clear is that now that the rapid decline in capital spending has happened, our customers are really sorted out normally who is working on it, who has stored and formed it, which projects are going to go forward with and we execute a little projects, we talk a lot of our big projects as the thing is that they move a needle a lot, but our average project size is $100 million, so those are small outage turnarounds just maintenance related activities and so I think we\u2019re going to get into a more normalized albeit lower level of how they\u2019re deployed.","Robert Barry","That\u2019s good to hear. Just lastly you\u2019ve been making a lot of changes to the sales organization in Valves, at this point are all of these changes kind of net, net helping or hurting the order growth?","Randall Hogan","I think the structure itself is the right structure I think when you make this level of change where you have project oriented sales people trying to call in the aftermarket you\u2019re going to find areas where that\u2019s the wrong skill set and I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to have to continue to migrate the sales force to the right skill set overtime and to say we\u2019re optimized to the moment I would say is not accurate and I think we think the structure is right and what we now need to do is get the processes, the support for the structure operating fully and then we think we can benefit going forward. Has that hurt us, probably here and there but not dramatically.","Robert Barry","Great, thank you.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time and if you would like to listen to a replay of today\u2019s conference you may dial 1-800-585-8367.

Please turn to Slide 4 titled, executive summary. We are pleased to deliver solid third quarter performance. In particular, our return to segment income growth and ROS expansion. And building on our performance from the second quarter. We are maintaining our full year EPS guidance. We've seen price cost stabilized and we are encouraged to see further signs of top line stabilization in our important aquatics business. We continue to invest in our two key strategic growth priorities. Advancing pool growth and accelerating residential and commercial water treatment. ","These investments are centered on building out a consumer experience inclusive of our brand, channel, innovative products and services. We continue to believe we are well positioned to return the core sales and income growth in 2020. And I'll talk little more later in the call about our optimism about long-term strategy an prospects. ","I'll now turn the call over to Mark to discuss our third quarter results and updated full year outlook. Mark?","Mark Borin","Thank you, John. Please turn to Slide 5 labeled Q3'19 Pentair performance. For the third quarter, overall sales increased slightly and we saw core sales declined 2%. Segment income grew 1% and adjusted EPS increased 7%. We'll provide more color on individual segment performance shortly. Below the line we saw an adjusted tax rate of 15%, net interest, other expenses of $7.7 million and our average shares in the quarter were $168.6 million. The tax rate in the quarter reflects our long-term strategy spread across a lower income base in 2019 resulting in an expected full year adjusted tax rate of 17%. ","Finally, free cash flow was just over $150 million and in line with normal seasonal patterns. We were pleased to see segment income grow and ROS expand despite the softer top line and we believe this is a reflection of price cost stabilizing following the headwinds of significant inflation we discussed in prior quarters. ","Please turn to Slide 6 labeled Q3'19 Pentair Segment Performance. This slide lays out the third quarter performance of our three segments. As expected our Aquatic segment experienced a 5% core sales decline against an extremely tough comparison. Following rather abnormal weather during the first half of the year, it appeared that weather in much of the country was more normal during the quarter and a result was an improved sell-through. Aquatic saw segment income declined 9% and ROS contracted 60 basis points but still came in north of 25%. ","As we have repeated throughout the year, we remained focused on exiting 2019 with channel inventories more in line with historical levels. Filtration Solutions reported core sales growth of 4% with solid contribution across all business lines but particularly within the smaller food and beverage business as we shipped out some of our improved backlog in both beer and sustainable gas. The integration of both Aquion and Pelican remain on track and both businesses performed in line with our expectations. Segment income grew 17% for Filtration and ROS expanded 50 basis points to 16.5%. ","In Flow Technologies, core sales declined 5% during the quarter. We continue to see strong headwinds in our Ag business both OEM and after market. Despite the soft top line performance, segment income grew 4% and ROS expanded 170 basis points to 17.1%. As a reminder, Flow Technologies was hit hardest by tariffs and broader inflation in the segment half of 2018 and a comparison in the quarter was its easiest of the year. ","While we continue to see mix results across the three segments, we are most encouraged by size of stabilization and price cost as well as only one more quarter of tough top line comparisons for our products.","Please turn to Slide 7 labeled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen and third quarter delivered another seasonally strong quarter of free cash flow. During the third quarter we had one bond matured and we have another maturing in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we successfully issued a 10 year note during the second quarter. Between our healthy free cash flow and improved leverage ratios, our balance sheet remains well positioned to fund both organic and inorganic growth opportunities. ","Please turn to Slide 8 labeled Q4'19 Pentair Outlook. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate core sales to be roughly flat. We expect Aquatic Systems to be down approximately 1% to 3% as we continue to focus on making sure channel inventories return to more normalized levels by the end of the year. We expect core sales growth in both Filtration Solutions and Flow Technologies to be essentially flat. We anticipate segment income to be up approximately 6% to 8% as we expect price cost to further stabilized and we continue to drive productivity. We expected adjusted EPS to be in a range of $0.64 to $0.66 per share.","Below the line we expect corporate expense to be approximately $14 million to $15 million. We expect our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate to be around 17%. WE expect net interest and other expense of roughly $8 million and shares to be approximately 169 million.","Please turn to Slide 9 labeled Full Year 2019 Pentair Outlook. For the full year, we expect core sales to be down roughly 1%. We expect total sales to be essentially flat with roughly 2% contribution from our two acquisitions offset by 1% headwinds from FX. We anticipate segment income to be down around 3%. We continue to expect our full year adjusted EPS to be approximately $2.35 per share. Other items embedded in our guidance include expected corporate expense of $60 million to $63 million and adjusted tax rate of 17%, net interest other expense of $35 million and an average share count for the year of roughly 170 million shares. ","While there are undoubtedly many moving pieces to our 2019 pack to expected flat EPS, we continue to be encouraged by signs top line stabilization and further price cost improvement. We are encouraged by the performance our businesses are delivering in light of the top line challenges faced this year. ","I would now like to turn the call back to John.","John Stauch","Thank you, Mark. Please turn to Slide 10, labeled Executing a Consistent Strategy. We continue to be focused on driving our long-term strategy and we believe there is a lot of evidence at the focused investment we are making is the right investments and driving results. Most people would agree that global water quality is a challenge. While many companies are participating in offering to solve this global issue, we've chosen to focus primarily on the residential and commercial markets. There is little argument that consumers can benefit from taking ownership of their water experience. ","They can do it to their own taste and with solutions that meet their individual needs and preferences. And Pentair has a variety of solutions to help consumers treat, move and enjoy water. In fact, Pentair is one of the few total solution providers to residential customers. Also, when we aligned on our strategy nearly two years ago, it started with our leading Aquatic franchise. With over 5 million pools installed in the US, and over half of them being over decade old, there is large and installed base to serve. We've built the strong business focus on new product development and strong dealer loyalty. ","The introduction of the Variable Speed Pump nearly a decade ago created awareness around energy savings and the results has compounded with other product categories from LED lightly to hybrid heaters. We believe the continued adoption of automation which is small today, roughly 275,000 pools versus an opportunity north of 2.5 million pools in the US, creates a new avenue of growth where we have leading position. ","Within residential Filtration market, the acquisition of Aquion and Pelican earlier this year moved us being leading component suppliers to now being a provider of systems and solutions. We've learned quite a lot in our short time owning both of these businesses, and we believe there are many paths to create value as we help consumers solve their water challenges in their homes. ","On the commercial side of the business, we've historically enjoyed a strong position in food service area. Increasingly, we are focusing on total water management with customers and we believe this presents an opportunity, better positions us with many our existing and potential customers. Within the commercial office water space, customers are increasingly looking at opportunities to decrease the use of plastic bottles. And we've a number of technologies today that can serve this space. And we believe there are opportunities to further expand in this area. ","Outside of the residential and commercial verticals, we've a number of technologies we've developed around nano and ultra filtration. As we develop new IoT products, we see even more opportunities to solve customer challenges. For instance, within the beer industry, we've approximately 150 plants globally that use our digital BMS system, enable our customers to become more sustainable, lower cost, move from static to dynamic live reporting and improved overall operating performance. We've transition this technology into the sustainable gas industry and we believe there are opportunities to expand this technology to other parts of our portfolio over time. ","We also continue to believe there are multiple paths to drive consistent, sustainable growth especially in our core residential and commercial businesses. And our recent acquisition allowed us to move closer to the consumer. And while we have built stronger aquatic business, we believe that by better focusing on the consumer not only the dealer, it will enable us to maintain an already healthy growth rate in one of our best businesses. ","We believe that we have the right portfolio, the right strategy, the right culture and the right technologies to further our positions as a leading water treatment company. With the strong core to build from and healthy balance sheet to support both our organic and inorganic opportunities, we look forward to demonstrating our strategy to our shareholders in Q4, and in 2020 and beyond. ","I would now like to turn the call over to Dorothy for Q&A, after which I will have a few closing remarks. Dorothy, please open the line for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. ","SteveTusa","Hi guys, good morning. Hey, can you just breakdown a little more like what\u2019s going on in the Flow business? The revenues were way off versus our model, but the profits kind of held in. and I know this dispersion in the margin profile of some of those businesses, so and that was one. I think, in the first quarter that was tougher to kind of figure out. What\u2019s going on in that segment? I think the other two are pretty straight forward. What\u2019s going on in this segment?","JohnStauch","Yes, Steve, let me speak to the revenue miss and I\u2019ll let Mark to give the details. But during the end of Q2, we saw a little both positive in some of the Ag orders. And right out of the gate in Q3, we just saw that Ag did not recover at all, so we had anticipated a little more recovery sequentially in Q3. And it just slide out, didn\u2019t happen. ","So now we\u2019ve adjusted heading into Q4 next year the fact that we don\u2019t see Ag recovering at all. And I think the lot of the global data would suggest that, and we\u2019d probably figured it out right now. But that was a little bit of a bounce in Q3 that we had expected that didn\u2019t happen. ","SteveTusa","How big is Ag? It isn\u2019t that relatively profitable? Shouldn\u2019t that had a -- shouldn't that have had a kind of more negative impact on the margin like? What am I missing on that front?","MarkBorin","Yes, Steve it\u2019s Mark, and it\u2019s a great question. What we saw positive signs here were two things really, you\u2019ll see price cost getting better. As I said in my prepared comments, Flow was hit hardest by the inflation pressure so we see price cost turning positive in Q3. And then also productivity, we touched on that in Q2 that, that although we weren\u2019t, we didn\u2019t see the productivity reading out in Q2 we saw signs that gave us a high degree of confidence that we would start to see that in Q3 and that\u2019s really what happened. ","So, you\u2019re right that, being down in Ag from a mix perspective would push margins down and income down but, that was --we were benefited by better productivity and improved price cost. And Steve-- ","SteveTusa","And how big is Ag, for you guys?","MarkBorin","Ag would be somewhere in the $200 million range. ","JohnStauch","Per year.","SteveTusa","Okay, and then one last one just on the Aquatics, pool made some pretty positive comments that their channel is clear. Can you kind of validate that comment or are there other considerations and thinking about next year a little bit, I would think you guys have some easy comps here coming up in the first half of \u201920 or is there something else that we should keep in mind when thinking about kind of the trajectory in the next year?","JohnStauch","Yes Steve, so I think you\u2019re right. I mean we do track a lot of our largest customer\u2019s earnings calls and we agree that inventory is definitely getting more normalized here. And our goal is in between now and the end of the year and make sure that it gets into that normalized pattern. ","I do think though that, the pricing this year is relatively more normal which we\u2019ll not suggest that any of the channel would reach to do the buy heads that we saw last year with a much more elevated pricing levels so, Mark, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything more?","MarkBorin","Yes. I agree, I mean, we\u2019ve said we continue to believe that by the end of the year, we\u2019ll exit with normal levels and we think of 2020 more in line with historical normal seasonal stabilized perspective. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.","NathanJones","Good morning, everyone. Just maybe thinking a little bit about where the returns organic growth comes from in 2020. I think we have probably being in the pool business thinking kind of understand why that should return to growth. But I mean look if I'm having a look at the last couple of quarter's results; organic sales have been down with positive impacts from price. This quarter, you're down to with 3 points to price, and volume down 5. Outside of the pool business with -- what I would imagine are moderating price tailwinds and some negative volume trends here, where would you expect the growth to come from in 2020 outside of pool?","JohnStauch","Well. I mean it\u2019s good question, and I thank you for asking. But I mean, I think first of all, we beyond pool, we also had some channel inventory in both Filtration and Flow. That was built up for some of the same buy ahead patterns that happened in last year's Q3 and Q4. So this year's Q3 and Q4 have those difficult comparisons and then Q1 and Q2 of next year have much easier comparisons across Filtration, Flow and Aquatics.","NickStokes","Okay. So some tough comp issues this year for the same reasons is pool latest ones next year. That makes sense. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about some of these? You talked about focused investments being the right investments and driving results. Maybe talk a little bit more about where those investments and what kind of results you're seeing them drive? And maybe specifically a little bit more about building out the channel for the commercial and residential filtration.","JohnStauch","Yes, so we have three specific growth priorities in both pool and residential and commercial filtration. It\u2019s really about having, I\u2019ll start with commercial first, and it\u2019s about having the best commercial systems and capabilities. And we\u2019re really excited about the technology that we\u2019re building to sell at commercial office water opportunities, as you know, people are seeking carbonated water and they\u2019re also seeking flavored carbonated water. ","So really excited about the investments we made on technology side, while we\u2019re more than a year away from launching that product that our product is really better solution that we think that the market will benefit from. So excited there. We are also through both the acquisitions and also internally within Pentair; we\u2019re having the best residential systems. Smarter, more innovative valves technology, smarter water softener systems technology, I am hooking those to automation and then having the services piece to the Pelican acquisition to complete that last mile.","And we\u2019re really excited about the progress of that in home sales capability, and the build out of what we call our mobile resource centers which are our brands that we go out and sell with. So huge progress there. On the pool side, we continue to see technology advancement, new technologies around filtration, new technologies around automation, so we\u2019re excited that that penetration rate will show up. ","When you look at the sell-through rates of pool in both Q2 and Q3, they\u2019re back to the high single-digits again. So once we get through this inventory channel issue and the pool business normalizes, I think we\u2019re very positive that we\u2019ll see that return to growth next year.","NathanJones","On the commercial water filtration product, the flavored and bubbly water, have you guys done enough work to kind of talk about what you think the size of that opportunity is for you?","JohnStauch","I think it\u2019s really fragmented. I think the overall momentum is there. I think what we wanted to do is make sure that we have the systems that can give you chilled, heated, sparkling and as you know our other peer filtration is a big part of that overall component. So we want to be talked about in the space, and we want to make sure we have the right systems that can solve any solution, that basically a commercial customer has. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.","JoeGiordano","Hey guys, good morning. John, I just wanted to clarify something you said earlier on Steve\u2019s question regarding Ag, Flow. I think you mentioned that there was some headwinds kind of exiting Q2 about Ag, that didn\u2019t materialize in the quarter. I was under the impression that once Ag that when we have that bad weather in the first half that like any recovery in Ag was taken out of guidance. So I'm just a little confused about, can you kind of square that for me?","+","JohnStauch","Yes, there are two forms of Ag. We have a precision Ag spray business and that we did address earlier and that is a very-very high margin offering. The other part of Ag is more of the pivot Ag spray in the irrigation side of the business, that\u2019s specifically what I was referring to.","JoeGiordano","Okay, so this is the irrigation not the precision, okay cool. Okay, can you talk about maybe some of the impacts you\u2019re having with some of just the internal cost that you shared? Because clearly, I mean, particularly in Flow, I mean, you\u2019re seeing the margins come through on weak number on a weak growth number, so may be you talk about some at a high level maybe there\u2019s a couple of examples you can kind of take us through or sort of some things that are being done differently today than maybe a year ago, across the enterprise maybe?","JohnStauch","Yes, sure. One of the things we talk a lot about is we separated with optimization and really looking at where did we have complexity and how can we get after complexity reduction and into the Flow Technology segment was certainly one of those businesses where we saw high degree of that skew rationalization things, that inherently drives up cost and drive down margins. ","And the team really got after that in as we exited 2017 and throughout 2018, and so we started to see those activities and actions pay off here in 2019. And also, we\u2019ve also talked about some of the factories where we had some challenges. We\u2019ve been investing in automation and other technology to replace and improve some of the older equipment and machinery that\u2019s used in some of those factories that\u2019s also starting to readout early stages. So there\u2019s more of that to comments, we think about 2020 but we\u2019re again seeing favorable signs and encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing. ","JoeGiordano","And one last for me on, if we look and it\u2019s too early to talk 2020, but if we just think about the situation where there is inventory cleaned up through your partners, and we can start ramping a little bit. When I think about free cash flow, there\u2019s nice performance here in the quarter. Is that going to be, how much of the headwind do you see that being into \u201920 as things kind of ramp up and start producing at higher rates?","JohnStauch","I think we still have opportunity to really focus on cash flow and we continue to view cash flow targeting at approximating adjusted net income, so we wouldn\u2019t change that point of view even though as we grow to your point, there maybe some working capital type things that we need to invest. But there are opportunities in other places that we would manage and balance out to have that long -term target still maintained. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird. ","MikeHalloran","Hey, good morning everyone. So a couple ones first, just on capital usage here, any thoughts to bring back being more aggressive on the buyback side again? And then secondarily related to that, how\u2019s the M&A pipeline look? What's the willingness, ability to bring something in and how are the evaluations looking out there?","JohnStauch","Yes, I mean I think clearly we\u2019re focusing on execution right now Mike and part of that was making sure that we\u2019re delivering on our commitments, Q2, Q3, and Q4 so that\u2019s our first focus area. I think there are the growing opportunities to invest in the platforms that I mentioned. And we\u2019re continuing to look at those tuck-in acquisitions I would say that feed more what we\u2019ve done already. ","But you can never time those. We have no idea where they\u2019re going, and we just want to make sure that we\u2019re protecting the balance sheet heading into next year and giving ourselves flexibility to do what we think is going to drive most amount of value. ","MikeHalloran","The pipeline on that side, John?","JohnStauch","Good. ","MikeHalloran","All right, and then just some thoughts on the price cost side, you talked --it seemed like you\u2019re implying the price cost side should be a little bit more favorable moving forward from here. Maybe talk about puts and takes on the pricing side? Is that kind of flattened out a little bit relatively to the commodity side? And how you\u2019re thinking about that moving into next year?","JohnStauch","Yes, so maybe the way to think about it is, we had significant price cost headwinds as we talked about coming out of last year and into the beginning of this year. Now what I referenced in Q3 in particular was favorability because we\u2019ve got favorable price and we have inflation moderating. As you move forward that favorable year-over-year price will start to be a little bit more than normal, at a more normalized level versus the unusually high price increases that we had in 2018 that spilled over into 2019. ","So, I don't -- it's more of a stabilization story rather than a benefit. It\u2019s just mitigation of what had been a pretty significant headwind. And on the inflation side, one thing to always kind of keep in mind is inflation is not just the material or commodity inflation, but we certainly also have labor inflation and we don\u2019t see that going away or moderating. So that will continue to be part of how we think about what our 2020 will look like.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","JeffHammond","Hey, good morning guys. Just on, can you just talk about what is in forming the lower growth rate in filtration and then just as you look forward here a lot about our macro-slowing and just where and just where are you seeing some signs of slowing in your business outside of that Ag space?","MarkBorin","Sure. As we-- as I talked about in Q3, we saw pretty, pretty improved performance in the food and beverage part of the filtration business. That moderates a little bit in Q4, so that's part of the story. We do see continued stabilization and incremental improvement on the important residential and commercial side. Both the systems and components businesses, where those -- the investments in those acquisitions took place. So overall, just more of a moderated view given their performance in Q3, and then would expect to kind of as we think about moving into 2020. A similar level of performance and starting to see some of the investments that John talked about reading out and improve core sales growth.","JeffHammond","Okay, and then just on pool. What are you assuming and what are customers telling you about kind of the normal early buy situation? And then just, if we look into 2020, certainly you've got some easy comps and typically this business grows mid-to-high single digits. Should we think of 2020 is kind of an easy comp and you can get back to those levels or above? Thanks.","MarkBorin","So on the first question and from an early buy perspective, we're seeing kind of a consistent early buy pattern, of last year was a little bit unusual because of the blend of the impact of the price increase. But what we're seeing this year is more in line with kind of the historical trends. In terms of next year, as we said, we're exiting Q4, you see that the Q4 guide is what I would think of as back to a little bit more level of normalization improved income performance, flattening of the top line, which had been decreasing, and as we think about 2020, we're just going really focus on getting back to what we believe would be performance in line with our long term objectives.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. ","DeaneDray","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hey, very well, thank you. How about, can we put a little finer point on the working down the excess channel inventory and pool? If we had been thinking it was around a $60 million excess it just based on commentary about expected 4Q normalizing. How much should we think about that $60 million haven't been worked up so far?","MarkBorin","So as we talked, and we worked down some of that inventory in line with sort of our expectations and we continue to see that coming down further in Q4 and exiting the year at levels that are in line with more historical seasonal patterns. ","DeaneDray","Okay, and then on pool, John, you talk about some of the new product development in filtration and pool and automation are just to set expectations, might you have some new automation offerings for the 2020 season? ","JohnStauch","Yes, we do already. And I think we're learning how to sell it better. We believe everybody can benefit from that automation capability. It's a different type of sale though. And we have that we believe the right products that can really help the user along, and we have to tweak our ability to sell technology. It's not like selling a product. It's more like selling a service or capability. And so we learned a lot this year. And I think we're encouraged by the progress we're making in Q3 and Q4. And I think those products can really accelerate as they head into next year. ","DeaneDray","When you say sell a service, is that something that Pentair would benefit from on a recurring basis or is that a pool dealer that would be part of their revenue stream? ","MarkBorin","Well, clearly the vision would be that everybody would benefit, right? And that at the end of the day, most people buy technology on more rented basis because they believe whatever they have is going to be obsolete. We'd have to line the channel that way, Deane but ultimately, we think that's going to be the right answer. We're launching in this quarter, the new Pentair Home App, which basically is a broad umbrella that takes all of the suite of products that Pentair offers and allows you to be connected into that Home App. And we're hopeful that as the consumer sees more and more things that are available to either connecting with Alexa or Google Home or Apple or whatever your devices that you start to see the benefits of, some of the monitoring your water quality, and then starting to buy some of the products and services that would attach to that.","DeaneDray","That's good to hear. And just last one for me when you talk about the commercial office water opportunity, are you thinking and still we agree that it's still very fragmented. Are you thinking of a rental opportunity or would this be equipment sales or both?","MarkBorin","Today, it's about having the right systems and likely out selling them, Deane, as you know the market does rent them. The end solution providers do rent units. Don't know yet if that's the space that we want to be in. But we were -- we introduced carbonated water some 8 to 10 years ago. We were probably early in the market. We have all the technology and we deliver that for food service and so how do we bring that into a commercial office environment in a productive way, if that's what people want. As you guys know, there's a lot of fickle drinkers. The first one is get tea and coffee. ","Most all tea and coffee needs to be filtered, so you don't scale the units or cause damage to those units. And our filtration plays a big part in that. And if we expand that filtration into other forms of water, we think there's a huge opportunity for Pentair. And look, this is forward thinking, we believe we have the technology where it's probably not a 2020 launch, it's probably somewhere in 2021. ","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.","JoshPokrzywinski","Good morning, guys. Quick question on price cost, I guess, with working down channel inventory and kind of generalized market weakness, some of that related weather earlier in the year. I would imagine it's harder to get price certainly, probably more room for incentives than to try to raise prices in the channel. Is that something we should expect to start expanding more rapidly from this point now that we've kind of cleared the season, cleared the channel overhang from an inventory perspective?","JohnStauch","I think the best way to think about it is, as I said before, it's just more of a normalized level of price, as you know a big chunk of the price that we see overall comes from the pool business that they had unusually high price last year in response to inflation. This year, they had a price increase that would have gone into effect in September, which is the normal timeframe that those price increases go into place. And I call that a more in a more normal historical level and something similar in the other businesses. So we are not seeing --we didn't see any unusual reaction to price this year as a result of channel inventories and but we do see just going to a more normalized level given that last year's higher price was really driven by that incremental inflation. ","JoshPokrzywinski","Got it. And then I guess as it pertains to the aquatic season, just as we kind of round it down there in the third quarter, obviously you had a slow start with weather and particularly in some of the warmer regions that would have been bigger contributors in the first quarter. Did any of that get made up later in the year just with the season, maybe stretching out longer, not even weather related, but just thinking of folks are always going to be busy kind of May through August, but maybe they do an extra job in September. Is that something that you guys noticed and maybe sets up, accomplish and think about and sell through next year? ","MarkBorin","Yes, I think some of it will. I don't think first of all, the comp is meaningful enough. But yes, those pool builders will continue to work as long as they can in those areas. And they'll fill in jobs in the slower season that they would have otherwise not done. But they will also probably likely celebrate the holidays that exists in Q4. And so you're not going to see that same level of build that you tend to see in the more summer seasons. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.","SareeBoroditsky","Good morning. Could you provide some color on what you saw geographically? I believe last quarter you talked about Europe and China being positive. Did that continue? And any expectations as we look forward towards the end of the year?","JohnStauch","Sure, that -- it did continue. So we had commented earlier in the year that we saw some weakness in Europe, particularly on the filtration side, as we move through the year in Q2, and then again in Q3, and we really see to the balance of the year, we saw improvement there. So Europe now has -- is back to moderating growth and China as well is returned to a reasonably good growth level.","SareeBoroditsky","And then just a more longer term question on aquatic. How should we think about the impact from the Variable Speed Pump Legislation that goes into effect into 2021?","JohnStauch","We believe in 2021 it should help our overall sales. Variable Speed Pumps for us today are probably just over half of our total pumps sold. They do sell at a higher sell through value. So we do believe as the transition happens. Those of us who've been through these transitions before always have to go question, one of those dates going to really happen and will there be slippage and also, how does the inventory work its way through. And so we're not putting anything into 2020, obviously, and, we'll see if there's a relative bump in 2021, but overall should be positive to our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","JulianMitchell","Thank you. Good morning. Maybe just following up on that geographic point, you had emphasized some of the weakness in Ag. We've talked a lot already about residential trends in the US in the past few months. Just wondered if you could give any detail around what you've seen in some of the more commercial or industrial markets in the US? If there's been any particular shift in demand from month-to-month since July?","JohnStauch","Nothing significant from a month-to-month perspective, our -- 80% of our businesses overall is driven by the residential and commercial end markets and as we move through the balance of the year, we've talked about sort of the inventory impact, but beyond that the underlying demand has remained positive and we continue to see that kind of reading out through the balance of the year.","JulianMitchell","Thanks. And then on your sort of segment Income Bridge I guess on slide 5, when we're thinking about the productivity portion of that in aggregate, it looks like it's probably a maybe a $20 million tailwind or something for the year as a whole. If you could just sort of clarify that sounds about right and then when thinking about next year, do we think about some of those measures that you've accelerated around productivity pushing that number up or is that a pretty good run rate for the current demand environment?","MarkBorin","Yes, I think what you're seeing in Q3 is more in line with the level that we would anticipate. And I think to remember kind of what makes that up. There are multiple elements. So there's material productivity which is we're working on trying to mitigate some of the inflation headwinds. There's operating costs productivity that would think about that as you're looking at opportunities to reduce G&A costs. And then there's factory productivity, but then what's offsets that is also the investments we're making in the growth areas around R&D and selling, marketing investments and technology and things like that.","So as we think about this year and into next year, we will continue to look for increasing levels of productivity but utilizing some of that to continue to invest in the areas where we see the biggest growth opportunities.","JulianMitchell","Thanks very much. And one last quick one for me. Looking at the filtration operating performance, you had pretty healthy sales growth there in Q3. The incremental margin was around 20% or so. Is that a reasonable sort of placeholder for that business with its current mix or do you see anything sort of one time within that figure? ","MarkBorin","I wouldn't call it one time but with this, this is where we do have the residential systems and also the consumer services and we are significantly investing in those businesses, right. So we're very encouraged by the top line growth we have and we continue to add back digital marketing, advertising, branding and R&D spend to really accelerate the long-term growth there. So I think this is a more normalized pattern, as we head into 2020 is benefiting from the growth and then reinvesting a portion of that income back into fuel more growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from a line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. ","WalterLiptak","Hi. Thanks, good morning. I want to ask a geographic question, and understand the comments about the EU filtration kind of moving up from moderating growth in China doing okay, now. I wonder if we could just get a little bit more detail about why that as we look at macro numbers, Europe continues to get worse. China, the GDP numbers continue to weaken. What's going on with your sectors or the market share that's helping those regions?","JohnStauch","Yes, so let me talk about China, first. In our China business, we said before in China, Southeast Asia overall is residential and commercial filtration primarily. And think about that being just north of 100 and some million dollars on an annual basis. So the growth rates we're talking about are really about starting from a relatively low base in a very enormous market in which we have a dedicated China team and we have a dedicated factory dedicated R&D lab. And we really invested a lot of new product growth and marketing. ","So, we're winning in a space that may or may not overall be growing, but we have a lot of runway left in that area. In Europe, Mark gave the overall numbers and that is appropriate. Within those overall numbers, those things that are doing well in Europe, and there's things that aren't doing so well in Europe. So as we look at you know, some of the global industrial product lines, we definitely saw slow downs. And when you take a look at some of the more installed base, residential and commercial aftermarket businesses they're doing okay. Than no way would we call a robust market environment.","WalterLiptak","Okay. Can you help us with the size of the EU industrial business?","MarkBorin","Yes, I think it's roughly $100 million. ","WalterLiptak","$100 million total for the year. ","MarkBorin","For the year, right. Not in a quarter.","WalterLiptak","Okay, great. And then just switch gears over to the R&D, hearing about the investments in 2020, or is it similar levels of R&D, but more focused around some of these growth opportunities, or should we expect some kind of a step up in R&D spends?","JohnStauch","Yes, I think you're going to expect a step up. I've said many times that we have the ability to invest a lot more in R&D. And we'll feel better about that investment when we feel marketing has done the work to produce the roadmap of where our R&D will be best utilized. And we're really excited about our automation platforms and we have a global innovation center around automation, one Pentair solution that would work across the enterprise, really excited about that roadmap. ","And then around our treatment, and water treatment Innovation Center, really excited about the nano and ultra filtration technologies out of the CPT acquisition our X flow business, and expanding those into both residential and commercial, very excited. ","And then as I mentioned earlier building systems capability that takes that technology and gives the overall solution. Those are the double downs for me and the team, and I'm going to accelerate that investment in 2020 and probably 2021. And we're encouraged and excited by the products of the other end of that investment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.","BrianLee","Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just first one on price going back to that topic to clarify a bit. I know 2019 was a bit of normal with the three points here and I know it's early for 2020. But do you think it's reasonable to assume we just settle back to somewhere around the point in price for next year, like we've seen in past years, or was the pricing this year late enough in the year where there's still some spillover into the early part of next year? ","JohnStauch","Yes. I think about it a slightly higher than that, 1% that we've seen, so prior to 2018 for the few years prior to that, it been right around 1%. But that was I call that like historically low, so something in the 2% range is probably a little bit more in line with what would be historically normal. With a rounded range on that 50 basis points. Okay. I mean, I think it's too early to say. The businesses that went out in September as Mark said, I mean, we were out in that range that Mark said and we saw those pricing stick, and we\u2019re generally well received by the overall customers, and there was a more normal, and then we'll see how the others do. ","BrianLee","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just a second question going back to Flow for a second. I know you, you kind of walk back to core growth outlook for that segment through the year and you sort of did the opposite last year and walking it up through the years. So how do you de-risk the view here for 4Q just given how lumpy it's been all year, and then as you think about 2020, is this a segment you'd expect to grow year-on-year along with the overall business? Thanks.","MarkBorin","I can't call it de-risk. I can just tell you that it represents the last multiple quarter trends, it doesn't produce any incremental upside sequentially from things growing off of how they did the previous quarter, and then there is some year-over-year benefit as you look at Q1 and Q2 in this business next year. And then we'll see how confident we are when we come up with the guide of being able to drive organic growth in Q3 and Q4 of next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners.","BrettLinzey","Hi, good morning, guys. Hey, I just wanted to come back to Aquatics. You talked about some of the technology and growth priorities you have there and pool. As we think about those incremental costs and price moderating, but also some relief on ROS and other spending. What's the right incremental margin range we should be thinking about next year as you maybe see a more normal top line?","JohnStauch","This business has a fairly sizable drop through. And because it's sales wise material and a really efficient manufacturing process. So good drop through. I'm not going to give you an answer because this is a huge value contributor to Pentair. I want to invest in this. And I think we have some really exciting technologies in the pipeline here as well. And we'd like to put some investment back into sales channel. Primarily around the aftermarket side, I think we do a really nice job with our dealer channel covering both new pools and remodel pools. ","I think our opportunity is and being further down the aftermarket cycle with the services channel, and making sure we're the company of choice for consumers and that services play. And then also making sure that we go back to our roots and I'd still say we are the technology leader, but we used to be significantly more advanced than we are today. And we believe we have those technologies in the pipeline and need to drive them through a new product development phase, and that will be an investment thesis for 2020 as well.","BrettLinzey","Okay, great. And then shifting to restructuring, it took I think $6 million this quarter, $7 million last quarter. Are you budgeting more spending in Q4? And then just thinking about the payback? Did most of that get realized in the quarter? Do you see some of that rolling over into 2020 and from saving standpoint? Thanks.","JohnStauch","So we don't include in our guidance and expectation around restructuring, but I would anticipate there would be some incremental restructuring again in Q4. And the investments and restructuring that we've made in this year really wouldn't see those necessarily reading out now. But those would be part of how we think about 2020. ","As Mark mentioned, we're attacking some of the factories and some of the efforts within the factories. Those tend to have a little bit longer payoff than just structural changes to the business. So we have a right investments, we do have a larger footprint than we need and it is always geographically perfect. So we've addressed some of that especially the flow side, as Mark mentioned. And while we're seeing the margin improvement, I think there's still an opportunity for more margin improvement down the road.","BrettLinzey","Okay. And geographically where those costs were focused restructuring? ","JohnStauch","Little bit everywhere. Yes.","End of Q&A","Operator","And there are no further questions. At this time, I will turn the call back over to our speakers for closing remarks. ","John Stauch","Thank you for joining us today. We are encouraged by our third quarter performance, and we continue to see further signs of stabilization in our core business. We saw further productivity improvement in the quarter and we continue to build on our strong culture. We've been investing and we'll continue to invest in our key growth strategies, as well as digital enterprise capabilities to better serve our customers. We have a strong capital structure, solid free cash flow and we will continue to invest in our strategy to be the leading residential commercial water treatment company. Thank you for your continued interest. Dorothy, you can conclude the call. ","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."],"16723":["Pentair (NYSE:PNR) Q1 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call April 22, 2014  9:00 AM ET","Executives","James Lucas - Vice President of Investor Relations","Randall Hogan - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer ","John Stauch - Chief Financial Officer ","","Analysts","Mike Halloran - Robert Baird","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Steven Winoker - Sanford C.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Lucas, you may begin your conference.","James Lucas","Thanks, operator, and welcome to Pentair's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. We're glad you could join us. I am Jim Lucas, vice president of investor relations, and with me today is Randy Hogan, our chairman and chief executive officer, and John Stauch, our chief financial officer.","On today's call, we will provide details on our first quarter 2014 performance, as well as our second quarter and full year 2014 outlook as outlined in this morning's release. Before we begin, let me remind you that any statements made about the company's anticipated financial results are forward-looking statements subject to future risks and uncertainties, such as the risks outlined in Pentair's most recent 10-K and today's release.","Forward-looking statements included herein are made as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from anticipated results.","Today's webcast is accompanied by a presentation, which can be found in the Investors section of Pentair's website.

All references today will be on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise indicated, for which the non-GAAP financials are reconciled in the appendix of the presentation.","We will be sure to reserve time for questions and answers after our prepared remarks. We will target to be done in an hour. I would like to request that you limit your questions to one and a follow up, and get back in the queue for further questions so that everyone has an opportunity to ask their questions.","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randall Hogan ","Thanks, Jim. Good morning everyone. Let me begin with our first quarter performance, on slide four. Before I go through the results in detail, as has been our practice since the Flow Control merger, I want to note that we\u2019re discussing our operating results on an adjusted basis to more clearly show the core operating performance of our businesses.","With that, here are the first quarter numbers. First quarter revenue grew 1% on a core basis, but showed down 3% on a reported basis, which we will explain in more detail in a moment. Adjusted operating income was up 14%, and adjusted operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 11.8%.","Adjusted EPS grew 26%, coming at the high end of our expected range at $0.73. Free cash flow was a small usage, which is normal in our first quarter. This reflects a seasonal working capital build in many of our residential businesses and in this year\u2019s first quarter, the fact that a larger than average portion of revenue was generated in March due to the slow January and February. We believe we are on track to deliver full year free cash flow greater than 105% of net income. ","During the quarter, we completed our original $1.2 billion share repurchase authorization and are now into our next $1 billion repurchase authorization. Now let\u2019s turn to slide five, for a more detailed look at the first quarter results.","As I said previously, our reported sales declined 3%. The waterfall on the left-hand side of the page shows that we experienced 2 points of foreign exchange headwinds, principally the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar, a 1 point headwind from divestitures, and another point of headwind from the nonrepeating Glebe Weir project in our water transport business in Australia. We\u2019ll provide more detail on this business when discussing our flow technologies segment. ","We do not believe we were alone in seeing a slow start to the year, with weaker revenue in January and February, but the majority of our business has experienced nice revenue acceleration in March and early April has seen many of those trends continue. ","The right half of the page shows first quarter Pentair operating profit and margin. Operating margin expansion of 170 basis points was helped in large part by strong productivity, which includes synergies. As we have discussed in the past, in order to deliver on our targeted margin expansion of 150 basis points per year, we need to deliver on both base productivity and synergies, so we track them together.","We continue to gain momentum on both Lean and sourcing initiatives, and we identified 18 focus factories that we expect to drive additional margin gains in 2014. As we\u2019ve experienced additional top line challenges, we took further repositioning actions in the first quarter to accelerate our productivity results.","Overall, while we are not satisfied with our top line performance in the first quarter, we continue to deliver on productivity and synergies and see strengthening of the top line as we enter the seasonally strong period for our residential and commercial businesses. Our backlog gives us further confidence in our expectation for an accelerating top line growth rate in the second half of the year as well.","Now let\u2019s turn to slide six, for a performance review of our largest segment, valves and controls. Valves and controls organic sales declined 7%, which followed strong double-digit growth in the fourth quarter 2013. This segment has shown a great deal of variability quarter to quarter, and we will continue to seek improvements in our forecast for the top line.","One of the ways we\u2019re doing that is by looking at longer periods for comparisons and evaluations. For instance, if we combine the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, and compare that six-month period to its prior year comparable, sales show growth of 5% year over year as compared to the 19% gain in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the 7% decline in the first quarter of this year.","A fair amount of the quarter to quarter swing relates to timing of large project shipments, but we also experienced a fair amount of variability in our shorter cycle business. All four industries served by valves and controls posted a decline, with sharp drops in power and mining. ","The declines in oil and gas were principally related to the timing of large project shipments, while the power decline came from weaker nuclear demand. We did see some softness earlier in the quarter on our overall short cycle business, but service showed solid growth in the quarter. ","The right half of the page shows fourth quarter valves and controls operating profits and margins. Adjusted operating margins expanded 140 basis points to 11.5%, which included $5 million in costs for the GBU\u2019s operating model transformation, or OMT.","As a reminder, we expect the OMT investment in valves and controls to continue on an annual basis through 2016, and that investment is expected to drive nearly $80 million of annual operating income savings once completed, and an overall tax benefit to Pentair of roughly 3 points due to the optimization of the global valves and controls structure in Switzerland.","Now let\u2019s turn to slide seven for a look at the orders and backlogs for valves and controls. As you can see on slide seven, the valves and controls backlog is broken down into four key industries, three of which fall into our energy vertical, oil and gas, power, and mining, and one in our industrial vertical, which is process industries.","Overall backlog remained near $1.4 billion, which is relatively consistent with where it has been since we acquired the business near the end of 2012. Orders were relatively flat in process, oil and gas, and mining, but power showed a sharp decline in orders.","We\u2019ve experienced a fair amount of quarter to quarter variability in sales and orders within oil and gas, but we still see healthy quoting activity. Industrial process is still expected to benefit from increased capital spending related to anticipated growth in North American chemical capacity. We anticipate this will be more of a second half and 2015 benefit for our valves and controls business. ","Power remains a wildcard, but the backlog remains relatively consistent, and despite the quarter to quarter volatility in orders, we expect shipments to pick up later in the year. We remain very cautious on mining, but this is the smallest portion of valves and controls.","Now let\u2019s move to slide eight for a review of process technologies. We indicated on our fourth quarter earnings call that we would begin to report in four segments, as our previous water and fluid solutions segment was split into process technologies and flow technologies. As a reminder, process technologies comprises our filtration and process and aquatic systems GBUs.","Process technologies reported good top line growth of 5%, which included a 1 point FX translation headwind. Both the residential and commercial and food and beverage verticals grew at a double digit rate, building on the momentum we saw in this business last year.","The right half of the page shows first quarter process technologies operating profit and margins. Operating margins expanded a disappointingly modest 10 basis points to 11.7% as a result of two principal factors during the quarter. First, we saw strong shipments of larger system sales in our beverage business, which as we indicated last quarter has a dilutive impact on the overall segment results, as these systems carry lower margins on initial installs, but they\u2019re important to building an installed base to drive higher margin replacement sales in the future.","Second, our residential filtration business experienced a slow January that resulted in poorer operating leverage than normal that month, followed by a strong increase in demand in March, which led to overtime and some expedited freight. We expect more normalized sales trends and greater operating margin expansion in the seasonally strong second quarter.","Now let\u2019s move to slide nine for a look at flow technologies. This is the first quarter that we\u2019ve reported our flow technologies segment, which as a reminder is a combination of the legacy Pentair flow technologies business and the Australian water business that was part of legacy Flow Control.","As expected, we saw a sharp decline in flow technologies, with sales down 7% on a reported basis. There were two main causes of this decline. We saw a 4 point headwind from the Australian dollar and another 4 point headwind from the nonrepeating Glebe Weir project in 2013. We\u2019ll discuss the impact of the Australian water transportation further on the next slide. The legacy flow technologies businesses actually saw modest growth in the quarter. ","The right half of the page shows first quarter flow technologies operating profits and margins. Operating margins expanded 50 basis points to 9.9% as the impact of no project activity in Australia and the tough comp it created was nearly a full point of margin headwind in the quarter.","We continue to aggressively rightsize the cost structure of the Australia water transport business to reflect the reality of a much different looking business today than was expected over a year ago. We continue to see strong productivity in the other parts of flow technologies, and the repositioning benefits are helping to partially offset the sharp declines experienced in water transport.","Let\u2019s now turn to slide 10 for additional color on our water transport business. Given the dramatic decline in water transport, we thought it would be helpful to explain how much of an impact the decline in the Australian economy has had on this business. ","When the mining industry was strong, in 2012, and there were a number of large projects in Australia, this business generated over $550 million of revenue. This is about the average revenue over the five year period five years prior to 2012, with the peak around $715 million in 2010.","At the time of the Flow Control acquisition, based on projects booked and being bid, this business was anticipated to generate over $800 million in 2015. We knew, based on the backlog and the debooking of two large projects shortly after the acquisition, that we were facing a decline in 2013, but this business has faced a significant lack of projects that has led to further declines in 2014 to historically low levels.","We\u2019ve been aggressively going after restructuring in this business, but there is a fixed cost element that, on these lower sales, is creating earning headwinds in 2014. As shown in the slide, the second quarter is the last expected large headwind, and this is likely to lower our overall EPS in the quarter by $0.08.","It\u2019s not realistic to expect this business to rebound anytime soon, as demand from China on the mining industry remains low and municipal investments just aren\u2019t happening. We\u2019ve taken significant costs out of this business and the tough year over year comps diminish in the second half of the year.","A decline in Australia of this magnitude was not foreseen, but it in no way does it lead us to back off of our commitment of $5 of EPS in 2015. We\u2019ve stepped up the restructuring activities and driving up side performance in other businesses, and we continue to drive productivity and synergies across all of Pentair to help offset this lingering headwind. We\u2019ll keep you posted on our progress.","Let\u2019s now turn to slide 11 for a look at the technical solutions results. Technical solutions sales grew 1% in the quarter, but price and volume contributed 3 points of growth, offset by 1 point of headwinds from FX and another point from divestitures. ","As a reminder, we sold our [unintelligible] specialty motors business in the first quarter last year, so this divestiture comparison goes away in the second quarter. This is the second consecutive quarter of growth that technical solutions has delivered following declines in the first nine months of 2013. ","We saw growth in the industrial, residential, commercial, and infrastructure verticals while energy declined in the quarter. After a slow start to the year, we saw daily orders rates in our electrical business accelerate in March, and this trend has continued into early April. The cold weather in the U.S. did have some benefits for our thermal business, but Europe experienced unseasonably warm weather, and we saw weakness in Canada offsetting that. At the same time, our electronics business has benefited from improving demand and new products. ","The right half of the page shows first quarter technical solutions operating profits and margins. Margins were a great story yet again, as adjusted operating margins expanded 210 basis points to 19.1%, with strong productivity, synergies, and operating leverage all on display during the quarter. While thermal is entering its seasonally slowest quarter, our equipment protection and electronics businesses are seeing improved momentum entering the second quarter. ","Let\u2019s now turn to slide 12 for a closer look at the total Pentair growth profile. First quarter saw solid performance in the U.S. and Western Europe, weakness in Canada and Australia, and mixed signals in fast growth regions. In the U.S., we continue to see strength in residential and commercial. In Western Europe, we saw a modest recovery. In the fast growth regions, the Middle East declined due to timing of one large project. We still expect strong growth for the full year. Southeast Asia remains mixed, and we continue to see growth in China and Latin America. ","Our residential and commercial and food and beverage verticals remain the bright spots. We still expect growth in all of our verticals except infrastructure, which is weighted down by the weakness in Australia. Energy continued its trends of lumpiness with a first quarter decline, following a 15% gain in the fourth quarter of 2013. First quarter weakness was principally related to the power declines in valves and controls, as we discussed earlier. ","We continue to see strength in oil and gas quoting activity, so we expect to see low single digit growth in energy for the year. Industrial was down modestly in the quarter, with the improvement in our electrical daily orders rate and the continued strong quoting around the anticipated North American chemical manufacturing renaissance gives us increased confidence that industrial will grow at a modest pace for the full year.","We\u2019re entering the seasonally strongest period for our North American residential businesses, which follows another strong mid-single digit growth quarter for this vertical. We also saw improvements in both the European and China residential markets and our businesses exposed to commercial construction are also seeing signs of improvement.","Infrastructure remains the weakest vertical, but again, this is due exclusively to Australia. Our North American break and fix business remains steady. We\u2019ve seen a bottoming in desalination, and datacom, telecom, electronics has bounced off the bottom, as evidenced by a second consecutive quarter of strong growth.","Food and beverage is expected to see solid mid-single digit growth this year, which follows strong double-digit growth last year. We expect continued slowness in our U.S. agriculture related businesses, both irrigation pump and crop spray OEM, but the aftermarket piece in cross spray remains solid. Our food service business continues to experience strong international growth, and beverage systems continues to have a healthy backlog. ","Please turn to slide 13, labeled Q1 Assessment and Full Year Outlook. Before turn the call over to John to review our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2014, I wanted to offer a summary of why we remain optimistic that we\u2019re on track to deliver on our full year commitment. Our top line came in a little lower than we anticipated, but this was due in large part to a slow January and February after robust growth experienced in the fourth quarter of 2013 to end the year.","We saw strengthening in many of our businesses in March, and that has continued into early April. We will still have the Australian water transport headwind in the second quarter, but we expect this will be partially offset by the seasonal strength of our North American residential businesses.","As we look out to the second half, we\u2019re seeing signs of increased capital spending by industrial customers and a building backlog in our valves and controls business. We continue to drive our productivity and synergies and have put additional action plans in place to drive even more productivity gains. And our OMT investment in valve controls is on track. Of course, we\u2019re committed to investing in growth, which we expect to start reflecting in our results in the second half of 2014.","In addition, our balance sheet remains in great shape, and we\u2019re on track for another record year of free cash flow. Our businesses that have earned the right to grow are building their acquisition pipeline. We continue to focus on the elements where we can control our own destiny, and while we still have to earn the right to talk about growth, we believe the second quarter will represent our last difficult year over year comparison, and of course we have opportunities to drive further margin expansion into 2015 and beyond.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John.","John Stauch ","Thank you, Randy. Please turn to slide number 14, titled Q2 2014 Pentair Outlook. For the second quarter of 2014, we expect sales to be flat to down about 1%, and approximately $1.95 billion. Valves and controls are expected to be flat due to timing of current backlog and an expected ramp of short cycle orders.","Process technologies is anticipated to be up 6% to 8% in its seasonally strongest quarter. Flow technologies is expected to be down approximately 20% due to the last tough comparison in our water transport business that Randy discussed in detail earlier on the call. Excluding this project, sales should be up approximately 3%. Finally, technical solutions is expected to be up 4% to 6%, led by our equipment protection and electronics businesses.","We are expecting adjusted operating income up 6%, and adjusted operating margins to expand approximately 100 basis points to 14.7%. This includes about $7 million more of OMT investments in valves and controls and the impact of the Australian headwinds mentioned earlier. Excluding these, operating income would be up approximately 16% versus Q2 of last year. Our EPS forecast for the second quarter is a range of $1.02 to $1.05, or an increase of roughly 13%.. ","Please turn to slide 15, titled Balance Sheet and Cash Flow. Quarter end debt was approximately $2.9 billion, or $2.7 billion on a net debt basis, inclusive of global cash on hand. In the first quarter, we returned $300 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. ","At the end of the first quarter, we have now completed our initial $1.2 billion share repurchase authorization, and have just under $900 million remaining under our current $1 billion authorization. We are seeking authorization from our shareholders at our May annual general meeting to increase our dividend to $0.30 per share per quarter from $0.25 per share per quarter, which, if approved, will mark our 38th consecutive year of annual dividend increases.","Our ROIC ended the quarter at 10%. We continue to have a lot of opportunities on the working capital front with legacy Flow Control businesses, and we expect to make further progress as the year continues.","Please turn to slide number 16, labeled Full Year 2014 Pentair Outlook. We are reiterating our full year EPS guidance of $3.85 to $4.00 on approximately $7.7 billion in sales. We have moderated our growth rate by a point to a range of 2% to 4%, reflecting the impact of FX and the slower start in January.","Valves and controls is now expected to grow 1% to 3%, as backlogs remain strong and we continue to focus more on the short cycle businesses. Process technologies is expected to grow 8% to 10%, with continued strength in aquatics, beverage systems, food service, and an improving residential and commercial filtration business.","Flow technologies is anticipated to be down 5% to 7%, related to the lack of project activity in Australia, the tough comps we discussed earlier, and [unintelligible] backs. Excluding the water transport business, we expect flow technologies to grow approximately 4% to 5%.","Technical solutions is expected to grow 4% to 6%, as we signs of business improving in the North American electrical distribution channel, strength in our electronics business, and easier comps for our thermal business. We do not expect any megaproject activity in 2014, but as we have stated in the past, we will update accordingly at the appropriate time if any megaprojects enter the backlog.","Adjusted operating income is expected to expand to approximately $1.1 billion, which would represent a record for Pentair. We expect three of the four segments to expand operating margins in excess of 100 basis points, with only flow technologies not achieving that level, as we continue to aggressively rightsize the cost structure with a dramatically reduced demand environment at our water transport business. ","Overall corporate costs are expected to be down due to lower corporate integration costs. For the full year, we expect the tax rate to be around 23.5%, net interest expense to be approximately $70 million, and the share count to be around 198.5 million.","We expect EPS to expand around 22% to $3.93, at the midpoint of the guidance range. We are expecting another record year of free cash flow, with at least $850 million, or greater than 105% of net income.","Operator, can you please open the line for questions? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Robert Baird. ","Mike Halloran - Robert Baird","Let\u2019s start on the revenue guidance. It sounds like the two main pressure points, a little bit of Canada FX and maybe some volumes there, but the predominant part is the Australia side. Maybe you could just go into a little bit more detail - and by the way, great color on slide 10 on the year over year and some more water transportation information - but maybe if you could just talk about what you\u2019re seeing on the short cycle, kind of everyday business over there, as well as what the outlook on the project activity looks like, and if there are even any projects embedded in the guidance as you look forward in that specific piece today.","Randall Hogan ","The volume we get is really all small projects, maintenance. There\u2019s always some of that. That business has always had at least one or two larger projects, and then they\u2019d get big ones on top of that. This year is unprecedented in that it has none of those bigger projects. And we don\u2019t have any bigger projects coming in the forecast. So that\u2019s what\u2019s different. We thought we\u2019d get a couple of those. They went away.","Mike Halloran - Robert Baird ","And on the regular way side, how\u2019s that business? Is that a little bit worse than expected as well right now?","John Stauch ","No, that\u2019s clipping along at roughly flat or modestly up. As Randy mentioned, primarily a break in fix or reestablishing fixing things that are already installed. That business has always been relatively steady. But it\u2019s the project business, and usually at this particular point in time, we\u2019ve always got two or three, or we at least have meaningful ones at the front [log]. We\u2019re not even seeing front log activity in Australia related to these projects.","Mike Halloran - Robert Baird ","If I take out the Australia and some of the Canada pieces and things like that, it looks like the core businesses outside of that are tracking consistent, if not ahead of your expectations, on a full year basis. You obviously have commented on some improving trends as you look through March and April here, but what gives you the confidence on the energy side that you\u2019re going to see some improvement as you work through the year there? And then also, maybe just a little bit more color about some of the end markets you\u2019re starting to see improve a little bit.","Randall Hogan ","We\u2019re getting better at seeing the businesses in our current configuration, and as we\u2019re looking at our bidding activity. In energy, bidding activity remains strong. The power surprise, nuclear valves is a nice business, and that was surprising to see the short cycle in that. So, short cycle, which is repair and maintenance, was actually weaker in the nuclear business than we would have anticipated. That was really the only surprise in energy. But the variability quarter to quarter is not that big a surprise. So we feel good about energy because of the bidding activity, and that\u2019s consistent across all of the GBUs that serve energy. ","John Stauch ","The only thing I would add to it is, I\u2019m sure like a lot of the companies you follow, our January and February slow start, March was very strong. And we\u2019ve anticipated or put in the normalized view of what we think the year\u2019s going to be, so we\u2019re obviously monitoring April, and is April tracking more like March, and how comfortable do we feel. We\u2019ll have a better picture of that, obviously, as we close out Q2. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research.","Deane Dray - Citi Research ","It looked like corporate expense came in lighter than what we were looking for, and right at the end of your prepared remarks, you commented that corporate is coming down with lower integration costs. But maybe just what were the dynamics this quarter on the corporate line that might have made it more favorable?","John Stauch ","We\u2019re looking at around 23 to 25 this year, probably closer to 23, each and every quarter. So we\u2019re about $1 million under that. We\u2019re going to have variability in things like stock comp timing, medical timing, and litigation. That\u2019s about the only variability we would have. So it wasn\u2019t a big delta. The year over year is the integration costs. We were obviously very heavy into the corporate integration last year, and you see that number reflected in over $30 million of expenses. That came down throughout last year. So most of our integration activities now are all in the businesses. So we mentioned OMT, that\u2019s being absorbed in the valves and controls business. And most of all, our Lean activities and costs that are being borne to drive the synergies that are all being managed by the businesses now.","Deane Dray - Citi Research ","And then on process tech, the margin hit, or just the margin pressure because of the mix, maybe you could just expand on that. When you ship these larger systems, is that also because you have content that\u2019s not Pentair content, and that\u2019s more of a pass-through. If you could just give us some context and color regarding those kinds of shipments, and what that outlook embedded is, for the balance of the year. ","Randall Hogan ","It\u2019s both. It\u2019s both a lower margin because the systems are direct to the OEMs or part of lower projects, and they\u2019ve always been a little bit tighter. But there\u2019s also, as we build a valves kit, or we build a [cold] block, there is a lot more purchase pass through parts. That\u2019s part of it too.","John Stauch ","But as you know, we\u2019re doing it because we\u2019ve got the memory there that within 12 to 18 months, it\u2019s going to be replaced, and we look for those aftermarket sales, and that\u2019s much higher margin. So this is the razor, if you will, and the razor blade is to come.","Deane Dray - Citi Research ","Yeah, I\u2019d much rather see you shipping these systems as solutions as opposed to component pieces. And then just a quick clarification on the nuclear business. We\u2019ve seen this elsewhere, from mothballed plants, that just would have ordered these valves that are now just being mothballed, or is it lower utilization, lower maintenance spending?","Randall Hogan ","Well, it\u2019s some of both. Germany was down, but Germany is moving away from nuclear, so those are being mothballed. So that\u2019s maintenance that isn\u2019t going to get done unless, for some reason, they open them up. At the same time, France has recommitted to another 50 year life extension for their whole nuclear fleet, and they\u2019re going to be net exporters of electricity to all of Europe. But their maintenance was lighter than we would expect. The U.S. maintenance was lighter than we would have expected.","And then there\u2019s project businesses in China and other countries that are there to ship, and they just don\u2019t ship. But the mothballing factor, we believe that we have that factored in. The surprise was more on the expected maintenance and the shipping of projects that are new installations, in countries that are building them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford C. Bernstein. ","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein","John, question for you. When you sort of now think about how long you\u2019ve had valves and controls, and the difficulty in forecasting this business, when you look within your FP&A process and talent pool, what kind of changes are you putting in place so that - I know there are big projects, I know you\u2019ve gotten certain surprises, but nonetheless, there are a lot of highly diversified companies with similar dynamics who have a maybe more mature FP&A process in businesses like this. How far away from that are you, do you think, in terms of time to get there? Or do you think it\u2019s just going to be a tough business to ever get there?","John Stauch ","I think we\u2019ll definitely get there. I mean, we talk about blue chips being top priorities here, and believe me, this is Randy\u2019s top blue chip, which means it\u2019s my top blue chip, which means it\u2019s the business\u2019s top blue chip. ","And right now, it\u2019s complicated. These acquisitions were acquired, and we basically have 40 individual businesses that really take sales in 128 different locations, and then those sales are put on the factories. And you could imagine, some of these are in stock, and some of these make the stocks, and some of these configure the order, and some of these are larger projects. ","But this is all solvable, and this is where our Lean tools really come in, and we\u2019ve initiated and kicked off that project. So there is a financial element to this, but there\u2019s also a process element that goes all the way through the sci op process. And as I mentioned, it\u2019s Randy\u2019s top priority, which means the business is all over it right now.","I can\u2019t tell you why they reach at the end of the quarter so much, like in Q4, and then you see the slowness this quarter, and then the catch up. I think that\u2019s their lack of confidence in what that shipments needs to be to manage those quarters.","Randall Hogan ","We all have experience in those kinds of businesses, in our past life, that with longer cycle, should be more predictable. That\u2019s one of the benefits of a longer cycle business. But as John said, it\u2019s a function of the fact that the businesses have not been integrated, and that\u2019s our big opportunity. That\u2019s what our OMT project is about. And beyond the OMT, to get more granular understanding of the forecasts that come in, it\u2019s not just in FP&A. It\u2019s the sales forecasting. It\u2019s an organizational capability. And we know how to do it, and we\u2019re working on it.","Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein ","And then on capital deployment, what is your willingness or desire to step up the repurchase part of the deployment over the next year or so?","John Stauch ","We definitely have the ability to. I think we will, if we need to. Right now, we\u2019d like to balance that with acquisitions, especially in the platforms that Randy mentioned [unintelligible], they\u2019re growing nicely, organically. They have a great standardized back office. And right now, there\u2019s a big willingness to have discussions around acquisition. There is an agreement on price. But that\u2019s what we\u2019d like to do, is balance this between share buyback and acquisition.","Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein ","And then this food and beverage has been a fantastic contributor now for some time, and offset a lot of weakness in other segments. As those segments start to come back, do you think food and beverage has got this sort of longer-term secular story, where it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to see that decrease as the other ones come up?","John Stauch","I don\u2019t think we can sustain 20% growth a year, but the reason we think we\u2019re more in the double digits on a long term basis is we have solved something significant for the large beverage manufacturers, which is a way to filter their product, which has become a standard element. And so as they expand the breweries or rearranged the breweries, we\u2019re a big piece of that.","The other element that\u2019s in the food and beverage is not only our ag offering, but what we believe is, you know, aquaculture and aquaponics, and a lot of other offerings. So we are focused on it. We have a lot of new product introductions there, and we have a global offering, which is really being well accepted. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O\u2019Callaghan of Nomura Securities.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura ","First, I was just wondering, I know you touched on this a little bit, but the fast growth markets have been rather lumpy in the recent quarters. Can you talk a little bit more about the moving parts there, and maybe some detail around your outlook for these regions for the rest of the year?","Randall Hogan ","The Middle East is still in a long term growth trend. We just had a really big project that shipped last year in the valves and controls business, in the Middle East. And that [unintelligible] in the Middle East looks weak. The secular trend, if you will, for our Middle East growth, is good. China has come back in residential spending. It\u2019s nice to see that again in China. And it\u2019s slowed down. And for us, that\u2019s in the water business. So we think now that that\u2019s coming back, it should continue for us. Latin America had suffered some setbacks from Brazil, but the rest of Latin America is lifting that. ","John Stauch ","I\u2019d say any time you get to see a valves number like this, you\u2019re going to see its impact. It\u2019s been our largest fast growth provider product, it\u2019s going to have a general toll on the reporting. But the underlying water businesses right now in the fast growth regions is seeing nice, sustained, consistent growth. We\u2019ve put a lot of investment and effort there, and I think I\u2019m with Randy, I think we feel like these markets continue to be better than they were last year, with the exception of Brazil, and I think we have a long term growth rate here that I call mid-single digits.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura ","And then just maybe on acquisitions, what are these main areas of priority? Do you have a range in mind when you think in terms of size, of what you\u2019d be willing to do? Or is that kind of a rolling target?","John Stauch ","We look at everything. And as I said earlier, obviously the integration effort, we\u2019d like that to be on something that\u2019s much more lean today, and could accept a larger acquisition.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase ","Just kind of a nitpicky question on the process technologies. You had two businesses that are, I guess, representing about 85% of the segment, residential, commercial, food and beverage, they were up 10%, 17% respectively. But sales were only up 5%. What was down so much in that business? Presumably, it\u2019s forex or anything like that. Am I missing something on the end market dynamics?","Randall Hogan ","It\u2019s the water purification, the business that serves desalination and just the pure water side.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase ","How big is that business?","John Stauch ","A little over $160 million annually.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase ","So it must have been down a lot.","John Stauch ","","Yeah, it\u2019s a muni play. It was down around 20% in the quarter there. And we were also slightly down in our energy, which is more of a timing issue, and when those shipments will go out. That was down roughly 10%. That\u2019s about a $100 million a year business.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase ","And then on valves and controls, your profits were up $3 million this quarter on a pretty significant revenue decline. I think the guidance for the next quarter has kind of a similar profit on a flattish revenues. Is that like OMT flowing through? Is there something there? Why wouldn\u2019t that be better? Why wouldn\u2019t the $3 million and increase be better with flattish revenues?","John Stauch ","I actually love your question, because we feel the same way. Right now there\u2019s a couple million dollars more of OMT, and we do think that the productivity that we\u2019ve seen in the last several quarters, we believe that that\u2019s going to continue to come through here. So we\u2019re looking for that increased Lean and sourcing savings, and I think whenever you\u2019re flat, I think businesses find it hard to forecast significant operating income on flattish growth.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase ","So the OMT, I think it was $5 million in the first quarter, I think we thought it was going to be more like $7 million. I know this is nitpicking, but what\u2019s the number for the second quarter in OMT?","John Stauch ","Roughly $7 million.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase ","So you get back to that kind of run rate. And then just one last question on overall productivity. I know you\u2019ve changed the slide somewhat, but getting to about $45 million in combined productivity and synergies for the quarter, I know you\u2019re not going to give us explicit guidance, but I would assume, are the synergies on track here as far as what you had laid out on an annual basis? Are you still expecting the same amount of synergies from [unintelligible]?","John Stauch ","Absolutely. I think the piece that we absolutely know about is the restructuring, and when you take a look at what we\u2019ve done today, we\u2019ve taken roughly $200 million in charges, and that run rate on those savings would be north of $200 million. And that\u2019s the piece that we absolutely have tangible confidence that we\u2019re going to achieve. The piece that\u2019s a little harder to gauge is some Lean savings, and how much is core, and how much is synergies, especially when you need growth leverage to benefit from both, and also, on the sourcing side, how much would you have gotten anyway. But right now, I did the same math you did. We exited at $40 million. I think we picked up some incremental synergies on top of that, probably knocking on the door of close to $45 million to $50 million, from a run rate basis. And we continue to believe that we\u2019re going to escalate through the year, based upon the incremental actions we even [drilled] in Q1.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase ","But I guess the comp gets tougher on synergies year over year, into the second quarter. Is that where the restructuring comes in? You just did some restructuring and that kind of reloads that, if we want to call it a core productivity pipeline. So that does look like, in the second quarter, that that productivity, if you kind of parse those out, and use what you had guided to previously, on synergy, it does look like that steps up in the second quarter on your guidance, because the revenues are obviously weaker, but in the context of those weaker revenues, the profitability still looks pretty decent in the second quarter. So is that kind of the way to think about it, that the restructuring, if we assume that the synergies were what they were, does the restructuring kind of help that productivity number step up in the last nine months of the year?","John Stauch ","Yeah, because we\u2019re getting the restructuring, we\u2019re getting the synergies, and when we start to grow on that reduced cost structure, the leverage is very nice. And when we track this year, synergies aren\u2019t the problem. We\u2019re slightly underperforming on the core, and that\u2019s related to the revenue. We\u2019re also utilizing those incremental synergies, as you know now, to cover the water transport impact. And we anniversary that in Q2, so I feel like we\u2019re well positioned on restructuring and when we get the growth, we\u2019re going to see some pretty nice leverage. ","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase ","Is this it for restructuring for the year? Are you guys done for the year?","John Stauch ","We expect to be done by the end of Q2.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase ","Okay, so it will be more than $22 million or $23 million or something like that. ","John Stauch ","I think they\u2019ll carry over into Q2, correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski with MKM Partners.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners ","First question, on slide 10, that\u2019s helpful color, but did any of that come together or become more clear as we worked through Q1. I guess as I look at that, a lot of that seems like it could have been more helpful to point out last quarter. So I\u2019m just wondering how much of that is more of a recent revelation in terms of sizing up some of those things.","Randall Hogan ","Well, it\u2019s not recent. As we were doing the restructuring, one of the things we knew was this business was one of the reasons we wanted to consolidate GBUs, is we want to take out cost structure around businesses that just didn\u2019t need the cost structure, and couldn\u2019t afford the cost structure. The new information is the fact that the expected additional one or two projects just aren\u2019t materializing. It was at that point we realized, this is something we should share. It\u2019s not a surprise. What\u2019s a surprise is the fact that none of the projects that would be reasonably expected, and that were actually being talked about, have materialized as real projects. ","John Stauch","This isn\u2019t a highly configured business. It\u2019s apparently a standard product that goes into our factories that maintain a fairly high fixed cost structure. So when you get a project, you can usually start shipping it within 30 to 60 days. And so this is the season that we usually see those projects enter at least the front log, if not the back log. And what Randy\u2019s saying is, we don\u2019t even see them in the front log, let alone the back log. So this was the time we felt we needed to share with you guys what we\u2019re absorbing in the rest of the base business. ","Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners ","And then just shifting over to valves and controls, it seems like there\u2019s a bit of a gap forming between pretty healthy quoting activity or tone from customers and orders that I think have hit a new low since, on a quarterly basis, since you guys took over the business. ","And then I guess the same question on backlog versus shipment. Backlog seems like it\u2019s pretty healthy, and you get these persistent delays. What am I missing? Or what is the gap there? Is it walking away from unprofitable business, like you guys had talked about? Is it a forecasting\/timing issue that you\u2019re still getting your arms around? I guess are there any other unintended consequences of this transformation, like sales force attrition or anything else? ","John Stauch ","Not seeing that. We\u2019re feeling the same optimism in the market that everybody else is talking about. Last Q2, we had a difficult orders quarter. We saw a little bit of recovery in Q4 of last year. And I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re at a historical low, but we\u2019re not ecstatic about the Q1 orders. But if you take the March order rate, it was relatively strong.","So I think we\u2019re hearing the same optimism in the market, and we\u2019re expecting that quoting activity to turn orders, and we\u2019re tracking this to a weekly order rate, and looking at the variances and doing our root cause countermeasures. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any systematic issue to what you\u2019ve asked. I think it\u2019s a matter of getting this capital investment spent, and getting those projects put into place.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners ","Is there anything else outside of nuclear, which sounds like it was a bit of a short cycle surprise in Q1, from a short cycle perspective, that was particularly underwhelming in the first quarter. I guess you\u2019ve seen energy bounce around in general. Any other kind of quick lead time\u2026","Randall Hogan ","Well, yeah, on the short cycle. We have probably the lowest conversion of, if you will, short cycle orders in quarter four quarter the business has seen in a while. And mining affected that too. If the mine\u2019s open, it\u2019s going to have maintenance. And so that was lower than we would have expected. So I would say it\u2019s both power and mining.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America. ","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Just a question on markets and how should I look at performance? It seems that nuclear was a little bit weaker. Mining was weaker, Australia was weaker. If we strip that out, and if we look at the forecast, what else has changed? And what are the positives and what are the negatives? Just another level down. ","John Stauch ","Yes, Europe remains a slight positive. They did have a warm winter, as Randy mentioned. We had a thermal business that obviously was impacted, but the rest of our other businesses we saw a slight benefit from that warm weather.","Randall Hogan ","Yeah, it seems to be stable and heading up.","John Stauch ","The U.S. continues to do really well in the market. Canada was a little weaker this time. And Southeast Asia and China, as Randy mentioned, as well as the Middle East, from a core basis, are good, solid markets right now.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","","You also highlighted the fact that you have some overtime in March. Is there enough time to catch up, given the construction season? Or do you think we now basically have to wait until\u2026","Randall Hogan ","That comment was really specifically to the process technologies segment, and particularly the water purification or U.S. residential. It was the U.S. residential and European residential comment. And no problem catching up.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Are we going to catch up in the second quarter, or do we have to wait until the second half?","Randall Hogan ","No, it\u2019s building now. The second quarter and third quarter are the residential quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jeffries.","Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company ","I calculated about $76 million of productivity plus synergies, which would be net of the pricing. I think you indicated that you did about $40 million of synergies in the quarter, which would suggest, if my math is right, about $36 million of productivity, which on the sales base, is over 200 basis points. Is my math about right on that?","John Stauch ","Yeah, I think I\u2019d say about $50 million in synergies, but your $26 million is right. And then obviously some of that\u2019s going to offset the inflation. So we always look at two elements. We want price to offset inflation. We want productivity to offset inflation in the core. Sometimes we don\u2019t always get there perfectly, but that\u2019s our targeted actions. And so we\u2019re always looking to offset that inflation rate on the [unintelligible] core productivity. ","But yeah, we\u2019re seeing that strength of operating performance, seeing good cost structure, good cost discipline management. And that\u2019s why Randy and I are optimistic when we see the growth, we\u2019re going to get that leverage. And the growth is frustrating, because we have 20 product technology platforms, half of them are growing. ","And when we talk about growing, they\u2019re growing high single-digits. And we\u2019ve got a couple of these platforms that are in significant contraction mode. The good news is, most of the ones like water transport aren\u2019t our highest margin, but some of the ones that are growing are higher margin, and so that\u2019s part of that positive mix we expect to see as well.","But I think your math is generally correct, yes.","Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company ","I\u2019m actually calculating off that adjustment about 150 basis points of productivity, which is still 50 basis points above what your target is. So I just wanted to confirm that. The next question is really more of a question for you, Randy. And you know, once out of every three or four quarters, there\u2019s some questions surrounding the top line that maybe should have been maybe a couple of points higher. Could you maybe talk about some of the things that you\u2019re doing to maybe address some of the vagaries that you see in sales from time to time across the businesses? Anything that you\u2019re hatching that\u2019s new to start to build on the critical mass that you now have in this company?","Randall Hogan ","You know, we\u2019ve gone from seven GBUs to five. And then underneath the five, John mentioned that we\u2019ve identified and defined and staffed 20 platforms, focused platforms, to manage profitable growth, so that we can make sure that we\u2019re flowing the resources to our best opportunities. And we just put that in place at the beginning of this year. And John can say what he just said, which is we really do understand which ones are leveraging us for growth, and which ones are laggards, and what do we do about it.","So we have much more granularity to that. At the same time, we\u2019ve invested in a growth function, and we\u2019re very much targeting that right now to get a better handle on the forecasting ability in valves and controls. ","And so really, our focus right now is on growth and our growth processes. We\u2019re building the competencies and capabilities for growth that we have built in Lean. It\u2019s taken us 13 to 14 years to get where we are on Lean, but we are among the companies that are, if I dare say so, great at it. We don\u2019t tend to take that long in growth. We\u2019ve been working on it for a couple of years. We want to see more results, more sustained results. And one of the benefits, on the flipside, of being a narrowly diversified company, is we\u2019re able to still execute and perform to promises, even when stuff happens. ","And growth is clearly the number one agenda for me. It\u2019s the number one agenda for the company. And that\u2019s really where I\u2019m putting all my focus right now, to make sure we are funding the right things. We need to get the average growth rate up to the low end of what we believe is possible. The profit potential is amazing. The best driver of productivity is growth, operating leverage. We get that. And so between the organization changes we made, between the way we\u2019re flowing resources and we\u2019ve changed resources, it\u2019s all about to drive a more sustained growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets ","Just kind of back on the guidance, and maybe a follow-on to what another caller was asking about, just within your guidance range, you seem like you\u2019re talking about more negatives than positives. And I\u2019m just wondering if I\u2019m not picking up on any kind of positive offsets within the number, whether it be lower corporate expense or some additional restructuring savings that you get later in the year. Or should we just be taking our numbers down a little bit within the range? ","John Stauch","I think we\u2019re looking at a couple of things. We were hopeful that water transport would recover, but we didn\u2019t plan on it happening. We never really gave Q2 guidance, so within our plans, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re bringing up anything new today within water transport. We\u2019re just sharing with everybody that we doubt it\u2019s going to recover back to historical levels and be any positive contributor past the $3.85 to $4.00 that we\u2019re giving.","We continue to work all those restructuring actions, which are more than offsetting the water transport headwind, and we feel very confident that we\u2019re building the growth process, as Randy said, that is going to generate the growth that\u2019s going to give us the leverage. So right now we feel like we\u2019re being really balanced. ","Obviously, we\u2019re managing the corporate expenses for two reasons. One is we\u2019re keeping the spending lower as a contingency, but the other reason is there\u2019s a lot to absorb in the business right now in integration, and they don\u2019t need more initiatives on top of what they\u2019re already driving. ","So those are all the normal things that a business goes through, this cycle. But I think we feel like we\u2019re on plan for the year, and we feel like we\u2019ve got enough positives to offset the negatives. Things have been a little bit more choppy in the external markets. I don\u2019t think anybody anticipated a slower start to January. I think we scrambled, like most companies, to make that all up, absorb those costs within our productivity in Q1 as well. So I think you\u2019re just hearing a balanced view from us, Jeff.","Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets ","And then just on this bidding activity, when do you think you start to see that acceleration in the order book?","Randall Hogan ","[crosstalk] better, and expecting the second half to start seeing some shipments from it.","John Stauch","Randy\u2019s put the business on a weekly pulse cycle. If you want to take a look at orders and you want to look at your front log, which is a manageable process, to have visibility into what\u2019s coming, they you want to have a predictability on the hit rate, you want to turn that into what you expect your daily orders rate would be, and what you want to see is a day to day improvement against that. And clearly, given what we saw in valves in Q1, that\u2019s where Randy\u2019s got the business target in Q2. And we all have visibility into how we\u2019re doing against that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg from Vertical Research. ","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners","Just coming back to valves and controls, it sounds like you are optimistic that you will start to see a better ordering environment, but I guess I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re getting any indications as far as the pricing of the early surge in potential orders coming to market. Typically when we see these types of cycles, it does get pretty price competitive in the beginning, and then [unintelligible] takes place, it gets better. So I guess from what you see today, do you see pricing pressure potential associated with the early projects and how disciplined do you expect to be associated with those dates?","John Stauch ","I think oil and gas, as we said before, will always have a price element there that\u2019s the most competition in that space. I think the thing that we\u2019re looking at now is based upon our substantial productivity that we\u2019ve driven, we have to have the confidence to maybe take a little bit lower gross margin knowing that we can drive the productivity in those projects. ","I can\u2019t tell you that we\u2019ve lost anything over price, though. But we want to have that type of visibility to know that if we are this confident we can continue to get the productivity, does that open up an increased order book for us? Randy, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any of that element.","I\u2019d also say that a window that we have as well is we have an [unintelligible] and controls business, which serves our competition, the whole industry. And I can assure you that based upon their performance in the quarter, it doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve lost share. So we have an inside view to the rest of the world in the valve space. We are still the world\u2019s leading valves and control player, so we feel we\u2019re involved in every project. And we feel like we\u2019re going to win our fair share here.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners ","And then just moving over to working capital. That was a little bit more of a headwind than I thought it would be in the first quarter. Is it just related to the cadence of how activity progressed through the quarter? ","","Randall Hogan ","You know, we had more stuff that would have sold in January that we would have got cash for. But it just wasn\u2019t balanced in terms of the usual mix of sales by month. The quarter always is a cash usage quarter for us, just because of the nature of the business. ","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners ","And I know you\u2019ve made comments before on bringing working capital from Flow Control down to more in line levels with legacy Pentair. Is that a benefit you expect you\u2019ll see in 2014? And I guess how much more typical does that become if the cycle is starting to get going?","John Stauch ","No, I think we made great progress in \u201913. We still have a long way to go, but I think we expect to make another big jump forward here in 2014. It\u2019s just receivable discipline. It\u2019s inventory disciplines, and it\u2019s tracking it and managing it, and holding people accountable to it. No, we think we\u2019re still going to make progress, even with growth in the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.","Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus ","A couple questions on the short cycle oil and gas business. You talked about in your prepared comments that there\u2019s more variability in that business than you thought there was going to be. I think we all understand the timing issues in the long cycle business, but what\u2019s behind their variability in that business, in your opinion?","John Stauch ","What I was saying was, in this quarter, we saw a lower short cycle business. That was a surprise, frankly, that, if you will, book in the quarter, ship in the quarter was the lowest conversion that we\u2019ve seen going back in history since before we owned it. And it just seems like that in our area, in our installed base, that there was a little bit of a slow start. And I don\u2019t know if that was weather related in the U.S. There\u2019s a lot to conjecture, but I can\u2019t give you root cause analysis on it. But we\u2019re certainly focused on it. That\u2019s one of the things that, as John mentioned, we have some new disciplines in terms of weekly reviews on order rates. It\u2019s one of the things I think we\u2019re watching to understand better. So I wouldn\u2019t say that that\u2019s something that was worse in the first quarter than we have seen.","Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus ","","At this point, are you able to say that you expect that conversion rate to improve?","Randall Hogan ","We would expect it to revert to the mean. That short cycle business is largely replacement. You know, as long as the refineries are running, as long as work is being done, products get worn out. So it\u2019s the kind of thing you wouldn\u2019t expect to have a high percent of deviation around the mean.","John Stauch ","One of the things that we\u2019ll have a clearer picture as we conclude the year, Randy and I both have a lot of experience in long cycle businesses. And when you get into project and maintenance related businesses, Q1 is usually the lowest quarter and Q4 is usually the highest quarter. So one of the conjectures is, the high rate of book and ship in Q4 of last year impacted the low rate of book and ship in Q1, but they were on a different fiscal year. Really shouldn\u2019t be an element of difference. Quarters should be quarters. And you should be responding to whatever the customer demands are. And so we should probably see a more normalized cycle with Q1 being the lowest shipment quarter, Q4 being the highest shipment quarter. And we\u2019ll see how that plays out this year. But that\u2019s what Randy and I are expecting, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve forecasted.","Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus ","And you also said that you expect the ramp in short cycle oil and gas as the year goes on, I know we\u2019ve heard similar things from other companies. Can you just provide a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing out there that gives you that confidence?","Randall Hogan ","Well, again, it\u2019s the bidding activity, and it\u2019s the quoting activity that gives us that confidence.","Nathan Jones - Stifel Nicolaus ","Are we seeing those turn into orders in a timely fashion?","John Stauch","That\u2019s what we continue to track, which I was talking earlier about. We want to make sure that we\u2019re looking at those hit rates, we\u2019re looking at the time in the cycle, from the time that the bidding goes into the front log to when it converts to an order. And we obviously have a lot more data and much more track record now that Randy and I can push the business to see. We are very optimistic as the market is, and we\u2019re tracking those orders. And our expectation is April is a big step up from March, and right now we\u2019re not off of that expectation.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse. ","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse","On valves and controls, can you just remind us what share of sales is aftermarket short cycle sales over there and how much of the growth in that business is driven by share gain? And also, some pretty quick update on if you\u2019re seeing any revenue synergies coming through, or any color on that front?","John Stauch ","Roughly we would expect a normal cycle to be somewhere around 50% to 60% into what we call the installed base. And that\u2019s mostly like for like replacement against whatever spec you won, for the most part. And then the rest would be a major expansion and\/or some type of greenfield application. Obviously, when you\u2019re on large project types of cycles, it probably shifts to more 40% in the installed and 60% elsewhere. ","The second part of your question, on sales synergies, we continue to be able to take these 20 product platforms, now that we have the visibility, and those that are strong in energy, try to pull the rest with them. And we continue to be excited about the pull through opportunities that a leading product provider has to bring the rest of our product technologies through product. So we\u2019re as excited about that opportunity as when we acquired [unintelligible].","Randall Hogan ","All right, thank you very much. "]}}
