Good afternoon everyone the Ulta Beauty team delivered very strong fourth quarter results capping an exceptional year of sales and earnings growth. While investing to drive market share gains and create substantial long-term shareholder value.","Let me start with the quick review of the headwinds for the fourth quarter. We grew the top-line 24.6% and delivered 16.6% comps on top of 12.5% comps in the fourth quarter of 2015 driven by strong traffic and ticket growth. Multiple factors strength across our product offerings, our best-in-class loyalty programs, great in store execution, investing in marketing and labor and steadily improving supply chain capabilities all work together to driver seller growth across both our retail and online business.","E-commerce growth exceeded our plan driven by strong traffic and outstanding fulfillment execution during the holiday. Our services continue to gain share as we grow our business with existing guest and acquire new ones, significantly outpacing industry growth. In contrast with above plan sales growth, earnings per share growth of 32.5% also exceeded our expectations.","Before I guide with the detailed review of the fourth quarter, I would like to highlight some of our key accomplishments for the full year. In fiscal 2016 we drove top-line growth of 23.7% and earnings growth of 30.9% well above our expectations at the beginning of the year achieving robust market share gains, solid execution and strong flow through on better than expected sales. We achieved a 15.8% comps with 13.4% comps in-stores and 56.2% growth in e-commerce with healthy traffic and tick growth each quarter during the year.","Underlying this financial performance with a many significant accomplishments we achieved as we executed against our six strategic imperatives. We opened 100 net new stores and continue to deliver very healthy new store productivity. We completed more than 500 prestige brand expansions across new and existing stores and also executed update to the Ulta Beauty collection, fragrance area and nail fixtures.","We added 69 new brands to our portfolio, reflecting the fact that Ulta Beauty is a great place for our brand partners to grow. We grew active membership in our loyalty program by 5.2 million members to 23.4 million active members, an increase of 28%. We increased our aided brand awareness to 86% as we continue to drive marketing effectiveness and efficiency.","We launched our - successfully launched our Ulta Beauty credit card program. We continue to improve our supply chain capabilities, successfully opening a new DC in Dallas and further ramping the Greenwood DC we opened in 2015.","Finally, we also seamlessly implemented several new core merchandising systems, which will improve our capabilities across merchandise planning and forecasting, as well as stage planning allocation, driving higher in stock as we continue to grow. I am so proud of this team and the traffic year we delivered. I\u2019d now like to go into a little bit more detail on some of the key drivers specific to our fourth quarter performance.","Starting with our first strategic imperative which is acquire new guests and deepen loyalty of existing guests. We increased asset membership in our ultimate rewards loyalty program by 1.7 million members during the quarter, driven by compelling marketing communication and excellence conversion in-store. We continue to see strength in retention rates, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average members\u2019 ticket. Our loyalty program allows us to execute compelling serum campaigns, which drove incremental sales and margin.","We also more than doubled our share play campaign delighting our guest with free gift who are driving additional sales. Our ultimate rewards credit card program exceeded expectations, driven by above planned new account sign up and higher average sales for cardholder. We also experience very strong gift card sales contributing to our sales momentum after the holidays.","This spring we plan to launch Ulta Beauty gift cards in major grocery chains across the country, which will allow us to reach thousands of locations with the new point of presence for the brand.","Our team successfully executed on three key events during the fourth quarter. Holiday, our hair care jumbo size promotion and our signature love your skin event. For the holiday season, we launched new creative for our television and radio ads, centered on our Joy To The Girl campaign, which was integrated across all touch points.","We increased our TV, digital video and cinema ads and dramatically increased impressions with content partnerships with POPSUGAR, Refinery 29, Caf\u00e9 Media and E-news Freestyle. We also made a big impact with social media with our Joy It Forward integration, delighting our connoisseurs [ph] and ultimately reward members with custom beauty boxes.","Post-holiday we refined our long standing and very popular hair care event featuring bitter and jumbo size product to drive sales and margin improvements with the fresh approach that sharpen the appeal and impacted of the event.","We also adjusted the cadence of the marketing and added radio advertising. These are other modifications let to be most successful leader event in our history, with strong growth across our largest brands both in-store and online.","Our business was very strong in January as well anchored by our successful Love Your Skin event, which drove growth in both mass and prestige skin care. We focused our communications and merchandising to help our guest truly understand the benefits and features of the brands and products within the skin care arena, which can sometimes be overwhelming to navigate in light of the complexity of the category.","De-mystifying skincare was a key theme throughout our marketing massaging, as we highlighted regimens for various skincare type it help guest discover our bestselling product.","On the merchandizing front we continue to see trends similar to the preceding quarters during the year, with prestige cosmetics leading the way, but with strength across all major categories and newness contributing significantly to our performance. Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Too Faced, Tarte, Anastasia, Clinique, Lanc\u00f4me, [indiscernible] Ardell, Real Techniques and the Ulta Beauty collection were notable among the best performing brands for the quarter with all brands providing terrific newness for the holiday season.","While cosmetics were the biggest comp driver in the quarter, we gained market share across all major categories, skincare both mass and prestige accelerated this quarter with strength in mass continuing interest in Korean beauty trends and the recent addition of three major new brands Proactiv and Shiseido and Origins contributing strong growth as they ramp up in the assortment. The power of social media influencers are driving particular strength in prestige skincare brands like Mario Badescu and Peter Thomas Roth.","Our own Ulta Beauty collection performed very well in the quarter, benefiting from upgrades to in-store presentation, formulations and packaging all rolled out earlier in the year and from new product positions in popular holiday kit.","Looking ahead we are excited to announce today a new partnership with the Estee Lauder Companies. We'll be launching their MAC brand online in early May and will begin to rollout MAC to stores starting in June and continuing throughout the year. We plan to reach more than 100 stores in 2017 including the majority of new stores opening in the second half of the year.","MAC is the number one prestige makeup brand in the U.S. and one of the strongest brands in America. MAC has along their one of our guest more reflected brands in its addition to our assortment helped us reach and better serve audiences that are important to us including Teams, Millennial and diverse customers.","The highlight is strong positioning as a makeup artistry brand we plan to offer MAC makeup services at all stores in which we rollout the brand. The service components of the MAC offering is yet another example of how we're able to enhance and differentiate the shopping experience and drive traffic to our stores.","Turning to the services business, salon sales increased 15.2% and comps 8.8% with strength in hair color and makeup services. Color services got a boost from the launch of Redken pH-Bonder a color additive that better protects the integrity of the hair during color services. In skin, MICROZONE services were a standout as the targeted promotion drove new guest acquisition.","We continue to evolve our marketing strategy by utilizing our CRM and loyalty programs to simplify offers to attract new guests to the salon, while still driving great value and great experience. In addition to continuing their participation in New York Fashion Week, the Ulta Beauty our testing team recently styled the hair of the dancers performing at the Super Ball Half Time show with Lady Gaga, garnering significant exposure on social media and continuing to raise our profile as a hair authority.","Our Benefit Brow boutiques continue their strong performance with brow services now available in about 850 stores. Benefit Brow bars complemented their services business with product newness, including exciting product launches in the lip and eye shadow categories.","Now turning to store growth, our growth and development team wrapped up a very busy year opening 25 stores in the fourth quarter to end the year with 974 stores. New store productivity remains very strong. We've recruited all the real estate sites for our 2017 store program including a handful of stores that are not in our typical suburban locations in which we'll require more capital and higher rents. These include our new store in Michigan Avenue in Chicago opened this summer, our first store in Manhattan planned for the fall and the store in the Mall of America in Minnesota.","Moving to our e-commerce business. Ulta.com sales grew 63.4% on top of 44.2% growth last year, contributing 380 basis points to our total company comps. This revenue growth was driven almost entirely by increased transactions. While total traffic growth was up almost 63% mobile traffic rose more than 90%, driven by growth in digital marketing paid channels including search, affiliates, display and Facebook.","Ulta.com's product mix continues to mirror that of our stores with strong interest in newness and trials demonstrated by the ongoing success of our online only Beauty Break and Beauty Fads, that give our guests compelling sampling opportunities.","So this was the first year that our hand supply chain capabilities allowed us to confidently go through the holiday season without travelling demand on this site, enabling sales growth well above planned. The profitability of our e-commerce business improved as a result of our more efficient fulfillment capabilities as well as the more effective promotional strategy.","Finally, I\u2019d like to update you on our supply chain operations and investments. Our supply chain team performed very well during the quarter and the team did a great job keeping up with the higher than expected demand both in-stores and online to keep in-stock levels high throughout the quarter and in particular during the holiday selling period. The Greenwood, Indiana distribution center ramped up to serve 230 stores through the holiday season and delivered 45,000 e-commerce orders per day during the peak.","Our newer Dallas building ramped to 130 stores and 25,000 e-commerce orders per day at peak. Shipping lead times continue to improve with 88% of orders shipping within 48 hours, it was an 83% improvement compared to 2015 performance. We expect to ramp the Greenwood DC to serve both the 300 stores and the Dallas DC to serve a little over 200 stores by the end of 2017.","We recently signed a lease for our West Coast distribution center in Fresno California, which we plan to open in the summer of 2018. This sixth DC will be a copy of the Dallas facility and is designed to substantially improve delivery times to the West Coast. From a systems perspective, our new forecasting replenishment system SWIFT performed as plan during the holiday period, as a result we saw higher in-stock and increased productivity of our inventory in the fourth quarter.","We also successfully implemented our new floor planning and assortment optimization tool allowing for a more analytical rigor around our assortment decision. And finally we continue to invest in foundational capabilities like our product information management system, newly deployed to all of our suppliers. This capability streamlines the catcher of our active product information directly from our brand partners. We are making good progress and we will continue to leverage these investments to improve operational performance and the guest experience.","This wraps up my review of the quarter. In sum our excellent fourth quarter results represented a strong finish to our best year yet. Our performance puts us in a unique position in the beauty industry and within the broader retail landscape to take advantage of the many opportunities before us to invest to drive the business for the long-term.","And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott, to discuss the drivers of our fourth quarter result and our outlook for the first quarter and all of 2017.","Scott Settersten ","Thank you, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Starting with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 24.6% to $1.58 billion, driven by 16.6% comparable sales and excellent new store productivity. The total company comp was composed of 10.9% transaction growth and 5.7% average ticket growth.","The retail comp of 13% was driven by 8% traffic and 5% ticket. Ticket growth was driven primarily by average selling price. The units per transaction were also up, in line with the UPT performance for the year. The salon business comped 8.8%, driven primarily by ticket growth, but also included some encouraging signs of traffic growth. The retail and salon comp combined produced a total store comp of 12.8%.","Operating margin increased 80 basis points, driven by a strong SG&A leverage. Since the components of the P&L are quite different this quarter compared to the rest of 2016, let me give you some color on the moving parts. Gross profit decreased by 10 basis points, but on a two year basis, gross profit increased 110 basis points. While we leverage six store cost on strong sales, product margins were down slightly for two primary reasons.","First and most importantly, we cycled over the elimination of a 20% our postcard promotion in Q4 of last year, resulting in similar year-over-year promotional levels versus the last several quarters when we were also able to opportunistically eliminate similar 20% of postcard promotion.","Second, channel and product mix put modest pressure on margin rate. While our e-commerce business continues to improve its overall profitability, with more efficient fulfillment capabilities ulta.com's lower gross margins had a more significant impact on the total company margin rate during the quarter. As our e-commerce channel represented a larger percentage of the business in Q4 at 10% of the mix versus 7% for the full year.","On the product mix side, growth and prestige and mass cosmetics outpaced the higher margin hair care category. And while many other prestige brands we've added recently drive sales and margin dollars, it tends to dilute margin rate.","Finally, we continued to see planned deleverage and distribution cost and supply chain investments are still weighing on gross profit as our new DCs and newly implemented systems continue to ramp-up.","Moving on to SG&A expense, we improved by 110 basis points, driven by leverage of advertising expense and corporate overhead on strong top-line performance. Offset slightly by investments in store labor related to prestige brand expansions and providing higher staffing levels and stores, particularly during the holiday.","In terms of the balance sheet, inventories increased 11.2% on a per store basis, well below the comp rate, driven by careful inventory management and better than expected sales. Capital expenditures were $93 million for the quarter, driven by our new store opening program, systems and fixtures for prestige brand expansion. CapEx for the full year was $374 million and some of the capital projects planned for the year slipped into 2017.","We ended the quarter with $415 million in cash and short-term investments. In terms of share buybacks we continue to repurchase shares in the open market as part of our 10b5-1 plan. During the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately 190,000 shares of our stock at a cost of $47.3 million.","For the full year including the accelerated share repurchase program and activity under our 10b5-1 plan, we repurchased 1.6 million shares for $344 million at an average price of about $210 per share. Share repurchases contributed about three percentage points of EPS growth for the year. As of January 28, 2017 approximately 101 million remain available under the 425 million share repurchase program announced in March of 2016.","Turning now to guidance for fiscal 2017 and the first quarter. As Mary mentioned, we are in a unique situation among retailers with our current opportunity for growth and market share gain. From this position of strength, we plan fiscal 2017 to allow us to deliver on our long range planned goal of delivering EPS growth in the low 20s percentage range, while investing in new brand, store labor, infrastructure and exciting new real estate opportunities. While continuing to grow our brand awareness and invest more aggressively in digital.","I\u2019d like to share with you a few data points and assumptions that influenced our 2017 plan. First, sales for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2016 came in much stronger than we expected. So we are starting from a much larger base than we anticipated.","We also delivered much more in margin expansion in 2016 than expected, about 60 basis point, versus our initial expectations of flat margins, due to significant sales upside to our plan, which we are not counting, aren\u2019t repeating to the same degree in 2017.","Second, we plan to rollout more Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me expansions than in our original plan. As well as other brands across the portfolio including launching MAC. This will put additional pressure on the P&L in terms of product margin rates and the startup cost of building out these brands. But these brand additions are expected to deliver incremental sales and margin dollars.","Third, we will need to continue to invest in our supply chain and systems to be competitive from an omni-channel perspective. For example we still need to play catch-up with some basic omni-capabilities like buy online and pick-up in-store. And finally as Mary described we will open a handful of non-prototypical stores like Manhattan with much higher rent than average this next year.","This is a prudent approach to testing some different types of real estate, but it will nonetheless pressure the P&L. All that said, our 2017 guidance is still and keeping with our long range plan announced at our Analyst Day in October. Our plan allows us to invest in the business to improve the guest experience, drive market share gains and deliver healthy growth and sustainable long-term shareholder value.","We plan to open approximately 100 stores all 10,000 square foot boxes. For your models we expect to open 15 stores in Q1, 25 in Q2, 40 in Q3 and 20 stores in Q4. In terms of the mix of market sizes roughly 60% will open in large and medium sized markets and 40% in small and single store markets. Mostly in power centers and community centers with about 10 in mall including the Mall of America. And five or so in urban street locations like Manhattan, Michigan Avenue in Chicago and Santa Monaca California.","About 20% will be located in new Ulta Beauty markets and 80% will be fill-in in existing market. Roughly 40% are planned in new shopping center developments versus 60% in existing centers. We plan to complete about 13 major remodels during the year we expect to grow our e-commerce business of approximately 40%, total company comps are expected to be in the 8% to 10% range.","We anticipate earnings per share growth in the low 20s percentage range including the impact of the 53rd week and assuming approximately $300 million in share buyback. Operating margin as we expected to increase modestly in 2017 in the 20 to 30 basis point range, with margin expansion building in 2018 and 2019 to reach our goal of 15% by the end of 2019.","I\u2019ve highlighted some of the major margin headwinds, but we also have many margin expansion opportunities ahead. Including continued benefits from our CRM and loyalty program, supply chain efficiencies, procurement savings and new store productivity gains. As you model out the quarters keep in mind the impact of the 53rd week in Q4 it\u2019s included in our low 20s EPS guidance.","And while it\u2019s too early to forecast exact numbers we anticipate that the extra week equates roughly to $100 million in sales or $14 million in pre-tax earnings or approximately 2% of annual earnings growth.","Turning to CapEx, in light of the additional opportunities we've evaluated we expect capital spend to be higher than our previous guidance in the range of $460 million, which is in line with 2016 CapEx as a percentage of sales. Compared to our initial plan we expect to spend more capital for stores in the non-prototypical locations like Manhattan and we are planning for higher fixture CapEx with the continued rollout of prestige brands as our access to great brands accelerated.","About $80 million has been allocated for prestige brand upgrade with about 700 expansions of Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me benefit and now MAC. Further significant investments include the Fresno distribution center, and a series of customer facing technology investments necessary to remain competitive.","On the share repurchase front, our Board of Directors recently approved a new share repurchase authorization for $425 million to replace the prior authorization, which will be cancelled. Our guidance for 2017 assumes about $300 million in share repurchase and our new authorization allows us flexibility to do more opportunistically.","Our tax rate is expected to be in line with 2016, but keep in mind the new accounting rules effective in 2017 will change how companies record the tax effects of employee stock option exercise. The tax benefit moves from the balance sheet to the P&L resulting the pontifical for increased quarter-to-quarter volatility in our EPS results. We don\u2019t expect the full year tax rate to be materially impacted. As a point of reference if we had adapted this accounting update in 2016 our effective tax rate would have been about a point or so lower.","Now moving on to specific guidance for the first quarter, we anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.244 billion to $1.265 billion versus $1.074 billion last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 9% to 11% versus 15.2% last year. E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the 14% range.","We plan to open approximately 15 new stores in the first quarter versus the 13 last year, so pre-opening is expected to be modestly higher. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.80 versus $1.45 last year. With modest leverage on both the gross profit and SG&A line and with overall operating margin expected to increase slightly. The tax rate is expected to be 37% and our fully diluted share count is estimated at $62.5 million.","Now, I will turn it over to our conference call host to moderate the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore. Please proceed.","Omar Saad","Hi, yes congratulations great quarter, great finish to the year. I know it\u2019s just the beginning of the year, I wanted to just kind of have you talk about how you think about the long-term comp guidance you gave at the Investor Day in the fall? And the initial kind of comp guidance for the year and how we should think about the fact that you\u2019re expecting 2017 comp rate to be in that 8% to 10% range versus the 7% to 9% longer term guidance you gave? And kind of what gives you confidence that this year will kind of be above that longer term trend that you expect? Thanks.","Mary Dillon","Great. Thank you, Omar. We tried to be prudent I guess and really reasonable with the guidance that we give on every dimension. We see obviously the core that we\u2019re in; we\u2019ve guided the 9%-11% for the quarter. We feel confident about the strength and what\u2019s happening in the business our ability to understand the dynamics and the levers that we have to continue to drive the results in a healthy long-term way.","So I would just say that really there is no change to the long-term guidance we always said that it would be stronger in the beginning and sort of moderate a bit out in the out years. So the 7% to 9% is the longer term and as we guided 8% to 10% for this year we feel just it\u2019s very much in our line of side and feel very confident about being able to deliver that.","Omar Saad","Thanks good luck.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephanie Wissink with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Stephanie Wissink","Thanks, good afternoon everyone and I add my congratulations as well. Mary could you talk a little bit about the brand boutique just give us a sense of the current number across the four or five brands. And then of course with the addition of MAC in that roll out how should we think about the staging and the phasing of the roll out of those brand boutiques? And if you could just remind us what the productivity is of those prestige boutiques on a relative basis to your overall store average? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Yeah I will talk about these in sort of just overall terms. First of all let me reiterate we\u2019re thrilled about the launch of MAC, we\u2019re thrilled about the progress we\u2019re making across the box in terms of brands and newness and innovation. There\u2019s a hundreds of boutiques that with brand expansions that will happen this year. We talked about that in the script I'm not going to break that out in specific deal or the productivity.","What I would say again we\u2019ve referenced it so that upfront there are some investments in terms of getting a brand up and going and these fixtures are a little bit more expensive, but they drive incremental sales and profit. And also in the long-term excellent for a brand in terms of really reinforcing Ulta Beauty as a great destination for all things beauty. So we feel very good about that current status.","Stephanie Wissink","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you our next question comes from Kelly Halsor with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed.","Kelly Halsor","Hi, everyone thank you for taking in my question and congrats on great quarter and the front year. My first or my question is really around the margin expectations and I appreciate about the color you gave, if could you just dig in a little bit more on the puts and takes as you look at gross margin versus SG&A. Should we expect the same sort of dynamics to play out as we did in 4Q given that you have fully lapsed the pulling of the coupons from last year so not really expecting much product margin expansion from here.","And then on the SG&A line could you kind of quantify the dollar amount that you spend last year around the boutiques and how that plays out in \u201817 is it going to be more or is it the same amount, any color on that would be great? Thanks.","Scott Settersten","Sure, thanks Kelly. So as far as the gross profit questions is concerned, I\u2019d say looking ahead I think that\u2019s what your pivot point is or as I look ahead to 2017 I\u2019d say gross profit largely in line with what we saw in the fourth quarter. So to your point, we are now lapping what I would call the low hanging fruit of the postcard elimination that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015 and then carrying through the first three quarters of 2016.","I will again for investors, we opportunistically took advantage of that, there is still we believe plenty of opportunity to continue to tweak our promotional and discount tactics and strategies as we look out over the long-term and with benefits of that. We\u2019re still not counting on that being a major driver of our mid-teens operating margin target here over the next couple of years.","Again as a reminder most of the benefits we see there will come from fixed store cost leverage and capturing benefits from our supply chain investments. So still very confident in our long range target there.","As far as the SG&A is concerned, we really don\u2019t get into the details of the boutiques and how much they cost and exactly the productivity, but rest assured you see the results of that in our comp results, right. I mean that\u2019s part and parcel of what we doing continue to invest in the store environment, which again is our important investment.","It\u2019s one of the reasons we are able to drive such healthy traffic gains to our stores right continue to invest in that to keep it fresh and exciting and fun for our guest. So we believe these are great investments for now and for long into the future.","Kelly Halsor","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Jason Gere","Okay, thanks. I guess I got a question that I get from a lot of investors and then basically more of the male investors. So bear with me on this question. Can you just talk about the beauty enthusiasts and I know that they are really the ones who are driving a lot of excitement in some of these new startup brands. So as it means to drive sales, so can you talk about the sustainability of the beauty enthusiast?","So I guess the question I am going to ask is really about the advertising that you are putting in-store, the support you give. So really it feels like a lot of some of these brands that you are carrying are getting a lot of just word of mouth traction YouTube, support et cetera. So can you maybe educate the male audience out there about, beauty enthusiasts and your confidence that these enthusiasts can really continue to drive a lot of the excitement that\u2019s going on in some of your key categories?","Mary Dillon","We would be very enthusiastic to teach more about the enthusiasm. But honestly I\u2019ll ask Dave Kimbell to add, I just want to stay that\u2019s actually one of the core reasons and one of the core foundations that why we feel very confident about our long-term prospects is our understanding of the segment, the size of the segment and the momentum. So I let Dave take it from here.","Dave Kimbell","Yes, we have spent a lot of time really trying to understand her behavior in our beauty enthusiast I think we shared at the Analyst Day, just some information about her, she makes up about 57% of total women in the marketplace, which drives a disproportionate amount of the revenue in the category.","So to your point is critical that we continue to find way to connect with her, we are very optimistic about her long-term engagement in the category, in fact every indicator we have is shows that she is just getting more engage and that\u2019s largely due to the relatively new tools that she has at her disposal through social media and the YouTube and the ability to learn more to share more to be more engaged in makeup and hair trends and skin trends.","So she is not demographically defined we see that across all ages, from teen agers through millennials all the way up from an age from an ethnicity standpoint, it\u2019s not demographically defined, but it is a mindset that keeps her positively engaged. And so many of things that we have been doing over the last two years or so to pretty significantly change our marketing mix. I have been very purposeful in order to reach in new and compelling ways. A lot of the tools we used in the past, we found awareness effected in meeting here today.","So our advertising even some of the broad scale advertising like TV and radio we think sets the stage and then we are building much more communication through social media, our own applications on our own website to provide content and engagement tools, influencers in the marketplace that are driving much more change in how consumers behave.","And then even tools like our Glam Lab that we launched on our approximately, which is a way for her engage in beauty virtually engage in beauty in a way that she couldn\u2019t before. So we\u2019re focused on meeting her needs, as I said very optimistic about her continued engagement. And it\u2019s really center of everything that we are doing in building our business for future.","Jason Gere","Okay. I appreciate. And then Scott, can you just - did you say with the preopening spends was going to be for the year just so we have that?","Scott Settersten","Yes, as a percentage of total sales roughly flat with 2016.","Jason Gere","Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed.","Dana Telsey","Good afternoon everyone and congratulations on the terrific results. As you think about MAC and this is so exciting that it\u2019s coming in the stores what could it contribute in sales and how does the margin compared to the rest of the product categories? And then with online, the margin progression of online, where does it go and when does it balance out with stores? And just lastly, what kind of comps should you need to leverage expenses going forward? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Thank you Dana, the three point question. We show you enthusiasm about the launch MAC and we\u2019re not going to specific about, we\u2019re just getting started right so starting online and we\u2019re going to launch it to a little over 100 stores this year. And it\u2019s really important brand products to have and we\u2019re confident it\u2019s going add to the mix very nicely and our guess will be very excited about it. Your second question was\u2026","Dana Telsey","Online.","Mary Dillon","Online, you mean the margin, right. So, I will do this we\u2019re very focused on improving the profitability of online business as we\u2019ve talked about today. The big part of our supply chain investment is around fulfilling the online orders in a way that better for our gust in terms of speed and also more efficient in terms of cost. But we expect this to improve, but we expect that the four walls margins are always going to be higher than the online margin.","On the flip side, so the margins getting stronger, but the great thing is it\u2019s a very incremental business to us, right. So, we study this closely, we look at very closely at consumer at our guest trends and the guest who\u2019re shopping online only this is a small number of people it\u2019s really about guest who are shopping in-store and online and that guests who is involved across both channels is really driving 2.5 times more sales really, it\u2019s not somebody who is just buying in-store.","So, even if that margin is I think in some ways inherently going to be somewhat lower than bricks and mortar, it\u2019s a very incremental business to us. Feeds very much into the dynamic that Dave was describing about how the beauty enthusiasts shop.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks and congratulations all. Back to the question - well let me phrase it this way thinking about the 200 basis points of margin expansion over the next few years, is the cost component of these continued roll out of new brands is that factored in? And I guess as part of it would you say it\u2019s fair that new brands rolling into your top-line - benefit your top-line as well but maybe you haven\u2019t built the full ramp of a brand like a MAC into that longer-term outlook?","Mary Dillon","Yes, we certainly are doing the best we can thinking about the cost of rollout of brands and I\u2019d say that\u2019s inherently assumed. We feel confident about the ability; we\u2019re maintaining the goal of reaching that 15 margin target by the end of 2019. And - but being really I think very smart and prudent about how we get there balancing short and long-term and since Scott talked about it well there now we adapt to new investment long-term in this business and we are definitely going to do that.","Because we know we\u2019ve got - we need to have the right brands, the right in-store experience and the capabilities to support that. So, whether or not that top-line could be stronger with some of these brand launches, I don\u2019t know we try to be really as prudent as we can with our guidance. But we\u2019d like to see how it goes before we call it higher that we think we need to.","Scott Settersten","And I would just add to that, assuming things again we are giving guidance here early in the year, there is a long way to go in 2017. But even if we only achieve to what we are guiding to today, by the end of 2017 we\u2019ll be half way to our goal of close to 15% by the end of 2019. So there still plenty of room left for us and the long time and again we always weigh these decisions very carefully versus dollars. And we think today these investments and these choices are the best for our investors for the long-term.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","Courtney Willson","Hi, this is Courtney Willson in for Oliver today. Thanks for taking our question. We just had a question regarding your expansion into urban location. You mentioned more capital, higher rents, will you be merchandising these stores much differently on the product side in terms of the balance of mass versus prestige? And do you have any plans to adjust their service offerings at all to cater towards the urban customer or your traditional suburban customer? Thank you.","Dave Kimbell","Yes Courtney, this is Dave, I'll take that. Overall, no we think our model works in all types of location urban, suburban. So we're merchandising these locations pretty consistently with how we're doing in all of our stores and there may be some fine-tune changes that we\u2019ll make.","And we're certainly looking at making sure that these stores are efficient and effective, but we don't see a big mix. I mean big part of what Ulta stands for is all time beauty all in one place, having the proper category mix being able to have mass and prestige and hair care. And so we're going to make sure that it's reflected in that location.","As far as services, we think that's a big part of our mix too, so we anticipate very strong service businesses in those high traffic locations and we're preparing for that but we're not radically changing the store design and the amount of space allocated towards that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Ike Boruchow","Hi, everyone, congrats on a great quarter, thanks for taking my question. I guess, Marry this might be for you, just looking at the loyalty membership growth, the growth rate I think is accelerated the last couple of years, I think now it's like 29% at the end of this year, can you just talked to some other things that you've done the last 18 months or 24 months that helped you accelerate that growth?","And then kind of what's baked into your plan for this year, in terms of new membership add? And I'm just kind of curious if there is a way to talk about how loyalty is maybe been benefiting the comp and if that does start to normalize, how should we think about a more sustainable comp growth rate? Just tying comp and loyalty together would be great?","Mary Dillon","Yes, so let me take some of that, maybe I'll start, Dave you want to add. I will say this is a bit of a secret sauce, so I'm not going to get very specific about lot of it, because we're really proud about how the royalty program is working. And as you know the loyalty members are driving the majority of our sales. So obviously that\u2019s part and parcel of the comp growth I mean that\u2019s kind of the way to think of it. Comp is driven by a lot of components, but the sales are coming from our loyalty members.","We've done a few things, one is obviously we just converted a couple of years ago to one loyalty program we\u2019ve simplified it we make it - I think our communication about how the program works, how we communicate with that guest, and how we convert new member, potential members in-store are all kind of components of what we've done that\u2019s making work well.","And I'll let Dave to add more color, but I would just add also what's exciting to me is I am not going to drive that rate of growth of new members forever right, because we\u2019re kind of early the program. But we still really only have 20% of the beauty enthusiasts as we define them, shopping it also in the U.S. There is plenty of more loyalty perspective members out there. And also even the postcard earner program, we certainly don't have 100% of their share of beauty spend and they're not even buying every category that we offer today.","So we see these as all levers to continue to pull at the top-line - at the top level to help drive to continue to support the kind of comp growth that we are guiding. And maybe Dave just add a couple of more points about what was done with the program.","Dave Kimbell","Yes absolutely as Mary said the combination and simplification into one program a couple of years ago really has allowed us to accelerate our growth in that space, but a few things the marketing has they have in one program has allowed us to just be sharper and clear about marketing that on a national scale, which we couldn\u2019t do before.","So we've been able to leverage that in all of our vehicles reaching all of our guests. We have a significantly increased our in-store execution, our store associates are better understand the program, they participate in the program and they've done a great job educating our perspective members and converting perspective members into that program.","And then we really have to make sure that just the value is there, it is fundamental to our overall business and we want to make sure that we're continuing to meet her needs. There is three core things that we deliver to her she finds value first in the points program and we've got a number of levels and elements to that. But she finds that valuable the ease of accumulating points and the simplicity of redeeming those points.","She get the second piece is she got a lot of content from us and this beauty enthusiasts that I described is open and interested in the content that we give her whether it's our mag or email or other activity that we have to reach them out.","And then we try to delight her throughout the year with special products birthday, birthday gifts, anniversary gifts, sample programs. So those things keep our engage and the execution we have through marketing and in-store and our merchandizing partners have allowed us to drive that growth and we're going to keep focused on doing that in the future.","Ike Boruchow","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.","Rupesh Parikh","Congrats on a great quarter and thanks for taking my questions. So I also wanted to ask about your urban locations and maybe even the Manhattan location. I just want to get a sense of whether you guys expect similar returns for the urban unit. And then secondly when you enter new market such as I guess in this case Manhattan, do you also typically see a meaningful lift on the e-commerce side of your business?","Mary Dillon","Yeah let me start with that one. So to Manhattan specifically and I guess the other urban sites that we're going forward with this year by and large we expect the same kind of financial results. I would say Manhattan is a special case, I mean so back to Dave's earlier point about we're putting our standard prototype store in there right it\u2019s 10,000 square feet and that\u2019s an expensive proposition on anywhere on the Island.","We went to a place where we felt most comfortable kind of a neighborhood feel there with a lot of traffic; I know we got to do subway station right here in our front door. So we're trying to make smart decision as far as the location is concerned that would be a case where we would take something less than our internal hurdle rate, which is way north of 20% right in most of our stores that we open perform way in excess of our internal hurdle rate.","And in case of Manhattan we're still expecting to recoup investment returns well above our cost to capital that\u2019s there that would be another measure that would be significantly lower than 20%. So we feel very comfortable that this is a wise decision and it's going to produce great returns for us.","Dave Kimbell","And then the question about e-commerce business, when we open a new store and we do see that not only driving growth in that store, but driving our e-commerce business. We see it in all types of market small markets and we would anticipate that to be the case in Manhattan. We do have a strong awareness and we surround Manhattan so it's not like we're unknown in that area, but obviously this would be the first time we're serving them directly and we'd anticipate our e-commerce business to benefit from that as well.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Next question Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Chris Horvers","Thanks, good evening. Like the peel apart the $80 million increase in CapEx it seems like the number of Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me upgrades were - are in line with what you previously planned at the Analyst Day or I'm guessing that they weren\u2019t given that to happen in October. So is the $80 million is that MAC counters in the stores and are you buying some of the real estate in markets like New York and Chicago to perhaps you could layout the size of the buckets of the incremental CapEx year-over-year?","Scott Settersten","Yeah this one is one that I could understand it could get a little murky for people who are just looking at the numbers at the top level. So I would say the short - the easy way to think about the $80 million is, it\u2019s just incremental store fleet investment. So when we gave the guidance earlier in the year about CapEx maybe being kind of flattish in '17 compared to '16.","We didn't have line of sight clear on MAC at that point or how many stores that might go into and things like that. Since that guidance we\u2019ve the increased the number of Lanc\u00f4me and Clinique and benefit boutiques versus our prior thought process. Layer math on top of that you layer in a bit of inflation in a new store plus open a new store.","So most of it is primarily boutiques in those new stores, which is again it's great news for investors because it's a lot more cost efficient for us to put those boutiques in new stores versus go back and remodeling stores, disrupting guest activity and it's a lot more expensive to do that.","So it's kind of combination of those things but by and large the $80 million is going into the store fleet, which again our most productive asset and a reason why Ulta is a stand out as far as driving traffic.","Mary Dillon","Yeah and there is no purchasing of MAC real estate or anything like that. You asked that question at the end just to clear now this just investment in our store.","Chris Horvers","Understood. So as a follow-up the CapEx should also drive extra depreciation expense, which was not in what you've previously guiding in terms of margin expansion and getting to the mid-teens. So following up on a prior question that tried to address this, what the offset in the margin line that allows you to stick to your existing long-term algorithm are you embedding more sales is there margin benefit that you are seeing now that you are previously didn\u2019t expect when you laid that out? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","No I mean we again, we are giving guide - there is a range of outcomes right, that\u2019s you are looking at a continuum. And so we feel comfortable that between having flexibility on the upside to do better with promotion tactics I mentioned earlier other benefits coming out of supply chain investment maybe quicker than we had originally sought. And just other stronger retail trends that drive a lot of leverage on fixed store cost so a combination of those things. And as we look at the range we feel very comfortable that we can stick to our target.","Chris Horvers","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","[indiscernible] on for Joe. I was just wondering if you could talk about the promotional environment as we were taking market share from.","Mary Dillon","The promotional environment was that we\u2019re too early taking. I guess the best way to think about it is that we compete across a lot of dimensions. So I mean we compete with I like to say 70,000 places in any given day that you can buy beauty, because we offer all the product categories and price points. So department stores are certainly one source, but we also compete with mass with drug, online retailers. So it\u2019s really kind of across the board.","Promotional environment I guess for us, what I feel good about it, that we the quarter that we had with consistent levels of promotion a year ago I think is a really good way think about the underlying health of our business and that we have - we\u2019re always going to make sure that we are providing a great value to our guest. And so there is always going to be some levels of coupons or promotions in-store, but certainly our loyalty programs allow us to get that much more focused and targeted and we have been doing that over the last few years.","So I feel like we have got good control of our levers, so we got levers that we use as we need them and more importantly we\u2019re really just in an environment where beauty is certainly the growing category it\u2019s very active there is a lot of players nobody is doing exactly what we do.","So we really try to just play our offence and that\u2019s why we are talking about really continuing to investment in the long-term of our business because obviously beauty enthusiast is holding with their dollars. We are not complacent, we are not perfect, so we know we just have to stand top of our game.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please proceed.","Mark Astrachan","Yeah thanks and good afternoon everyone. Wanted to ask about the percent stores with at least one prestige boutique if you could - if you not answer it directly just give some direction sort of how that increasing overtime? And commentary about more expansions for Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me that you mentioned on the call that relative to the 100 more boutique that you announced at the October investor meeting?","And just sort of broadly given growth and assuming increasing focus on prestige brands relative to mass, any thoughts about how you see the sales split overtime between mass and prestige within the stores?","Dave Kimbell","Yeah so I would start by saying we don\u2019t - as we\u2019ve said before we don\u2019t give specific numbers on that, but I\u2019d say increasingly most of our stores certainly more than half have at least one boutique in them. And as we continue to grow I think if you look at the history, what we\u2019ve talked about we said at the beginning of last year that we started the year, started 2016 with approximately 200 of each Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me and 700 of benefit and then we added about 500 boutiques last year and this year as we said another 700.","So, increasingly we will be reaching pretty much the whole fleet it\u2019s with at least one over time and we think that\u2019s important to continue to elevate the experience in investing our stores as Scott has said.","As far as the mix between prestige and mass, we are really focused on making sure the entire store is growing certainly prestige has been leading, but our mass business across cosmetics for sure, but also skin care and bath is also been contributing in a very strong way to our overall business. And that\u2019s really important because that\u2019s ultimately what our guest comes us for is that mix.","So as much as we talk about and we spend a lot of time today talking about prestige, our boutique investments, we have been equally as focused on building all parts of our store. We are investing in our hair care business, adding a lot of new brands there; we\u2019re as I said building our mass side. So the balance overall is important. We don\u2019t see a real dramatic shift. It might gradually continue to grow within prestige, but we were focused on keeping that balance for the long-term.","Mark Astrachan","Great, thank you.","Operator","Next question Simeon Siegel with Nomura. Please proceed.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks good afternoon guys and congrats on the year. Scott, just maybe to follow-up on a few of the others. Just I guess what do you expect depreciation to be this year and then any update to what you\u2019d expect CapEx to like beyond 2017? And then maybe from Mary or Dave, I don\u2019t if I missed it, but where is the private label penetration at this point, do you see any big difference between stores and online and I don\u2019t know if you think about it like this but is there a sealing level that you wouldn\u2019t want to surpass? Thanks.","Scott Settersten","Yeah, so as far as D&A and CapEx is concerned, I think D&A we said 215, 250 sorry for 2017 is the estimate. In CapEx Simeon it\u2019s hard for me to sit here today and think about how we could do any more, right how could we take on any more with the capacity that we have. So respect the CapEx I have learned now never say never, but it\u2019s hard to imagine that the number could get larger than what we\u2019re looking out for 2017. It\u2019s a large undertaking but again a lot of it is going into the store fleet and we think there is great payback there and a great prospects for our investors over the long-term.","One other thing, I would say about CapEx, so again, getting back to that $18 million year-over-year. There is a lot other things going on behind the scenes I guess both sides just the MAC and Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me boutiques there is things like Est\u00e9e Lauder, we introduce it last year going much larger with it this year across the fleet, 250 comp stores and additional 100 new stores, there is things like that.","Remember when we go into the stores and we do these boutique drop in we\u2019re also taking opportunity to refresh the store right on a pretty large scale. So we are going in with new nail fixtures, fragrance fixtures, updating the Ulta Beauty collection where it makes sense. So there is a lot of activity going on in the store, just to keep it fresh, when she comes back it\u2019s like a new shopping experience right and we just want to continue to do that. So that\u2019s the CapEx expectation.","Mary Dillon","And then the Ulta Beauty collection. I think we break it out, it\u2019s between 3%, 4% of the business similar online in-store, which is true for most of our, but actually I am really proud about our little Ulta Beauty collection growth rate. I mean Dave talked about this the mass side of our business is very important to our guest and our private label brand we\u2019ve really, really double down in making that a stronger brand that we had. And I am proud of it.","So part of the investments in-store had to do with making sure that we\u2019re using fixtures and showcasing that brand and to best possible light. We have invested in - we have redone the packaging, we are really bringing newness to that that line much more rapidly and it\u2019s doing very, very well.","So I don\u2019t if there is a cap certainly I like it, it\u2019s a great margin and our guest will response our guest is wonderful the constrained would be we are not going to be too big in anything. I mean we want this to be a mosaic brands that our guest want and love. Having said that we know it\u2019s going to be bigger will be bigger and we have a fair amount of space dedicate and we can make that space even more productive overtime and we will. So we\u2019re proud about what\u2019s happening with Ulta Beauty collection.","Simeon Siegel","Great. Thanks and best of luck.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Katie Price","Thanks very much this is Katie Price on for Matt. Just taking a look at the SG&A cadence that you guys have had over the last year, obviously the growth per store was elevated reflecting the investments that you have made. In the fourth quarter that growth rate came back down pretty sharply, but as we think about how the investments that you\u2019re going to continue doing over the next year will flow through, should we expect that growth rate to reaccelerate once again or kind of given the base of investments that were made last year that that growth rate would remain below prior year levels?","Scott Settersten","Yeah, I guess, I would say again, a quarter when we look at individual quarter, every quarter has a special set of challenges and opportunities. And really over the last couple of years there has been a lot of investments. So I think we saw last during in the fourth quarter we deleverage the SG&A line.","I think for the year we were kind of flattish, but the fourth quarter included some consulting expense we were thinking about our Analyst Day and refreshing the five year plan, we were the business was strong. So we pulled forward some of our supply chain expense and try to get at head start on things, we also had some people decisions that we made to get more footsteps on the ground to make sure we could ramp up some of these investments little bit quicker.","So again we\u2019re lapping that in 2016 and you saw fourth quarter this year, we saw the fruits of our labor so to speak in a lot of different ways we got a lot of leverage this year because we got an early start on a lot of those things. So I think we mentioned as we look at 2017 now SG&A slight leverage I would say for the full year. So there is still a number of things that we need to work on people wise and tool wise and we're just thinking what being pragmatic and doing what we think is good for the business for the long-term.","Katie Price","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","I would like to turn the floor back over to Mary Dillon for closing comments.","Mary Dillon","Thank you. I just want to reiterate we're really proud about the year that we had in 2016. And I really like to thank our 32,000 associates for delivering that year and all their efforts to continue to drive our success in 2017 and beyond.

I'll now turn it over to Mary.","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. ULTA Beauty delivered excellent results in the third quarter. Strong traffic and healthy new store productivity drove the top line leading to better than expected earnings growth.","Sales rose 22.1% and we achieved a 12.8% total company comp on top of a 9.5% comp in the third quarter of 2014. This was our best retail comp since 2011 and the best total company comps in our history as a public company.","We gained market share across all of our categories, with both Prestige and Mass Color Cosmetics achieving outstanding growth. Earnings per share increased 22% to $1.11 compared to $0.91 in the third quarter of last year.","Scott will take you through details of our third quarter financials in a few minutes, but first I\u2019ll provide a business update through the lens of our six strategic imperatives, which is our template for long-term shareholder value creation. The first imperative is to acquire new guests and deepen loyalty with existing guests.","Our ultimate rewards loyalty program continues to be a significant contributor to our business results. We now have 17 million active members, up almost 20% versus a year ago, a significant acceleration compared to the 16% growth we achieved last year. Our store associates are doing a fantastic job converting new customers to the programs and we\u2019ve improved all the loyalty program communication touch points in conjunction with our brand relaunch last quarter, including loyalty cards , brochures and web content.","All key loyalty program metrics including retention rate, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average member ticket are trending well above last year\u2019s numbers. We also saw a big jump in the reactivation of members who hadn\u2019t shopped at ULTA Beauty recently, about 56% higher year-over-year likely helped by our increased digital marketing and national advertising.","We believe our efforts to increase brand awareness through advertising are also contributing to the acceleration in new loyalty member acquisition. As a reminder, ULTA Beauty\u2019s brand awareness while still lower than our peers has increased over the past year and we still have an opportunity to improve both the aided and unaided awareness of our brand.","On September 7, we debuted television and radio ads on national cable and broadcast networks and also air aired these commercials during [new fall] episodes of several primetime shows. One of the ads focus on our 21 days of Beauty event during which we saw double digit traffic increases and the other ads were focused on ULTA Beauty\u2019s unique all things Beauty, all in one place positioning. We are currently running another flight of TV and Radio during the holiday season with new creative, both the new brand ads and one focus on ULTA Beauty as a great gift giving destination.","We also used social media and public relation activities to grow awareness about our support of the breast cancer research foundation, an important cause that we\u2019ve been closely involved with for many years. This year we introduced new elements to deepen the emotional connection for our guests to the cause , which includes sharing the story of a breast cancer survivor in a new video called Tracy\u2019s First Haircut that was launched over 3.8 million times, and we launched a fund raising challenge on social media #ultapinkover in partnership with actress Tiffani Thiessen.","We also returned as the official partner to the Ellen DeGeneres show for her Breast Cancer Awareness month activities, which were BCRF and ULTA Beauty on the national stage for millions of viewers each week to raise awareness and funds.","Throughout this activity we expanded our reach in educating and raising funds for the important work of BCRF. The second strategic imperative is to differentiate by delivering a distinctive and personalized guest experience across all channels. Our CRM and consumer insight capabilities continue to grow leading to more effective, personalized and targeted communication.","Our CRM platform enables more targeted offer so that we can continue to reduce our reliance on coupons and discounts to drive sales. Our data shows that more targeted email offers lead to higher open rates and significant increases in online sales per e-mail sent.","We also continue to use both our CRM platform and our website as a important component of our multi faceted sampling program. In addition to our positive duty breaks and monthly sample Beauty Bags, we are also working as brand partners to deliver product samples based on customers\u2019 past purchase history and propensity to buy certain products. We can track subsequent purchases, get guest feedback and share data with our brand partners.","We are on track to distribute more than 4 million personalized samples this year, primarily through targeted e-mails, and also through targeted point of sale messages and direct mail.","Now turning to the in-store experience. Over the past few quarters we\u2019ve implemented several initiatives to enhance service levels. Our payroll optimization tests are ongoing as we experience with allocating incremental stacking hours to support higher sales goals.","In the current quarter, we are deploying insights from previous test to invest in customer facing hours to deliver a great guest experience during the holiday season with this increased traffic in our stores. We continue to see benefits from recently rolled out programs that increase productivity, including our past management tool, a new store block tool to help district managers and other field leaders consistently measure and reinforce store operations and service and Kronos Mobility which improves store management\u2019s ability to appropriately stock the stores while increasing guest facing time.","We also continue to reinforce product announcements and guest service training through our learning management system. And finally we continue to elevate our guest experience to improve execution of our in-store event strategy for both brand partner and store generated events.","The third strategic imperative is to offer relevant, innovative and often exclusive products that excite our guests. The Beauty business is driven by news and innovation and our merchants are doing a terrific job creating an assortment that\u2019s clearly resonating with our guests. We gain share across the board with color cosmetics growing well above the house on both the mass and prestige side of the portfolio.","In the Prestige cosmetics categories, brands like Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, Tarte and Too Faced are leading our growth with plenty of newness. Urban Decay\u2019s Naked Smoky Palette was the biggest sales item of the quarter. Too Faced was a standout with the successful launch of Born This Way foundation.","Ongoing interest in contouring and strobing is driving strength in palette from Anastasia, Lorac, Becca and many others. Exclusive to ULTA eye shade of palettes like Too Faced Vegas Nay start-up palette and the Lorac Mega PRO Palette were big hits on social media and with our guests.","We continue to roll out Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me boutiques as well as Benefit brow bars. All three brands contributed significantly to our comp growth. After introducing an assortment of five Lanc\u00f4me mascara SKUs to all stores during the quarter, we are excited to add another great prestige cosmetics brand in a large number of doors just this week. Two of Dior iconic Dior Show mascaras were introduced in nearly 600 stores.","On the mass side assortment, we are at the popular Soap & Glory luxury bathline during the quarter which is off to a great start. Mix, owned by L'Or\u00e9al is simply on fire, and we offer a dominant assortment of more than 900 mix skews. Their suede lip launch was a big hit in the third quarter. Masks are also a trending category and we\u2019ve added a great assortment of masks from Korean brands like Tony [Indiscernible].","And lastly, the ULTA Beauty collection continues to perform very well, benefitting from the teams work to offer higher quality, on trend products as well as the updated in-store presentation we have rolled out at the end of the second quarter in more than 300 stores.","Our professional hair care department exceeded expectations as well, driven by newness and continued benefits from the extensive work we completed during the second quarter to a previous assortment, signage and overall presentation of the category.","Innovation from Redken, Living Proof, Pureology and Diva Curl drove double digit comps in those key brands. We also saw great results selling the rebranding of our gorgeous hair event in October within hairs content, contours, sampling and events in the salon.","The fragrance category strengthened in the third quarter as well with new launches including GucciBamboo, Jimmy Choo Illicit, Kate Spade's Walk on Air, Mark Jacobs Decadence and Est\u00e9e Lauder 'Modern Muse Le Rouge' contributing to renewed interest in fragrance. We also added Christian Dior fragrance to ultra.com during the quarter as we continue to enhance our online offering.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter we are excited about our assorted in growing number of exclusive product offerings, Bare Mineral Enchanted Beauty, Tarte's Tartlet in Bloom, Benefits Party Hopping kits and Nyx Holiday kits, Clarisonic limited edition holiday sets, these are just a few of the holiday kits that are exclusive to ULTA Beauty.","In our minds, so the exclusivity of our assortment is really twofold. On the product side, we have a great private label offering with our ULTA Beauty collection, exclusive brands like in IT Cosmetics and IT Brushes for ULTA, the broadest assortment around from limited distribution brands like Mix and Urban Decay and an array of kits sold only at ULTA across many of our brand partners.","Equally important ULTA Beauty is the only retailer that brings its broad portfolio of brands, categories and price points together in one place to delight the Beauty enthusiasts combining it with a compelling loyalty program and a high quality services. So how we bring it all together is what sets us apart and what\u2019s driving our consistent market share gains.","Next is our four strategic imperative which is to deliver exceptional services in three core areas: hair, skin health and brows. Our Salon business comped 10.9%, an acceleration compared to the first half of the year. This momentum was driven by a balance of traffic and ticket increases. Transaction growth reflected strong new guest acquisition complementing solid growth from existing guests.","Online booking generated 22,000 appointments per month with about two thirds of these coming from new guests. The increase in average ticket was due to more targeted discounts and growth in add on services like conditioning and hair treatment. We recently rebranded all of our salons including in-store signage, training material and direct mail and digital content in consent with our overall rebranding of ULTA Beauty which we rolled out in the fall. The focus on trend in combining hair and makeup books has been very well received by Salon designers and our guests.","The strongest category during the quarter were hair color, blow outs, hair treatments and make up services which reflect the increased integration of hair and makeup looks in our training and marketing materials. In the third quarter, our team trained all of our 5000 plus salon designers and the latest hair cutting styles, hair color and make up trends in our integrated fall of winter trend collection with a focus on building average ticket.","Our annual Cut-A-Thon to raise funds for the breast cancer research foundation was a big success this year. We provided 26,000 haircuts and 6400 micro zone skin services free with a donation to BCRF significantly more than the prior year. This event was made possible by the incredible passion and engagement of our Salon associates who generously donated their time raising more than $500,000 for BCRF in a single day.","We continue to see excellent growth in our brow services performed by Benefit Arch Experts. We now have 710 Benefit Boutiques and will add another 12 this quarter.","Turning to our fifth strategic imperative: to grow stores and e-commerce to reach and serve more guests. We opened 25 stores, closed two, remodeled two, and relocated two stores during the quarter, ending with 860 stores.","New store productivity continues to be very strong this year with the class of 2015 stores opening well above plan even excluding the record breaking grand openings of our three stores in Alaska.","We believe these results are driven by great site collection and also because of our growing brand awareness, continuous improvement in our merchandised assortments, stronger grand opening marketing tactics and strong store teams, with more tender [ph] of managers now often opening new stores.","We\u2019ve invested payroll hours just before training and on boarding for new store associates for building a strong bench of field leaders during improved succession planning process to support our growth and we are dedicating resource to make sure new stores get off to a strong start.","We\u2019re on track to open 100 net new stores to end 2015 with 874 stores. In addition, the real estate pipeline continues to look very healthy. We already opened almost all the -- we\u2019ve really approved almost all the sites for 2016 and we continue to have access to high quality sites as our unit growth and ability to drive traffic to centers gives us an excellent standing with landlords.","Approximately 25% of these will be in new markets and 75% will be in existing markets. About half the stores will be in new or redeveloped shopping centers and about in existing centers.","On the e-commerce side, Ulta.com achieved very strong growth of 56%, contributing 190 basis points to our total company comp and composed of 54% transaction growth and 2% ticket growth. Traffic to this site was very strong, benefitting from continued digital marketing channel growth including e-mail, page search, and affiliate, display retargeting and paid social media including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.","Integrated marketing campaigns for ULTA Beauty\u2019s 25 birthdays, our signature 21 days of beauty prestige events, ECRF, our redesign mobile app and holiday gift guide all contributed to growing interest in our e-commerce offering. We also saw a significant increase in customer retention and e-commerce, a reflection of our more compelling assortment and offers, improved site shopping experience and fulfillment capabilities. More of our ultimate rewards customers are shopping both online and in stores. Currently 6% of our loyalty members are shopping both channels versus 5% a year ago.","Omni-channel guests spend about 2.5 times as much as retail only guest. We continue to see great interest in our CRM campaigns online, our sample bag with a purchase offers and limited time beauty breaks on ulta.com. So as a result we feel e-commerce purchases is largely incremental in providing a path to trial and discovery versus primarily replenishment. We have yet to see e-commerce shifting any volume away from bricks and mortar.","Finally, our sixth strategic imperative to invest in infrastructure to support our guest experience in growth and cash for scale efficiencies. Our new DC in Greenwood, Indiana continues to perform very well. We successfully ramped the building as planned to fulfill orders for 126 stores in 25,000 e-commerce orders t per day. It will maintain its levels through the holiday season before adding more stores in ulta.com orders next year.","Greenwood will handle about half of our e-commerce volume at peak during this holidays selling season. We launched the first phase of our demand forecasting in inventory optimization tool early November. We call the system swift for store and warehouse inventory forecasting tool and the tool is now piloting [ph] in the mass year category of expectations that will grow across all categories next year. With swift we can provide more accurate forecast for both stores and e-commerce resulting in a better inventory position and reducing loss of sales from outer stocks.","Swift takes replenishment from a manual process to an automated one and helps us feel much more accurate about anticipating future demand and building inventory to support seasonal sales based on holiday or the promotional periods. Early results from both the new DC and swift are encouraging, but we still have a lot of work ahead about to optimize our supply chain and improve inventory efficiency. That concludes our business update and now I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott.","Scott Settersten","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter sales were $911 million compared with $746 million last year, an increase of 22.1%. Comparable sales increased 12.8%. Both the retail comp and the salon-only comp was 10.9% and ecommerce growth was 56.3%. The total company comp this quarter was mostly traffic driven with transactions growth of 10.6% and ticket growth of 2.2%.","Retail-only comparable transactions were very strong, up 9.5%, the highest growth so far this year. Retail-only ticket growth of 1.4% was evenly split between the units per transaction in average selling price. E-commerce growth was driven almost entirely by traffic with average ticket increasing in the lower single digits.","Gross profit dollars were up 19.1% to $335.6 million, but gross profit margin deleveraged 90 basis points to 36.9% from 37.8% last year. This decline was primarily driven by planned supply chain investments including the distribution center in Greenwood Indiana when it opened in early August.","Product and channel mix also weighed on gross profit in the quarter, as we saw a very strong growth in areas like mass cosmetics and e-commerce which carry lower margins.","SG&A expense increased 20.8% to $218.8 million, down 30 basis points as a percentage of sales to 24% versus 24.3% last year. This improvement was driven by lower variable compensation expense and modest leverage on store labor and other store expenses. These gains were somewhat offset by planned investments in marketing.","Note that we are on track to keep marketing as a percentage of sales flat for the full year, with marketing de-leverage in the back half of the year balancing the leverage we saw in the first half. The higher marketing spend in the second half is related to investments to grow our brand awareness to national advertising campaign Mary mentioned which includes television and radio.","Pre-opening expense was $6.1 million compared to $6.6 million last year, due to 45 stores opened during the quarter compared to 50 new stores opened in Q3 2014. Operating income increased 17.7% to $110.8 million. Operating margin was 12.2% down 40 basis points versus last year.","Our tax rate was 36% versus 37.3% last year, primarily due to changes in state income taxes. Net income increased 20.2% to $71.1 million or $1.11 per diluted share versus $59.1 million or $0.91 per diluted share last year.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, inventories were $884.4 million at the end of the quarter compared to $709.7 million at the end of Q3 2014, up 10.9% on a per-store basis below our comp rate. In addition to the inventory in the new DC, we continue to invest in inventory to improve in-stock levels for our fastest turning items to support our rapid sales growth as well as investing in new brands and the continued roll out of rollout of Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me boutiques.","Capital expenditures were $94.7 million for the quarter, driven by our new store opening program, supply chain and system investments and merchandise fixtures. We are on track to spend about $300 million in CapEx this year.","Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter were $ 42million, and are expected to be about $165 million for the full year. We ended Q3 with $360 million of cash and short-term investments.","The company repurchased approximately 288,000 shares at a cost of $48 million during the quarter under our 10b5-1 plan. As of the end of the quarter $239 million remained available under the $400 million share repurchase authorization. Since we began our current buyback program in October of last year, we have repurchased more than 1 million shares for $161 million.","The reduction in our diluted share count versus last year added just under a penny of earnings per share for the third quarter.","Turning now to guidance for the fourth quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.212 billion to $1.233 billion compared to $1.048 billion last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 8% to 10% versus 11.1% last year, our toughest comparison of the year. ","We have planned for our online sales growth to moderate this quarter. We have purposely smoothed out some of the e-commerce promotional activity during the early part of the holiday season to better match demand with our fulfillment capacity to deliver an improved guest experience.","We expect to open about 14 stores in the fourth quarter; this compares to 10 stores open in Q4 last year, so pre-opening expense is expected to be up slightly. Earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $1.48 to $1.53 versus $1.35 for Q4 of 2014 which included a $0.02 benefit of non-recurring tax.","We anticipated tax rate of 37% and a fully diluted share count of approximately $64 million. As a result of our better than expected performance in the third quarter and continued momentum in the early stages of the fourth quarter, we are raising our sales and earnings expectations for the full year. We now expect to deliver earnings per share growth in the low 20s percentage range compared to the $3.96 of adjusted EPS we delivered in 2014. We expect to deliver double digit comparable sales in the 10%, 12% range for the full year and topline growth in the low 20s percentage range.","I'll now turn the call over to the conference call host to begin the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please state your question.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks, good evening everybody. Can you talk about the promotional environment and what you are seeing from a department store channel in the Beauty space and whether that had any impact on merch margins during the quarter and in a similar vein as you think about the outlook for the fourth quarter is there any anticipation of promotional pressure coming from that channel?","Mary Dillon","Well thank you Chris. Let me just start by saying, you know I guess there\u2019s always promotion in retail in this time of the year in particular. Well, if you step back and look at our business and our business results we feel that you are kind of operating in a different way the most of the retailers right now and we feel pretty proud of that. So our trends are kind of transcending some of the dynamics like weather and mall traffic or other things. And certainly for promotional perspective, we\u2019ve been actually able to drive healthy comp sales growth with actually pulling back in terms of broad discounting.","Now having said that, we are really focused on using our loyalty program, our CRM facilities you know the whole tool kit of products and in store experience to drive this great guest experience. So, you know I'm not diminishing the fact that we're certainly in a promotional environment. We understand that plan, we feel that our business is really well set up to perform really well at holiday because you are positioning ourselves as a great gift giving destination and the formula is working well for us.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. And then just as one quick follow up, Scott well do you think is there any component in the gross margin that you would consider as a onetime expense related to the new distribution center? Thanks.","Scott Settersten","Yes, well we\u2019ve been clearly stating throughout the year that third quarter was going to be probably the most significant headwinds with respect to the supply chain investments specifically around the distribution center there in Greenwood, Indiana. So that's the biggest one time I guess one time that\u2019s a tough term to use, but that was the biggest single factor as far as the deleverage was concerned in the third quarter and again that what we expect that to moderate now as we march into the fourth quarter. So I think the biggest challenge for the year in the gross profit line is kind of behind us.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon. I'll ask kind of two-part here conjunctional related. First of all, Mary, your initial insights on the economics of the marketing spend, I know, this is a very big quarter for your marketing campaign and some of the broadcast advertising against some of initial thoughts on responsible. And then conjunctional related -- the mass business is sounds like gain share within the mix that something we haven't heard a lot of before. How do you relate that to the marketing effort potentially capturing new customers or to other things that are transpiring in the marketplace? Thanks so much.","Mary Dillon","Okay. I love the way everybody's getting two questions in. That's very tricky. We'll try to get as many as we can. And Matt anyway, I guess also a couple things and maybe I'll ask Dave to add more to it as well. But initial feeling about of our marketing mix revolution I'm thrilled to that too. I mean, this has been journey that I think we've been on as you know for the past couple of years. How we can we evolve our demand creation and smartly in the way that's going to just drive healthy long-term growth in the business. And I couldn't be more pleased, I think the team has just fantastic. We've done a lot of fermentation. We've been careful about it does not point pendulum too dramatically. But now we're in our position to have this really whole kind of marketing mix and we're just really getting started I guess. And so that's a key part of we think one of the key growth leverage for us going forward in terms of our ability to continue get new guest and drive more market share gains with existing guest.","And then on the mass side of the house, again, I state to add more but I'm thrilled of that too, because the whole brand promise ULTA is I don't mean to sound commercial here, but all things beauty all one place, is a very meaningful idea to our guest to be able get categories in price points in brands, and we're really working at that is something that's differentiated and ownable to the long-term. And as a result all the categories have to be important to us and have to perform and they are. Maybe you just want to add.","David Kimbell","Yes. Yes, absolutely. On the market spend we just started TV advertising in September, so it's probably a little early for us to fully judge the impact of the return on it. But we are really encouraged. We've seen as both Mary and Scott talked about increase in traffic. We've seen a healthy increase and a key metric for us which is membership signups and that was up 20% for the quarter as well. And so we continue to watch it. But so far we're feeling very good about it. And as I think we've talked before, currently, we have another cycle of television currently on air, supporting our holiday efforts. So, its s tactic that will continue to drive, but it\u2019s also part of a much broader marketing mix. We think about TV, video, but heavy digital, really digital in many ways being the center of our marketing efforts in really connecting and driving awareness in and engagement with our guest, so we're really dialed that up as well, more PR, social media those kind of things. So that will be a big part of our ongoing marketing campaigns.","And briefly on the mass side, as Mary said, we're continue to drive growth, really that growth has come at the same we've been growing the prestige side as equally as well. So the growth is happening in all part of our box and we want that to continue.","Matthew Fassler","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. Please state your question.","Daniel Hofkin","Good afternoon. It's obviously a terrific results. Before I ask my question, Scott, I have seen that you have been named top margin company CFO by FEI, Financial Executives International recently, so, my congrats on that?","Mary Dillon","So that's nice to raise that. Thank you for that.","Scott Settersten","I appreciate that. Thank you.","Mary Dillon","You get two questions.","Daniel Hofkin","Yes. It will be one question two-part. It's really actually just a little clarification what finance already and then one thing about small sale performance. You talked about impact events, obviously early to access, but aren't there are a couple of things either in terms of your online business or particular categories that you think may have seen an outsized benefit from the ad so far. And then, as it's relates to margin you indicated the mix was a factor on top of the supply chain stuff. But if you were to look at it on the same mix pieces kind of within categories, could you just -- merchandise margins would they have been up, flat or down kind of within kind of on the same mix basis. And then my last question is the quick update on smaller store performance? Thanks.","David Kimbell","Yes. Just briefly on the advertising, really we're seeing healthy performance across all aspects. Scott, Mary talked about e-commerce Salon and of course our core retail business. Categories are strong. So, we really see that supporting our total store not any individual part of it and so far that is definitely working for us.","Scott Settersten","Yes. And as far as the margin question is concern, again distribution center drag was the biggest driver that de-leverage year-over-year. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, I mean, the mass, the spike up in the mass comp kind of surprised us a bit. So net-net year-over-year merch margins were better, I mean, by in large on the reduced promotion cadence that we had this year versus last year, but the mass comp surprised us a little bit versus our forecasting in case I would say. So again, a great thing overall for the business and we're willing to take that part of the businesses to the bottom line as well, even if it has a little bit lower margin.","Mary Dillon","And on small store, we're really pleased with the performance of the two stores that we're operating. And really what we're doing is learning about two kinds of things at once drive, which is one is about operating ultimate footprints and then continuing to learn about a smaller market opportunity, both of those were promising to us. I guess this is way I would say. So we already have several successful 10,000 square foot stores in small market. So small markets not that new to us, but we see that as continue to be a future opportunity. And I guess you can just continue to see us experiment with different footprint sizes that will give us more growth opportunity. So, whether it\u2019s a smaller store in urban or suburban streetscape, we're looking at all those things. But those two stores ended up themselves are performing fine and given us some good insights.","Daniel Hofkin","Very helpful. Best of luck in the fourth quarter.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please state your question.","Aram Rubinson","Hello, congratulations on another great set of results. Question I guess I'll leave to one, just to focus on the distribution center, I suppose in Greenwood. When you guys think about \u2013 before you opened it you probably were worried about certain factors weather it\u2019s a cost to build it, operate it, timeliness, et cetera. Just give us a sense as to what's you've learned so far and whether or not you'll be folding in those kinds of learnings to other DC nodes and how its maybe changed your future thoughts of what that network is going to look like?","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Aram. I guess I can answer that at a pretty high level. First, I would just say, is actually we are really proud of our entire supply chain and DC team members right now, because they work really hard doing a things at once, right. So, the new distribution center were pleased with how that's going so far. All the DCs are busy with holiday and e-commerce fulfillment and they're really improving that year-over-year, so really great.","And I guess the main thing I would say is that, we're absolutely planning to take all earnings that's in process right now that we're taking from \u2013 getting Greenwood up and running to apply to the next distribution center. And we got in fact the team from the future distribution center working in Greenwood over holiday right now to both helps as well as to help gain insights in terms of how we can apply all those learnings, every things from across the board. So at a high level I would say we're pleased with how it\u2019s going, still improvement to be made for sure, but we're very focused on making sure that we do \u2013 make it even easier I guess the next time.","Scott Settersten","Yes. I guess I would just add again, we have a five-year road map, right for supply chain and merch systems kind of rebuild. And that we've got a couple of existing centers out there, right, so we're keeping in a back for our mind how the guest experience. How it's going to evolve over the long time. And we're going toggle best back and forth to make the best decisions over the long-term.","Aram Rubinson","Thanks, great. Well, congrats again and have a great holiday.","Mary Dillon","Thank you, you too.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Securities. Please state your question.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Good afternoon guys and congrats on the quarter. So, I don't know if this is redundant I guess Mary to your point you were just making. Can you talk about how those learnings that Greenwood will help Dallas. I mean, I presume that goes quickly and maybe less expensive, so any color on the right way to think about related expenses there Scott? And then just given the other initiatives can you give help with total SG&A dollar growth for the fourth quarter of next year? Thanks.","Scott Settersten","Yes. I guess as far as Greenwood is concern, again just to echo what Mary has already said here a couple \u2013 we are tickled pink without how the team has executed down there, got the building open, we're off the ground, we\u2019re serving stores, we hitting e-commerce, throughput targets there on a daily basis now, which just gives us a lot more confidence and what we're going to be undertaking Dallas next year. Again, the learnings that we're generating everyday there, the ability to apply that quicker, so I mean, to your point we're working to our 2016 plan as we speak and thinking about how quickly we can ramp up Greenwood now right to add more capacity there to make to gain more efficiencies and cost savings and then how could we get out of the gate quicker in Dallas next year. So all that\u2019s kind of a working process and we'll be able to share more details with you on that in March when we give guidance for next year.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. And then, Scott, do you just know what percent your SG&A is variable versus fixed offhand?","Scott Settersten","No. We don't get into that level of details, I mean, I'm sorry. When I look at kind of the aggregate for the fourth quarter, I think by in large everyone in the right zip code, I guess when I look margin SG&A kind of split out, I think most people maybe are little conservative on the margin line. I think margins for the fourth quarter, the gross profit margin will be closer to flattish compared to last year and so you can work the math that would be offset on the SG&A line.","Simeon Siegel","Great. Thanks. Best of luck for the rest of holiday, guys.","Scott Settersten","Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks. And nice results and what luck with all these Simeons following each other.","Mary Dillon","We got it.","Simeon Gutman","Yes. So two parts with one in one question, can you just comment on the transaction growth, I think you said in the certain parts of the business whether it\u2019s a same customer or you just tell us maybe the split between the growths coming from new customer versus the same. And second question on related, thinking about the services in your store and particular the Salon capacity utilization, I'm assuming it\u2019s not a 100, I'm sure the industry is not 100 either in that business, but what's reason or what are the industry norm, where are you relative to it, any contacts around that?","David Kimbell","Yes. I'll start with the transaction growth. We're really again pleased with what we're seeing. And it\u2019s coming, I think really from a variety of place. Certainly as our member base grows, we're growing members and they are coming more frequently over time, so that's a very strong source of us and will continue to be a focus for us. Our ability to connect with our members through our loyalty program access to her in traditional vehicles like that we use like print, but also email and digital and social has increased our connection with us and that's definitely getting her in store more often.","We've also \u2013 Mary mentioned that we've had an increase in success and ability in attracting or reengaging guests that that had fallen off of our active member list and we define active members that something that shop with us in last month. So going back in time in members that haven't been as active and we've been successful through our efforts to bring them back into the store. So that's helping with traffic as well. And then we're also really proud of the fact that we are adding new members at an increasing growth rate. So coming across the board and we think that will be \u2013 that's our really strong part of the success that we had.","Mary Dillon","And on the services question, I can tell you exact answer to the capacity question. I can tell you that. We see this is a great opportunity for business going forward. That's why it\u2019s one of the strategic comparatives and we're actively and I think aggressively growing the business. We know that when somebody is using for example our salon, any of our services, they're going to be coming more often, spending more their great guest and today only 107% [ph] of our loyalty members are using the salon for sample. So, we know there's plenty of upside there across our three of the services that we provide and we'll continue to be looking how hard is up with that.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.","Erica Eiler","Good afternoon. This is Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Congrats on a really nice quarter. So, I wanted to switch gear to the holiday selling season. It sounds like you have some exciting exclusive kits going on. I guess, I'm just curious, how do you store your position this holiday season versus prior years. And then maybe you can talk a little bit about Black Friday, how that perform versus your expectations, whether any significant differences versus last year. And then maybe just color on what you saw online versus in-store, that would be helpful? Thanks.","Mary Dillon","So, let me take Black Friday part to the extent that I comment that and Dave maybe you can take the part how we setup for holiday, okay. So, obviously I can't comment specific trends in the quarter, the guidance that we've been provide incorporate and we've seen to-date, usually I will say though that I'm really pleased with the execution that we've seen in stock levels, staffing in stores, the offers themselves probably one of the most significant things is our e-commerce service levels, your strong improvement which really focus on that year-over-year to improvement, fulfillment, capabilities and delivery speed and just for a moment, I actually do just want call out, but this is an really good example of where I think it\u2019s kind of I guess every CEO would says this, but I think pretty unique at ULTA which is people are working together in truly collective way against a broader kind of purpose. So, even just improving e-commerce fulfillment takes a big cross functional up. There were very focus on how our teams can continue to improve and collaborate and communicate and get better every day. So that all sets up well for the future.","David Kimbell","Again, as far as overall kind of holiday execution we're obviously right in the middle of it and are really feeling great about our preparation and the way we try to bring our brand to market so far this holiday and feel lot of confidence throughout the rest of this holiday. We have a totally new approach towards our marketing efforts. I mentioned earlier that includes mass media really for the first, our stores, we think look better than ever for really integrated. We think very strong holiday look that then has been infused in all of our marketing tactic online and social, digital, magazines every touch point has a really consistent coherent look that we've really excited about. Our products we think are stronger than ever across all categories, certainly prestige, cosmetics had some very strong item, holiday items, Mary mentioned a few of those from key brands like benefit and Earn it [ph] and Tarte. Just this week we launch our Gwen Stefani Palette with Urban Decay, so there's a lot of newness coming out.","Mix and the mass side, have some great new holiday offers that we think really exciting and the ULTA brand itself as always has very strong holiday and we think those are better than ever. And hair care is strong for us as well. And finally our fragrance business is \u2013 this is the biggest time of the year for fragrance and we have a lot of newness plus variety of brand offer such as robe, some of the biggest things we do throughout the year in that category. So, across the board we're feeling really good about our execution and we'll be watching our results carefully.","Erica Eiler","Great. Thanks for all the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager with Robert Baird. Please state your question.","Mark Altschwager","Good afternoon everybody and congrats on a very solid quarter. I know, you don't want to talk about 2016 guidance, but maybe bigger picture in the context of the multi-year plan, that plan calls for annual comps in the 5% to 7% range, obviously you've well exceeded that this year so far in comparisons get tougher but now that you're year end and you've seen the results of some of these marketing and merchandise initiatives, does that maybe change your thinking at all regarding what the base level comp is that this business is capable over the planning horizon?","Scott Settersten","Well, I guess, I'll take a shot at that. We're still \u2013 we got to close out 2015, right. We\u2019re still a long way for being complete I guess I would say, get through to the holiday season here. We're feeling great about the business. The underlying trends are very strong. We feel like we have a lot of levers. We're in control of those, right, lot of new merchandise, newness coming through the business, the loyalty programs doing better than what we expected. We've got some of these brand awareness things out they are really kicking in, but we still have to see the result to some of that, right, we're still in a very early stages.","So, the long term guidance we gave last year was 5% to 7% higher in the earlier years, little bit more moderate in the out years. We're going to kind of stay consistent with our practice. We're going to give guidance on 2016 next March, early next March and we'll be able to share more details with you and how we see 2016 roll it out and maybe a little bit about the longer term at that point.","Mark Altschwager","Thank you and best of luck over holiday.","Scott Settersten","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Tunick of Royal Bank of Canada. Please state your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for taking the question. This is [Indiscernible] for Brian. First I guess, we want to ask you if there were particular differences in prestige and mass trends in Q3. And now from higher I guess newness on pricing perspective, do you see any differences in industry trends between these two. I guess, my very quick second question is on uses of cash. It looks like the case balance is still being nicely, so could you maybe remind us how you're thinking about use of cash?","David Kimbell","I didn't -- first part, the difference between prestige and mass\u2026","Scott Settersten","Trends in the industry are we seeing any differences in trends on what's going on pricing, I guess trends in industry.","David Kimbell","I mean certainly, yes, in the broader industry we watch and as it has been for a little while prestige has been growing and the industry in total as we look at probably the same reports that you do, that's been growing faster than mass. But we're again \u2013 what we're really focused on is driving that total, all things beauty all in one place.","You know as Mary has mentioned, what's really working well for us right now is driving greater awareness, getting her into our store more frequently, but they getting her to experience the whole store and that\u2019s all categories and once she gets in, she might come in for a mass, she might come in for prestige or hair or fragrance, but then we work hard through our CRM capabilities to get her introduced, engaged in all categories.","So, again, we're seeing growth across the entire stores and that something that we'll continue to drive and that's what really what we're focused on despite what happened in outside of the store.","Scott Settersten","And as far as capital allocation is concerned, I guess I would say we're very excited to be able to invest the way we are in our business and still be able to return significant cash to shareholders most recently through repurchases, but you know over the course of the last three years we\u2019ve returned roughly $260 million to shareholders through special dividend and share repurchases, so again I think that demonstrates management and the board\u2019s focus on making sure we do what's right for shareholders over the long term and again we'll right size that or change tactics, specs of circumstance of change.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.","Ike Boruchow","Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question and congrats as well. I guess Mary when you look at the prestige portion of your business, it seems like the fragrance side of the industry has been a little weaker over the last 12 months. I guess, I would think that fragrance will be a larger piece of your business during the holiday given its more of a giftable item. So I guess, how has that been trending for you and how do you think about the prestige fragrance part of your business for holiday within your plan?","Mary Dillon","Yes. I mean, it is definitely a bigger part of the business of holiday and we do a lot with our gift we purchase and our guests love that. Our fragrance trends were strong in the last quarter. As you know it\u2019s a bit of up and down category I guess I say in terms of it\u2019s a little bit more trend driven. We think that prestige side is obviously a really strong part of the category that's tend to be a little more consistent I guess, that what I would say. But important category for us is again is part of the overall brand promise we just try to pick our spots and make sure that we got the right portfolio for our guest and for our business.","Ike Boruchow","Got it. Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Co. Please state your question.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Congratulations to the team. We just had a question regarding out of stocks, it sounds like there's a lot of nice opportunity ahead. Which parts of the store would you say have the best low hanging fruit in terms of improving the other stock levels?","And then just taking a step back, your traffic has been so impressive, is there any way for you to prioritize the various aspects that have really been helping you buck with the trend and gain share?","Scott Settersten","Let me take out of stock question here first of all. Again, all of the supply chain things we're doing in the merchandize systems that were making significantly investments in today are going to help us with in stock position over the long term, both making sure we have the right product, right store on the right shelf across the chain and just make us more efficient throughout the network from the vendor dock all the way to the shelf in the store.","So, there's many different elements I guess I would say levers along the way, part of that is the swift tool that Mary described earlier today, the distribution centers play a big part on that, but there's also space planning tools and other master data things that we're doing, so it\u2019s like a continuing, it\u2019s a large, broad section of things that we're putting in place to help within stocks overall.","You know, there's no, I wouldn't say there's any one specific category or brand or anything like that we're focused on, it\u2019s just the store overall. So, the easiest thing I would point to AMB item, right, so the fastest, most high velocity skews where today we can't really work up accurate forecast to share with our vendors that would be one thing that we're going to move in the future that's going to help us to stay better in stock. So there is no, I wouldn't point any one item, there's a number of items that we're going to implement to help us with that and its going to help across the network.","Mary Dillon","Now on the traffic question, first of all, we'd say, we're proud that our traffic trends are transcending, what's really happening every tail end are successively driving a lot of healthy traffic to the stores. It\u2019s really not \u2013 there's not exact science to this though I will tell you and that's probably a little of what you want to hear, but the good news is it does really, it looks like a lot of things coming together, so more relevant product portfolio, royalty program, this broader marketing mix that includes things that you can help \u2013 are helping the drive awareness in new guest acquisition, CRM, online and in-store experience, so it\u2019s kind of like all them together is really what we think it\u2019s magic that working for us. And we think that we're confident we'll be able to continue to \u2013 some of those levers we think many of them have multiyear runway.","Oliver Chen","Great. Thank you. Happy holidays.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Please state your question.","Joe Altobello","Hey, guys, good afternoon and thanks for squeezing me in here. Two quick ones, I guess first on the traffic obviously it sticks out as you guys alluded to relative to other retailers, this season. And the national TV advertising, I think you said started September 7, did you guys see a pickup in traffic post that advertising launch , or was it really pretty stable and steady throughout the quarter, number one.","And number two, quick one for you Scott, the tax rate you said 37% for the fourth quarter, is that a great rate to use next year, because there was between 37% and 38%, it\u2019s about $0.10 what matters? Thanks.","David Kimbell","Yes. On the specifics around the TV and the traffic, again, one thing I'd start with is, really TV is a big kind of visible one, but it\u2019s very much as a holistic integrated marketing campaign across multiple vehicles, but I will say the TV was time to launch with our 21 days of beauty event in September and we did see very strong traffic at a very nice healthy increase in traffic during that event, but it wasn't just that event as evidence by the traffic throughout the quarter we feel like \u2013 we feel really positive about how that traffic sustains throughout the quarter. So yes, strong when we came on, but continued strength.","Scott Settersten","And as far as the tax rate is concerned, I guess, I split the way we sort of speak. I\u2019ve used 37.50 for next year, it\u2019s kind of a best estimate at this stage.","Joe Altobello","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We have time for one question. Our final question comes from Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please state your question.","Jason Gere","Okay. Thanks and [Indiscernible]. I guess a question more on shipping and I was just wondering from the e-commerce, and I understand in the end it just up and running right now, but can you talk about how competitive your shipping is versus maybe some of the other competition out there.","And on that note, do you have in all your stores the option for in-store pickup, so I was just wondering if people don't want to wait three days or if it\u2019s one to two days have you seen in store pickup that might actually contribute to the comp that you saw here that once people come into pick up, then they start browsing and doing a little bit more shopping, so really the question kind of around shipping and how that kind of plays out?","David Kimbell","Yes. First of all, no, we do not currently offer in store pick up by online pickup in store. We are in the midst of long term omni channel roadmap and that\u2019s something that we'll consider, but that's not currently something that's offered today.","As it relates to our shipping in total, yes, Greenwood is important part of it. Improvements we've made in our existing DCs have led to what we think is a very competitive shipping window timeframe where we did as we\u2019ve talked before, we weren\u2019t as pleased with some of the customer service that we had last holiday and so we've worked very hard including opening in to DC but working with our supply chain partners, IT partners to make sure that our service level. So we feel it\u2019s very competitive and we know it\u2019s ever evolving landscape and we'll continue to make improvements but we're happy with how we're going to be servicing our guests this holiday season.","Jason Gere","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Mary Dillon for closing remarks.","Mary Dillon","Thank you. I'd like to first thank our associates for achieving these great results. And we continue to make great progress in our strategic imperatives and taking care of our guests, especially during this very busy holiday season. And I want to thank all of you for interest in ULTA Beauty. We look forward speaking again with you soon. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Laurel Lefebvre. Thank you. You may begin.","Laurel Lefebvre","Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for ULTA Beauty's first quarter 2015 conference call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer, and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Dave Kimbell, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's Safe Harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call which are not historical facts may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Good afternoon, everyone. I am delighted to report that 2015 is off to an excellent start at ULTA Beauty with better than expected sales and profit growth in the first quarter.","To review the headlines. Sales grew 21.6% and we delivered an 11.4% total company comp on top of an 8.7% comp in the first quarter of 2014. We continue to see strong momentum in transaction growth with average ticket growth also contributing to the overall comp. These results were driven by continued market share gains across all categories with particular strength in both prestige and mass color cosmetics.","With our best retail comp in 12 quarters, we are also pleased to deliver a 10.3% comp in our salon business and 49.8% growth in e-commerce. We continue to benefit from more targeted marketing through our loyalty and CRM programs. We have also been successful in our effort to drive effectiveness and gain efficiencies in traditional marketing programs, enabling us to reinvest in advertising to drive higher brand awareness and long-term growth.","Earnings per share increased 35% to $1.04 compared to $0.77 in the first quarter of last year. Scott will talk in more detail later about our first quarter financial results and raised outlook in just a moment but first I would like to provide an update on our business through the lens of our six strategic imperatives.","As a reminder, we developed this long-term strategic framework last fall to guide our path to continue to deliver market share gains and long-term sales and earnings growth. The first imperative is to acquire new guests and deepen loyalty with existing guests. To update you on our loyalty program. Membership in our ULTAmate Rewards program has now reached 15.5 million active members. A healthy increase resulting from an increased retention rate and strong growth in new members in the first quarter. We believe improved retention signals that both the program is strong and the benefits of converting to one program last year.","New membership was driven by great in-store execution by our associates, converting nonmembers into members and guest recognition of the benefits of the program. Member comp sales were very strong, driven both by more loyalty member shopping and higher sales per member. Our loyalty program and increasing capabilities to deliver more targeted and personalized offers through our CRM platform continue to drive strong traffic and sales growth. While we will always focus on offering our guests a strong value proposition at ULTA beauty, in the first quarter we were able to maintain very healthy traffic while trimming the depth and breadth of some of our promotions.","We continue to focus on new customer acquisition by reallocating some marketing dollars into awareness and acquisition vehicle. After a successful test of advertising in the third quarter of last year, we invested in a national radio campaign during the holiday season. And based on the success there, ran a national radio campaign for 21 days of beauty this quarter which drove very strong traffic growth during the event.","Our increased use of tools like advertising and social media give us another opportunity to create an emotional connection between our guests and ULTA Beauty. Our Mother's Day social media campaign is a great example of this. The campaign was based on the insight that most people don\u2019t remember the last time they told their mom that she was beautiful. And ULTA Beauty invited people to send her this message via social media. And of course we encouraged them to get our Mother's Day gift at Ulta as well. Thousands of people shared messages, photos and videos at #MyBeautifulMom. The original campaign video was viewed 1.4 million times on social media channels and garnered more than 100 million media impressions.","We plan to continue to use a full array of marketing strategies and tactics, including traditional and digital advertising, PR, CRM and magazines to acquire new guests and deepen loyalty with existing guests.","The second strategic imperative is to differentiate by delivering distinctive and personalized guest experiences across all channels. We continue to see good results with the client telling app we initially tested in 30 stores. We are now rolling out an upgraded version of the app to an additional 30 stores this quarter. The new version will give our prestige associates the ability to track and review the preferences, purchases and loyalty points of our guests, enabling more efficient follow up and feedback collection and more personalized interactions on every visit to our store.","The store operations team is planning to extend the pilot to additional districts and continue to measure how the application improves the guest experience and increases engagement and loyalty. Another way we are making the guest experience more engaging and personalized is through exciting in-store and online events. We continue to expand our repertoire of activities, increasing resources to host live chats on ulta.com, personal appearance in our stores and master classes featuring our brand partners, many of whom have earned celebrity status with our guests.","And finally we have upped our game in training our associates to support a great guest experience. Over the past year we have had five training courses focused on guest service and sales including a program devoted to increasing ULTAmate Rewards program membership. We have also added more than 50 brand specific product knowledge training videos that all store associates can access on demand through ULTA Beauty's online university.","Most recently we delivered robust leadership and store training to all of our general managers and field leadership teams at our recent general manager's conference in April.","The third strategic imperative is offering relevant, innovative and often exclusive products that excite our guests. Our guests are responding very well to the product assortment that our talented merchant team continues to curate and evolve. Many of the new brands and products launched last year in our prestige cosmetics category continue to show strong momentum IT Cosmetics, IT Brushes for Ulta and new products from Urban Decay and bareMinerals. We are increasing our focus on offering exclusive products with more and more items marked new and only at Ulta in our marketing communications.","During the first quarter we drove increased traffic with our signature 21 Days of Beauty event as well as our Mother's Day gift with purchase program which highlighted many recently launched fragrances. Our prestige boutiques featuring Benefit, Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me products continued to expand and perform very well.","In our private label business, we enhanced the ULTA Beauty collection with the introduction of the ULTALuxe and ULTARomance bath and body products. We also introduced a new private brand of nail products called Whim, a high shine nail lacquer line available in 58 shades.","In the professional hare category, we completed significant reflow projects in all of our stores to reallocate space, optimize adjacencies and assortments, and add trend-right new brands including John Masters Organics, Obliphica Professional and Peter Coppola. All three brands add dynamic innovation to our current assortment.","Turning to e-commerce. Ulta.com sales benefitted from expanding the assortment to include most of the professional hair care brands we carry in store, adding Lanc\u00f4me products and continued success with sampling and limited time Beauty's [deal] [ph] offers. From a trend perspective we are seeing explosive growth in contouring palette as that trend is still growing strong as well as continued interest in brows, lip and mascara.","On the skincare side, innovative treatments and masks targeting specific face and body areas and featuring innovation in ingredient delivery, such as hydro gels and infusion patches, are all emerging trends.","Next our fourth strategic imperative, delivering exceptional services in three core areas. Hair, skin health and brows. Total salon sales grew 20.5% and comp sales were up 10.3% demonstrating continued momentum and the strong trends we have been seeing in our services business. Haircuts and color, blow outs and makeup services all comped double-digits during the quarter. We launched our spring cut and color trend collection designed by ULTA Beauty's artistic team and Rodney Cutler, Redken Expert and Celebrity Stylist. We supported the launch with ample training and this new collection received rave reviews from our associates, who found they could easily translate these great looks to their guests.","At a recent general managers conference, we announced a new product partnership with Sam Villa, Redken's Education Artistic Director to sell his professional quality hair tools. Sam personally provided master classes for our top salon associates at the conference. The addition of Dermalogica facial peel services last year continued to drive growth at our skin services category. We have improved staffing, retention and productivity of our skin therapists who receive high quality training from Dermalogica to provide guests with expert advice on skin services and products.","New guest acquisition was very healthy during the quarter with an encouraging response to our offers targeting new salon and skincare guests. Online booking continues to grow nicely with more than two-thirds of these appointments from new salon guests.","To update you on our brow services offerings. We currently have more than 600 Benefit Brow boutiques. Brow tinting services have now expanded to about 450 stores. Both products and services are driving excellent performance for our Benefit Boutique. We plan to pilot online booking capability for the Benefit Brow bars later this year as well.","Turning to our fifth strategic imperative, growing stores and ecommerce to reach and serve more guests. So starting with stores. We opened up 24 stores during the quarter and closed one store ending the quarter with 797 stores. New store productivity continues to exceed expectations. We entered Alaska for the first time during the quarter with new stores in Anchorage and Fairbanks. Both stores opened very strong and Fairbanks has earned a new distinction of achieving the best grand opening sales in ULTA Beauty's history. Tomorrow morning at our quarterly town hall meeting, we will be celebrating the milestone of opening our 800th store in Ammon, Idaho.","Our two 5000 square foot stores continue to perform very well. And we intend to additional small stores next year as we improve systems capabilities and implement space planning tools to manage assortments and supply chain more efficiently. We are on track to open 100 net new stores this year. For the remainder of the year, we expect to open about 20 stores in the second quarter, about 40 in the third quarter and about 15 in the fourth. As a reminder, about one third of the 2015 program will be in new markets and two thirds in existing or fill-in markets.","Turning to e-commerce. Ulta.com continues to grow rapidly with sales increasing 49.8% contributing 170 basis points to the total company comp. We were successful with digital acquisition efforts during the first quarter, driving significantly more unique visitors to the site. At the same time improvements to our Web site experience and merchandising strategies drove conversion up 12%.","Moving on to our sixth strategic imperative. Investing in infrastructure to support our guest experience and growth and capture scale efficiency. To update you on our supply chain project. We are currently testing the systems and operating model in the new distribution center in Greenwood, Indiana and proceeding with training programs for new associates to be ready for inventory to begin flowing in next month. We are on track to begin shipping orders for e-commerce customers and fulfilling stores in the third quarter and are pleased with how the team is working to ensure the operational readiness of the building. We plan to wrap up this facility over time to reach its full capacity of 400 stores and 45,000 e-commerce orders per day and be ready to support our holiday sales plan this year for both stores and online.","While the supply chain project is currently a major focus of the organization, we are also rolling out other important tools to drive productivities in stores. A task manager application has now been deployed to the entire chain as part of our general managers conference training activities. The store operations team is now using this system to better manage tasks in store and to gain increased visibility on task completion and compliance. The store operations team is working with IT to create additional reporting abilities that will allow the store teams to optimize guest facing hours to further improve the guest experience.","That completes my update on our strategic imperatives so now I will hand over to Scott.","Scott Settersten","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. First quarter sales were $868 million compared to $714 million last year, an increase of 21.6%. Comparable sales increased to 11.4%. The retail comp was 9.7%. The salon only comp was 10.3% and e-commerce growth was 49.8%. The total company comp was driven primarily by traffic strength with transactions up 7.2% and ticket up 4.2%.","Similar to recent trends, the ticket increase was driven by higher average selling price resulting from strong sales in prestige category and less discounting overall. Retail only comparable transactions were very healthy, up 6%, and e-commerce growth was driven by both increased traffic and conversion.","Gross profit dollars were up 23.3% to $303.2 million and gross profit margin leveraged 40 basis points to 34.9% from 34.5% last year. Gross profit benefited from strong retail margins resulting from a strong mix of prestige products, lapping the loyalty program conversion that took place in February 2014 and modest leverage on fixed store costs.","Ulta.com's margin rate improved year-over-year due in part to an improved product mix with many more brands of professional hair care products that we offer in-store now available on our Web site. SG&A expenses increased 18.5% to $192.5 million, down 60 basis points as a percentage of sales to 22.2% versus 22.8% last year. The key drivers of this improvement were marketing and store payroll leverage and better-than-expected sales as well as the shift in timing of marketing expense. As Mary mentioned, we are capturing efficiencies in marketing spend that we plan to redeploy later in the year to drive greater brand awareness. We anticipate marketing expense as a percentage of sales will be flat for the full year compared to 2014.","Pre-opening expense was $3.1 million compared to $2.6 million last year driven by 24 store openings and one relocation during the quarter, compared to 21 new stores opened during Q1 2014. Operating income increased 33% to two $107.6 million. Operating margin was up 110 basis points versus last year at 12.4%. Our tax rate was 38% versus 38.4% last year, driven primarily by the impact of accounting for equity compensation transactions.","Net income increased 34% to $66.9 million, or $1.04 per diluted share versus $50 million or $0.77 per diluted share last year.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventories were $662.9 million at the end of the quarter compared to $531.4 million at the end of Q1 2014, up 8.9% on a per store basis. The increase is primarily driven by a focus on maintaining strong in-stock levels for A&B SKUs in light of our sales momentum along with the addition of new brands and the Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me boutiques rolling out this year.","Capital expenditures were $56.6 million for the quarter, driven by our new store opening program, merchandise fixtures, supply-chain investments and systems. We plan to spend about $300 million in CapEx this year.","Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $38 million and are expected to be $170 million for the full year. We generated about $12 million of free cash flow in the first quarter and ended Q1 with $536 million of cash and short-term investments.","The company repurchased approximately 192,000 shares at a cost of $28 million during the quarter under our 10b5-1 plan as part of our program to return cash to shareholders. As of the end of the quarter, 332 million remained available under the 400 million share repurchase program. We expect to continue to offset dilution with our 10b5-1 plan and still have the flexibility to repurchase opportunistically beyond that.","Turning now to guidance for 2015. In terms of our outlook for the full year, based on our strong performance in the first quarter we are raising our sales and earnings expectations for the year. We expect to open 100 stores and remodel four stores. Grow e-commerce sales in the 40% range. Drive comparable sales in the 7% to 9% range and deliver earnings-per-share growth at the high-end of our previous guidance range of 15% to 17% from the $3.96 of adjusted EPS we delivered in 2014, which excludes the two cents non-recurring tax benefit in Q4 of 2014. This guidance includes planned supply chain and systems investments and assumes we continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution.","Some of you may be wondering why we are not raising guidance more significantly for the year in light of the strength of our Q1 results. We mentioned at the beginning of the year that you should expect a bit more variability in our quarterly earnings performance due to the timing of investments like our supply-chain project, the addition of prestige boutiques and marketing and advertising. As a result, we expect to see our softest earnings growth in the third and fourth quarters this year.","We feel very good about the strong sales momentum in our business. At the same time, some of the earnings upside we saw in the first quarter was related to timing of marketing expense that we now plan to deploy in the second half of the year. We also are now planning to pull forward some of the supply-chain headcount investments originally planned for next year into the back half of this year with the goal of realizing the benefits from some of our new system investments sooner than originally planned. Also, we believe it is prudent to maintain a fairly conservative view of the year until we have passed one of our most significant operational milestones maybe in the history of the company, which is the opening and start up of our newest distribution center in Greenwood just outside Indianapolis.","As a reminder, the Indy DC is twice the size of any of our current DCs and will have all new systems and processes. Once the Indy DC is operational, we expect to begin shipping to a handful of stores in early August. We will reassess the status of the project and of course overall business performance and we will plan update our guidance for the second half of the year at that point, if appropriate.","Currently for the year we expect deleverage on the gross profit line and modest leverage on the SG&A line and operating margin is expected to be about flat. As a reminder, much of the investment related to our supply-chain project will hit gross profit including, higher depreciation expense. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 38%. We expect to spend capital in the $300 million range and to generate free cash flow similar to last year's performance.","In summary, we are very pleased to bring up our annual comp guidance and our earnings outlook with the expectation to deliver high teens earnings growth while making significant investments in the business to support sustainable, long-term growth and shareholder value. In the short-term, the current quarter is also shaping up to deliver strong performance.","In terms of specific guidance for the second quarter, we expect sales to be in the range of $854 million to $868 million, compared to $734.2 million last year. We anticipate achieving comparable sales increase in the range of 7% to 9% versus 9.6% last year. We expect to open 20 stores in the second quarter versus 19 stores opened in Q2 last year. So pre-opening expense is expected to be relatively flat. Earnings-per-share are expected to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.12 versus $0.94 for Q2 2014. We anticipate a tax rate of 37.6% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 64.3 million.","With that, I will turn the call over to our conference call host to begin the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Ike Boruchow","Congrats on a phenomenal quarter once again. I guess, Mary, you have talked pretty extensively about new customer acquisition and conversion since you joined the company and it does really look like your strategies are bearing fruit, given the traffic numbers you just put up again. But are there any metrics you can maybe share with us on the quarter that could better illustrate the improvements you are seeing. Maybe non-loyalty sales or traffic versus loyalty or conversion rates of new customers into loyalty. Anything like that would be very helpful.","Mary Dillon","Yes. Well, thank you. We are actually very pleased to see the progress and as we have said in our five year plan, that we saw lots of opportunity for us to drive growth for Ulta over time by acquiring new guests and having more loyalty from our existing guests. And that is exactly how it's playing out. In terms of specifics, Dave Kimbell is here as well. Would you like to add a couple of points to Ike's question?","Dave Kimbell","Sure. Yes. There is a lot of things that we think are driving the improvement in traffic which is obviously contributing to our overall growth and we look at a few main things. We are really happy with the continued advancements in our overall assortment. Adding a lot of new products, exclusive products and most, if not all, of our biggest and most important brand partners are bringing great news that is driving excitement among our members. Our loyalty program, Mary mentioned we grow that over 17% which is an increasing rate versus last year to $15.5 million. And that was a very important part of our overall growth. In that, a couple of things we think drove that.","We did do, we think, a better job getting non-members into the store but importantly we converted them in store into members at a higher rate than in the past. But also contributing to that was an increase in retention. I don't think we have shared specifics around retention rates in the past but we are very pleased with what we are seeing around retention overall. And then the other components of traffic overall, our marketing we believe is improving in its efficiency and effectiveness in driving traffic into store, both the traditional vehicles that we have had as well as that in new vehicles like radio.","And then finally the services component. We have seen strong growth across all elements of services which naturally drives traffic on the hair side, and then importantly as well a lot of growth in brows with our partnership with Benefit. So across the board a lot of things driving new guests and traffic into our stores.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Simeon Gutman","I don't know if it was mentioned, store performance across age cohorts and I think the comp numbers probably speaks for itself. And then connected to that if you look at the store base in terms of stores and penetrated markets versus stores in new markets, is there anything unexpected in the way that you would have predicted how that performance would look?","Scott Settersten","Hey, Simeon. Overall, when we look at this -- at the age store stack, as you alluded to there. When you are producing comps this strong, those older vintage stores are definitely a huge contributor both on the comp line and even more importantly on the earnings line. Right. Those are very efficient stores for us. And as we look through the stack this quarter, again those older stores, we would say roughly 2005 and older stores are very healthy, low to mid-single comps. So they are additive to the comp overall.","When we look across geographic regions, we look new stores, old stores, we haven't seen any kind of variability there. I mean all of the stores are generally about the same. When you look at that new store model you would be surprised at how close is it when you look at the overall chain and how strong the performance is in almost every one of the stores.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. And my follow-up, Scott, you mentioned the DC and being conservative given where the process is. Can you just shed some light on where exactly you are? Anything that\u2019s surprising you with, I guess, the week's now leaving up until that DC gets opened?","Mary Dillon","Yes, let me take that. Actually we are very pleased with the progress and very confident with the team that we have in place, the approach that we are taking. As I mentioned earlier, we are going to be doing inbound shipments starting next month and everything is on track. We feel confident about our readiness but we are taking a somewhat prudent approach because as Scott said, it's a complex new building for us that\u2019s larger. Double the size of our other DCs and new systems. But we have got contingency plans in place if things aren't perfectly running but we feel very confident with how it's proceeding so far. So everything is on track.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Hofkin","I will add my congrats on the terrific results. Just a little bit of follow-up on kind of the performance. Are you seeing any change in sort of the cadence of new product coming out of the vendors or let's say in the broader beauty space. Or would you attribute -- it sounds like obviously quite a number of your initiatives are really gaining traction. Just curious how you would -- whether you would attribute anything to let's say a better product flow? That\u2019s my first question and then I have a quick follow-up.","Mary Dillon","You know I think Dave answered it well. It's really, I would say, a combination of factors. We feel very good about the brands that we offer, the new products that we have launched. The beauty industry is healthy, vibrant and there is lots of innovation and new product launches either within existing brands or new brands. But really for us the results are a combination of not just what we offer but everything we are bringing to market in terms of how we are creating demand, differentiating the Ulta proposition and using our tools to efficiently and effectively drive awareness and drive traffic. So I think it's really all those things together that we feel is helping to drive our growth.","Daniel Hofkin","So I guess it's fair to say, it's not that there is necessarily been acceleration on the broader industry growth rates or even within certain categories. It's more kind of what's going on in your stores and on your Web site and how you are conveying it.","Mary Dillon","Yes. I mean I think everybody knows the general trends in beauty are positive, so prestige is doing pretty well, you know high single digit growth and mass is up as well. The industry is healthy and growing but it's really -- we are I think benefiting from the fact that we are this all things beauty, all in one place. So what we have is a proposition that nobody else offers and it also insulates us if there is any segments that aren't performing as well. But, again, I would say it's a combination of what we are experiencing what others are in beauty but we are gaining share across every category. Because I think the results show that we have something differentiated that\u2019s appealing to our guests.","Daniel Hofkin","It's great. And then just a quick follow-up on the marketing. So it sounds like it's not a delay in planned spend but you are seeing greater efficiency that\u2019s kind of, let's say, freed up some spending in the quarter and allows you to redeploy it later. Is that a fair way to characterize it?","Mary Dillon","Not directionally, Dan. There is a couple of things at play here. Part of it is what I call a deferral right of spend. Some of that we had planned earlier in the year, so some of that moved back in the year. Some of it is efficiencies that we are capturing that were unplanned that we captured during the first quarter. We were able to toggle back a little bit and we are saving that as dry powder for later in the year as well for some broader brand building kinds of things. So there is a couple of elements at work.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Aram Rubinson","There are a lot of competitors taking aim at the beauty space, whether it's the drug stores, some of the department stores etcetera. The only one who seems to be pulling back in terms of space allocation at the margin is yourself, i.e. taking the space growth down from over 20% to about 14%. So my question is two things. Number one, do you think that has actually benefitted your comps by pulling back on the space such that maybe your brand had a certain amount of growth ahead and now it's just kind of being split amongst fewer stores and therefore adding to comps. And then second, do you think it's also helping in terms of focus. So by refocusing the organization, do you think that slowing the pace of growth in hindsight has actually helped the comp?","Mary Dillon","So we are talking about store growth, right. Our rate of store growth. Well, first of all, thank you for the question. You know the rate of store growth that we laid out in our plan, we think is aggressive and appropriate for us. So it's 100 stores every year over the next five years. And, yes, we had a year where it was 125 and that was kind of a peak year and 100 a year is very manageable for us and we think still quite aggressive than the marketplace. So we are all systems full steam ahead as it relates to our getting to scale and growing our proposition. And we certainly know that this is a competitive industry. It's been for a long time and it will continue to be. But, again, I would say that our pace of growth we think is appropriate and our market share gains and our comp gains I think really demonstrate that what we are offering as a proposition is differentiated and appealing in the industry.","Aram Rubinson","And so, would you say that it's true or not true that by throttling back on the pace of growth you have refocused the company on comp growth and therefore that in turn has been a benefit to comps by throttling back the new store growth rate.","Mary Dillon","You want to give me credit for that, I like it. But, honestly, the way I would say it is, I wouldn\u2019t really consider it so much a throttle back because 100 stores a year is still a pretty aggressive growth rate, albeit less than 125. Having said that, you are absolutely right that what I am doing in focusing myself and my teams on is doing two things at once. Which is, growing our store presence as well as making sure that we tend to same-store growth in every single store that we have. And driving growth whether it's an older store and certainly newer stores, our expectation given the really, frankly, small share that we have in the marketplace today is that that we ought to be able to drive growth across all of our fleet. And that\u2019s why we have been investing in learning about how do we evolve our marketing mix. So it's not just marketing to existing guests but really attracting new guests. And that\u2019s part of what's allowed us to be able to do both new store growth as well as comp growth.","Aram Rubinson","Since I will qualify that as a clarification, my follow-up would be, it seems from looking at your purchases of inventory going into this first quarter that you were leaning into inventory pretty hard. You are still leaning into inventory, it looks like from our calculations going into the second quarter. But my question is, can you give us an example, like a real like example of say, hey 21 Days of Beauty, we have kind of done this and carried it differently this year than last year so we can kind of crystallize that thought.","Scott Settersten","Yes. I don\u2019t think there is any one specific category or SKU or anything I would talk to. I mean again, Aram, we have talked a bit about systems, right, and how we are kind of lagging behind. So a lot of our inventory buys and trying to talk with our vendors to try to get better flow to our network is really manual. And it's more of a hatchet approach than a scalpel. And that\u2019s really what the systems investments are going to allow us to progress to at some point here in the near future. So we are just really trying to do long on the hottest A&B SKUs that we have because we know there is no risk there, right. We are going to sell those regardless. So that\u2019s a part of the inventory growth you are seeing. You are also seeing we have to buy ahead on the boutiques, right. And, again, it takes a while for those to get up it to scale within the store, so we are heavier there.","We have got additional safety stocks. We are putting a brand new DC, again, it's twice the size of any existing facility. So it's going to take a while for that to work its way out. Again, if I look at the full year, I would expect the inventory per door to be below the comp, comfortably below the comp by the time we cycle through to the end of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer and Co. Please proceed with your question.","Rupesh Parikh","I had a question just on e-commerce. So we are seeing again strong performance in your e-commerce business. Are you seeing anything different from a consumer behavior perspective on your recent quarters?","Dave Kimbell","No. I wouldn\u2019t say anything different. I think we are really pleased with how we continue to evolve our e-commerce proposition. There are a lot of things we think that are contributing to that growth. We have made investments in improving the site experience through different ways of communicating trends and merchandising our products, content, beauty destination, other social media tactics. A lot of investments in there to try to drive engagement. Our new items are perhaps the key driver. If there was one shift as we have added, particularly in our professional hair line we added some significant new brands in the first quarter. Those are already starting to change the mix a little bit. So we probably attracted some new guests there that we hadn't had in the past.","But I think overall it's around -- to continue to optimize our traffic through stronger acquisition and converting them through stronger site performance and that\u2019s continuing into the first quarter.","Rupesh Parikh","And then maybe just follow-up again on e-commerce. We hear a lot about brick and mortar just becoming more aggressive in store. Are you guys seeing anything different or any significant changes on the e-commerce from some of your competitors?","Dave Kimbell","Anything different than what they are doing as far as...","Rupesh Parikh","Yes. Or anything that\u2019s going to change the competitive landscape online?","Dave Kimbell","Yes. You know, it is like the entire industry, beauty is pretty competitive space. So there is a lot going on within that space. I think what we are focused on is continuing to evolve and make sure that we are delivering the comprehensive omni-channel experience. Mary mentioned a few of the things, a few of the key initiatives that we have that touch our guest both in-store and online. And there is a lot that we are doing. I think fulfillment is the key component of it. Speed of fulfillment. And that\u2019s a big focus for us. Our DC and supply chain investments will allow us to get even better than that, better at that. We are partnering with Google on some programs in a few markets, in five markets across the country for same day delivery. So there is a lot of competition but there is a lot that we are doing to try to evolve our proposition to make sure that it remains quite strong and attractive to our guests.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with Nomura Security. Please proceed with question.","Simeon Siegel","So just a follow-up on that. If you look at e-commerce trend, are you finding the growth driven more by omni-channel customers or is that online only shoppers. And then can you talk about the opportunity or the progress in converting the loyalty members into online shoppers. Thank you.","Dave Kimbell","Yes. Definitely the growth is with our omni-channel guests. By far, those guests are significant higher than online only guests. So what we are finding is, as we grow our in store member profile, we are successfully converting them to online, which is exactly what we want to do. We want to serve her wherever she wants to be served and get her buying online and then coming back in store. So that\u2019s a big part of that overall profile. And we are very pleased with the profile of that guest. How frequently she is coming back, the retention online, and we will continue to drive those tactics to have her shop in both channels and use our services as well.","Simeon Siegel","Okay. And then just what is the average ticket online versus stores at this point?","Scott Settersten","Rough numbers, it's 40, low 40s in store and low 60s online.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Altobello","First question I guess is a housekeeping one for Scott. Could you quantify how much marketing was deferred out of the first quarter? How much it contributed to the upside and the bottom line? And maybe where those dollars are going to be going to in the second half specifically. Is it going to be broad-based across your advertising or is one particular mode going to get most of that?","Scott Settersten","Yes, Joe. I am not going to quantify what the savings benefit was in the first quarter. I guess I would just point -- I would say that most of it is going to shift to the back half of the year. And again, we haven't made specific decisions on when we are going to deploy that. It kind of depends on how the business is performing, what we see competitors doing and what we think is more appropriate for the long-term. So we had planned going into this year to do some investing for the long-term, right. So more brand awareness things. So that is in the plan. And we have got some dry powder now that we identified in the first quarter that we are going to add to the arsenal potentially, if we think there is a need to use it.","Joe Altobello","Okay. Got you. And then secondly in terms of the drag that you guys had anticipated this year and next year from supply chain and systems investment. I think, and correct me if I am wrong, it was about 500 basis points in both years and it sounds like you are going to be accelerating some of that spending into this year. So how do we think about that cadence this year and next? Is it more like 700 basis points drag this year on EPS growth and maybe 300 next year?","Scott Settersten","Yes. I am not going to be able to get into that level of detail with you, Joe. But I will tell you that we, the management team and the board spend a lot of time talking about our guidance policy. How much and how often. And we have been talking to investors that the quarters are going to be more variable, more lumpy as we get into some of these investments with our supply chain and other parts of the business. So I am not going to get into this kind of detail every quarter but seeing this is kind of the first time and we are coming out right. We are one quarter out here on the supply chain being turned on. Let me give you a little bit more color on the back half of the years.","So if you look at EPS consensus for third and fourth quarter, I would say you take it out roughly equal weight out of both quarters from an EPS perspective. I would say in the third quarter, if you are looking at it more from a P&L line item, you take 80% of it out of the gross profit line and 20% out of the SG&A line. And then for the fourth quarter you would allocate it equal weight between gross profit and SG&A.","Joe Altobello","Okay. Great. One last one if I could, in terms of the gross margin upside. The comp numbers obviously was pretty eye popping but the other upside surprise was gross margin. You had a similar comp last quarter when gross margin was down. So it seemed like the one differentiating factor this quarter was you did anniversary the loyalty conversion from last year. Was that a big driver or was there something else that was driving that?","Scott Settersten","No. I mean that was again -- that was kind of a mix of elements that benefited us during the quarter. So loyalty wasn\u2019t as much of a drag as it was a year ago. It was roughly 20 basis points last year. We had e-commerce, margin expansion. We had the professional hair care assortment we added in the first quarter. That helped the mix overall. But we also continue to see healthy expansion in the core retail merchandise margins as well. So all good news from the core of the business. Unfortunately, when you look at the back half of the year, some of that is going to be covered up, right, with some of the deleverage we are going to see from some of our supply chain investments. But we are very happy with how the business is performing overall.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Halsor with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your question.","Kelly Halsor","Could we dig in a little further around the retail comp growth in the quarter which was really impressive? There are a number of moving parts there. So could you just parse out for us a little further what the key drivers were particularly around the impact of new stores entering the comp base? And if you could help us quantify that impact for the overall comp growth. And also just how you view the product introductions versus your company specifics niches? And anymore color on the opportunity from a brand or product perspective that gives you confidence that you can continue to deliver this solid comp growth as you [lap] [ph] brand introductions from last year.","Scott Settersten","Yes. Let me start with the overall comps. So again 7.2% transactions and more than 4% on the ticket side of things. So from a new store perspective or the chain itself, I mean we are getting a lot of benefit from new store, right. And that\u2019s part of the reason when we updated our long-term financial targets for the Street last fall, we pointed to that. I mean we expect to get a nice benefit from all those new stores. 100, 125, 100 a year now falling into that comp order for us. So there is a significant amount of the comp goodness that\u2019s coming from the very strong performance of our new stores overall.","Mary Dillon","Yes. So let me shoot at a couple of points, which is that our guidance assumes strong level of newness and innovation throughout the year. We increased the strength of the guidance on comp for the rest of the year. In the first quarter we had some pretty big things to jump over in terms of launches a year ago on IT cosmetics and IT brushes. So we are now anniversarying those so we will be jumping over those, I should say, throughout the rest of the year. So that\u2019s just something to keep in mind. As I look forward though, in terms of opportunity, first of all we are always trying for a balance of traffic to get in. So we think we are proving that we can do that. And we feel very optimistic as we look at joint business planning with our vendor partners about their pipeline of news and innovation as well as our own ability to continue to tweak our demand creation capabilities. We can get more effective and efficient, it relates to how we use to deploy our marketing spend. So I think the same formula will continue to hold. We think these are strong comps that we are guiding to. We feel good about it and optimistic and we believe we will continue to deliver.","Kelly Halsor","Okay, great. Thank you for the color there. And Mary just secondly, there has been a lot of buzz around the contouring trend which you called out in your remarks. I believe it has been around as a category for a while but it seems to have gained steam over the spring. Have you seen that interest in the category kind of tick up this quarter and has there been any additional investments in the category by your major brands. And then just lastly, if so, what innings do you think we are in with its traffic?","Mary Dillon","The contouring innings question. That\u2019s a great question. I mean contouring is a technique, it's been around for ages, really. It's just gotten very popular recently I think through the combination of certain celebrities who are famous for it as well as social media. We have certain brands that were big in countering a while ago. It started -- probably began to turn like Anastasia but many other new product launches including our own ULTA Beauty Contour Palette that\u2019s done quite well. So I don\u2019t know. I think we are still in the early innings of contouring. But the great thing about beauty is, you know there is just lots of exciting cyclical trends. So brow is big and it's going to continue to be big. We think lip is big. Some of these will just continue to cycle in and out and our job is to really just be on top of it, go to the vendor partners to make sure, bringing exciting products across all price points, frankly, to our guests, which is something that's uniquely is done at Ulta.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan Chase. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Horvers","So I want to follow up on the DC question. So does the new DC alleviate in-stock issue in the stores and capacity issue on line. So is that you think actually missing sales or does the benefit show up from the perspective that it alleviates an operational cost issue from manual processes and higher safety stocks. Really just trying to understand what benefit and how it shows up, particularly as you get into the fourth quarter where the e-commerce business is substantial.","Mary Dillon","Right. Well, let me just start out by saying that our supply chain transformation is really a multiyear approach. It's not just a one-shot thing. So we are opening up this distribution center in Indianapolis in the third quarter but we plan to do another one next year. The whole goal overall is for us to do a few things and you have hit on some of them. Which is continuing to build infrastructure to support our growth, have enhanced capabilities and drive efficiencies. So we should begin -- we will begin, I shouldn't say should, we will begin to see benefits in this year as it relates to e-commerce in stocks and stores. But it will be a multi-year benefit to us. And so part of that is going to be increase frequency of delivery to stores which we are always focused on in stocks but we know we can always improve and that will help us there.","There is other aspects of these new distribution centers that will help our stores in terms of their labor efficiency. For example, a store ready [cartonization] [ph], so easier to stock the shelves. Certainly being able to assort in segments better so that as we have different store formats or things that need more customized or localized assortments, we can do that. As well as certainly e-commerce processing time which is the goal. So all of those are macro goals that will play out the next several years.","Christopher Horvers","So as you think about last year, is there a number where you get to say, well, our in-stocks in the stores last year were on average x in the fourth quarter and we felt like we left some amount of sales on the table and similarly on the e-commerce side.","Scott Settersten","Yes. There is not one algorithm I guess. I mean we feel naturally that something that we struggle with, in-stocks, generally speaking. But it's not just around the DCs. I mean it's these other systems that we are referring to. We need all of them to kind of work in unison to help us solve some of the in-stock challenges that are just embedded in our processes today because a lot of the stuff is manual. So we need the DCs there to help the throughput on the network but we also need forecasting and replenishment to help our vendors manufacture the product in time so we get it in time and help them with their lead times. And then we need some of the floor and space planning tools to help us get the stores set up right and be able to measure productivity of the inventory. So we need all those things kind of to work together and that\u2019s why it's kind of a multi-year thing. It's not just about the buildings themselves.","So, again, once we get all this in place it's going to take us a little while to get there but we expect to see big benefits from improved inventory in stocks and productivity and working capital improvements and making the stores more productive by getting them shelf ready product and all that kind of stuff to, again, improve the guest experience across the spectrum. Whether it's in the store or the online experience.","Mary Dillon","And the cost and benefit of everything we just described are built into the five-year financial targets that we communicated last fall.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Matt McGinley","My first question is on the e-com impact on the gross margin. I know that, based on shipping and fulfillment costs that e-com had historically been dilutive to gross margin. But with the growth that you are seeing in that part of the business, are we getting to the point now where it's either less of a drag or it's going to be margin neutral, or is that still pretty far off in the future where that would be kind of terrible from a margin standpoint?","Scott Settersten","Yes. I would say it's less of a headwind. So we saw margin expansion in the e-commerce business in the first quarter which we have been telling investors we expect to see that over time as we improve the assortment online and we did that. Demonstrated that with some of the professional hair care things and Lanc\u00f4me being added online in the first quarter. So that\u2019s come to fruition. I mean there is a structural cost element to that business with the free shipping and some of the infrastructure things that we have to do here in the near-term. That would make it very difficult to see it kind of produce margins that are on part with the retail business which, again, our model is so much more mature in that part of the business, right.","So, again, it's something that we look at critically and analyze on a regular basis. It's something we work to try to improve but I doubt that it would ever get to the point that it would be par.","Matt McGinley","My second question is a balance sheet question. It's related to the accrued liabilities. In your accrued liabilities, I think you have both gift cards which I think you guys said did pretty well in the fourth quarter, and then growth in your loyalty reward. So my question is, how much of that $10 million decline in the accrued liability gain from gift cards versus the growth in loyalty? And if it was a substantial upon the gift cards, how much did that impact the comp in the quarter?","Scott Settersten","Yes. I am not sure what comparison you are making on the balance sheet, if you are looking at year-end balances or if you are looking at the prior year balance?","Matt McGinley","So from year-end to now you are down about $10 million?","Scott Settersten","Yes. I would say the majority of that is really the incentive comp accrual. So at year-end, you got a full provision in there for a year where you over-performed the initial expectation and now in the first quarter you are just building that reserve for the full year. So to your question, the loyalty reserve is higher year-over-year as are the gift care liabilities.","Matt McGinley","And did the gift cards actually help the comp very much in the quarter or they did not? [indiscernible] something we need to know.","Scott Settersten","No. Relatively speaking it's not a huge part of that, the retail or the total comp but it is beneficial. I mean we have seen gift card sales up 20% plus year-over-year in the first quarter, so it's stronger than the house. And normally I think most people understand that. When those guests come back to shop, they are usually buying more full priced product and they are spending more than the value of the gift card they have in their hand. So it's a great story.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Fassler","My first question relates to client telling effort. If you could go on to a bit more detail about what you have seen and what you have learned? It seems like a fairly unique effort for a business with a fairly high frequency of customer visits. So how additive were some of the puts and takes if taken from your test of this effort.","Mary Dillon","Yes. This one, Matt, I would say work in the early stages. And we tested in 30 stores, we have now rolled out to about 30 more. And our associates are very exciting about this. They love to serve our guests and they love any opportunity they can to make it easier to interact and to know her, the guest sales history or interest or loyalty points. So we are getting positive response from our store associates and our guests. But it's pretty early right now to give you the results. But I am pretty confident that\u2019s what we are going to roll-out to chain. Anything we can do to make it easier for our associates to serve our guests that we know can be very productive for us.","Matthew Fassler","Got it. And then secondly on gross margin. This was, I think, essentially your second best gross margin showing in three years. And I realize that you deferred some of the investment you thought about later in the year. And you have good things to say about the promotional climb which is also different from what we are hearing from other sectors of retailing. So can you talk about the seasonality of promotions or promotion is really not just a fourth quarter concern at all. So as you move deeper into prestige, does that shield you more from promotional pressure? And then finally with that in mind, what kind of promotional backdrop are you contemplating in the margin guidance that you gave us for the rest of the year?","Mary Dillon","Let me start with promotions . You know we always need to understand that we need to provide a great value to our guests. And so in a competitive industry, promotion is always going to be a part of it. Certainly as you know it's more intense at times of holiday, but we step back and look at how do we create a [great] [ph] value equation for the Ulta guest. And I like to think we are getting better everyday using our tools to get more efficient and effective by being more personalized and more targeted and less broad scale in the discount. So first and foremost when she comes to Ulta, she loves the fact that she can buy products and brands across multiple price points and categories, which is great.","And then if she is part of the loyalty program, which is most of our guests right now, she will be able to earn points as she uses this currency essentially, whenever she consolidates more of her purchases at Ulta, and that\u2019s a great value. So that wouldn\u2019t be necessarily seen as 'discounted promotion', but to our guests it certainly behaves that way. And so we think that mosaic of things that drive awareness and brand clarity and demand, as well as discounts that are given to her in a way that\u2019s very targeted and personalized, are going to be part of our equation going forward.","Now during more intense holiday periods, certainly like Mother's Day or holiday, that ramps up a bit. And I don\u2019t think that will change necessarily. But we are just trying to break-through the clutter by creating more of an emotional connection, being more targeted and personalized, seeing Ulta as a great gift destination and not competing on every front on very single category. And then your question about prestige, I would say the same holds. I mean for us, that we are great value to our guests is that she can use her loyalty points across all categories and that is something that she values.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Altschwager","Mary, you talked about putting greater emphasis or greater focus on exclusive product. But what does the mix of exclusive look like today? How do you see that evolving? And maybe just talk about the puts and takes here as you look to bring more of the prestige brands in house. Thank you.","Mary Dillon","You will take that Dave?","Dave Kimbell","Sure. Yes. The truly exclusive brands are still relatively a small part of our overall business. But the way I guess we think about it is, steady stream of new brands, some of which are exclusive. Great example of that, Mary has mentioned a couple of times, it is our IT brush line that launched last year and it continues to be a strong drive for us. But also finding other brands that might not be fully exclusive but give us a unique proposition and assortment. Meaningful Beauty is an example of that, Mally Cosmetics. Other brands that aren't totally exclusive but have limited distribution.","We are doing that really across the entire assortment which is I think one of the reasons we are seeing some success right now. Another example, it's a big brand, it isn't new from us but it isn't sold everywhere is [Nics] [ph]. And we are seeing nice growth through that. While not exclusive, we are doing a lot of great partnership with them in bringing their brands to life in unique ways in our stores. We are doing that across the portfolio. From mass to prestige, hair care. Hair care is another example, take one of our largest brands, Redken. Obviously not unique to us but how we did some re-planning and reflowing in the first quarter and how we are merchandising that in store and seeing some nice benefit from it.","So for us it is definitely a mix of bringing new exclusive brands which we have a track record and we will continue to do and we feel confident in our pipeline of those coming forward. But also partnering with big established brands across all different categories. And then finally or Ulta brand is an important part of our overall mix. We are seeing nice growth off that. We launched -- we are leaning heavier into trend. We launched an eye shadow palette this quarter that performed very well. So we will see that play a role in our mix going forward in the future as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Gere","Thanks. Actually all of my questions have been answered so I'll just pass onto the next caller.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Steph Wissink","Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked as well but just two quick housekeeping. Scott, I think in your prepared remarks you mentioned Lanc\u00f4me and Clinique both keep rolling out in the back half. Could you just give us an update on the number of stores that will have those boutiques? I mean if stores will have both boutiques or if it's one or the other? And then also, Mary, I think you've given us some great color on prestige versus mass, but I am just wondering if you would be willing to give us a mix of brands between those two, or the mix of revenues. Just to give us some sense of how they are relating to one another?","Scott Settersten","Hey, Steph. We are trying to move away from getting to specific with the number of boutiques. We don\u2019t really think it's all that helpful to folks. I mean the fact of the matter is it's the total offering and assortments that we have in our store that\u2019s driving the comp. It's not one brand over another. It's everything working in unison inside the four walls. So, again, we don\u2019t want to get too detailed about the number and at what quarters and what time periods we are rolling.","Mary Dillon","Yes. And just a comment on mix. You know we have talked about that we have shifted mix up a bit to prestige in the past couple of years. You know ultimately for us the magic is really in maintaining a really robust mix of different categories, brands and price points at Ulta because our guest really values that. She sees it as a savvy move to be able to come in and get an exciting product, maybe from ULTA Beauty, [Nic's] [ph] or other mass brands as well mix out in with prestige, exciting products you can get as well. So for us, we are going to breakout the mix and also I would just say that we expect that mix to be a mix and continue to be that over time. And that\u2019s part of our proposition of all things beauty, all in one place.","Steph Wissink","Thanks. That's helpful. Maybe just a follow-up on the boutique side. With the boutiques rolling out to the back half, how is the economic, or how are the economics of those determined with the partners? Is it similar to the other service boutiques that you have or is it slightly different on a merchandising strategy?","Scott Settersten","No, I wouldn\u2019t say there is any significant difference, I am looking at Dave across the table here. I mean we work very closely as partners in determining, looking at the analysis, making sure that ROIs make sense and determining what locations would work best for the deployment of those boutiques. So it's agreed to in a combination and a partnership between us and the brands.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time I would like to turn the floor back to Mary Dillon for closing comments.","Mary Dillon","Great. Thank you. I would just like to thank our ULTA Beauty associates for all the great work they have done to deliver a really fantastic start to this year. And thanks to all of you for your interest in ULTA Beauty and we look forward to talking to you again soon. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Please proceed.","Laurel Lefebvre","Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Ulta Beauty\u2019s second quarter 2018 conference call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also, joining us is Dave Kimbell, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you of the company\u2019s Safe Harbor language.

The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance in the second quarter, reflecting rapid growth in prestige boutique brands, mass cosmetics, skin care and fragrance, offset by continued moderation in the growth rate of a few of our large color cosmetics brands.","Our flexible business model continues to support healthy retail comps, excellent new store productivity, and high-growth for Ulta.com, resulting in significant market share gains across categories.","To recap our financial performance, total sales grew 15.4%. We drove 6.5% comp sales growth on top of a 11.7% comp in the second quarter of 2017 with balanced traffic and ticket growth overall. Diluted earnings per share grew 34.4%.","We continued to deliver our results by executing on our strategic imperatives. I\u2019ll give you a progress report in each one starting with their efforts to drive loyalty and differentiate our brand.","We grew our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program to 29.5 million active members at the end of the second quarter, representing a 15.5% year-over-year increase. As we\u2019ve seen over the past few quarters, we expect the absolute growth in members to continue to moderate, but still exceed square footage growth.","Going forward, we expect to increase average sales per member to complement member growth. These gains will come from multiple sources, including the maturation of loyalty members, who buy more over time, the addition of new brands, the benefits of our Platinum and Diamond Tiers to increase share of wallet, higher penetration of our credit card program and greater personalization of our communications and offers to our guests.","This combination is expected to drive continued healthy revenue growth. Our guests continue to respond to the powerful combination of our loyalty, credit card and gift card programs. In the second quarter, we saw continued momentum with both Platinum and Diamond members of our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program, where we continue to innovate with the new tier enhanced rewards and increased personalization.","Our Ultamate Rewards credit card program continues to exceed our expectations, driven by great execution from our store teams and ongoing marketing efforts. Sales of gift cards grew more than 40% driven by expanding distribution in other retailers this year, as well as strong growth in our stores.","We\u2019re maintaining the very high levels of brand awareness we obtained earlier this year through our marketing efforts around events and promotions, including Mother\u2019s Day, our Gorgeous Hair events, our sale on jumbo-sized hair care products, as well as our programs targeting distinct guest segments, such as Latina, millennials and teenagers.","We continue to grow awareness of Ulta Beauty as the beauty destination and authority in many ways: Digital partnerships, which utilize influencers, social media and high-impact display placement. And these include POPSUGAR, Refinery29, and Bustle, as well as new Hispanic media partnerships with Mobvious, HCODE, Hola and Caf\u00e9Media. We also continue to invest in network radio and streaming audio, with Spotify and Pandora.","We\u2019ll continue to drive awareness and further depth to differentiate the Ulta Beauty brand as we evolve our positioning in deepening the emotional connection we have with our guests, beginning with an inspiring new television advertising campaign launching next week in which we\u2019ll bring to life our new brand statement, \u201cThe Possibilities are Beautiful.\u201d","We\u2019ll share more of this topic at our upcoming Analyst Day, but this new positioning which will be infused through all of our marketing communications and partnerships will unveil a new chapter for our brand celebrating the emotional and inclusive power of possibilities at Ulta Beauty.","Turning now to an overview of how we are continuing to differentiate our merchandise assortment. We continue to gain significant market share in prestige beauty as evidenced by NPD data from February through July this year. U.S. prestige beauty sales for the industry were up 6.4% and we grew more than 2.5 times as fast. Ulta Beauty has gained 210 basis points of share in prestige beauty so far this year and now represents almost 23% of the prestige beauty market as tracked by NPD.","Our share gains year-to-date was the strongest in the makeup category, up 360 basis points as Ulta Beauty grew prestige cosmetics in the mid-teens, compared to the total market growth of 1%. More broadly during the second quarter, we benefited from strength in mass cosmetics, prestige skincare, fragrance, prestige boutique brands, and sun care. Each of these categories drove healthy double-digit comps with particular strength in fragrance and boutique brands. These gains were offset by continued softness across a few large brands of prestige cosmetics.","We\u2019re seeing excellent growth in the expansion of brands that are not present in all doors, such as NARS, MAC, Clinique, Lanc\u00f4me, Estee Lauder, Morphe, and Chanel Beaut\u00e9. And we anticipate that these rollouts will be an even bigger benefit in the second-half of the year.","We\u2019re also encouraged by the amount of newness in the pipeline ahead, both new brands and new products from existing brands. We\u2019re delighted to announce the addition of Kiehl\u2019s Since 1851, the prestige skincare brand known for naturally-derived ingredients inspired by their apothecary roots. This brand will launch in a small number of doors in the second-half of the year and will be part of the Ulta Beauty express skin bar offering in these doors. The brand will then launch online in early January.","We plan to roll out Kiehl\u2019s in a more significant number of stores starting early next year. The product lineup will include Kiehl\u2019s skincare, body and men\u2019s products. On the mass cosmetics side, we\u2019re excited about the addition of Juvia\u2019s Place. This digitally-native brand was founded just a couple of years ago by a Nigerian-born woman inspired by the beauty of African queens. The line offers rich, vibrant, highly pigmented, and affordable collection of colorful eyeshadows, as well as its makeup tools and beauty essentials.","Juvia\u2019s Place recently launched online and will set in 500 stores later this year. Headwinds like Kiehl\u2019s and Juvia\u2019s Place to name just those two, reflect Ulta Beauty\u2019s status as a partner of choice for a wide range of brands from digitally native, vertically integrated brands to large, iconic brands.","In terms of new items from existing brands much more newness is on tap for the second half of the year giving us confidence for an improved comp trend. In many cases, these brand expansions or new product launches are exclusive to Ulta Beauty, or we have an early lead on must-have products that the beauty enthusiasts want to be the first to own.","The Tutti Frutti collection from Too Faced is expected to be a big hit with our guests. This is a fruit scented assortment of lip, eye, cheek and highlighter products with mega influencer Kandee Johnson, partnering with Too Faced as the face of the collection. Launched online in mid-August and set in stores just this week, this collection is only available at Ulta Beauty and toofaced.com.","Recently launched digitally-native brand, Morphe will be expanding to ten feet in all doors in just a few weeks, as a new Vault four-palette collection with influencer Jaclyn Hill had a very strong launch just a couple weeks ago. We\u2019re the only brick-and-mortar outlet for this brand.","NYX just launched exclusively with Ulta Beauty their Can\u2019t Stop Won\u2019t Stop long-wear foundation with a broad shade range. Other recent major product launches include equally anticipated items like the Norvina palette from Anastasia; the newest NARS mascara, where in both cases Ulta Beauty had an early lead for the launch.","Other new products include Clinique\u2019s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly; Tarte Creaseless Concealer; Urban Decay Aphrodisiac Palette; Dose of Colors limited edition collaboration with influencer iluvsarahii; Benefit Brow Contour pen; and Clinique My Happy Splashes fragrances designed for layering.","Now the last thing I want to mention is some breaking news. We are thrilled to confirm our exclusive partnership with Kylie Cosmetics, which will be launching in all stores and online later this year. Kylie Jenner is a highly influential force in the beauty industry. This brand addition is yet another example of successful, digitally-native brands valuing a brick-and-mortar partnership with Ulta Beauty to extend their reach with consumers. We\u2019ll share more details about this launch at a later date.","Now moving on to our services business. Salon sales increased 8.8% and comp sales rose 1.7% due to growth in average ticket. Skin services were a top performer helped by strength in microzone services. The express skin bar continues to roll out in new stores with about 40 stores now offering this new model.","These stores are already showing increases in prestige skincare sales compared to the prior model. This program offers our guests quick services on the sales floor with licensed skincare experts focused on helping guests choose a skin care regimen that addresses her concerns.","Select locations will begin offering facial services from Murad, Kate Somerville and Kiehl\u2019s in addition to Dermalogica, our longstanding skincare partner across the chain. We\u2019re on track to roll out 180 express skin bars by year-end and 50 of these will offer multi-brand skin services.","During the quarter, we completed training in California in preparation for their conversion to our new services optimization program, a model that improves and simplifies the guest and associated experiences with changes to pricing, training, and compensation.","Our new stores in Hawaii opened with this program joining the central region, as well as the DC and Denver districts, which were launched in the first quarter. Early results indicate higher guest retention and our stylists have received the new program very favorably. We plan to introduce this model to additional regions in 2019.","We continue to focus on gaining awareness within the salon industry. We participated in Premiere Orlando, attended by over 57,000 beauty professionals and we hosted the first-ever Ulta Beauty show at the North American Hair Stylists Awards in Las Vegas. NAHA represents the most prestigious hair industry awards in North America, viewed by over 200,000 people and garnering 5 million impressions.","Last quarter, we mentioned that the Ulta Beauty pro hair team had received nine nominations across multiple hair categories, and we\u2019re pleased to update you that one of our team members took home the award for Hair Stylist of the Year. Events like these establish Ulta Beauty as a great place to work for stylists and help us to continue to attract top quality talent.","And now turning to real estate. We opened 19 stores in the second quarter, compared to 20 last year and closed two, ending the quarter with 1,124 stores. Our growth and development team has done a great job getting stores opened earlier in the year with 53 stores opened in the first-half compared to 38 last year.","We opened our first store in Hawaii on Maui in the second quarter and have opened another Hawaii store early in the third quarter, with plans to open two more on Oahu during Q3. Our Hawaii stores are off to an excellent start. We\u2019ll also be entering Vermont later this year to reach the milestone of opening of operating stores in all 50 states.","New store productivity continues to be very strong. We continue to study new store productivity and observe cannibalization to be stable and well within our expectations. So we feel very comfortable with our network strategy in reaching our target of 1,400 to 1,700 stores in the U.S. over the next several years.","And now turning to an update on Ulta.com. E-commerce sales grew 37.9% and represented 9% of total company sales. This moderation relative to the first quarter was expected as we\u2019re comping over 72% growth last year when we benefited from the MAC launch and high-growth from several online-only brands.","Ulta.com contributed 250 basis points of the total company comp, driven by transaction growth. Total traffic rose close to 40%, with mobile traffic up 50%. We continue to drive significant growth with online-only brands and online-only promotions.","Our store-to-door program that allows guests to order online in our stores and have products shipped to their homes continues to exceed expectations, particularly with brands that aren\u2019t available in every door, such as ColourPop, MAC, and several digitally-native brands that are in high-demand, but in limited distribution.","Ulta.com recently launched a foundation finder. We\u2019re continuing to see success from enhanced content programs like our monthly fragrance crush and we just launched a new program focusing on a key skincare trend each month called Skinfatuation. We\u2019re also testing personalization initiatives in several areas.","Omni-channel customers now represent 10% of loyalty members and the shopping behavior of these guests continues to reinforce our view that e-commerce sales are largely incremental. The guest shopping on Ulta.com continues to shop more frequently in stores than retail-only customers. This guest is our most engaged loyalty member, demonstrating interest in new brands and products and a low incidence of replenishing exact items.","And finally, I\u2019ll update you on our supply chain operations. Ulta Beauty supply chain operations continued to mature in the first-half of 2018, supported by investments in capabilities that support growth, deliver a great guest experience and enable network efficiencies.","Our in-stock position throughout the second quarter was consistently strong, particularly for our top selling items. We effectively manage our inventory position throughout the quarter with our inventory per store well below comp growth and inventory turn slightly ahead of our goal.","We\u2019ve made several improvements for a logistics network over the last several months to better serve our retail and e-commerce customers. And so far the results have led to improved performance and reduced costs across both channels.","We also recently implemented an order management system that enables future omni-channel capabilities such as buy online, pickup in store. Our newest distribution center in Fresno, California went live in July, serving both e-commerce and retail operations. This DC is planned to ramp quickly with a more aggressive first-year build than Greenwood and Dallas.","Fresno is currently serving nearly 100 stores and about 20% of our e-com volume. In the fall, Fresno will ramp to about 170 stores and maintain it\u2019s share of Ulta.com sales. And after the holiday season, Fresno will ramp to serve you more than 200 stores and more than 20% of our e-commerce sales.","Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the strong performance of our supply chain operations in-stocks and decreases in inventory per door. This year, we\u2019ve implemented improved processes for the large number of inventory transitions we execute as a result of our growing access to new brands and products.","At the end of the quarter, we ran a special clearance event with extra discounts and inventory resulting from the major plan where reset we executed recently. The event was designed to sell-through inventory no longer on a store\u2019s planogram and cleanup our back room, setting us up for a great 21 Days of Beauty and strong holiday season and is proceeding on plan.","Now before I turn it over to Scott, I\u2019d like to give you a preview of our upcoming Investor and Analyst Conference. Scheduled for November 8, near Chicago, this will be our third Biennial Investor Conference. In similar and prior events, it\u2019s an opportunity to get to know the management team, learn about our latest thinking on our market share gain opportunities, our consumer targets, our brand positioning, get an update on our loyalty program and share wallet potential, hear about the outlook for newness across our merchandise portfolio, learn more about the salon services optimization program, see how we\u2019re investing in technology and innovation to enhance the guest experience, get a refresher on our supply chain capabilities, learn more about our efficiencies for growth program, and get a current view on our capital allocation. So lot\u2019s to cover and we hope you\u2019ll join us in November.","And with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Scott to talk in more detail about our second quarter results and share outlook for the second-half.","Scott Settersten","Thank you, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Starting with the income statement. Revenue growth of 15.4% was driven by a 6.5% comp and continued strength from new store sales. The revenue recognition accounting standard implemented at the beginning of the year added 9.4 million of sales.","As a reminder, this represents the impact of income from our credit card program and gift card breakage moving up to the revenue line, as well as e-commerce revenue now being recognized upon shipment date instead of delivery date to the customer. These items are partly offset by the value of loyalty points earned now treated as a reduction of net sales.","Our retail comparable sales growth was not impacted by the revenue recognition change. Traffic and ticket for the total company was fairly balanced with a 3.1% increase in transactions and a 3.4% lift in average ticket. The retail-only comp of 4.1% was made up of 1.1% traffic and 3% ticket growth. Ticket was driven by modest increases in both average selling price and UPT. A combined retail and salon comp was 4%, which included the salon comp of 1.7%.","Turning to margins. Gross profit deleveraged 40 basis points. The new revenue recognition accounting standard was a benefit of about 60 basis points to the gross profit line, so the underlying roughly 100 basis points of deleverage was attributed to several primary factors. About a third was from supply chain expense, reflecting the cost of opening the new Fresno distribution center. About a third was investments in our salon operations as we roll out our salon optimization program.","And the remaining third was related to ongoing pressures from the mix of e-commerce sales, prestige brand boutiques and mass cosmetics relative to higher-margin categories, as well as the clearance event that we ran at the end of the quarter that Mary already referenced.","This event focused on selling through inventory that was no longer being sold in certain stores, where we\u2019ve had a series of significant reflows and planogram resets across multiple categories this year. While we typically have smaller clearance events throughout the year, this one reflected more aggressive markdowns and more items featured overall to make sure we cleared the stores ahead of the holiday season and major launches of fall newness.","This event is ongoing and will wrap up in a few weeks. Aside from this exceptional activity, promotional levels were stable year-over-year. Finally, we did see modest leverage in rent and occupancy expenses to partially offset these factors.","Turning to SG&A. We deleveraged by 70 basis points, reflecting 80 basis points of deleverage from the revenue recognition accounting standard, the 10 basis points of underlying SG&A leverage was a bright spot considering we deleveraged store labor expense, primarily in support of our prestige boutique strategy and also deleveraged advertising expense slightly, while expecting this line item to be flat for the full year.","Offsetting this pressure was strong leverage in corporate overhead, reflecting good expense management and early savings from our cost optimization program, as well as timing of some budgeted G&A costs that will be incurred later in the year.","Operating margin was 13% of sales and was down 100 basis points as expected from last year\u2019s Q2 result of 14%, with 20 basis points of the decrease coming from the revenue recognition accounting change. Diluted EPS increased 34.4% with the upside to our guidance primarily due to corporate overhead savings and timing of expenses.","Moving on the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory grew 6.5%, but decreased 4.3% on a per store basis, well below comparable sales growth and a strong outcome in light of the investments in inventory to start operating our new Fresno distribution center during the quarter. This excellent performance reflects the new tools and systems we invested in to manage inventory, as well as the more significant clearance activity at the end of the quarter.","Capital expenditures were $68 million for the quarter or new stores, investments in systems, prestige boutiques, merchandise fixtures and supply chain activities. We ended the quarter with $386.1 million in cash and short-term investments. We repurchased 512,000 shares through our 10b5-1 program at a cost of $127 million during the second quarter.","$402 million remain available on the $625 million authorization as of quarter-end.","Turning now to guidance for the third quarter and full-year. For the third quarter of 2018, we expect sales to be in the range of $1.550 billion to $1.563 billion versus $1.342 billion last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 7% to 8% versus 10.3% last year. E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the 40% range.","We plan to open approximately 40 new stores in the third quarter, compared to 48 in Q3 last year and remain on track to open 100 net new stores this year. Q3 preopening expense is expected to be slightly lower as a rate of sales.","Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.11 to $2.16 versus $1.70 last year, and operating margin is planned to deleverage, including the roughly 20 basis points related to the revenue recognition account standard consistent with the impact we saw in the first-half of the year.","The tax rate for Q3 is expected to be 24%. This does not include any assumptions for the tax rate impact of share-based compensation accounting, which is difficult to forecast. Our fully diluted share count is estimated at 60 million.","For the full-year, we are maintaining our outlook for full-year 2018 to reflect some of the timing we mentioned with planned expenses occurring later that n the year. We plan to open 100 new stores, all are our 10,000 square foot standard prototype.","We\u2019ll complete 50 remodel and relocation projects. We expect to grow e-commerce approximately 40%. We anticipate top line growth in the low-teens, including the impact of the 53rd-week last year. Total company comps are expected to be in the 6% to 8% range, with retail comp in the mid single digits.","We expect to grow diluted earnings per share in the low 20s percentage ring, including the extra week in 2017. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $375 million, depreciation is forecasted at approximately $290 million. We expect to repurchase shares in the $500 million for the year and the annual tax rate for the remainder of the year is expected to be 24%.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to our conference call host for the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Tunick from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Tunick","Thanks, and good afternoon. I guess, the first question was a little more help maybe from Scott on the third quarter. Obviously, there\u2019s some comparisons on the hurricane issues and some SG&A initiatives. Can you maybe help us parse out how you\u2019re expecting gross margin versus SG&A to play out in the third quarter and maybe in the back-half just the different components first.","Scott Settersten","Sure, Brian. So, I guess, on the gross margin line, we would expect a bit of a pivot here as we look ahead to the second-half of the year. So the third quarter, I think, you\u2019ll probably will remember we\u2019re going to be anniversarying over some hurricane activity last year. So we had some pretty significant, what I would say, merchandise margin investments in rate last year to try to mitigate against some of the sales softness that we saw you know as part of the hurricane impact.","So, we\u2019ll be lapping that, so we feel good about where we are. So I think you would expect to see gross margin above \u2013 show good leverage above the accounting change impact that we saw here that 20 basis points in the first-half of the year, so I guess that would be the first thing I would say.","On the SG&A side, more deleveraged than we saw in the first-half of the year, so I think that\u2019s where you\u2019ll find equilibrium there for the back-half, so we\u2019ve got some projects again. Some things we\u2019re doing for the first time, some of these new technologies that we\u2019re implementing across the business, so some of our initial timelines were just a little bit slower off the line, I guess, I would say on that, but we feel good about -- we\u2019re going to get everything completed in the second-half of the year and position ourselves well for 2019 and beyond.","Brian Tunick","And then maybe could Mary talk a little about the larger prestige color cosmetics that you\u2019re talking about here. How big of a portion of the business is that? Has the company gone through a similar period before from either a lack of newness or cadence of product introductions? Maybe just talk about what the company has seen before through this kind of period?","Mary Dillon","Well, obviously, it\u2019s sort of a \u2013 it\u2019s a mix story, I guess, I would say. We continue to drive solid growth in prestige cosmetics overall. We continue to have great market share gains. We\u2019ve seen through our boutique brands, they\u2019re growing very nicely. Many of our prestige brands are growing with strong innovation and social media presence, but a few of our bigger prestige brands are not lapping the newness, I guess I\u2019d say. So that\u2019s putting some pressure on the model.","This is what we do, I guess, all the time. Our merchants are constantly evaluating and working with our brand partners to continue to strengthen the pipeline. We feel really good about the pipeline. First of all, our overall business model, I think is -- it shows the strength and flexibility at a time where you might have a segment that\u2019s not as strong, but delivering strong results across many categories, and we\u2019re working with \u2013 closely with our brands. And maybe Dave, if you want to add a little bit about, we feel really good about the pipeline of newness and innovation coming up in the second half.","David Kimbell","Yes, we really do, really across the store to reiterate what Mary said, we\u2019re really happy and excited about the whole mix and the assortment in all categories, haircare, skin care, fragrance, and cosmetics, and we\u2019re seeing some nice growth in the entire store.","Although as Mary said, our \u2013 some of our largest prestige brands have had some challenges. But as we look forward, we\u2019re really optimistic. We\u2019ve been working closely. They certainly \u2013 the brands themselves are focused on driving growth. I\u2019ll give you a couple of examples of things that we\u2019re very optimistic and excited about.","Tarte is one of our largest brands and it\u2019s been driving actually strong growth all year long in part because of the Double Duty Beauty line that\u2019s exclusive to Ulta Beauty and that\u2019s been successful all year. And we have seen some nice innovation and expansion of that business that will continue to drive growth through the rest of the year.","Too Faced, Mary mentioned, just launched an exclusive line only at Ulta Beauty, Tutti Frutti, which is off to a strong start early. But we\u2019re excited that has a long history \u2013 that brand has a long history of growth and success at Ulta Beauty, and we\u2019re optimistic. IT Cosmetics, a brand that really grew up in many ways at Ulta Beauty has recently launched some new lines, including a 48-shade concealer line, Bye Bye Under Eye concealer, that also is off to a strong start.","And Benefit, we\u2019ve had a long partnership with Benefit, including a unique brow partnership, brow service partner \u2013 Brow Bar service partnership, and they\u2019ve had a steady stream of innovation and we\u2019re optimistic about what\u2019s coming, including a strong holiday. So across the board, as Mary said, we see ups and downs naturally in our business, but as we look forward, we see a lot of good things coming.","Brian Tunick","Thanks very much for the color, and good luck for the fall season.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question.","Julie Kim","Hi, this is Julie Kim on for Simeon. Thank you for taking our questions. I was just wondering about the salon segment, if you could provide any color there? I believe comps slowed down sequentially, so just curious on what trends you\u2019re seeing, and given the expansion of the skin bar, what your thoughts are on longer-term for opportunities?","Mary Dillon","Yes. Well, we\u2019re very invested in the services part of our business. It\u2019s a critical differentiator. It\u2019s \u2013 that salon guest, any service guest is really one of our best guest, because they shop and spend much more. They spend almost 3 times what somebody who is not using services does.","So our salon business continues to outperform the market. We have exceptional talent. We do see that we believe we can reinvent it to make it even better, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this services optimization work. Early results are very encouraging and it\u2019s really about optimizing menu, pricing, training, hiring, kind of across the board.","So you don\u2019t expect that to show fast results quickly, but that early results are actually very encouraging. And also, as we start to rollout the skin bar with these quicker services, that is off to a very strong start as well. And it\u2019s very much as being responsive to what our guests want and need from us. They care a lot about skincare. They don\u2019t have maybe as much time to have a long service, but they\u2019re very happy to start participating in these quicker services. So a lot of new brand launches, a lot of innovation there, and we feel good about where it\u2019s heading.","Julie Kim","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Stephanie Wissink","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll ask a question on Kylie Cosmetics. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk a little bit about that partnership, what the timing is of the expected rollout. Mary, I think you indicated back part of the year, but will that be in stores for holiday? And then how should we think about that in tandem with your new marketing campaign in terms of added possibilities at Ulta? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","All right. Well, it\u2019s a new possibility at Ulta. Yes, so we\u2019re not going to \u2013 we don\u2019t really have details to disclose today, but know that it will be all stores and online by holiday. We\u2019re really excited about it. It\u2019s going to be, I think, a fantastic partnership for us. And I\u2019ll see if you want anything more.","I\u2019ll just add, if we start to do advertising, which starts September 2, so it\u2019s right around the corner, really proud about, I think, the work and we pretested the works, so we feel good about how consumers are going to react to it. It\u2019s just the next evolution of our brand and really elevating to a more emotional level in a way that\u2019s very consistent with how people want to see Ulta Beauty and talk about beauty. So more to come on that, but I think bakes it very nicely together.","Stephanie Wissink","And Scott, can I just follow-up on an earlier question regarding the third quarter. I think you mentioned that the investments are largely going to be in technology in the SG&A line. Can you maybe extrapolate a little bit more around what\u2019s left within in the investment cycles that you still need to focus on here over the six to 12 months? And how should we think about that equalizing over the course of the next several months kind of as you pass through Q3 and into back-half and onward into 2019?","Scott Settersten","Yes, so a little more clarification on that. I mean, typically, the third quarter is the toughest for us on a margin expansion kind of quest over the long-term. So you\u2019ve got peak new store implementation, you\u2019ve got peak boutique and labor component with that implementation in the third quarter. This year on top of that, you\u2019ve got the Fresno DC, which is at peak deleverage in the P&L there as it kind of gets off the starting line, so to speak. So there\u2019s a lot of things at the core that kind of pile up in the third quarter that make it a challenge for us.","And then in addition to that, we laid out earlier in the year some of the incremental investments that we have, right, as part of the tax reform working our business. So a lot of those projects, the test and learns and other things that we have queued up are just taking a little bit longer to get implemented than we initially thought earlier in the year.","So again, the majority of that falls into the third quarter. So when we\u2019re talking about shifting of expenses, that\u2019s a big piece of it as well. And then advertising or marketing is a little bit more on top of that. So with the new advertising launch here in the fall, we move some of the spending from the first-half of the year and into the second. So again, just trying to take advantage of making sure we\u2019re optimizing from all focus points.","So third quarter you\u2019re going to see more deleverage on the SG&A line than maybe we were thinking last quarter when we spoke with you. But again, as we roll it forward to the fourth quarter with sales, Fresno up and running working towards, as Mary mentioned, a quicker ramp than we\u2019ve seen in the past. We expect a lot of that to moderate in the fourth quarter.","So again, for the full-year, we\u2019re right on target with our 50 to 70 basis points of deleverage on the operating margin line. And then feel like we\u2019re really in a good spot setting ourselves up well for 2019 and beyond.","Stephanie Wissink","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks, good evening. Can you talk a little bit about the 7% to 8% guide for the third quarter? It\u2019s been interesting. Your comps haven\u2019t really bounced on easier comparisons, but clearly, you\u2019ve got a lot of self-help coming here in the third quarter. So I guess, my question is, is the seven to eight more anticipatory of the lift that\u2019s ahead or is there something that you\u2019re seeing in the month of August that is giving you the encouragement to guide this way?","Mary Dillon","Well, thank you for the question. I\u2019m not going to comment on the quarter that we\u2019re in, but you know, we really try to give our best guidance. We do expect to see acceleration against some easier comps in the second-half. And I think we talked about a couple of times the continued roll out of some of our high-growth brands, newness from existing brand partners, new advertising, 21 Days Of Beauty, which is always a great event for us. So we just believe that and see the ability for our comps to strengthen, as we get further into the year.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. And then in terms of the boutique roll out. You\u2019ve accelerated that over the past few years. In the past, you talked about the boutique sort of mature over a three-year timeframe. It\u2019s tough for us to lay out sort of that math. But as you think about the lift from the boutique additions that you\u2019ve done over the past few years and this year, is the benefit from that boutique roll out accelerating here into the back-half of 2018 and into 2019?","Scott Settersten","No, I wouldn\u2019t say, there\u2019s an acceleration. I\u2019d say overall, we\u2019re very happy with the performance of those boutique brands. Again, they\u2019re a big contributor to our comp performance here in the recent quarters. Again, everything\u2019s got to stay in balance, right? So very happy with the top line performance of those boutiques and our investments there. But it does create a little bit of a headwind as we discussed in the past on the margin rate line.","So again, trying to balance it all for an optimized result overall. So I wouldn\u2019t call it an acceleration. Although I would point out this year, like Mary mentioned the new stores. So we did kind of sequence our field construction program a little differently this year. We\u2019ve pulled ahead, I guess, the new store roll outs. So we\u2019re further ahead on new store week, so that\u2019s a good thing getting those stores open further in advance of the holiday season.","So the store teams are more seasoned and ready to go. We think that\u2019s going to be a benefit. And some of the new boutique installs are kind of dragging later in the year than they have the last couple of years. So again, that\u2019s another comp driver that we think gives us confidence on the second-half of the year.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. Best of luck.","Scott Settersten","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager from Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Altschwager","Good afternoon. Thanks. Just to clarify, Scott, I think if I heard you correctly, you said you do expect gross margin to be up in Q3 even before the accounting benefit. Is that accurate? And then, what is the merchandise margin expectation that\u2019s embedded in that? I think merch margin was the primary driver to the gross margin decline last year. So just trying to get a sense of a reasonable expectation in terms of recapture? Thanks.","Scott Settersten","Yes, I don\u2019t think I can quantify it in basis points for you, Mark, but you\u2019ve hit the nail right on the head. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re expecting. So that will be the pivot point in the third quarter. I mean, again, I don\u2019t recall exactly what we stated, but it was significant basis point investment last year. I mean, those hurricanes really hurt us last year, and so we made a decision to invest in rate to drive sales through incremental promotional events and so we made the decision. We made the right decision for that point in time and now this year as we cycle that we expect to see a bounce back on that. And based on the early reach, we\u2019re feeling very confident where we\u2019re headed.","Mark Altschwager","And it seems like a lot of moving pieces on the SG&A front this year. Is there a way to think kind of as you get beyond 2018 and a lot of these kind of your one-time expenses on the supply chain front, what\u2019s a normalized level of SG&A growth that\u2019s needed to sustain the strength in the business? Thanks.","Scott Settersten","Yes, I don\u2019t think I can again quantify for that specifically year-to-date. Maybe that\u2019s something we can queue up for Analyst Day a little bit differently than maybe we\u2019ve looked at it in the past. But again, this year we\u2019ve got a significant reinvestment right, of those tax reform benefits that approved to us this year. So again, a lot of that \u2013 a lot \u2013 yes, trying to quantify what\u2019s recurring and what\u2019s one time kind of thing.","I mean, we\u2019re in a very dynamic environment here in retail and there\u2019s things that we just need to do to make sure we sustain a healthy business for the long-term and that\u2019s what we intend to do. So we\u2019ll keep you updated. Again, we talked about guidance for 2019 and we\u2019re feeling pretty good about right now. And when we see you in November, we\u2019ll give you a view of how we\u2019re thinking about the longer-term.","Mark Altschwager","Looking forward to it. Best of luck.","Scott Settersten","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Adrienne Yih","Good afternoon, everyone. Mary, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about sort of the promotional backdrop. It seems like year-to-date the department stores have done a little bit better and therefore, maybe aren\u2019t as aggressive on the promos. And then if you can comment on recently, there was an article about CVS rolling out this beauty experiencing and collaboration with GlamSquad?","And then finally, Scott, as you talk about 2019, in order for margins to expand, do you need comp \u2013 the store comp to accelerate from that kind of fourish level, or will the fixed cost break-even point come down to that level, because you\u2019re going to have some of these investments rolling off? Thank you very much.","Mary Dillon","Okay, a three parter. I\u2019ll start on the promotional strategy. I will just say this, it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve been consistent year-over-year in the quarter. There\u2019s \u2013 I would say, the overall environment is always competitive. We\u2019re not seeing any major shifts, I would say, in the promotional environment, it\u2019s stable, but pretty promotional environment. I feel really good about the model that we have.","We\u2019ve worked hard over the last five years to really diversify our, I guess, I\u2019d call the demand levers and tools. And we always have the ability to pull different levers with an increasing focus on using our loyalty program or CRM program, more personalized over time. So \u2013 and it\u2019s allowed us to really balance the mix and invest in things like advertising and PR and social media.","So, I think we\u2019ve got that, we flex as we need, but we don\u2019t see that as being necessarily very different right now, I guess, than it\u2019s been. Your other question, competition, everybody is interested in the beauty business.","Adrienne Yih","Yes.","Mary Dillon","And so we\u2019re aware, pay attention to everything that\u2019s going on. We, I think, have a real strong lead as it relates to having a differentiated model whether we\u2019re talking about competing with mass or we\u2019ve got obviously very differentiated matte assortment in the mass arena or mass, prestige arena, plus services, plus our loyalty program. So, I love what we\u2019re doing as it relates to digitally-native brands across prestige and mass. And so we look at everything as game on, but not \u2013 it doesn\u2019t keep me up at night, I guess I\u2019d say.","Adrienne Yih","Okay. Fair enough.","Scott Settersten","And then as far as the outlook for 2019 and how the algorithm might work, so we would, I would say, we take a reasonable prudent view of what the top line might look like, right, and we build the cost infrastructure to match that and then we hope we do better on the top line, right with some of the newness than we have in our side. So, you used the term fixed \u2013 it\u2019s fixed cost and variable cost. The things we talked about our efficiencies for growth initiatives that we kicked off here earlier this year. So, that will be a big piece of it. So, we see cost efficiencies across the business, very happy with where we are in that.","With DC, again we got Fresno this year that will drop off, right. So, we won\u2019t have another one in 2019, that\u2019s not planned now. So, we\u2019ll get some benefit there and then the investments we\u2019re making the tax reform investments that we\u2019re investing in this year, we expect to get benefits out of that right in 2019 and beyond. So, maybe that would be a way to think about it.","Adrienne Yih","Great. Thank you, very much, and good forward to seeing in the fall.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Erinn Murphy","Great, thanks, good afternoon. Mary, my question, it\u2019s for you. You talked about in your prepared remarks, the opportunity for spend per loyal consumer to further increase. Can you just share with us what you\u2019re learning about the platinum and the diamond tier customers whether its frequent into the stores, spend per customer? And then I guess secondly, just on the second quarter, the stores that overlap at the Bon Ton, can you just talk about how they performed and if your second guidance implies any share gain from Bon Ton\u2019s closure? Thanks.","Mary Dillon","We are careful not to break out a lot of detail about the various performance of the tiers, but I will tell you that obviously we considered a successful and the strong tool for us, but if you step way back, today we have just under 30 million members in our loyalty program, but they still represent one-third of the beauty enthusiasts in the U.S. and we only have about a third of the wallet share. So, I look at that as a continued source, we\u2019re very focused on how we\u2019re going to grow both that, the number of members, as well as wallet share. And, I mean the innovation that he team is putting in place in the program are really working.","So, the diamond tier, really strong move for us, credit card, increasing personalization engine and recommendation engine, so as well as really strong focus by our teams in-store on driving awareness and conversion of the program. So, we see that as a core asset for us and feel really good about how we\u2019re going to continue to innovate to drive growth.","On Bon Ton, I would just say, we\u2019re certainly paying attention to everything that\u2019s happening competitively and we\u2019re obviously reaching out \u2013 make sure customers are looking for a place to shop for beauty and those markets know about Ulta Beauty, I would say our guidance assumes we\u2019re going to continue to gain share across from several sources, we don\u2019t predict that precisely down to an individual competitor. But we see closure impact of stores, it can have kind of plus or minus, but generally built into our expectations.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Rupesh Parikh","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So, on your NARS cosmetics business, the performance really stands out versus your peers this quarter. So, I was just curious as you look at the reset that you\u2019ve done this year-to-date, have there been any surprises versus your expectations?","Dave Kimbell","Yes. We are very happy with our NARS cosmetics business in a lot of ways with their make-up business overall. But, yes \u2013 no I think the things that we set out to do we\u2019re feeling good about accomplishing them some of our biggest more established brands like our Ulta Beauty Collection, Loreal. Maybelline are playing important roles, but a lot of newness has come in to really excite guests and engage them in new ways.","In particular brands that are exclusive and only found at Ulta, Morphe as one that Mary mentioned in her prepared remarks, it\u2019s been one that\u2019s been driving a lot of growth the recent Jaclyn Hill, pilot launch of just a couple weeks ago was quite successful and we\u2019ve continued expansion of that brand, make-up revolution, also exclusive in the United States to Ulta has grown quite well and plays a very important role in our overall assortment.","The addition of ColourPop, one of the stronger influencer led digitally native brands has also been a nice complement to our overall portfolio and driven a lot of growth. So, we\u2019re really pleased with its performance. We see a lot of growth in that space and continue to focus on all of make-up and anticipate more growth than mass base in particular.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Daniel Hofkin from William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Hofkin","Good afternoon. Just wanted to see if you could just comment briefly, I may have missed it, but are older stores in this type of an environment are your older stores still comping positive or breakeven kind of where does that stand at this point?","Scott Settersten","So, the fleet looks healthy overall, again as you would expect with a mid-single digit comp in the retail side. The older stores five years and older are low-single to mid-single digit comps. So, again, we\u2019re not seeing anything unusual there. Oftentimes, we might see some sales transfer or cannibalization, but oftentimes we do that to ourselves, right. So, we\u2019re trying to make sure we\u2019ve got best positions in the market and we\u2019re in it for the long-term, we\u2019re in it for total dollars on the top and bottom line. So, feeling good about \u2013 as Mary said, feeling good about new store productivity and our long-term target.","Daniel Hofkin","Okay, great. And then if any update on just kind of the major urban store locations that you\u2019ve opened in the last year Chicago and Manhattan and kind of what you see in the early going as the potential incremental opportunities there?","Mary Dillon","Yes, those stores are performing really well. We\u2019re thrilled that we opened them. I think they\u2019re giving us great brand awareness and also really performing very nicely for us. So, I think, going forward, it will still be a smallish part of what we do. Obviously, the cost to run those businesses is a lot higher than a non-urban store, but we love what we\u2019re seeing on the those.","Daniel Hofkin","Okay, great. Best of luck.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Fassler","Thanks so much and good afternoon. My first question, my primary question relates to your prestige market share numbers. You quoted some nice increases on an aggregate basis. Can you give us a sense of how that\u2019s transpiring on a same store basis and also what direction the trend has gone for you in terms of your prestigious market share trajectory?","Dave Kimbell","Yes. So, I\u2019ll jump in and our prestige market share overall has been growing significantly well for several years and the first half of second quarter of this year was no exception. I think the main drivers of that growth and that\u2019s happening certainly as we\u2019ve added new stores, but for sure, within our comp stores. Even the brands that we\u2019ve talked about today that \u2013 in that prestige space that haven\u2019t been performing to our expectations, or still performing largely better at Ulta than perhaps in other places across the market.","So, the drivers of that growth are really a combination [technical difficulty] continuing to expand some of the brands that are in limited distribution that are rolling out into more stores, that\u2019s a significant contributor to our market share growth, brands like MAC and Estee Lauder, Clinique, Lancome really across the board and NARS.","The addition of new brands like Flesh as an example, recently has been in addition to adding growth. And then some of these exclusive lines that I\u2019ve talked about earlier with Tarte Double Duty Beauty now, Too Faced Tutti Frutti are significantly driving growth, and are \u2013 because they are exclusive are driving strong share growth as well. So, to multi-tiered level and we\u2019re definitely seeing in comp stores, as well as new stores, and I\u2019m excited.","The last thing I\u2019d say with that though is, digitally native brands are certainly having an impact on the total prestige market and total makeup market. That\u2019s why we\u2019re really focused on driving these brands, brands like Morphe, ColourPop that we\u2019ve added and now, as Mary mentioned, confirming the launch of Kylie who will play an important role and continuing to make sure that we\u2019re driving shares well into the future.","Matt Fassler","And very briefly on Kylie, obviously, a new piece of news or guidance it is as it was, should we consider that new brand addition to be included in the present guidance for the rest of the year?","Mary Dillon","I would say, yes. Think about it like that it comes quite late in the year, and so we\u2019ve factored that into our thinking. And it\u2019s like any new brand, it\u2019s really hard to predict, exactly how it will play, but think about it as included in the guidance, yes.","Matt Fassler","Got you. Thank you so much for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Binetti","Hi guys, good afternoon and thanks for taking our question here. Can I just ask the quick model question, I might have missed this, but is the plan still for the merchandise margin to be flat this year, and I guess related was the planogram change that you discussed that resulted in the clearance activity contemplated in the initial guidance for merch margins flat?","Scott Settersten","Yes, I think directionally flat is the way to think about it for the full-year and the clearance work \u2013 where the clearance event at the end of the second quarter is not going to have any significant impact on that.","Michael Binetti","Okay. And would you mind help them walk us up to how you\u2019re thinking about, I guess, gross margins for the fourth quarter, which is obviously very promotional quarter, but there\u2019s some noise last year and the compare in the fourth quarter with the 53rd-week, I think maybe just help us think about how you\u2019re building up to your gross margin expectation in all the important holiday season.","Scott Settersten","Yes, I think the way I described the third quarter to the pivot point here where we expect gross margin to leverage in the third quarter, it is consistent with the fourth quarter as well. So again, to your point, some unusual activity last year, the DC ramp up your Fresno is going to give us the less headwind, I guess, I would say as we look to the fourth quarter or so. Efficiency of the company, the enterprise overall continues to get more efficient. So, you take the newness cupped in a better sales trends there coupled with the efficiency that we\u2019re building every day, feel like we\u2019re going to be able to expand gross margins in the fourth quarter as well.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Mary, maybe one more just a little more fun to think about. Obviously, you said the growth rate of the loyalty customer will mature just given the size of that program for you, but \u2013 so to the earlier question, would you mind sharing any kind of numerical example or KPIs of the wallet share metrics that you\u2019re seeing that accelerate that drive the confidence. In the comments you said, in your thoughts on gains from the share of wallet for the customer, please?","Mary Dillon","Yes, which as I said earlier, just in broadly, we\u2019ve got about a third of the share of wallet of our loyalty numbers overall, so we don\u2019t really break that out in any more level of specificity, but you can imagine some that are more highly engaged, we have a higher share of wallet than others. But on average, it\u2019s a third. So, our focus as we think about the future is just really \u2013 we\u2019ve got everything to be enthusiast more of the love and we\u2019re going to continue to offer her everything she needs and more.","And so, for us it is about continuing, but she\u2019ll also never have 100% of a wallet share, because people shop in different places sometimes. But we think that between increased levels of personalization of our offers and just innovation in the program and also innovation of what we offer. We\u2019re going to continue to focus on how we can even drive more of that wallet share growth over time. But it doesn\u2019t move overnight, it takes a while, but that\u2019s the key area of focus for us.","Michael Binetti","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Oliver Chen","Hi, thank you. Regarding the planograms, what are your thoughts about what the new planograms will do for you and how you ensure that this is a good stuff just in front of the all-important holiday selling season? And Mary, I would love your thoughts on what we\u2019re seeing with the bifurcation of the larger brands versus some of the newer brands. Do you expect that, that will be a trend that will continue in terms of just the reality of the pace of newness that you\u2019re seeing and how the industry dynamics have changed? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Well, maybe I\u2019ll start with it and then Dave will talk about the planograms, but I just think it\u2019s actually it\u2019s a really exciting and interesting time for innovation and entrepreneurialism in this industry, and the great thing is that we can participate across all that. I\u2019m proud about how our team is building partnerships, but I\u2019ll tell you some of the largest, most iconic and well-known brands are doing really well with the younger guests, as well as to what is the great example of the classic, iconic brand that millennials have rediscovered, and of course, then there is a lots of brands that are starting up as entrepreneurial direct-to-consumer.","So, I think that is certainly going to continue to be the dynamic going forward and our goal is to bring our guest really everything that she wants across the spectrums, but I \u2013 it doesn\u2019t mean that anyone is going to win the long term, I think it\u2019s the mosaic of being in all those sectors of the market.","David Kimbell","And as far as the planograms, of course, newness has placed a really important role in our overall business, so we\u2019re always updating our assortment, and all that goes back to some of the things that we talked about today about our optimism about the newness that\u2019s coming. And so, we feel really good about the planogram, we think we\u2019ve got the stores in a good place to present this new product and we\u2019re ready for 21 Days of Beauty, which starts on Sunday and then going into the obviously important holidays season. So, a lot of newness stores are well-prepared to accept that newness and present it in a really compelling way to our guest.","Oliver Chen","And just lastly on inventory management and the Swift system and how you\u2019re thinking about the line of communication between you and vendors, as well as accuracy in turns, what are your thoughts about where you are versus where you want to be in order to get the goods at the right place at the right time at the right place and that would be great? Thank you.","Scott Settersten","So, I will just remind you that Swift is just one element of a complete, I would call it a complete rebuild of the behind, the merchandising support, infrastructure I guess I will say, so there\u2019s space planning tools that have been built and implemented over the last couple of years. Swift is a key piece of that, but there\u2019s also a lot of work going on in our distribution centers like the old legacy centers and the new centers with new operating models and so on.","So, they all are working in unison. And so, we\u2019re only in the early innings I guess I would say. You\u2019ve seen the last couple of quarters, our inventory productivity improved or taken excess inventory out of the system, while keeping in-stock levels very high, so its feeling good about where we are and we\u2019re on a path right, a multi-year path that continue to see that and inventory optimization is going to be a significant driver of operating margin improvement in 2019 and beyond.","David Kimbell","And to add to your point about the \u2013 just a quick add on our brand partners, we\u2019ve worked very closely, particularly over the last couple of years to fully integrate more with our brand partners and that\u2019s been working well. There\u2019s more opportunity there, but they\u2019re overall very engaged, and I think, generally pleased with the success that we\u2019ve had in improving the efficiencies and in-store presentation.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Best regards.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Goldsmith","Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I wanted to speak on the performance of prestige cosmetics. Was it the same brands within prestige outside of the boutiques that were soft in 1Q that were soft again in the second quarter? And did they decelerate during the period? And then on the newness, is that coming from brands that have been growing slower and having them rebound a bit or is that coming from other brands? Thank you.","David Kimbell","I\u2019d say, generally speaking, I am not going to get real specific on any individual brand, but generally speaking some of the brands that were not performing to our expectations in Q1 carried through Q2 with some exceptions, but overall there\u2019s a few brands that have hit a bit of low. The ones that I called out earlier, IT, Tarte, Too Faced benefit our brands that have either been performing well all year or we\u2019re excited about and seeing promising results on key innovation.","So, those brands, we\u2019re working closely with them to make sure that they\u2019re getting back on track. And as I said for many of them, we\u2019re seeing some positive signals. And then, the other brands that we\u2019re bringing in are complementing our overall assortment. Our guests are responding well to them. So, collectively, both existing brands and new brands we think will get that key part of prestige cosmetics part of the business back to where we\u2019d like it to be.","Michael Goldsmith","Okay. And then you spoke about the growth in e-commerce and that\u2019s come from brands available only online or in limited distribution in-stores. So, what\u2019s the online sales mix between these products and those that are in the stores, and then how do you expect it to evolve over time?","David Kimbell","Well, I mean I think it really varies. Obviously, there\u2019s a group of brands that we\u2019ve mentioned that are online only, that we haven\u2019t brought into stores yet. We use that often as a testing ground. I\u2019ll give you one example, Dose of Colors that started online, so obviously a 100% online and now we\u2019re rolling that into hundreds of our stores, and have seen nice success with that. Brand like MAC, which we launched last year because of the pace of the rollout into stores started out heavier as a percentage online, but as more stores have grown, of course, that has gone to a different balance. So, it varies across the board and there isn\u2019t one kind of specific model it really depends on the brand, and its history and how we\u2019re rolling it out across our channels.","Michael Goldsmith","Thanks again, and good luck in the back half.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mary Dillon for closing remarks.","Mary Dillon","Great. I\u2019d like to wrap up by thanking all of the Ulta Beauty associates. They delivered another solid quarter and executed a number of complex projects to enhance the guest experience and set us up for a strong second half of the year. So, I look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laurel Lefebvre, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Laurel Lefebvre","Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Ulta Beauty's Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us today are Janet Taake, Senior Vice President of Merchandising; and Jeff Severts, Senior Vice President of Marketing.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's Safe Harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC.","We may make references during this call to the metric free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash provided by operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mary.","Mary N. Dillon","Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm delighted to be hosting my first earnings conference call as the CEO of Ulta Beauty. The team delivered an excellent second quarter with strong sales and margin performance.","Our second quarter performance highlights many of the reasons I decided to join Ulta. We operate in an industry that's growing and important to our guests. Ulta has a differentiated format that resonates with customers. We have a solid long-term growth strategy and a strong team that's executing that strategy very well.","Leading that team for much of the second quarter was our interim CEO, Dennis Eck, and I would like to thank Dennis for his leadership and dedication to the success of Ulta Beauty over the past few months, and the other board members for their support as well.","Now to recap the Q2 headlines. We grew the top line 24.8%. Comparable store sales increased 8.4%, including the impact of our e-commerce business, which continued its rapid growth with a 72% top line increase. Operating income increased 26.8% and operating margin improved 20 basis points to 12.1%. Earnings per share increased 29.6% to $0.70 per share. The team will provide more details on the results and the drivers for the quarter.","Before that, I'd like to make a couple of comments on my perspective on the business after my first 2 months on the job. Ulta has enjoyed tremendous success for the past several years, executing a well-defined strategy. And that includes accelerating store growth, introducing new products, services and brands, enhancing our loyalty program, broadening our marketing reach and increasing our digital focus, including ulta.com.","I don't plan to make any radical changes to this strategy, but rather I plan to expand and build upon this solid foundation. In my first couple of months, I've been in our stores getting to know the business and our people. I'm incredibly excited about our potential. The beauty category is expected to continue to grow 3% to 4% over the long term, and I believe Ulta can continue to capture market share.","I expect that share gains will come through new store growth, healthy same-store sales growth, driven by new customer acquisition and more frequent visits of existing customers who are attracted by newness in our offering and the strength of our marketing and loyalty programs.","We'll continue our focus in introducing new products and services that drive traffic on continuously improving our loyalty program with increased simplicity and benefits for the customer; on delivering value to the customer through our gift-with-purchase programs, discounts and special offers; and improving our CRM program to better target and refine our offerings.","In addition, I see great opportunity to test and activate new strategies to further drive growth and profitability. These include: driving greater awareness of Ulta as a brand and a retail concept in creating a stronger emotional connection to our brand; deepening our insights about our current and prospective guests, continuing to identify opportunities to best meet her beauty needs; further driving digital discovery and e-commerce; continuing to provide great value while reducing reliance on price promotion and, finally, exploring new ways to continue to create excitement for our guests.","Now with that as a backdrop, I'd like to share with you my key priorities for my first 100 days at Ulta Beauty. First and foremost, I plan to work with the team to deliver the 2013 financial performance that we've planned. Another top priority is supporting our store growth plans. At the same time, I'll be focused on addressing business needs in the area of supply chain and our digital omni-channel approach.","I'll also be assessing the organization's talent, capabilities and culture needs as we continue to aggressively grow the business. I'll also spend time getting to know key vendor partners, and of course, analysts and investors.","I'm highly energized about the opportunity ahead of us and about how much runway the Ulta brand has. So now I'd like to ask our SVP of Merchandising, Janet Taake; and our SVP of Marketing, Jeff Severts, to talk about the progress that they and their teams have made with the key elements of our growth strategy. And then our CFO, Scott Settersten, will wrap up with an update on our real estate strategy and a detailed review of the numbers.","So let's start with Janet to update you on brands, products and services.","Janet Taake","Thanks, Mary. The merchandising team has a lure of steady stream of compelling new products and brands for our guests in the first half of the year and are even more excited about the newness we're launching in the back half. Ulta gained share in all categories during the quarter. Our strength on the top line was again driven by prestige cosmetics and skincare.","To recap the highlights of the second quarter, we launched Sarah McNamara skincare, Ulta men's skincare and Mally Beauty cosmetics developed by a celebrity makeup artist, Mally Roncal. Many of our premium brands launched new products, including Stay Flawless 15-hour Primer from Benefit, Limited Edition spring colors from Clarisonic, Diamond Oil from Redken and Moxie Lipstick from bareMinerals.","Benefit has quite a few new product launches this year and we're also making good progress on the services front. We have about 360 Benefit Brow Bars in Ulta stores as of the end of Q2 and plan to have more than 400 by year end, making Ulta the largest Benefit Brow provider in America. We continue to roll out brow tinting in the Benefit Brow Bars and expect to have 100 stores offering this additional service by the end of 2013.","To update you on Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me, we ended the second quarter with 90 Clinique boutiques and expect to have 100 boutiques by year end. We added another 5 Lanc\u00f4me boutiques during the quarter, with 20 more planned for this fall, for a total of 105 Lanc\u00f4me boutiques by year end. Both Ulta and our prestige brand partners are very pleased with the results of these boutiques, and our guests are delighted to find these brands in our store.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we have a tremendous amount of newness in the assortments. A few highlights of the new products we're excited about are Urban Decay's ultra long-wear pencils and lipsticks, Smashbox Liquid Halo Foundation, Tarte's Amazonian Clay Foundation, The New Black Innovations in Color Nail Kits and the Infiniti Pro Curl Secret from Conair.","We continue to work with our vendor partners to offer our guests items sold exclusively at Ulta, including Stila's Dancing with the Stars collection, Butter London's color cosmetic collection and Living Proof's Perfect Hair Day 5-in-1 Styling Treatment.","We are launching several new brands this quarter that have a strong following and unique brand personalities, including IT Cosmetics, Jamie Kern Lima's award-winning line of color cosmetics infused with anti-aging technology and Meaningful Beauty's skincare system, Cindy Crawford's brand developed in partnership with Dr. Sebagh, a renowned anti-aging expert.","On the [indiscernible] side, we just introduced Jane Cosmetics, a brand that was very popular and trendy in the 90s, and was recently completely revamped and relaunched. Jane Cosmetics products are available online and in 500 Ulta stores today, with further expansion planned for October.","We continue to enhance our merchandise assortment on ulta.com, including launching new brands and products a couple of weeks in advance of their in-store launch. Grooming has seen a strong trend online with products like Tria, a laser hair removal device, and other personal care appliances becoming strong sellers on ulta.com.","Turning to salon, our services business continued to see strong momentum in Q2, driven by a good balance of higher customer traffic and higher tickets. Our efforts to improve retention of stylists and grow our team of more experienced stylists are translating into higher sales in the salon business.","Coming up in the third quarter, we are launching a new collection of trend right hair color looks for fall and have rolled out chain-wide training in new color techniques. We are also beginning to use our CRM platform for targeted offers to increase salon trial among our rewards customers. We expect our salon business to continue to deliver growth as we improve execution and retention and test and roll out new service offerings like lash extensions.","In summary, we're building momentum by adding new products, brands and services to our overall offering to continue to fuel strong growth and market share gains and enhance our positioning as a beauty destination. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff Severts, SVP of Marketing.","Jeffrey Severts","Thank you, Janet. I'm going to start by highlighting our key promotional activities during the second quarter. I will then update you on our loyalty program and CRM platform, and then finally wrap up with an update of our e-commerce business.","The largest marketing promotion of the second quarter was our signature Love Your Hair event. This year, we expanded it to a 3-week duration and executed a fully integrated marketing campaign, with a strong focus on digital tactics. The campaign generated millions of impressions and thousands of sweepstakes entries while driving traffic to the stores.","At the end of the quarter, in late July, we launched our first digital brand-building campaign called Beauty LOLs. As we've discussed in prior calls, we have a big opportunity to grow Ulta through increased brand awareness. With Beauty LOLs, we are using digital and social media tactics to invite women across America to submit their own stories about the humorous beauty mishaps they've experienced. To date, we've received thousands of submissions in the form of stories, pictures and videos, and we directly or indirectly reached a significant number of potential new customers.","While we're working to bring new customers into the top of our marketing funnel with campaigns like Beauty LOLs, we continue to drive today's performance with our bottom-of-the-funnel initiatives. Our loyalty program member count has now passed 12 million, an increase of about 19% year-over-year. Member sales continue to grow as a percentage of the total, and our retention rate continues to improve.","Consistent with last quarter's announcement, we expect to convert the remaining 50% of the country still on our legacy certificate program to ULTAmate Rewards, our newer points-based program in Q1 of 2014. This conversion will allow us to more effectively communicate the benefits of being a loyalty program member at Ulta. We will also be able to better leverage our CRM platform, because we will now have a universal currency for driving customer behavior.","With our CRM platform and our more robust customer analytics team, we have significantly improved our abilities to segment our customer file. As a result, our communications now feature content that is much more relevant to the target audience.","We have been moving promotional emails from one-size-fits-all to a modular, more personalized approach, helping us drive increased sales and margin. We executed 27 CRM campaigns during the second quarter and continue to experiment with different promotional offers. Overall, sales driven by email are up dramatically, while the total number of emails we're sending is down.","Now turning to e-commerce, top line growth in Q2 was 72% with nice improvement in the margin rate. Growth was once again driven by prestige cosmetics and skincare categories. We have brought new brands into our online assortment like Perricone and Mally, and we have enjoyed continued success with our limited-time-offers we've trademarked as Beauty Breaks!.","Our website redesign project is on track for delivery in Q3, and we'll carefully convert customers to the new site with a phased approach to implementation. We recently began fulfilling e-commerce orders from a second distribution center and are currently staffing up to scale that capability in time for the holiday season.","Looking forward, I would note that this quarter, we are starting to anniversary the work we did to stabilize the site last year. So we expect our top line growth to moderate somewhat as we stop lapping some easier comparisons. We also expect some conversion disruption as customers adapt to the new website. These 2 effects will make it challenging to match the e-commerce growth rate we experienced in the first 2 quarters.","We are making strong progress against all our marketing priorities. We are broadening our reach through digital tactics, we are strengthening our loyalty efforts by converting to 1 program, and we are improving our CRM capabilities through experimentation and analytics. In e-commerce, we are driving today's business while building capabilities to support a high-growth future. With that, I'll now hand it over to Scott.","Scott M. Settersten","Thanks, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll recap our real estate program and review our financials. Our growth and development team continues to execute the plan very well, identifying high-quality sites and opening new stores on time and on budget.","In Q2, we opened 33 new stores, ending the quarter with 609 stores in 46 states, representing 25% square footage growth. New store productivity remains strong, driven by the quality of our new locations, increasing brand awareness, a more compelling assortment of products and services and great execution of our grand openings and marketing programs, to get our stores off to a strong start.","For the back half of the year, we're on track to execute the balance of our 125-store plan. We expect to open 53 stores in Q3 and 13 stores in the fourth quarter this year. We're also on track to complete the 7 remodels in our plan and expect to end the year with just 38 stores in older formats.","Looking ahead to next year, we have already approved 90 sites for our 2014 program. While we have not yet settled on a firm number of openings for next year, we expect to have more remodels in our plan than we did this year when much of our focus was on new stores.","This year's 125-store program is at the upper end of the range of what we feel that we can comfortably execute from a store staffing and operational execution perspective. And as a result, on a base of 675 stores by year end, we'd expect the absolute square footage growth next year to be more aligned with our long-term guidance of 15% to 20%.","Now turning to a detailed discussion of our financials. Second quarter sales were $601 million, an increase of 24.8% compared to sales of $481.7 million achieved in Q2 of 2012. Our 8.4% comp was stronger than expected and reflects 130 basis points of benefit from our e-commerce business, as well as a benefit from our salon business, which comped better than the product side of the house again this quarter.","The retail comp of 7.1% compares to 9.3% in Q2 of 2012. Last year's retail and e-commerce combined comp was 9.7%. Our comp was primarily driven by an increase in average ticket. The composition of our same-store sales increase was roughly 80% ticket and 20% transactions during the quarter.","A higher average ticket reflects less discounting as we successfully implemented strategies to be more targeted with our promotions. It also demonstrates strong growth in our salon and e-commerce businesses where the average ticket is higher, as well as the continued mix shift in our stores and online to our higher-ticket items, such as prestige cosmetics and skincare products, which continued drive the fastest growth in our assortment.","Gross profit margin increased 50 basis points to 35.3% from 34.8% in Q2 of last year. Gross profit leverage came in better than we expected due to higher-than-expected sales growth, which helped us achieve stronger fixed cost leverage than planned. Gross profit improvement was evenly split between merchandise margin due to mix and discipline promotions and rent and occupancy leverage on higher sales despite the large proportion of young stores in the portfolio.","SG&A expense as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points to 22.4% compared to 22% in the second quarter of last year, driven by the expansion of prestige brand boutiques and investments in store labor to support the growth in our prestige categories.","Deleverage was less than we expected due to higher-than-expected sales and the timing of some of the investments planned for this year, with some shifting out of Q2 and into Q3.","Preopening expense for the quarter was $4.8 million compared to $4.1 million in Q2 of 2012 due to adding 33 new stores compared to adding 22 new stores last year. Operating margin rate increased 20 basis points to 12.1% compared to 11.9% a year ago, with operating income up 26.8% to $72.9 million.","The tax rate was 38.4% compared to 39% in Q2 of 2012. The decrease is primarily due to changes in our state tax liabilities. Net income per diluted share rose 29.6% to $0.70 compared to $0.54 last year.","Turning now to the balance sheet, starting with inventory. Inventories at the end of the second quarter were $461.2 million compared to $316.7 million at the end of Q2 of 2012. Total inventories increased 45.6%, and average inventory per store increased 16.9% compared to the prior year. Growth in total inventory was driven primarily by the addition of 120 net new stores opened in the past year.","Inventory per door increases versus last year are being driven in part by the addition of roughly 150 prestige brand boutiques since the end of 2Q last year. Each boutique represents an incremental inventory investment of approximately $75,000. It also includes the $20 million permanent investment in basic, high-turning inventory items we made in the fourth quarter of 2012 to improve store and stock levels, as well as the continued introduction of new brands as we enhance our product offering across the store, and to a lesser extent but still impactful, the timing of receipts to support over 50 new store openings, as well as bringing additional e-commerce fulfillment capacity online in our Northeast D.C. in Q3.","While difficult to measure, we believe that these inventory investments are translating into a better guest experience and contributing to our strong sales growth. Our inventory is healthy with very low obsolescence risk. As we mentioned in our last call in June, we expect that inventory per door growth will be in line with comp growth by the end of the year.","Capital expenditures were $56 million for the quarter, driven by our new store program, the addition of prestige boutiques and systems and supply chain investments. Depreciation and amortization were $26 million for the quarter.","Now turning to our outlook for the rest of the year. We are maintaining our previous earnings guidance for 2013. We expect to deliver comparable store sales growth in a range of 5% to 7% for the year, including e-commerce. We expect to grow square footage approximately 22% and we expect to achieve earnings per share growth at the low end of our long-term range of 25% to 30% growth, adjusted for the 53rd week in 2012. We expect to spend about $225 million in CapEx, including approximately $125 million for new stores and $100 million for merchandise fixtures, remodels and other systems and e-commerce capital needs. Depreciation and amortization are expected to be approximately $105 million. We expect to generate strong free cash flow for the year and we'll continue to evaluate with our board the best use of any excess cash.","Turning now to third quarter guidance. We expect to achieve sales in the range of $613 million to $623 million versus $505.6 million in Q3 of 2012. We expect comparable store sales to increase in the range of 5% to 7%, including the benefit from e-commerce sales. We plan to open 53 new stores versus 49 last year. We expect to achieve earnings per share in the range of $0.71 to $0.74 versus $0.59 in Q3 of 2012.","Gross profit margin is expected to increase 100 basis points at the midpoint of the range. We expect healthy product margin expansion and modest supply chain leverage, offset by some deleverage of fixed store cost, driven by our accelerated store growth.","SG&A rate is expected to increase 95 basis points versus last year's 23.3% rate, driven by investments in store labor to improve the guest experience, in supply chain as we develop our blueprint for the future and in e-commerce as we accelerate growth in that business and prepare to deliver a better guest experience.","Some of the upside we saw in Q2 was due to timing of investment spend shifting from Q2 into Q3. Operating margin is expected to increase approximately 10 basis points at the midpoint of the range to 12.2%. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 38.2%, and we anticipate a fully diluted share count of approximately 64.5 million shares.","This outlook represents robust sales and earnings growth while balancing the need to make prudent investments to ensure the long-term health and sustainability of our business. With that, operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First of all, Mary, welcome to the company and it's -- looking forward to meeting you. You talked -- I was going to ask you about what you found in your first few months, but you did a really good job of walking us through that. But one of the comments you talked about opportunities in supply chain and omni-channel. Could you go into a bit more detail about what the opportunities are or what you see as kind of the weaknesses now and what are you going to them [ph]?","Mary N. Dillon","Sure, absolutely. I'll start with omni-channel and then, Scott, maybe you can jump in on supply chain. We'll do that second. I would just say, obviously, omni-channel is something that's important to everybody in retail right now and for -- I think the way would look at it, it's about being where the guest wants to learn, wants to explore and of course, where they want to shop. It's about making it easy for the customer, as well as really being in the conversation. In social media, they're discovering brands. So I know the omni-channel through many different lenses. And I would say that, for us, we will always have what I would say is our very unique asset, which is our store base, which has the combination of product and service, and it's a great part of our model. But also being everywhere else our guest wants to shop is important as well. I'd say the investments that we're making this year, and Jeff talked about some of these in his section, are a great step forward as it relates to e-commerce. So being easier to shop in terms of web, tablet and mobile. We're pleased with what that is going to do for our business and our guest experience as well. We also have several other projects in flight from a systems perspective to help to continue to enhance the guest experience. So whether it's selling capabilities in-store, it were [ph] discovery, as well as associate selling tools. So all of those are either in process or I think we've made good progress on already. And lastly, I would just add that certainly as we think about our longer-term supply chain solution, we're thinking through the evolving guest expectations and how we economically meet those.","Scott M. Settersten","And I'll pick up on the supply chain. Again, we're in the midst really of a significant project of designing what the future state supply chain looks like for Ulta. I think our honest assessment is we're probably a little bit behind as far as supply chain processes and best-in-class things are concerned. We've slowed down the project here just a little bit in recent months and that's what you'll see some of the flip in expense going from Q2 to Q3, that's really one of the primary drivers. As you know, Gary, these are big decisions with far-ranging financial and operational impacts on a business over a long period of time. And so we're carefully looking at what we can do to expand current capacity and also taking into consideration what we think guest expectations are going to be in the future. So we're still a little away from the finish line, but as we -- those particulars are finalized, we'll be sharing more details with you.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's great. Just one follow-up and I'll get off. But you have Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me in less than 100 stores, I would say 90, approximately of the 609 that you have. Is there a material difference in the results you get from those stores versus the other ones, driven by having these 2 brands in there?","Scott M. Settersten","We'll have -- actually by the end of this year, there'll be roughly 200 between both brands, so roughly 100 of each. And we do see that those brands, there's a halo effect on each of the stores that we place those brands in service and it drives customer traffic to the stores. We've seen that demonstrated.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Could you quantify that or you won't?","Scott M. Settersten","No, we won't be able to break that out for you, Gary.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So I guess I'll focus on the top line right now. There's clearly a lot of volatility in the retail space today month-to-month. Is there any way you guys could provide any color of the cadence of how the quarter played out maybe what you've been seeing quarter-to-date from your customers? And then if there's any changes that you're seeing between traffic and ticket?","Scott M. Settersten","You know, Ike, we see the same stories in the financial press and in the general press at large, the same kind of things that you guys see on a day-to-day basis. It seems like there's a divergence in customer reaction and shopping behaviors, and it depends what kind of retail category you're in. We're not going to be able to comment really about what the cadence was within a quarter or what the current kind of business environment is for us. But the guidance that we provided includes our best observations of what current business trends are and all the macroeconomic kind of impacts that we look at as we get ready to discuss that with our board and come up with our final guidance for the quarter.","Mary N. Dillon","And Scott, let me just add one piece, which is one of the things that I think is great about our business model, is that we have a pretty diverse customer base. And I think through our merchant marketing and CRM strategies the ability to walk across those different customer bases. So we have some folks that are more value-oriented, some people who are about discovering newness and less concerned about value. So I think that sets us up well, really, in any economic environment.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Then Scott, just a quick follow-up on inventory. I think you did a helpful job explaining away some of the growth that you have at the end of the quarter. Can you maybe help us think about how inventories plan to end the year? And then just kind of how you plan -- how you see the business kind of normalizing as we get into next year from a growth rate or inventory per square foot basis?","Scott M. Settersten","What I tried to do in the prepared remarks is just try to remind everybody of the significant changes in the business over the course of the last year. So we've added a lot of prestige boutiques, which are -- represent significant inventory investments. The new brands that Janet and her team have been able to bring aboard here again are skewing more towards the prestige side of the store. They are higher-priced points kind of items, they're in high demand. So we're making investments to try to stay ahead of the demand curve and try to service our customers as best we can. We would see that continuing in the future. That's part of our strategy. By year end, we would expect again year-over-year comparisons that the comp -- that the inventory growth will be in line with the comp growth for the full year. And we would expect that to be the trend as we look out to the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair & Company.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just wanted to follow up a little bit on traffic. If I heard correctly, I think you said within the product business, that 7.1 comp was about 80% average ticket. Was that correct?","Scott M. Settersten","That's correct.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So if the traffic was in that, let's say, 1% to 2% range, I guess can you discuss a little bit what some of the factors maybe that caused that to ebb and flow a little bit. I think in the first quarter, as I recall, it was more of an even split between the 2. That's my first question.","Scott M. Settersten","Yes. We've seen the composition of the comp transition over the last 3 or 4 quarters from being one that was basically driven by transaction growth to now more recently being more of an average ticket growth kind of situation. Part of that, we would attribute to kind of the macro environment. So you've seen other retailers talk about traffic being down in centers across the U.S. I mean, you've seen that reflected in a lot of the comp numbers that have been announced during the last 4, 6 weeks. We see that in our business, we're not immune to that. I mean, we're in the centers, right up next door to all those other high-quality, big-box retailers. So we have seen nonmember traffic down year-over-year. The good news for Ulta is we've got a great loyalty program. We've seen that be very effectively implemented. We see our loyalty program members actually shopping more often with us. And we -- to top that off, we've got nonmembers and members actually buying higher-ticket items and driving their basket higher. So that's really worked in our benefit here in Q2.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like you would attribute most, if not all of it, to sort of just the overall backdrop as opposed to kind of changes within your specific business?","Scott M. Settersten","That's correct.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then as it relates to, I think just following up on Gary's question on brand penetration, is there -- can you talk about kind of what you're thinking, at this point obviously, not putting hard numbers on it, but do you foresee a situation where the 2 kind of -- Lanc\u00f4me and Clinique could be in a significantly larger percentage of the store base over time? Is there a subset of the stores where it wouldn't make sense for any number of reasons? I'd just be interested in your thoughts on that.","Janet Taake","This is Janet, and thanks for the question. We are just opening up more boutiques this year. So with the 100 in Clinique and 105 in Lanc\u00f4me. We're very pleased with the partnership we have with the brands, and we're hopeful that we'll add more boutiques in the future. But at this point, I don't have a definitive answer for that.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess if I could sneak in one last one as it relates to store growth. And obviously, I think last quarter, you had said you've had about 50 in place and now, 90 for next year. Is that -- is my memory correct on that?","Scott M. Settersten","Yes, that's rough -- that's correct, Dan. You're on target there. We...","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. Do you think from the standpoint of your longer term, your most recent longer-term target of 1,200 stores, how are you thinking about that itself and your thoughts also on the smaller format opportunity?","Scott M. Settersten","Well, the 1,200 stores, I think as we've discussed consistently in the past, is a realistic target that we're all here focused on. So that's 1,200 of the 10,000 square foot boxes that we do so well today. I think we've also talked a bit about the 125-store number kind in absolute terms, that's kind of a mix of new stores and remodels. It's kind of at the upper end of the range where we feel like we can execute that at a very high level. So again, as you look out to next year and beyond, that's kind of the absolute number that would fit into your model as you're looking at percentage growth kind of estimates. The small store opportunity is one that the team here is focused on internally. Again, we've got a couple of small stores sprinkled throughout the chain right now. But the team is focused on really delivering the Ulta experience in a smaller store format, whether that be in an urban kind of setting or more of small town rural kind of setting. So that's something that we're focused on currently and we'll probably have a couple of test stores to roll out next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Mary, I wanted to ask you, what is your impression of Ulta's brand awareness, given the kind of the size of the business and the store chain and your thoughts on potential improvements there? And then secondly, your view about the marketing spend, both kind of the dollars that are being spent, do you think -- is that appropriate and also the content of it, the different areas of spend?","Mary N. Dillon","Sure, okay. Well, thank you, Evren, for your questions. I'd say a couple of things. One is that I think that our current brand awareness is a great opportunity actually for Ulta because it's not very high. In some ways [ph], I mean, if we're doing great, it means that we're in a great industry that's growing, we've got a very successful business model that's working really well and I think this team has really built, as you can see, a very successful business, and we're focused on the right strategies. That said, I think we do have the potential to really drive even more growth in the future as we think about the fact that there's millions of prospective customers who really haven't discovered Ulta yet. And so we'll figure out carefully over time how to get there. But I think driving more top-of-mind awareness and more customers to Ulta and driving more emotional connection are all opportunities for us. Women, we know, love to discover new beauty products and services and especially in a really helpful setting with great value and certainly, that's very much what we have to offer. So as I look at our current strategies, I'm really pleased to see that we're experimenting and evolving. I don't think anybody would ever swing a pendulum dramatically on a business without some risks. So instead, I think what we're doing is right, which is we're testing and learning. Jeff and his team are -- the CRM improvements are, in terms of our ability to target and segment and vary our offers, are very interesting to me. Our e-commerce business is growing strongly, as you've seen, which is terrific as well. But certainly, we see that there's opportunities to continue to think about how do we shift the mix over time and drive more awareness driving tactics, which drives you to the business. So we'll continue to evolve that.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then secondly, Scott, I wanted to ask you about e-commerce profitability. Where are we today and where can that get to? And if -- what kind of time line, if you could talk about that, relative to maybe the corporate average or the store side?","Scott M. Settersten","Evren, I would say e-commerce, I think it's probably generally common knowledge that e-commerce businesses generally do not contribute at the same rate as an installed bricks-and-mortars base of business, the environment that we operate here at Ulta. So it contributes at a lower rate currently, but it is scaling up quite nicely. And as we continue to scale that businesses up, we expect that to significantly improve over time. So that's part of our long-range plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a couple of questions here, if I may. Jeff, for you, what size and scale do you think Clinique needs to be, if you're not already doing it already in terms of targeting either versions on the print circulars or the targeted e-marketing. I'm just wondering how much of the Clinique success that you guys have had just because of some bolt-on sort of traffic versus how much you guys have actually been alerting area shoppers as to whether or not Clinique is actually in your store. Could you talk a little bit about that and then I have a follow-up.","Jeffrey Severts","Sure, Neely. We actually do both already. So we version the mailers for Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me already for the geographies where there's enough density of stores in those areas or actually, where customers live within a short enough distance of one of the boutiques. And then email, of course, gives us even more options for being very precise in our targeting to her and letting her know what the benefits of those boutiques are for her. So we do both already.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, that's awesome. And then, Mary, a question for you. As you think about the digital strategy for Ulta, I think at one point, we were counting up actually the SKUs online versus what is actually carried in the store and there was -- if memory serves, was a pretty big delta between the 2 there. Is that one of the key gating factors kind of expanding some of this digital strategy, getting the customer-facing side, the website re-platforming done, et cetera, but then also just getting the SKUs kind of available online? Is there something precluding the company from being able to kind of scale up on that?","Mary N. Dillon","Yes, I'll make a comment and then I'll ask somebody else in the team to add to that. I would say that it's both. I mean, first and foremost, I'm really excited about the redesign that we'll be launching and, I mean, it really will improve the overall guest experience and shopability and discoverability on the site. So that's a good starting point. In terms of having more products online, of course, we're always going to look to expand that. So I'll ask you guys to -- Jeff, you want to take [indiscernible] .","Jeffrey Severts","Yes, I won't add much to that. I mean, we have a pretty high penetration of what you can find in the stores already online. They're just a couple of categories where we're not where we'd like to be, and pro hair is probably the biggest. And Janet's team is always working very hard to get us up where we are on the stores online. So we're making great progress there.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Great. And just a follow-up here for Janet then. Janet, it's great to see IT Cosmetics come into the store. I think it's a great brand and completely spot on with your customers. I was just thinking about it, though, is this kind of the first brand you've had maybe in a while or ever where the distribution was initially digital? And is this the first retail introduction? I'm just trying to get a sense of -- sizing up kind of what that opportunity might be for IT Cosmetics for you guys.","Janet Taake","Sure. Neely, it's not the first time, but it's been many, many years. I think I would go back in history on there because it was on DirecTV prior to really launching with us, but it's been a long time. So to have a brand that's direct and then coming in brick-and-mortar, it's been a new experience since I've been here and I can't really speak to -- too much about it because we are just in the midst of launching IT Cosmetics, but we're very thrilled with the partnership, and we have great expectations of what the brand will do, most importantly for our guests and the experience in the store with our guests.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Citigroup.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Regarding the performance of the salons comping better this quarter, what was the rationale there? And is that an opportunity in the back half? Also, related to your merchandise margin guidance in 100 basis points on the gross margin, what's the driver behind your view of better merchandise margins this third quarter?","Janet Taake","On the salon side of the business, it was average ticket, as I mentioned, drove increase. But a lot of it is going back to the retention of the stylist. And with the retention of the stylist increasing, goes back to the loyal guests coming back to that stylist. The heart and soul of the salon is truly the cut and color, which drives the majority of the business. So all of those things have been working and we foresee that the salon will continue to be a solid business.","Scott M. Settersten","Oliver, as far as gross profit improvement in the third quarter being driven in large part by improvements in merchandise margin. It's really kind of a continuation of the discussion we started earlier this year. It's a combination of factors. It's the business continuing to mix up more towards the prestige side of the box, which again is higher price points and less promotion and less discounting going on there. And also on our side, being more disciplined and smarter around the promotional kind of environment. So again, whether it's the CRM tool, we can be more targeted with our promotions to customers or the analytics team that supports all that, which is helping us get smarter on how we do those kinds of things. So that those are really the primary drivers.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And Mary, as you engage in the journey to make the brand potentially more emotional, how should we think about the financial impact there and the timing? And what do you foresee how that will impact the business or the brand portfolio or traffic?","Mary N. Dillon","I like that question, how to quantify emotion. I'm going to figure that one out. I think it's a journey. It's really just about continuing to refine how we think about positioning Ulta and making sure that all of our communications add up and the guest experience adds up to an ideal guest experience. I don't think we have a problem there. I think we have an opportunity to continue to have folks just discover us and hence, have a deeper relationship, rely on us as, really, their beauty expert. So that will play out in many different ways I think, but it won't be something that happens overnight. It's something you have to earn over time. And as I mentioned earlier, I would just say it's the totality of everything we do. We're not going to swing a pendulum and all of a sudden, start doing things really differently in terms of stopping all of our promotions and doing only advertising or something. You really have to work your way to that to really find the balance in the mix. And again, I think the team has done a nice job already of -- with the loyalty program that's really working well, with CRM analytics that are helping us refine this. So I would think about it is as a journey over time that I think just is an opportunity for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with JPMorgan Chase.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess one question for Scott and then one for Mary maybe. So on Scott, on the $0.13 of incremental investments this year, can you maybe talk about some of the pieces that could continue into next year? Or are there potentially new initiatives as you continue to move towards that 1,200 store opportunity? So just curious of the $0.13, maybe what are some things that we should expect? And maybe Mary, if you look ahead to the planning around holiday this year, just curious as you reflect on and you look at the results of holiday last year and you see the current tough traffic environment out there, what gives you the comfort to guide essentially a 5% to 7% comp for the holiday, and if there are any tweaks to the plans that you're making now?","Scott M. Settersten","I guess I'll go first. I'll take the investments. Again, the $0.13 were split roughly evenly between labor investment in the stores to support prestige growth, supply chain, e-commerce investments to drive growth there, and then of course, the new store program. So another one, Brian, on the new store program, I think -- we would think that's going to moderate a little bit again as you look at 2014. So the absolute number of stores is not going to grow beyond the 125. So on a percentage basis, that should help or moderate a little bit as we look forward. E-commerce, I would say again, we're going to continue to make investments there. It probably won't be at the same level, generally speaking, because we wouldn't expect to have a new website redesign next year. So we'll continue to invest in the team there and some of that analytical stuff we have to do. But infrastructure-wise, it shouldn't be as big a bite of the apple next year. Supply chain, I mentioned we slowed that project down just a little bit, so the expense is kind of flowing towards the back half of 2013. We would expect to have a final determination here sometime in the fourth quarter on what the plan is going to be. So that will go -- that will transition from being kind of an expense item to more of a capital item as we transition into 2014. Again, we'll be able to size that up for you a little bit more once we have our final answer there. Store labor, again, we deleveraged that store labor this year significantly, either try to improve the guest experience in the store and to support the prestige side of the business, which continues to grow at a very high rate. With Mary entering the business here and us kind of taking a fresh look at the strategy and how Ulta is going to evolve here over time, I think that one might be a little bit more TBD'd as I look into 2014. Again, I wouldn't expect it to be a significant change from where we are '13 versus '12, but there could be some investments that we look at there. It just depends.","Mary N. Dillon","And then on holiday, I'll just make a couple of comments and I'll ask Janet to add to this. But certainly, we're very focused on our holiday readiness. I feel very confident. I know that across the merchant teams, the store operations teams, marketing, supply chain, that everybody is really focused on making sure that we have strong holiday season. And I have confidence that the team has put together a really good plan. So would you like to add some color to that?","Janet Taake","Sure. And we are very focused on gift-giving categories across all areas of the store. And we feel that we have both value as well as some exclusive items, as well as some of the things that we do traditionally every year that other people may not do to really incent some of the categories for holiday, but we feel very good about our holiday assortment coming in this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I want to focus for a moment on a couple of other angles on the online business. First of all, you spoke about online being a factor in driving traffic. If you could just speak about the composition of the typical online transaction and what about it drives the ticket higher? And then also if you could tell us within online what you've seen essentially in terms of traffic conversion at ticket?","Jeffrey Severts","So Matt, this is Jeff. I may have to have you repeat the second question or catch it from somebody here. I'm not sure I got that. But on the first question of how is that a factor in driving higher ticket, we have, as long as I've been here anyway, seen a higher ticket in the online channel than in the retail channel. So as that becomes a stronger portion of the total mix, it's just carrying the average for the enterprise up. Does that answer your question or did I miss that?","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","No, that's good. And the second one, I guess the question was to the extent that in aggregate, your comp growth shifted from being traffic-driven to ticket-driven, if you think about what -- if you think about the big surge that you've seen in online, is that more a function of online transaction growth or online ticket growth within the online channel?","Jeffrey Severts","I see. So within the online channel, the mix has been heavily traffic versus ticket so that's been predominantly traffic-driven.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And a follow-up, if I could. You spoke about tougher compares in online for the -- as you cycle the second half of last year, when it sounds like you started to make real headway. I believe you only started giving us online contribution with this level of specificity in the first quarter of 2013. So any sense you could give us as to how the momentum of your online business changed or evolved as you moved through 2012?","Scott M. Settersten","I would be able to tell you, Matt, if you looked, I think we provide some of these details in our Q as well, which got filed today. So year-to-date last year, I think it contributed 40 basis points of comp and this year, it's at 130 to 140 basis points of comp. So that's kind of the relative spread year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.","Unknown Analyst","This is Christina [ph] in for Joe. Most of my questions have been answered at this point, but I just wanted to follow up on, it sounds like you're saying that your customers aren't as focused on value as they were maybe in the last few quarters. And I was wondering if you could talk about that a little bit more and if you're continuing to see that in this quarter?","Scott M. Settersten","Yes, we talked a little bit about in the first quarter call. We started seeing this trend continue as we exited the holiday period and kind of got through some of the rough seas we saw early in the first quarter, that we saw this divergence in our customer profile, much like the rest of America has seen it. There's a certain portion of our customers, our core customers, that are pursuing value and that are very focused on whatever coupon or promotional event that we're running at the time. And then there's a good portion of our customers that the sense is that price is really no object. They're pursuing whatever the hottest new gadget is or the hope in the bottle or hope in the technology or whatever it might be. So the good news for us is we serve a wide continuum of customers and a lot of different products available in our stores. So that plays to our strength.","Unknown Analyst","Great. And then just one last one about gross margin, what your expectations are for the full year?","Scott M. Settersten","We would expect -- I think when we talked about quarter-to-quarter, we would expect to see the continuation of improvement in our merchandise margin as we get deeper into the year. That will be the major driver in third quarter. Again, if you look at it historically, that moderates somewhat as you get into the fourth quarter because of the promotional environment and the competitive environment in the fourth quarter. So that would be the driver for the rest of the year by and large.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Wu with Telsey Advisory Group.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","First, you mentioned that the major comp driver was the higher ticket, and I was wondering, how much of the ticket increase was driven by less promotions on the mass products versus the mix shift toward prestige? And do you expect ticket to remain the main driver of the comp through the back half of the year?","Scott M. Settersten","Well, that's what we're seeing as the most recent kind of reality in the marketplace in our stores. So we would expect the trend to continue absent any other significant change in the macro environment. The ticket, when we talk about the ticket, most of it was average selling price. That was the majority of the ticket increase. So units were up slightly. So again, it's subject to assessment and analysis on our side. But we tend to think that our customers are making choices too, just like people are choosing autos and homes and home improvement versus other discretionary kinds of things. When they get into our stores, they're choosing a higher price point prestige kind of product and offsetting that with not buying another category. So that's what we're seeing as kind of the current business trend right now. We really don't foresee any significant changes there in the near term.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great. And you mentioned already approving the 90 sites for next year, and I was wondering, how much of it will be in new markets versus backfilling existing ones?","Scott M. Settersten","Well, we always take a very balanced view towards our real estate strategy, so that's been our profile since day one here at Ulta, and so that we would expect that to continue. So it's always a balanced approach with single-store markets, major metro areas and backfilling markets as we look at our real estate. And we're always cognizant of the sales transfer or cannibalization impact on those stores and making sure that we're making really good decisions.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great. And as you expand into some of the smaller markets, are you looking into opening smaller-format stores, so below sort of your average 10,000 square foot store sized in order to maximize your productivity? And as you continue to do that, do you think it could potentially change sort of the new store economics?","Scott M. Settersten","As far as the economic model is concerned, that's a little far out right now. I guess we're not -- the thought process isn't that far down the path on that one. That would be something, again when you're talking smaller footprint, we're looking at different potential sizes so 5,000 square feet up to 7,500 square feet. And just trying to think about what worked best inside each one of those footprints. And of course, that would be different if we're doing that in an urban setting versus some kind of rural setting. So we do believe that small store is a good side opportunity for us in the long term, and it's something that we hope to see again in some limited test cases in 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jill Nelson with Johnson Rice.","Jill R. Caruthers - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Touching on the strength of the salons, you mentioned a trial you're going to run with customers to get them to the salon. I was wondering, is the bulk of your salon customers under the loyalty program now? I'd assume they're pretty loyal and good customer for you to have?","Scott M. Settersten","Yes, our salon customers, service customers, are our best customers. They visit our stores more often than an average loyalty person does. So we recognize the value in those folks, and we're looking strategies and tactics to try to drive more engagement and try to get more people to try the salon at Ulta. So I think Janet mentioned that we're going to have a CRM initiative to try to touch our loyalty members and try to get them engaged and get them to experience the salon. And we figure, once we get them to try that, there's a good chance that they're going to continue with us. And that's a great add for us as far as value is concerned in the long term.","Jill R. Caruthers - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then have you ever quantified of your total sales the percentage that is tied to your loyalty program?","Scott M. Settersten","No. We've consistently said it's greater than 50% of our sales. And I think that's all we're going to share at this time. I just -- we're all kind of laughing and smiling here. It's something that we think in the future that we might want to provide a little bit more granularity and color on. So maybe stay tuned in 2014 for that.","Jill R. Caruthers - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","All right. And then just one last question. Given you've talked about some shifting of the expenses, is there any way you can quantify of the $0.13 of investments you're making this year, how many -- how much of that $0.13 has already occurred in the first half, just asking, given you mentioned a shift from second to third quarter, some investments.","Scott M. Settersten","Yes, Jill. Sorry, I don't really have that kind of detail handy with me. Generally speaking, the e-commerce stuff will be, by and large, behind us by the time we get to the end of September. Supply chain has kind of pushed back into the second half of the year. We thought that would be more evenly balanced quarter-to-quarter. The store labor, as well we did some experimentation with that and testing early in the year, and now that's really picking up steam in the back half of the year. So it's a little tough to give you any more quantitative answer than that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the store growth. Can you just talk about what learnings you've had as you've ramped to that 125 pace? And then moving forward as that pace slows, would you expect to see more operating leverage, given the system from a training perspective, is going to be less stressed?","Scott M. Settersten","We consider the real estate program and what we do with processes around new store to really be a core strength of Ulta. I mean, the teams that we have, the experience that we have doing this and the way we've been able to accelerate that store growth plan over the last couple of years has really been outstanding. And the new stores again, congratulations to the team. The sites we've identified, those stores are producing excellent results, right on target with where we want to be and that's great for Ulta. As far as the future is concerned, we would expect again the 125 to kind of be the absolute top end so percentage-wise, yes, that's going to help on the leverage when you consider fixed store costs and what that -- impact that has on the P&L. So we would expect to see some benefit there next year.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then maybe to push for one more on the loyalty program. As the new loyalty program has built momentum, any metrics you can share with us just on the customer behavior on the coupons versus the new point system, timing of purchases, frequency, basket size? Any metrics you have kind of comparing the new program with the old?","Jeffrey Severts","Mark, this is Jeff. We generally are pretty tight-lipped on details about the loyalty program. We view it as central to what we do and proprietary in many ways, so we probably can't reveal what you'd hope to hear today.","Scott M. Settersten","We would say, though, that it's clear that those customers are more engaged than the folks that are in the certificate program, that they prefer that over the alternative and that we see those folks more often, they're more engaged with the program and it's going to be a big win for all of us when we move everyone onto that program next year.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mary Dillon for closing comments.","Mary N. Dillon","Great. Thank you. Just to wrap up, I'd like to first thank our 19,000 Ulta Beauty associates, whose hard work delivered excellent results this quarter. In my short time as CEO, I've seen that our associates truly love what they do and they're currently passionate about Ulta and our guests. I've really developed great confidence in the team's ability to deliver another strong year of growth in sales and earnings, while making wise investments to set up the business for long-term performance.

Good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report a strong start to the year, with better than expected sales and earnings growth in the first quarter. The team\u2019s accomplishments included driving continued momentum in our online business, successfully rolling out new brands, completing the smooth conversation of our loyalty program onto one platform and closely managing inventory.","In addition, transactions and comp retail stores turn positive, reversing a slight decline in the second half of 2013. We are also making excellent progress with our strategic planning work and we are on track to deliver long-term vision in five-year financial target, which we planned to announce on our second quarter earnings call in September and follow-up with an Analyst Day in October.","As I said last quarter, the strategy work is designed to refresh our vision and chart a course for an evolution of our business model and to create a playbook for sustainable profitable growth.","To recap the numbers for the first quarter, we grew sales 22.5% and delivered an 8.7% total company comp on top of the 6.7% comp in the first quarter of 2013, both including the impact of online sales growth. Our e-commerce business performed very well, driving 72.3% comparable sales growth.","Similar to the past several quarters, prestige cosmetics and skincare was a strongest category. We were pleased to see transactions turn positive at retail, with the healthier balance between transactions and average ticket driving the strong comp in the quarter. Earnings per share were up 18.5% to $0.77 versus $0.65 last year, driven primarily by better than expected sales and some planned expected shift later in the year.","Scott will cover the detail financial result for the first quarter and our guidance for the second quarter and fiscal 2014 in a momentum. But before that I would like to provide an update on our five growth strategies, new store growth, new product, services and brand, our loyalty program, marketing and ulta.com.","Starting with real estate, we opened 21 stores during the quarter, ending the first quarter with 696 stores. We are on track to deliver our planned 100-store program this year for an increase in square footage of approximately 15%.","New stores continued to open up strong and the class of 2014 stores is exceeding it sales budget. Thus remains stable and we continue to sell our real estate pipeline with high-quality sites.","For the remainder of the year, we expect to open 20 stores in the second quarter, 50 in the third and nine in the fourth. We also expect to complete 12 remodels this year and are planning to complete a smaller scale remodel of our mass cosmetic planogram in about 60 stores over this summer.","We haven\u2019t seen anything in the market or in our stores performance to change our long-term view on the potential for 1,200 of our full sized 10,000 square foot stores in the U.S. Today, we view the potential for smaller stores largely incremental to the 1,200 store target, but of course, we expect to learn a lot about the potential for smaller buys once we open up two 5,000 square foot test stores later this year in smaller market.","Turning now to merchandizing, our merchant teams delivered a strong first quarter, with a strongest comp gain in prestige color and skincare. IT Cosmetics and Mally launched last year in selective stores are now fully rolled out to the entire chain. Also the only retail chain offering this popular brand and our guest is delighted to find their product in our stores and online.","We also expanded space for Urban Decay in all of our stores, showcasing the naked franchise. Our nearly 500 benefit boutique continued to perform very well with new product launches and the rollout of brow tinting services to additional stores.","Newness is always a significant driver of our comps with contributions from recent brand additions such as Japonesque, Meaningful Beauty and SheaMoisture. The fragrance category was energized by two big launches, Dolce & Gabbana Dolce and Ralph Lauren Midnight Romance.","Now turning to services, our salon team drove solid results in the first quarter, maintaining good topline momentum and contributing to the total company comp. The strong business with strong comp were driven by both increases in average ticket and positive guest count, retention of salon managers and stylist continue to improve, bolstering a strong performance as tenure is highly correlated with sales in the salon business.","We executed several successful promotions focused on hair, color and skin treatment to drive awareness and trials and develop a strong integrated services message for salon services and Benefit Brow services in our direct mail and email communications.","Moving onto an update on our loyalty program and customer relationship platform, we now have 13.4 million active loyalty members who shop with us in the past 12 months and we have completed the conversion of all members to the ULTAmate Rewards program as of the end of February.","We see a great deal of excitement about the program from our newly converted guests regarding the benefit and the flexibility of the program, as well as the new benefit of the loyalty program, offering a free Ck One mascara on guest\u2019s birthday.","So far we have seen strong performance in comp store sales and margin dollar growth from the recently converted regions, driven by both transaction growth and higher average ticket.","Our loyalty program provides a valuable database of customer and purchase information that we can use to deliver increasing personalized offers. Having all of our guests under point-based program enables more efficient use of our CRM platform and will continue to improve the effectiveness of our targeted campaign.","Now turning to marketing, continued partnership between our merchant and marketing teams is enhancing the effectiveness of our communication, including direct mail, website and promotion, which we believe is helping to drive comps.","During the first quarter, we executed successive programs like our signature 21 Days of Beauty featuring beauty steals and in-store events with an increased focus of social media. Our trends of spring report position Ulta as a beauty authority and we enhance our Mother\u2019s Day promotion with the stronger gift with purchase program and several new fragrance launches.","Our marketing collateral continues to evolve as we build a more compelling and emotional connection with our guests. Our marketing team is also making good progress on refining our brand positioning, carrying out a marketing mix analysis, and executing the test and learn initiatives we talked about last March, all with the goal of driving Ulta\u2019s continued profitable growth to new guest acquisition and less reliance and discounts.","Wrapping up our fifth growth strategy, our e-commerce business, ulta.com continued to see strong sales momentum in the first quarter, with topline comp growth of 72.3% contributing nearly 2 points of comp to our same-store sales.","We continue to enhance the online shopping experience to new releases of the platform, the latest improvement include a product Q&A platform called Ask Ulta on the site and the addition of brand stores to highlight collections and rest of assortment, as well as promote services like the Benefit Brow Bars.","We continue to invest in omni-channel capabilities like the newly launched feature called Find in Store which enable guests to check the availability of many popular SKUs in their local stores. We also continue to increase fulfillment capacity to support the rapid growth in our e-commerce business.","This completes the update on our growth strategy, so I will now hand it over to Scott.","Scott Settersten","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. First quarter sales were $713.8 million, compared to $582.7 million last year, an increase of 22.5%. Comparable sales increased 8.7%. The retail comp which includes Salon was 6.8% and e-commerce growth of 72.3% added 190 basis points to the comp.","The transaction and ticket contributions to the total company comp were more balanced, the transactions up 2.5% and ticket up 6.2%. The ticket increase was driven by roughly 20% unit and 80% average selling price. As our business continues to mix up to more prestige category which are generally at higher price points. We were very pleased to see that retail-only comparable transactions increased 120 basis points, almost a 2 point sequential improvement from Q4.","Gross profit dollars increased 20.6% to $246 million. As we expected, gross profit margin declined 50 basis points to 34.5% from 35% in Q1 of last year. While retail product margins were strong, the overall product margin rate was down about 40 basis points, driven by a number of factors, including a higher mix of ulta.com sales, some product mix shifts within prestige and the impact from converting the remaining 50% of the country to the ULTAmate Rewards program, which delivers more gross margin dollars but at a slightly lower rate.","For the full year, we anticipate product margins will be slightly higher than last year based on some of the newness in the category mix we are planning for the rest of the year.","As a reminder, the ulta.com impact to our margin rate is primarily due to sales mix. As most of you know, we do not currently sale the full assortment of our professional hair care products online. So having a lower mix of that higher margin product online, does dilute our e-commerce rate somewhat compared to bricks and mortar.","However, from a margin dollar perspective, we believe that a significant portion of our e-commerce sales are incremental, as we have seen that our guest to engage with us across both channel also spend more in store.","While it is natural to focus on the margin rate as a standalone measure we are focused on the big picture, which is that, we are capturing more beauty dollars overall and that is good news for both Ulta and shareholders.","We are delighted with the tremendous growth and market share gains we are seeing in prestige cosmetics and skincare, while high margin, they are not as high margin at some of the other prestige categories we sell. In the first quarter, those mix shifts had a slight impact on overall margin rate. We expect to see these mix impacts mitigate as we go through the year.","I would also remind you that having all our guests on the ULTAmate Rewards program has a modest impact on gross margin rate. We know our guests are much more engage with this more flexible attractive program, so they use it more. We expect the program to deliver higher sales and gross margin dollars, but the margin rate is a bit lower than our previous certificate-based program.","The remaining 10 basis points of deleverage relates to fixed store costs, which we expect to continue for the full year, as we add 100 new stores this year on top of 125 last year and 100 in 2012.","Taking a long-term view, the modest deleverage we expect to see in 2014 is minor in comparison to the increase market share we are capturing with these stores. In the long-term gross profit and cash flow these investments will generate in the coming years.","We are very happy with new store productivity. Our 2012 and 2013 classes of new stores continued to exceed our internal sales and investment return targets, and store openings in the first quarter of this year exceeded their grand opening sales targets. Our store model has proven to work well in all geographies and we continue to review and approve high-quality sites consistent with our historical practices.","Back to the P&L. SG&A expenses rose 22.1% to $162.4 million, flat as a percentage of sales at 22.8%, due to planned investments in marketing, supply chain, e-commerce and store labor, but better than expected driven by strong expense controls and some planned expenses that were delayed and pushed later in the year.","Pre-opening expense was $2.6 million, compared to $3.2 million in Q1 of 2013, driven by 21 store openings during the quarter, compared to 28 new stores opened during Q1 of 2013.","Operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 11.3% versus 11.6% in Q1 of last year. Net income increased 19.4% to $50 million or $0.77 per diluted share versus $41.8 million or $0.65 per diluted share last year. EPS grew 18.5%.","Turning to the balance sheet, inventories were $531.4 million at the end of the quarter, compared to $442.1 million at the end of Q1 2013, driven by 120 net new stores opened since May last year.","Inventories were down 50 basis points on a per store basis. As our supply chain and store teams have done nice job keeping inventory very clean through our large number of product transactions.","Capital expenditures were $39.1 million for the quarter, driven primarily by our new store opening program, as well as supply chain and IT investments. And depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $30.4 million. We generated about $34.6 million of free cash flow for the quarter and ended the first quarter with $457 million in cash on the balance sheet.","Now we delivered the first quarter above expectations and have a solid start to our second quarter, we believe it is prudent to maintain our view of full year guidance until we get a bit more of the year under our belt. If the environment remains stable we would expect to do better.","We expect to open about 100 new stores this year along with 12 remodels. We anticipate comparable sales to increase in the 4% to 6% range and total sales to increase in mid-teens range for the year.","As a reminder, P&L investments for the year include supply chain expenses to support the planned 2015 opening of a fourth DC, marketing to convert 50% of the countries to the ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program and investments to increase training for both store and salon associates to improve the guest experience, as well as some test and learn initiatives around brand awareness and new guest acquisition, most of which are occurring in the back half of the year.","We expect that earnings per share will grow in the mid-teens percentage range this year, excluding any potential accretion from share repurchases. Our existing authorization has about $113 million remain.","We expect to invest about $265 million in capital in 2014 with approximately $170 earn marked for new stores, remodels and new locations, $28 million for merchandize fixtures, $50 million for IT systems including e-commerce, $45 million for supply chain projects and about $25 million for maintenance CapEx.","Turning more specifically to the second quarter of 2014, we expect sales to increase in the range of $706 million to $717 million versus $601 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 5% to 7%.","Pre-opening expense is expected to come in around $3.4 million, with 20 stores planned to open in the second quarter. We expect to achieve earnings per share in the range of $0.78 to $0.83, compared to $0.70 in Q1 of last year.","Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 38.4% and our fully diluted share count will be approximately 64.8 million, excluding any potential share repurchasing activity.","Before we move on to the Q&A, I\u2019d like to give you an update on our supply chain investments. In April, we signed a lease for our new distribution center near Indianapolis, which we expect to open in mid 2015. This facility will be about double the size of our existing building and we will have all new warehouse management and control systems.","The new facility will also have more sophisticated material handling technology and ultimately a more efficient operating model compared to our current facility. This model will take inventory lead time our of our supply chain by allowing more frequent shipments, which will improve store and stock and inventory turns. It will also create labor efficiencies in the distribution center and allow us to deliver more shelf ready product to our stores.","Having the product delivered more frequently and shelf ready will allow our store associates to get the product on the shelf faster and more efficiently, and improve in stock and product presentation.","The new [EPM] (ph) systems are the first phase of a multi-year network optimization work project, as we continue to evaluate our supply chain capabilities and capacity to support future growth.","We expect this project to generate a good return on investment over the loner term and benefits including speeding up the supply chain, improve labor efficiencies and providing more inventory flexibility to drive improved inventory turns. This is clearly an important investment and we are all highly focused on execution to ensure that it delivers the expected operating and finical benefits.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our conference call host to begin the Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Kayla Berg - Piper Jaffray","Great. Good afternoon. This is Kayla Berg on for Neely Tamminga. Just wondering digging deeper into your e-commerce sales, can you guys tell based on your loyalty data how your customers choosing e-commerce versus a store visit? Said another way, within your loyalty base, how much is she using the site by product versus going into the store? And with that example, what is her purchasing behavior look like online versus in-store again looking at your loyalty customer base, maybe looking average transaction size and dollars or units. And how does that look differently online versus in-store? Thanks.","David Kimbell","Hi, Kayla. Yeah, this is Dave Kimbell. We absolutely see a lot of cross purchase activity within our membership database between the website and our stores. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re prepared to share specific details around some of the specific questions you have. But as our e-commerce capability has grown over the last 18 months and become a bigger part of our business, one of the things that we\u2019re particularly excited about is our ability to reach her where and when she wants to shop with us.","So importantly our members are finding that to be a very convenient way for them to shop. So they are visiting both stores and e-commerce and that\u2019s certainly something that we\u2019re encouraging as we continue to leverage e-commerce as a way to drive customers back into our stores.","Kayla Berg - Piper Jaffray","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Great job on the results. Two things, first of all on the new store productivity, I know historically you\u2019ve talked about 70% during that range. Our calculation for this quarter was around 74 and to get to your guidance for second quarter, I think I needed at least 75. So the question is what are you doing differently there? And is it function of also opening fewer stores that maybe we can share it, they are just the best. And if that\u2019s sustainable, then I had a follow-up?","Mary Dillon","No, Aram, I wouldn\u2019t say there is anything specific that we\u2019re doing any differently to drive new store productivity. I think we\u2019ve just seen a natural maturation of the stores we put in place over the last two years. Notably, we observed that first quarter this year, the stores coming out of the gate, the 21 new stores in the first quarter were just exceptionally strong. So nothing special there we\u2019re doing other than our normal great day-to-day activities to support new store openings.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Okay. Sometimes when you chose fewer stores, you get a better hit rate, I guess, is kind of what I was trying to get at, that\u2019s now what you\u2019re seeing just yet you\u2019re saying?","Mary Dillon","No, we\u2019re not seeing that.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","And then my second question is in the 10-Q, it says our long-term strategy is to drive operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our ability to expand merchandise margin and leverage our fixed cost with comparable store sales increases and operating efficiencies offset by incremental investments in people et cetera. Wondering if that would offset is kind of to be read fully offset or partially offset?","Scott Settersten","Aram, my response to that would be partially offset. And I think we\u2019ve shared that with many, many investors that we\u2019ve talked to over the course of the last year. We still believe that in mid teen\u2019s operating margin target is a reasonable one for Ulta and one which we\u2019re capable of achieving over the longer term.","Again we\u2019ve got some investments that we\u2019re making in the near-term notably within supply chain, e-commerce, cycling our hyper growth new store program here over the course of the last couple of years. We feel like once we get through that, we\u2019re going to see benefits coming from those investments. And we\u2019re also going to see continued mix up in the prestige part of our business which we think will drive new improved operating margins over the long term.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","And comps of 8.7 don\u2019t hurt either. Thanks for taking my questions.","Scott Settersten","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Balter with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Gary Balter - Credit Suisse","Thank you. I don\u2019t think I read the press release as closely as Aram, so (indiscernible) details. Two questions, one is you mentioned that obviously traffic went up. How much of that is high end with the relative of the royalty program the ultimate rewards to all the customers and what does that imply for future quarters?","Mary Dillon","Gary, it\u2019s Mary. Thank you. I think there were several factors that we believe drove the transactions and we\u2019re encouraged to see that improvement. Over the long term, we\u2019re going to want to continue to have that kind of balance. But it\u2019s really a combination of things, 500 process just one thing but certainly growing up the royalty program as part of it. But we\u2019ve also had some great newness in brands that we\u2019ve talked about like IT and Mally, space expansion, more compelling marketing and merchandising I see overall in our materials and stores and online. So really a combination of those things, altogether we believe is what drove that to happen.","Gary Balter - Credit Suisse","Thank you. And Mary, just following up, you mentioned when you talked about the really strong results in e-commerce. But you had the new release of the platform or some upgrade. Where are you in the commerce rollout of your platform and what do we expect in the future? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Sure. I\u2019ll ask Dave to take that.","Dave Kimbell","Yeah. Absolutely. We\u2019re continuing to expand our capabilities. So as you\u2019re probably aware last year, late last year we launched our new site that has been performing very well and is one of the drivers of our success. And we continue to add new capabilities. I think couple of things that Mary referred to earlier are brand stores, with the new capability in partnership with some of the key brands.","We have a new feature around Ask Ulta where customers can engage with us and ask specific questions on our products or beauty tips. And then we continue to expand our capabilities. We\u2019ve got -- as Mary mentioned, our inventory availability, online both on our site and then within Google, which is we found to be a great convenient store. Our customers in Q1, we\u2019ve had about $25,000 million abuse of inventory on our site. And that\u2019s important not only if connect with our customers today but to set up ourselves up for future Omni-channel capabilities.","We\u2019ve built in some live chat capabilities. We\u2019ve really designed our loyalty and guest services. So there\u2019s a variety of things as we continue to build our web and digital experience that we think will be critical to continue the strong growth that we\u2019ve had in that space.","Gary Balter - Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Citi. Please proceeds with our questions.","Oliver Chen - Citi","Thanks. Congratulations on a great quarter. Regarding your comments on the evolution of gross margin, what is going to drive the category mix positive impact there? And also the breakout in getting the 20% unit growth was impressive. Is that a trend that will continue and could you just give us color on what\u2019s working on the unit growth side?","Dave Kimbell","Hi Oliver. Thank you. First on the gross profit margin, you\u2019ve only just started at high level as Scott described as a few different items that drove some margins deleverage in the quarter and some of those headwinds will continue to for the year. But we dos expect to see modest improvement for the full year. And it really is a couple of things, one is newness that we see have in the pipeline and also as we continue to evolve our promotional strategy and pull back on some discounts carefully, we think that those two things will help us.","Oliver Chen - Citi","Thank you. And on the unit front, do you expect the momentum in kind of breakout to continue at this rate between AUR versus units?","Mary Dillon","Yeah. I think we\u2019re trying to really drive a healthy balance of all that over time. So some of the test and learn programs that we are doing this year are really trying to see how we can lever that sales equation even further. So we\u2019re looking across the board. So part of this is obviously first and foremost getting new guests to Ulta and then having our current guests come more often, shop more often. So whether she\u2019s buying more units for transaction or higher-priced items in her bag, all those are frankly good leverage for us to explore that we think all are going to be part of our future growth.","Oliver Chen - Citi","Thanks. And Mary, on the customer acquisition front, what would you prioritize as the top catalyst for the continued momentum in terms of realizing opportunity there. And we\u2019re looking forward to Investor Day. So if you could just give us a few thoughts on the nature of what we may expect to hear about, that would be great? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Well I can\u2019t preview Investor Day but I can\u2019t tell you is that consistently we\u2019ve said that and we know from a data perspective that awareness of Ulta just as a retailer is lower than really it can be. So it starts with just getting more guests that are in our sort of sweet spot of our target to become aware of Ulta. And as we become aware of what we\u2019re about, so -- really the long-term work that we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s really about how do we (indiscernible) relaunch the brand to people who maybe have not been in Ulta for long time and maybe never been in Ulta or ultimately know we\u2019re like right now versus what we were perhaps a long time ago.","So giving us a lot of opportunity there and it starts with awareness clarity what we stand for and then it\u2019s about continuing to do what we do really well which is offer her a differentiated experience in the stores, most importantly within a ray of great products and service that you can only get at Ulta. So all the things together, I can\u2019t prioritize only one because they\u2019re all, I think, exciting opportunities for us.","Oliver Chen - Citi","Thank you. Best regards.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your questions.","Bilun Boyner - J.P. Morgan","Hi. Good afternoon. This is Bilun Boyner filling in for Brian. Thanks for taking our question. We want to ask about your product introductions for the rest of the year. Are there any product launches or emerging trends you\u2019re really excited about for the rest of the year. And do you have any updates to your Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me shop-in-shop rollout events?","Mary Dillon","Thank you for asking the question. As far as future, any new products have rolled out, we would not share at this point in time. Of course, we always are focused on newness whether it\u2019d be products, courses or new brands that I would not be specific. And that\u2019s a Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me. We opened significant amount of doors last year. I think I mentioned on our last call and we\u2019re very pleased with that business. And we continue to monitor but it\u2019s like a new store. It ramps over time. So we\u2019re partnering with our vendors to make sure that we maximize the business together.","I really don\u2019t have other updates other than that that we\u2019re very pleased with those businesses. And as far as trends, some of the trends continue. Lip has been very strong. We see that continuing this year and as we move forward into fall. Also anti-aging continues to be strong for us. And we\u2019re all seeing complexion of face being very strong as Q1 ended and I think it will continue.","Bilun Boyner - J.P. Morgan","Thanks. And can you update us on the store maturity of Carol. I know you mentioned new stores exceed expectations but I wanted to see if there\u2019s a change in your comp assumptions by store age particularly given the product mixes somewhat changing and e-commerce is now our growing part of the business?","Scott Settersten","Yeah. There hasn\u2019t been any change in the core model and what we see the performance of those new stores compared to what we share in our standard kind of investor desk. So -- no store is still very productive in line with our expectations and the stores that are beyond five years old, again in a healthy comp environment, they are additive to the comp. They are all comping, very healthy low to mid single digit range.","Bilun Boyner - J.P. Morgan","Great. Thanks. Best of luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon. I have two questions. The first relates to gross margin. You made some comments about the mix within Prestige and the notion that the Prestige products that you sold more than Q1 might be a little lower margin than some of the Prestige products perhaps that you\u2019ve sold in the past than you expect to sell going forward. Any color as to drivers of that trend, what changes you expect to see that will make Prestige more of a peer positive to the gross margin range?","Mary Dillon","Hi Matt. Well, I would say Prestige was a pretty big category, right. There is a lot of different brands that we have that are in the place that we call prestige and some of them have different margins. All of them are good strong margin and good high price points right but within that there are certain brands that are somewhat higher or lower. So it\u2019s really just about that. It\u2019s little bit of shift within that. As we look at our pipeline for the rest of the year, what we expect in terms of newness, we believe that we\u2019ll moderate and shift up positive.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","So you have visibility to launch in such that that you feel like that way?","Mary Dillon","Yeah.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Great. And then my second question, I believe at the outset of year you talked about $0.10 of investment, most of it in SG&A in the initiatives that you\u2019ve spoken about in the past and again today. Scott, if you haven\u2019t done so and I may have missed it, could you quantify how much of that $0.10 you booked in Q1. And to the extent you said, some investments were deferred to later in the year. How much of what you\u2019re originally expected to spend in Q1 that you push out to later in 2014?","Scott Settersten","We\u2019re virtually zero in Q1. I can\u2019t answer the question directly. And it\u2019s all back-half loaded to 2014. I would say directionally it\u2019s heaviest in Q3. That\u2019s where we really could not able to get some actions in place and it will continue on into the fourth quarter.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair","Hi. Good afternoon. Congratulations on a great result. Just a couple of follow-up questions, one if I could ask Clinique and Lancome question slightly differently. Would you at this point -- do you feel like over time there is still a meaningful opportunity to add one or both to those brands or others of that stature to the meaningful part of the chain that don\u2019t already have them?","Janet Taake","This is Janet. So thank you for the question. We are pleased with the business. As I said, there is opportunity and we are hopeful that we will continue to expand those brands and there is opportunity for others. So that\u2019s -- and at this point, as I mentioned, that I have no further update.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair","Okay. And then just a follow-up on the thoughts around the promotional cadence. You didn\u2019t call it out in the first quarter, so was it fair to say it was not a meaningful difference year-over-year in the first quarter?","Mary Dillon","Well, part of -- we actually slightly pull back on our promotions versus year ago. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s so significant that it\u2019s super meaningful yet, but it\u2019s a trend that we are encouraged by, because strategically we think it\u2019s important. And one of the things, I believe it is just sort of just walk before you run on something like this, right. So value is important to our guests and we need to make sure that we offer value, but we have done some things to sort of modify our mix and our offer strategy. Dave talked about our CRM platform. We are leveraging that to deliver more relevant offers. We are expanding a digital reach to drive awareness. And now we feel we are balancing the value equation with offers that are more relevant, more personalized, perhaps even more emotional connection you might say to our guests. So we are making some changes there, but are having improvements in terms of our promotion level. That\u2019s going to be difficult for analysts I think to track that going forward, because as we get more segmented and more personalized, it won\u2019t be as obvious to everybody what we\u2019re doing, because we won\u2019t be doing the same offers to everybody, but we are encouraged by that. And again, that\u2019s very important part of how we think about the long term for the business.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair","Okay. So, I mean, basically you are also clearly aiming at more effective and higher payback on the promotions that you run so that seems to be part of it to.","Mary Dillon","Yes.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair","And then just thinking about as the year progresses, the reason I asked the question is, obviously second half of last year and there were some unique external dynamics that worked at all retailers or grappling with. But what, I guess, at this stage, is there something about the second half this in -- this coming second half that you would expect to allow you to be maybe less promotional than you were in the second half of last year or at least similar year-over-year based on maybe even new -- the full year rolled out ultimate rewards program or other more targeted promotion that kind of helps that?","Mary Dillon","Right. Well, I feel good about where we are and I feel really good that everyday we\u2019re raising our gains as it relates to our ability to be more fine-tuned with our promotions. And as you said use that to drive more incremental profitable sales. That\u2019s the ultimate gain here. So really if I look at our full year, it\u2019s still early in the year and we feel it\u2019s prudent to hold where we are until we get deeper into the year. To your point, we don\u2019t really know what holiday holds, but I do think that I feel good about where we are and if we\u2019re going to continue to raise our gains. If our sales momentum continues and if our upcoming newness performs better than expected, we could see some upside.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair","Great. Well, best of luck in the second quarter and look forward to the update in the fall.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your questions.","Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee","Hi. Congrats everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Quick clarification. Scott, did I hear correctly that even ex the e-com business that your traffic levels were positive for Q1, I think 1%, is it?","Scott Settersten","Yes, that\u2019s correct, 1.2% actually, right. So that\u2019s 200 basis points improvements from what we saw in the fourth quarter.","Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee","Right. Okay. So I guess my question is, I think most retailers saw a sequential deceleration or a lot of retailers saw sequential deceleration in the traffic trends, is there anything you can point to in terms of what you guys did to improve that your own traffic levels from Q4?","Scott Settersten","Yes, when you say there is any one particular thing as Mary mentioned, the way we\u2019ve seen it and measured it, it looks like it\u2019s a combination of things, right. So it\u2019s some of the great new products we introduced in the first quarter, whether it\u2019s expanding Urban Decay or did cosmetics and adding to what we offer in the box, continuing to improve our marketing and merchandising inside the stores. We expect that the back of the year we will have some easier comparison. We would expect the transaction trend being positive to continue to the rest of the year.","Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee","Okay, great. And then just one more on the gross margin line, so it looks like the comps came in couple of points above your guidance, but the gross margin looked a little weaker to us. I think you clarified this, but just want to double check. It sounds like your like-for-like retail margins were just like you planned them and this was just a function of your sales came from different channels and different products and because of that the profitability was a little less. Is that a fair assessment of the gross margin for Q1?","Scott Settersten","That\u2019s fair. I mean, again, the retail product margins as we defined which is 90% of the business, I mean we are very healthy. Mary mentioned slight pullback on some of the promotional there, so it\u2019s helped us to be able to maintain margin rate on that. But it\u2019s just some of the other mix items that we saw occurred in the first quarter. And, again, we see a number of those things being able to either mitigate or moderate as we get further into the year.","Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee","To that point, can you give us some color on Q2 and give us the comp and the sales and EPS, but in terms of how you expect gross margin to play for second quarter?","Scott Settersten","Sorry, Ike, we are not getting into that level of detail on guidance any longer. So we kind of stopped doing that when we kicked off 2014.","Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee","You would expect those headwinds to dissipate is what you are saying on the gross margin line?","Scott Settersten","Well, directionally that the royalty headwind is going to be with us for the rest of the year. E-commerce, we would expect that to moderate because we are going to continue to expand our assortment there and the business continues to scale, so we would expect some moderation there. And then on the product mix, again directionally we expect that to improve as we get deeper into the year, because we do have some nice newness in the Q, which is going to be rate accretive to us in the back half.","Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee","Got it. Congratulation guys.","Scott Settersten","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo","Thanks. Congratulations from me as well. First question is, can you compare contracts, the environment that you saw in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, if you need it to be more or less promotional, if others around, either in the beauty category or other product categories you can keep with, you could share some thoughts on that, that would be great?","Mary Dillon","Well, certainly the fourth quarter of last year was really promotional as we saw across all retail, right. So in gift giving categories that we might compete with, we compete with everybody at that time of the year, right. So even with outside of beauty, we also are very promotional quarter. This year, I would say that within beauty, I would say it\u2019s not necessarily less promotional and this is very competitive environment as you know and everybody is fighting for share. We\u2019ve gotten I think better every day as it relates to how we do our promotions and how we target them and use them to get our guests to come in and buy more often and buy with less discounts. So I think certainly I would say the broader promotional environmental, less intense, but within beauty pretty competitive.","Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo","Okay. Another question is, have you seen any changes in your kind of the pace of new customer additions compared to prior years and how do you anticipate that to change going forward?","Mary Dillon","Well, let me say one thing which is that the big part of this test run that we\u2019ve referenced and we will be running some of these awareness in new guest acquisition tests as we get further into the year. The whole goal of that is to drive new guest acquisition but do it in different ways, right. So right now, we\u2019ve got a great 13 million plus people on our loyalty program and it\u2019s a strong program, it\u2019s driving the majority of our sales which is great. We think there is opportunity to have a lot more people if loyalty members to open in the future, right. So to do that, you have to actually make sure that you are communicating in an effective and efficient ways to get people\u2019s attention and to get them aware of Ulta, right. So that\u2019s why we are doing those tests to see is there an opportunity for us which we believe there is to drive new guest acquisitions to a range of tactics from traditional media to social media and search optimization. So there is plenty of ways for us to do that. And we think that\u2019s going to be the big learning for us to this summer and into the fall that we can then leverage as we look forward.","Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo","Thank you. One last one is on the mature stores and the older stores, how is that, maybe you could share some color on how those stores perform relative to the rest of the chain? Thank you.","Scott Settersten","Again, our new store model is intact. New stores are performing as expected. And again it\u2019s a healthy comp increase year-over-year. And as we would expect those older stores are contributing to the comp increases. So we are seeing healthy low digit into the mid digit kind of comp year-over-year in some of those more mature stores. So we are very happy with the productivity of those stores right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Wu with Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Thanks. Hi. Good evening. And congrats on the great quarter. Can you elaborate more on the two 5,000 square foot stores that you are planning to test in the smaller markets and any color around the expected overall profitability and merchandising differences versus the full size stores?","Mary Dillon","Right, David, well, if I had to keep it at a pretty high level because we are still in the planning phases and we haven\u2019t really publicly communicated a lot about this yet, but I will say, we are all very excited about the opportunity. It\u2019s really an opportunity to go into right now I would say just consider them smaller markets, similar sort of in some ways to where we operate today but just smaller markets with less dense populations. The stores will be 5,000 square foot stores. We think about it as really bringing the Ulta experience into a market where frankly we think our women targets are going to be very excited, women futures guests are going to be very excited about having that Ulta experience. So it will be curated down certainly with less space, but we will have a salon in every store. We will have a mix products similar to what we have today in every store. It gives us an opportunity to experiment a little bit with fixtures and lighting and things like that, but most importantly it will for us to learn about the economics. We feel like we are very confident the economics will be strong and good, but we need to learn that. We also need to learn about labor model and service model. So more to come on that.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","And are those locations also based in power centers?","Mary Dillon","I don\u2019t know if I want to disclose where they are exactly, but yes, similar real estate strategy today.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Got it. And obviously maybe too early to tell, but what do you think the smaller format store potential could be over time?","Mary Dillon","Yes, too early to tell would be a good way. I mean, it\u2019s really something, we modeled it certainly as we see that it looks like it will be quite accretive I guess I would say. We see it as an incremental opportunity to our real estate strategy and overall business strategy. So part of what we\u2019re defining in our five year plan to these tests is what is that potential.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer","Thank you. Good afternoon. Just want to go back to something that you mentioned, Scott, about the sort of directional cadence in the gross margin this year maybe even next year. If I understand you correct, it sounds like this year you are looking for a little bit of gross margin expansion, but most of that\u2019s going to be offset by the investments you are making on the SG&A side. As you look ahead to \u201915, I would imagine the headwinds that dissipate later this year eventually go away effectively, so you are going to get better gross margin expansion next year and then the $0.10 of most SG&A investment to happen this year probably dissipates as well. So would you guys expect to see even greater gross margin expansion next year given what you\u2019re investing this year?","Scott Settersten","Joe, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m prepared to go all the way out here with you on that line of questioning, but I would clarify on the gross profit line. We did mention product margins, so retail product margins we expect to be slightly up year-over-year for full 2014, but that\u2019s going to be offset somewhat by some other investment headwinds that will roll through that line, most notably fixed store cost deleverage for the full year.","So gross profit maybe slightly up for the year but in the flat to just slightly up kind of area I would say. And that $0.10 worth of SG&A, you\u2019re right, that\u2019s where it goes, that\u2019s were test and run is. It\u2019s hard to say right now how that\u2019s going to play out. We want to see what the results are and then take actions from there on what we want to invest in near future or what path we\u2019d like to follow.","Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer","Okay. I thought to give it a shot, that\u2019s all. But in terms of the evolution of the promotional strategy, obviously it sounds like you\u2019re easing up there a little bit. And I know one quarter is a very small sample size because a lot of how that plays out will have to do with what your competition is doing etcetera. So are you guys worried at all that your core customer base has become a custom to promotion? And as you ease up on that lever that they may look to go elsewhere or is that not a concern at this point? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Well, that\u2019s exactly why I would say walk before you run on this kind of thing. And so far I think it looks very encouraging again. Value is part of the equation the guests have come to expect from Ulta. It\u2019s really across a lot of different dimensions if with purchases, free samples, beauty feels, and then of course a loyalty program. And then there\u2019s been discounts like coupons and postcards.","So as we\u2019re pulling those apart and we\u2019re doing analytic work to pull it apart as well as just experimentation, I really very much believe that early data would suggest that we are not -- we don\u2019t have guests that are ultimately reliant. There may be segments that is like, that\u2019s probably true for every business. But for the most part, we are confident that as we understand her better and we personalize offers to her more and we bring in the thing that she is excited about trying and buying that there is a lot of runway there.","Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kernan with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","John Kernan - Cowen & Company","Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for squeezing me in and congrats on a very nice quarter. Scott, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about that the environment remain stable. You expect to put a little bit better than your outlook for the year. Does that imply you need to keep doing 9% comps or is there just some type of line item, you think you have good visibility into that could drive some upside to the current outlook?","Scott Settersten","No, we\u2019re just looking the glass is half-full, right? We're looking at business where we\u2019re just coming out of our great first quarter. You know what our guidance especially on the comp line with a little ahead of our full year guidance target. And again, we\u2019re doing the same with the second quarter because sales are strong, we\u2019re seeing good strength in some of the newness that we\u2019re introducing to our guests. So we just want people to realize that if things continue on, the plane that we are on today, we would expect to see some upside as we go through the year.","John Kernan - Cowen & Company","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just I think it\u2019s obviously been a big driver to comp. can you remind us what inning you think you\u2019re in, in terms of that continuing to be a comp drivers as the Prestige becomes a bigger part of the mix? Thanks.","Scott Settersten","We would expect again big picture. We are focused on trying to have a nice healthy balance between ticket and traffic drive in our business. So we see ticket recently over the last three or four quarters has been a heavier contributor to the comp. We\u2019re starting to see now transactions right or traffic trying to get back in balance here. We would expect that phenomena to occur as we get through the rest of 2014. We think, we\u2019re on track to have more normalized and a better balance between the two comprising our total balance.","Mary Dillon","And the one thing I would add is it\u2019s not only about shifting more of the mix to Prestige, it's also about more units per transactions for our guests. We have a lot of items in the store, plenty of opportunities for her to pick up more in her basket every time she shops, so we think we can drive that balance over time.","John Kernan - Cowen & Company","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Gere - KeyBanc","Okay. Thank you. I guess, just noticed in the balance sheet and all the cash that you\u2019re sitting on $7 a share, so can maybe you update us just on the thinking in terms of the uses of cash at this point? Is this something maybe you\u2019ll talk more at the Analyst Day, but clearly with no debt and you have a very attractive (indiscernible) EBITDA. I was just wondering first off if you can just maybe give a little color on how you can put that cash to work.","Scott Settersten","Yeah. Jason, we discuss uses of cash and capital allocation with our Board on a regular basis. Right now our current, our best thinking is the best investment is to continue to drive organic growth in the business. So we\u2019re investing in new stores. We\u2019re expanding our supply chain capabilities and driving our e-commerce growth as best we can. So we\u2019re assessing capital allocation as part of the long-term strategy work that we\u2019re doing as a group and we will be able to give you more color on our plans for the future and long term when we meet with you in the fall.","Jason Gere - KeyBanc","Okay. That\u2019s good. And then second question, as e-commerce gets a little bit better and forgive me if you did talk about this earlier. Can you talk about what the average, I guess, purchase size was online versus in the store? And the reason why I\u2019m asking is just when I think about the customer coming into the store, usually they have -- they know they\u2019re looking for, but there\u2019s always those impulse items too. When you\u2019re online, sometimes you don\u2019t have the time for the impulse items. So I was just wondering, as you see the shift move, how do you get that customer to shopping online to kind of buy more than what they\u2019re just looking for?","Dave Kimbell","Yes. And absolutely, it\u2019s a big opportunity for us. I\u2019d say you are right in general that the e-com has -- there\u2019s opportunity for us to continue to grow that. I think we\u2019re pleased with really all measures within our e-commerce business right now on traffic, conversion and average order. But as we get smarter with our cadence of promotion to communication on the web, we think, we\u2019ll have opportunity to continue to drive that.","And so much of that will be driven by our deeper understanding of our customers and targeting message and communication through some of the new capabilities I talked about within our website. So yes, we do have opportunity to continue to grow average order in our e-commerce. We\u2019ve made progress on that over the last several quarters as we\u2019ve launched our new site and continue to see opportunity there.","Jason Gere - KeyBanc","Do you -- I mean, can you quantify the difference between average order online versus average order of the loyalty card member versus the non-loyalty card member? Is there something that you can provide, just to give a little color so we can see what the potential opportunity may be?","Scott Settersten","Yeah. Not on the loyalty side of things but generally speaking, where the bricks-and-motor transaction is round numbers, call it $35 a ring normally and e-commerce is north of 50. And a lot of that is the free shipping offers and things like that which generally tend to drive up average order value.","Jason Gere - KeyBanc","Okay. Great. Thank you for the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jill Nelson with Johnson Rice. Please proceed with your question.","Jill Nelson - Johnson Rice","Hi. Sorry to add another gross margin question. But just trying to understand first quarter decline on the merchandise margin line, given last quarter, I\u2019m sorry -- last year in the first quarter you were hit by kind of a one-time event with gifts and purchase issue. And so just trying to compare that to how you performed in the first quarter and then just in contrast that the improvement you\u2019re expecting for the remainder of the year?","Scott Settersten","Yeah. A new quarter, a new set of challenges, right, and opportunities to manage. So I was hoping I would never have to talk about one quarter last year, the GWP and (indiscernible). Thanks for reminding me, Jill. I would just reiterate what I said previously, which is the core retail product margin that we see in the business, which again 90% plus of our business is in really good shape and part of it is our ability to kind of slightly back off on promotional level as well as continue to improve the mix of the overall box with adding additional prestige kinds of brand and items to our mix overall.","So that\u2019s a great things for the business. I did mention that loyalty, there is a bit of a rate hit that we take on that. And I would expect that continues for the rest of the year. And again, that\u2019s a long term good for Ulta. Loyalty is one of our best biggest most important assets that we have.","E-commerce, we\u2019ve talked about that for the last year or so. I mean, that\u2019s the nature of that business. We continue to build the assortment out there. We\u2019ll continue to do that throughout 2014 and we expect the rate to improve there in the long term with better assortment and more scale for that business to help cover some of the investments planning we had to do.","And then lastly, the product mix, the shift we saw in Prestige, we expect that to moderate as we get deeper into the year. And again, I just say again, we\u2019ve got some nice things in the queue. I\u2019m looking at Janet, my merchant partner, here we get some great things in the queue for the back half of the year that we expect to help margin range.","Jill Nelson - Johnson Rice","All right. Appreciate it. Just last question, inventory per store were down this quarter, how are you looking at that metric for the remainder of the year?","Scott Settersten","Yeah. We -- that\u2019s another, I think, we\u2019ve kind of grappled with for the last year or so. I mean, we\u2019ve made some important investments in inventory, both to help general in stock levels in the stores and then with the boutiques we\u2019ve made some significant inventory investments as well. Those have been good for the business, good long-term investments for us. We\u2019ve kind of cycled all that now and so we feel like we\u2019re in a really big position and we expect per door inventory increases to be well below the comp increases for the year.","Jill Nelson - Johnson Rice","Appreciate. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Altschwager - Robert W. Baird","Great. Thank you and congratulation. You touched on the mix shift going out within prestige. But could you update us on the performance of math versus prestige? And whether you are seeing any evidence of broadening the strength across price points?","Scott Settersten","We haven\u2019t seen any shift really in the total box shop so to speak. So we still, customers coming into shop prestige that\u2019s what\u2019s drawing her into the store. But we also know, when she checks out there is still mass items in her basket. She\u2019s cross shopping the store and that\u2019s really one of the secrets to Ulta success, as we can capture both parts per shopping trip.","Mark Altschwager - Robert W. Baird","Great. Thanks. And then could you just talk a little bit of the store experience and you have been investing a lot in training. What metrics are you looking at to gauge whether these investments are translating into a better more differentiated experience?","Mary Dillon","Right. Well, we\u2019re early on the test and learn of those, so we\u2019re doing a couple of things, one is just increasing moderately our overall base level of training for associates. But really as we look at the test and learn, its really about how learning about if we were to ramp that up even further and frankly, have more, guest facing time, even more knowledge to our associates, maybe through technology and these are just key measures, of course, will be does that drive incremental profitable growth.","So we have to measure that over some period of time. But we\u2019re pretty confident that while our guest does not want to be -- she sometime doesn\u2019t want some help, another time she does.","We believe, we know the right way to do that, but we believe that, for many of our guests is more knowledge, more recommendations from associates. She may increase the units per transaction and we\u2019ll measure that closely and make sure that that kind of investment would work overtime.","Having said that, a lot of our supply chain investments will also be hope overtime allow our associates to have more customer facing time. So with our incremental investments, we believe that\u2019s also going to be one of the ways that we can drive growth.","Mark Altschwager - Robert W. Baird","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mary Dillon for closing remarks.","Mary Dillon","In closing, I\u2019d like to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates to deliver a great quarter while working to refine our strategy to drive sustainable long-term growth. And thanks all of you for your interest in Ulta Beauty. I look forward to speaking with you soon.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

Thank you Ms. Lefebvre. You may begin.","Laurel Lefebvre","Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Ulta Beauty's Fourth Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are Janet Taake, Chief Merchandising Officer; and Dave Kimbell, Chief Marketing Officer.","Before we begin I'd like to remind you of the company's Safe Harbor language.

","I'll now turn the call over to Mary.","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Laurel and good afternoon everyone. Ulta Beauty achieved excellent sales growth in the fourth quarter supported by continued momentum in our e-commerce business. We delivered solid EPS growth in keeping with our expectations that we would need to invest in margin dollars to drive market share gains during the promotional holiday season. We also made significant forward progress in each of our five key strategies. ","To recap the headlines, we grew sales 14.4% or 23.3% adjusted for the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2012. We delivered a 9.2% total company comp on top of an 8.6% comp in the fourth quarter of 2012, both including the impact of online sales growth. Our e-commerce business performed very well driving 82.5% comp sales growth which contributed 260 basis points to the comp. ","Similar to the rest of the year prestige cosmetics and skincare were the strongest categories while we continued to see weaker industry trends in the nail and fragrance category. We were encouraged to see improvement in the transaction trend with a sequential improvement compared to the third quarter. While still slightly negative for retail stores transactions increased about 1% including e-commerce despite difficult traffic trends in the retail environment overall.","Our comps continued to be mostly driven by ticket, about a third of increase coming from units per transaction and about two-thirds coming from average selling price. Earnings per share were up 9% to $1.09 or up 14.7% adjusted for the 53rd week last year. Scott will provide more details on our financial results for the quarter and on our guidance for 2014 in a couple of minutes but first I want to update you on the recent progress on the five components of our growth strategy; new store performance, new product services and brands, our loyalty program, marketing and ulta.com","Starting with real estate, we opened 11 stores during the fourth quarter to complete the most ambitious store opening program in our company\u2019s history. We are very proud of our growth and development team\u2019s execution in delivering this new store program as well as the hard work of the store operations, merchandising, supply chain and HR teams to get these stores staffed, merchandised and ready to serve our guests.","New store productivity continues to be strong. We are on track with our plans to open about a 100 stores in 2014 representing about approximately 15% square footage growth. This is a purposeful decision on our part as we said last quarter to moderate our pace of store growth. New stores continue to provide excellent returns and will continue to be an important part of our growth strategy. ","We expect about 40% of these new stores to be a new market and about 60% are planned for filling in existing markets. We anticipate about one-third of the stores to be in new real estate and the remaining two-thirds are planned for existing shopping centers. We expect about 15% of the 2014 class of stores will be in enclosed malls adding to the 52 mall stores we have in the portfolio today. The rest will be in power centers or strip malls. ","In terms of the pace of new store opening, we expect to open 19 in the first quarter, 19 in the second quarter, 43 in third quarter and 19 in the fourth quarter. We also plan to open two 5,000 square foot or small format stores during the second half of the year in smaller markets with fewer households than what's typically required to support a 10,000 square foot store. We are in the early stages of developing and testing this model but we are very encouraged by the potential to expand our store growth and delight more new guests with the great Ulta Beauty experience. ","We also plan to remodel about 12 stores to our latest store format this year and re-flooring that cosmetics planograms in about 60 stores to replace some dated fixtures and to create a more vibrant and consistent shopping experience in that category. Today we have only 38 stores in older formats, about 5% of the fleet. We are very proud of our consistent and contemporary store portfolio. ","Now turning down to merchandising I am delighted to announce that Janet Taake was recently promoted to Chief Merchandising Officer. Janet and her team have done a phenomenal job expanding our portfolio with new brands, products and services over the past several years and developing valuable partnerships with key vendors. They have also worked in concert with our marketing, e-commerce, operations and replenishment teams to make sure we launch new brands and products effectively. ","The recent launch of Urban Decay's Naked3 eye shadow powder is a great example of this, where the merchants, CRM, e-commerce, supply chain and stores teams worked together with our vendor partners to ensure customer has got excited about the new products and had a great experience buying it from Ulta. ","Our merchant team delivered a strong fourth quarter with strong comp gains in prestige, color and skincare offset by softness in traditional gift giving categories like fragrance, bath and personal care appliances. While industry weakness in fragrances and nail polish have been well documented there were several bright spots including the successful launch of the fragrance One Moment by One Direction driven by a major 360 degree launch including print, email, social media, PR and digital marketing. ","We also saw strength in lower price point items like lower box fragrances and we made improvements for our holiday gift and purchase program which helped drive sales in the fragrance category despite industry softness. ","We were also pleased with our January performance with prestige skincare taking center stage with our skin event featuring daily in-store events. From a trend standpoint our lip category continues to be a standout and delivered excellent growth. Skincare and anti-aging products remain high growth categories as well with new brands and products from Perricone, Meaningful Beauty and Philosophy contributing to the category's strong performance. ","Looking ahead we are excited that IT Cosmetics and Mally launched last year in selective stores will be rolling out to the entire chain later this quarter. Our customers have enthusiastically embraced these brands in our stores in our line. ","Turning to services, our Salon team delivered solid results in the fourth quarter to cap a great year where they contributed to the total company comp by improving retention of Salon Associates and refining offers to drive trial and awareness. In the fourth quarter we rolled out eyelash application services in all stores. The Salon's artistic team created a lot of excitement by representing Ulta Fashion Week in New York in early February where they created the model hair styles for various designer Broadway shows. ","Looking forward we expect to add new services at our Salons this year and roll out enhancements like text confirmations for appointments and 24X7 online appointment booking. We will also feature Salon services more prominently in our direct mail campaign to communicate to our customers that Ulta is a destination for trends like hair, skin and brow services. ","Now moving on to an update on our loyalty program and customer relationship platform, we now have 13 million asset loyalty members who shopped with us within the past twelve months. We recently converted all of our customers to the ultimate rewards program and the team executed a very smooth transmission. Having all of our customers on one program which uses points as currency will enable a more efficient use of our CRM platform for targeted offers. ","Now we\u2019ve been working with our CRM platform for just over a year now and we continue to test and fine tune our offers as wells as we are also talking with our vendors to develop compelling CRM campaign. As a result of our improved ability to segment and target customers we\u2019ve been able to grow our conversion rate and drive more sales from marketing contacts which in turn helped us to deliver strong comp growth in the fourth quarter. ","Now turning to marketing first I\u2019d like to announce that Dave Kimbell has joined Ulta Beauty as our Chief Marketing Officer, Both the marketing team and e-commerce team report to Dave. Dave brings to Ulta his extensive experience in building consumer brands including beauty products with Proctor & Gamble and brands like Quaker Foods and Seventh Generation. Dave was most recently CMO with U.S. Cellular where he oversaw the team responsible for advertising, digital and e-commerce, retail design, pricing promotion and consumer insights and analytics. ","Dave brings a seamless integrated and multi-channel customer experience which drove strong e-commerce growth. Dave will lead our efforts to drive greater awareness and clarity about the Ulta Brand and create customer acquisition and optimize the balance across promotional and brand building activities over time. In addition Dave will lead our Omni-channel marketing and e-commerce efforts. ","Now turning to the marketing highlights from the fourth quarter, we were encouraged to stabilize the trend in transactions with our increased promotion to drive traffic and protect market share. During the holiday season we also expanded our beauty sales programs with hot offers and social media in ulta.com. In January our signature mother skin event supported with a fully integrated digital and print campaign drove the strong finish to the quarter. ","Looking ahead to the first quarter we are excited about our continuing digital brand building efforts, our direct mail campaigns featuring our spring trend reports and our highly anticipated 21 days of beauty promotion later this month with an amazing array of offers and events. ","Now wrapping up with our fifth growth strategy, our e-commerce business, the fourth quarter was very strong for ulta.com with particular strength in prestige cosmetics, skincare and holiday promotional products. We benefited from our improved e-commerce platform that was launched in the fall as well as increased fulfillment capabilities with the expansion of our Northeast distribution which began shipping e-commerce orders this fall. With 83% comp growth for the quarter ulta.com exceeded our expectations. ","While Black Friday and Cyber Monday were very successful the team maintained strong momentum post-holiday as well. We are confident on e-commerce business will continue to deliver rapid growth in 2014 but we\u2019ll likely begin to moderate off a larger base with top line growth expected in the 50% to 60% range. ","So this wraps up my update on our five growth strategies. Before I turn it over to Scott I\u2019d like to also give you a progress report on our strategy work and share my thoughts on our guidance for 2014. Ulta is a great business, I am very optimistic about our future. We are well positioned in the marketplace and our core business model remains strong. I want Ulta to be the most popular destination for beauty products services and experiences for women when and however she wants to shop. ","The long range strategy we are developing will ensure that we deliver on this vision. We will chart a course that allows us to continue to deliver an exceptional guest experience, be a terrific place to work and drive profitable growth for years to come. ","We have a wonderful foundation to build on. We operate in the large and growing beauty industry, we offer many popular and exclusive brands, we have a track record of performance that's one of the best in retail. We offer a differentiated guest experience that involves products as well services. We have excellent store economics. We also have a powerful and developing CRM capability and of course a great leadership team and passionate associates. ","That said we cannot stand still. We see a clear line of sight to continue growth in the near term. However we also need to invest in the strategy that will drive growth for the long term. Doing this now while we are operating from a position of strength will enable us to drive healthy long term performance for Ulta. In our strategic planning work we are taking the long view, projecting the consumer category in competitive environments well into the future refreshing our visions in how Ulta needs to continue to evolve our business model and developing a five year growth plan. ","Through this work we'll create a [play book] anticipating the guest\u2019s changing needs in a unique and differentiated fashion and deliver profitable growth for our investor. Again we are in an exciting, we are in a very exciting growth business with passionate guests and associates and terrific vendor partner, a great basis for our future. ","Now once we've completed this work in the fall we\u2019ll share the results and vision, strategy and five year financial targets. This work has already given us some clear insights that have helped inform our view for the current year with clarity about some of the investments I believe will drive future growth. ","Two of our biggest opportunities focus on the customer, acquiring new guests and making sure we continue to deliver relevant and differentiated guest experience. As you are all well aware retail is changing rapidly and customer expectations continue to rise and change as well. We need to invest in a most effective way to increase awareness of Ulta, to drive new customers to our stores and website and to become less reliant on discount over the long run. We also need to build Omni channel capability that customers expect us to have and provide even better service in our stores. ","With our tremendous growth in prestige cosmetics and skincare over the past few years customers today have higher expectations for our product knowledge and service standards and we need to reaffirm that. We believe that these investments in 2014 will help us to prioritize the best strategies to drive comp growth as well as margin improvement. Our plan is to deliver mid-teens earning growth in 2014 allows us the flexibility to make important investments today and we believe will set us up for future growth and success. ","With that I will hand it over to Scott.","Scott Settersten","","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. We recorded total sales of $868.1 million compared to $758.8 million last year, an increase of 14.4%, excluding the impact of approximately $55 million sales in 53rd week last year sales growth on a 13-week to 13-week basis was 23.3%. ","Comp store sales increased 9.2%. The retail comp was 6.6% and e-commerce growth of 83% added 260 basis points to the comp. Salon contributed slightly to the overall comp. I would like to remind you that this comp performance benefited by more than 200 basis points through the comparisons to 2012 Super storm Sandy negative impact and the timing effect of the extra week last year. Recall our comp compared weeks 40 to 52 of last year to the same week this year and excludes the 53rd week which was an unusually large sales week for us. The underlying comp excluding these factors was more like 7%. ","Gross profit dollars increased 13.1% to $293.6 million and gross profit margin declined 40 basis points to 33.8% from 34.2% in Q4 last year, driven by strength in our prestige categories offset by higher than expected promotional activity to drive growth. ","SG&A expenses rose 15.4 % to $177.6 million, up 20 basis points on a percentage of sales to 20.5% due to planned investments in supply chain, e-commerce and store labor that are bit better than expected driven by strong expense controls. For example, we were more efficient with marketing spend by distributing more offers digitally, via email and social media rather than printing direct mail business. ","Pre-opening expense was $1.8 million compared to $1.9 million in Q4 2012 driven by 11 store openings during the quarter compared to 13 new stores opening during Q4 of last year. ","Operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 13.1% versus 13.7% in Q4 of the prior year. Net income increased 9.5% to $70.7 million or $1.09 per diluted share versus $64.5 million or $1 per diluted share last year. EPS grew 9% or 14.7% excluding the approximately $0.05 attributed to the extra week in 2012. ","Turning to the balance sheet inventories were $457.9 million at the end of the quarter compared to $361.1 million at the end of Q4, 2012, up 3.3% on a per store basis. This is consistent with our plans were after making permanent investments in inventory at the end of last year to improve in-stock levels and continuing to invest in prestige boutiques we expected to see inventory per door growth below comp growth by year end. ","Capital expenditures were $49.1 million for the quarter, driven primarily by our new store opening program and depreciation and amortization for the quarter were $28.7 million. Capital expenditures for the full year were $226 million. Roughly 60% of our capital spend was for new stores, remodels and relocations. The remaining 40% was for merchandise fixtures including prestige boutiques, supply chain investments primarily related to the e-commerce expansion at Chambersburg as well as IT investments including ulta.com and maintenance CapEx. We generated about $102 million of free cash flow for the year and ended the year with $419 million in cash. ","Turning now to guidance for 2014. We expect to open about 100 new stores this year and will increase our remodel programs with about 12 stores. We anticipate comparable sales to increase in the 4% to 6% range. This is expected to yield top line growth in the mid-teens range for the year. P&L investments for the year include supply chain expenses to support the planned 2015 opening of a fourth DC, marketing to convert 50% of the countries to the ultimate rewards loyalty program and investments in increased training for both store and Salon Associates to improve the customer experience. ","In addition as Mary mentioned all of the strategy work we've done so far identifies significant opportunities to acquire new customers and drive higher awareness of our brands. We also need to create a better customer experience with more Omni channel capabilities and more knowledgeable associates. We intend to allocate a pool of dollars to test and measure initiatives that we believe our critical to our long-term growth as-well-as invest in some headcount to move these key initiatives forward. ","These initiatives to explore future growth are expected to impact EPS by about 10 points. As a result we expect that earnings per share will grow in the mid-teens percentage range this year, including those incremental initiatives representing $0.10 of earnings per share and excluding any potential accretion from share repurchases. As a reminder we have an authorization in place with about $113 million remaining. This outlook assumes the current economic and consumer environment remains stable in 2014. If macroeconomic conditions improve we expect to do better. ","We expect to invest about $265 million in capital in 2014 with approximately $115 million earmarked for new stores, remodels and relocations, $30 million for merchandised fixtures for existing stores, $50 million for IT systems, including e-commerce, $50 million for supply chain and about $20 million for maintenance CapEx. ","Turning more specifically to the first quarter of 2014, going forward we will give quarterly guidance for sales, comps and EPS but will no longer breakout our expectations for gross margin and SG&A. We expect sales to increase in the range of $693 million to $704 million versus $582.7 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 5% to 7%. Pre-opening expense is expected to come in about $2.5 million with 19 stores planned to open in our first quarter. We expect to achieve earnings per share in the range of $0.70 to $0.75 compared to $0.65 in Q1 of last year. ","You may be expecting Q1 to be our strongest quarter relative to an easy gross margin comparison from Q1 of last year. In fact we will see certain expenses hit Q1 that will make it a tougher quarter relative to the rest of the year. We will have costs related to the changes in the senior management team and consulting expense related to our strategy projects with a significant portion of the work occurring in the first quarter. We are also incurring incremental marketing expenses related to the conversion of our loyalty program. At the same time the first quarter represents the greatest headwind in terms of P&L deleverage due to the large number of younger stores that are still left and fully productive. ","Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 38.3% and our fully diluted share count will be approximately 64.9 million excluding any share repurchase activity. ","With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to our conference call host to begin the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator"," ","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. ","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research ","Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Can you hear me okay.","Mary Dillon","We can. ","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research ","Okay, great. Question around, well two things really, one is if you can help us tell us what you learned about your customer from fiddling with the promotional cadence in Q4? Just wondering whether it's mass or whether it's prestige kind of what the customer response was to changes in promotional strategy on either side of the store?","Mary Dillon","This is Mary, let me just say couple of things. One is that we -- I guess I would say that there is probably a tale of two customers that we see overall in our business. There is folks that are feeling probably pretty upbeat about their earnings and about the overall economic environment tending to buy prestige we saw and our ticket, pretty strong uptake in ticket. So there are folks certainly that are less promotional and buying our higher margin prestige items. ","There is other folks I would say kind of the other part of our consumer base that are it's going to be more sensitive to promotion, more sensitive to the economic environment and probably more attractive to promotion. So those folks were as we ramped up our promotional cadence we think that was the right thing to do for that customer. ","Now overall for the quarter we saw an improvement in traffic but still most of our result was confidence driven by ticket. So as I noted that overall that it's part of our test and learn it we want to continue to dissect further what are the best drivers of incremental profitable growth as we use promotions more or less to drive results in any given period. ","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research ","","Thanks and just to quickly follow-up can you tell us what that increase in ticket looked like in the fourth quarter and also what promotional environment is embedded in \u201914 if you are expecting to become more or less or the same as 2013? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Yeah, right now I think we don\u2019t have any reason to think that \u201914 will be different than \u201913 and so that\u2019s we are assuming something pretty similar to that. In terms of the transaction versus tickets, so again I would say really pleased that we saw a sequential improvement in transactions in the fourth quarter, we were up about a 1.2 in transaction and 8 in ticket for the total comp of 9.2. Transactions in the retail store were slightly down in stores and there were offset by growth in Salon and e-commerce.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research ","Well, thanks so much, good luck in this quarter. ","Mary Dillon"," ","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup","Hi congratulations on outstanding quarter and great finish in the year. Regarding your guidance for first quarter and in your comps, February has been pretty rough on everybody. Are you thinking that March and April could be better than February and are there any kind of thoughts around the dynamics you saw in February? Also is e-comp kind of experiencing similar trend with respect to how the weather has impacted or is there a dynamic that you could share with us, that would be great.","Scott Settersten","The guidance that we were providing of 5% comp guidance includes, as it always has, in the past everything we know laid up for the last kind of 5% to 7% excuse me, which includes the current consumer environment and what\u2019s going on in the category. To the part of the question about e-commerce, funny enough when we saw some of the toughest weather days in January we didn\u2019t really see a huge spike in the e-commerce business, which kind of flew in the face of common sense, from our vantage point. ","So we do think like we have a good momentum there, we have made a lot of progress in our ability to merchandise that and expanding the assortment online, we have made good progress on expanding our margin rate there as well. So we\u2019re very happy with the overall performance of that business.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup","Great, and on the promotional strategies, what\u2019s your best strategy there in terms of things you should highlight a few kind of offset or mitigate or what seems to be a continuation of the promotional slate?","Mary Dillon","Well I will say couple of things, one is that you know we continue to learn from everything that we do and so finding, as we think about even promotion for holiday for next year we\u2019ll step back and look at what worked well and what didn't work as well and we\u2019ll continue to refine our strategies for that, understanding the shift in consumer shopping patterns for online and see how that plays out in a holiday period. ","Speaking about holiday we look at all things from like gift giving versus buying for herself, those are offering that we are considering as we think about how to continue to refine. But we certainly know that at the core that we\u2019re going to continue to be aggressive to grow our market share and so I would expect it to continue to be a promotional time. ","Another thing I would say though is one of the test and learn things that we are working -- we are going to do right away is we are going to do deeper analytic work to quantify overall setting aside holiday, just incremental sales and profit impact of all of our promotional initiatives which will help us to get even more efficient and affective with that area of spending, so that\u2019s going to be an important area for us as we look to the future and how we balance non-promotional traffic and volume with promotional. ","Oliver Chen - Citigroup","Thank you. Best regards.","Mary Dillon","Thank you. ","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee","Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess for Mary the comments that you made about the investments into the brand, is there anything you can tell us about the studies you have done, you can kind of see where your unaided brand awareness is today versus some of your peers and maybe how you think that could change over time? And then I guess one quick one for Scott. On the comp guidance for the year can you help us think about what\u2019s embedded in that in terms of ticket and traffic?","Mary Dillon","Yeah I\u2019ll start with the -- I am not going to say specific numbers but certainly we understand where we are both in terms of aided and unaided awareness and I consider this to be a great opportunity for us. We\u2019re not as high as we can be and both in terms of awareness and I would say understanding the brand equity of Ulta, what is it that we represent, what do you experience about, so both of those are areas that we know there is plenty of room to drive awareness in both the store, what we offer in store, the fact that we have the salon and services. ","All of that is going to be key areas for us as we try to learn this year because to drive awareness consumers are bombarded with lots of messages all the time, so we have to be very purposeful in what and how we try to drive awareness and new guests to Ulta. Fortunately there is plenty of ways to do that and one of the ways that we are going to be testing and learning is around more sophisticated customer acquisition efforts, for example as well as more traditional CapEx, so there\u2019s I think some good opportunity there for us.","Scott Settersten","And Ike I would say in the near term we don't see any drastic changes as far as the makeup of the comp is concerned. So in the near term we still expect ticket to be primary driver of the comp although some of the growth initiatives that we talk to we\u2019re going to be focused on ways of trying to drive increased traffic, so either brand awareness activities or rather things that we can do within the store.","Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee","Thanks and one quick follow-up. You guys are actually one of the rare retailers that haven\u2019t used weather as an excuse for the quarter. Is there anything you can mention about store closures or weather may be negatively impacting the comp for the quarter and what it could have been I guess if you could just give some color around that I would assume it was slightly negative to your traffic and your comp.","Mary Dillon","Well we certainly weren't immune to the weather. I think we have 400 store closure days. You know fortunately a lot of our transactions are replenishments and items that perhaps our guest, that she can buy that they will come back and buy another day so we didn't feel that -- could we have done somewhat better for holiday while we didn't see weather is a big, the biggest impact in our performance.","Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee","","Thanks. Good luck.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Balter with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you. Mary you wrote in the press release, you mentioned it that you had 25 significant new brands that helped in the comps. Can you talk about what under the bigger brand additions were?","Mary Dillon ","Yeah. Thank you, Gary. It's actually one of the, I think most exciting parts of our story is that our guests are -- they want to come and find new things at Ulta and Janet and her team have done a great job at that. So I am going to ask Janet to take that question. ","Janet Taake ","Hi, Gary. Just quickly some of the things that we've launched last year we launched Perricone around this day, last year which was a nice add to our skincare portfolio, we added Meaningful Beauty in the third quarter last year and other skincare brands. In color we launched IT in about 50% of our doors last fall and as Mary mentioned in her prepared remarks we are taking into all doors in this quarter. We've put Mally in a handful of doors but we have lipstick, cream we have many other several different brands throughout the entire store. We also launched Jane in the mass arena, so we added brands across of the businesses including professional hair care. ","We talk a lot about prestige but we really added brands across all categories. Those were some of the highlights. ","Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you. And just, Scott a query, could you go into bit more detail possibly on the product gross margin and how we should think about what the impact was in the fourth quarter and how we -- I know you said -- I think you already said you are not going to talk about the gross margin but if you want us give us any thoughts about how we model it out for this year? ","Scott Settersten","","Yeah, I guess I can reference -- give you a little color on the fourth quarter. So with gross profits they were down 40 basis points and as we talked about in our third quarter call we're always ready to invest a bit on margin rates to protect our market share gains. And we did that, we had to do it in the fourth quarter, we also -- how it shook out. I would say that the 40 basis points, just to give you a little more specificity on that, it wasn't -- part of that was due to mix in the business overall. ","So as e-commerce continues to grow at an accelerated pace and becomes a larger part of our overall growth profile, while we've been very successful increasing our margin rate in that business as you look at individual year-over-year it does put a bit of [byline] over our margin rate because it does contribute at somewhat lower rate than our bricks and mortars. ","Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse","And going forward? ","Scott Settersten","We would expect that phenomena to continue at that; although we will continue to focus on merchandising there and other marketing tactics and e-commerce to help drive a better margin rate in 2014 as part of our plan. ","Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs ","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon. My first question relates to the loyalty program conversion. I guess it's great to hear about this happening with no hedges and no evident costs given that I think the second stage of the conversion and the prior stage had been a bit more challenging. Can you talk about what improved in your process as you converted the rest of the country to the current model of the loyalty program? ","Scott Settersten","Yeah. We've talked about this a number of times before explaining to people some of the hard lessons we've learned on the first time around, Matt. And I am sure we've had these conversations with you as well. So the team we were just better prepared, we had a better communication strategy to our customer, we kind of transitioned them out of the old certificate program into the points program in a more seamless manner so it's clear to them. And it was communicated as a big step up for them an improvement in the loyalty program overall. ","So we are very happy, the team did a great job getting us through that in a very transparent and fluid way. To just be clear on the margin rate we talked about loyalty and it is a bit of a headwind our margin rate for next year as we -- and yes we've discussed this in the past. But in the long-term it drives incremental comp sales and incremental gross profit margin dollars. ","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs ","Great, and then my second question Mary a call or two ago you spoke about the changes that you are making in supply chain -- that you had made in supply chain and human resources after the call, then another company and not a competitor talked about hiring someone who had been your CIO and just curious any other changes -- any changes in the management team since the last conference call, as I know you have been centrally organizing the team with your vision?","Mary Dillon ","Right, absolutely Matt, thank you. Well first of all as I mentioned two changes in our in our folk who are in the room here was us today. So Janet Taake being promoted to Chief Merchandising Officer and then the addition of Dave Kimbell as the Chief Marketing Officer. And yes and right now -- a fellow named Steve Junk is our Interim Chief Information Officer. Steve's been in Ulta for many years and has a great and deep experience. Our CIO went to another company and fortunately Steve was able to step in and play that role for us and he's doing a fantastic job and overtime we\u2019ll probably look at somebody in that role for the long term but right now Steve is running the ship for us and doing a great job. ","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Great, thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with JPMorgan Chase & Company. Please proceed with your question. ","Bilun Boyner - JPMorgan","Hi, thanks for taking my question this is Bilun Boyner on for Brian today. I guess I first wanted to ask about supply chain DC and the Omni-channel investment that is still in your $0.10 incremental SG&A impact guidance. Clearly they are ongoing investments but where would you say we are in that process, are we towards the tail end of a big chunk of those investments? I guess by our models they impacted earnings last year by about $0.03 to $0.04, so do you think it is reasonable to expect a similar impact this year from those and then they should start to minimize into next year?","Mary Dillon","Yeah, let me take that one, the $3 that you refer to in 2013, the way we describe it to folks was that, that was kind of a down payment on a longer term supply chain project that we have that we talked to with investors quite a bit in 2013. So that was consulting work to help us kind of blueprint what the future supply chain would look like. Now we are shifting into actually constructing a supply chain. We are looking at a new, a fourth building coming on-line in the middle of 2015. ","So now we are moving on to more of a CapEx kind of phase of the project there as we find a location, put up a building and get it staffed up and pre-opening as we go into 2015. So that will be the first step on a longer range supply chain re-formulation I would call it, we are going to look and make some significant improvements in the way we do business and we expect that to drive significant efficiencies across the supply chain over the long term and it's going to be a multi-year project and it's going to include going back and looking at some other existing facilities and perhaps doing some retrofit work there so\u2026 ","Bilun Boyner - JPMorgan","Okay that\u2019s helpful. And then my second question is on the Salon and Ulta Brand. Clearly there are big differentiating factors here. Can you help us better understand what your vision is for them and where you see the opportunities? Maybe how we should expect to see you really play them to your strength going forward and in 2014?","Mary Dillon","","I am sorry did you say Salon\u2026?","Bilun Boyner - JPMorgan","","Yes.","","Mary Dillon","","\u2026 and Ulta Brand? Yeah you know right now the services part of our business is not that big but we consider that it's a very strategic asset in that for the long term having a place to go to get great haircut and color, skin services where all the different kinds of services we can imagine adding will be something that really differentiates us. And as well our Salon guest is our best guest. She comes frequently and she purchases more than just the services. So that\u2019s the great part of your business as we are looking at our strategic planning work we\u2019ll consider options around how we think about that going forward. ","With the Ulta as well we\u2019ve got a really nice brand, the product are very large brand of color, skin care and sun care and we launched many of those in big packaging, we are going to be merchandising them even more effectively in 2014. And that\u2019s what we think it's a good base off of which to grow as well. ","Bilun Boyner - JPMorgan","Great, thank you, best of luck.","Mary Dillon ","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair & Company. Please proceed with your question. ","Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Company","","Hi good afternoon. Nice job navigating a noisy environment with a healthy comp. Just wanted to understand a little bit better may be bridge the kind of the updated EPS growth guidance for 2014 with the prior guidance from December. So all of the $0.10 is incremental correct?","Mary Dillon","Yes and I will just state that really the change in our view from December is really centered around our belief that we have the opportunity to leverage our position of strength right now and invest in initiatives that we think are important to drive their future best way to drive future long term and profitable growth. So that is our incremental analytics around the different areas that we described, which is brand awareness, getting more new guests, improving the guest experience as well as making sure that resource our company with the talent and skills that we need to drive that long term success. ","Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Company","And the $0.10 includes all of those items?","Mary Dillon","","Yes.","Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Company","Okay, so if my math is right that\u2019s about three percentage point impact, let\u2019s say going from previously give or take around 20% expected growth to now about mid-teens, give or take one to three percentage points additional and I am just wondering if you can kind of bridge that remaining gap a little bit. Was it -- are you expecting kind of little more gross margin investment base what you saw through the holiday period you that kind of thing or just maybe help tying it up?","Mary Dillon","","No, I mean what we said is that we would be around high teens similar to 2013 and we are guiding to mid-teens right now.","Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Company","Okay, maybe I didn't catch that right before. I thought the previous thought was around 20% at the midpoint. Okay, I\u2019ll\u2026","Mary Dillon","","Dan we were trying to not give a single point estimate for the guidance, to say that the next year we are going to be very similar and not try to give you know very detailed guidance but in that range. So you are right if it was exactly the same it would be there but with more of a range in mid-teens that three points is really the difference between our view then and today. ","Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Company","Okay, fair enough. Thanks very much.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","","Sure. Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray. Mary I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about mobile maybe get in to a little bit more than indicating some of your specific initiatives for mobile in 2014. You guys are making great strides in and out over the last six months and those starting to tie royalty there. I am just wondering how you are seeing your mobile shopper interplay your more engaged shoppers, how are they using the app and are they adopting to the technology and what more key offer them in 2014? Thanks.","David Kimbell","","Yeah, hi it\u2019s Dave Kimbell. I will take that one. Mobile has been an increasing part of our business and as part of our total e-commerce sales platform and it\u2019s now representing about probably quarter of our total e-commerce sales so it\u2019s a bigger part and growing very quickly. The new app as you said has been a big improvement for us and we\u2019re going to continue to find ways to drive that to market differently within the mobile space to look for different offers in different times. ","Of course mobile does provide us with some unique opportunities to reach our consumers in very relevant places at relevant times. We are looking at creating some in-store applications, expanding Wi-Fi in our stores which will also allow her to use those services more seamlessly within our stores and continue to new find ways to improve the effectiveness of the app across different platforms, including phone and tablet. ","So we see that as a big platform. We\u2019ve been very successful, it\u2019s growing but we also think we are just scratching the surface on fully maximizing the opportunity in that space.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","","Dave could you actually again looking at implementing from [i-beacons] potentially in 2014?","David Kimbell","","I am sorry, some what?","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","I-beacons","David Kimbell","","That isn\u2019t necessarily in our pipeline but we are going to look at everything that\u2019s available to us as we look at new ways to create that experience. Mary talked about broader Omni-channel and of course mobile is a big part of that. So as we look at there\u2019s a robust pipeline of ideas that we have both in this year and over the next three years to try to create more seamless experience but we\u2019ll look at all those things and trying to drive that go forward.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Altobello with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Morey Marcus - Oppenheimer & Co.","","Hi, this is Morey Marcus in for Joseph. My first question just going back to incremental investment and going back to 2013 back into Q2 you discussed that\u2019s going to be around $0.13 what it actually end up being?","Scott Settersten","","It ended up being at roughly $0.13. Again the pacings during the quarter change little bit throughout the year as we kind of go back and forth with some of these things, and you'll recall we talked about supply chain, the $0.03 that was related to supply chain will slow down a little bit during the course of the year so quarter to quarter it changed a bit.","Morey Marcus - Oppenheimer & Co.","","Okay, great. And then going back to the headwinds at the loyalty program for 2014, I know you said you won\u2019t go into margins that much but can you talk about I guess the timing of that impact, do you expect it to be evenly distributed throughout the year or is kind of again all in the same quarter?","Scott Settersten","I'd say it's evenly distributed throughout the year. So the way the margin rate headwind comes in again, it's the way they earn points and the way they would gain points so it's kind of evenly spread throughout the course of the year. ","Morey Marcus - Oppenheimer & Co.","Okay.","Scott Settersten","And by the time we cycle through a full year cycle is where we expected to be kind of back of break-even from a few dollar standpoint, so at that point is where the comp increases start to materialize and we start seeing better gross margin dollars. ","Morey Marcus - Oppenheimer & Co.","","Okay and then my last question and next is, did the reduced reliance on price promotion have a significant impact on the quarter and also how do you possibly read out the strategy going forward?","Scott Settersten","No, we actually were more commercial in the fourth quarter than we had originally expected earlier in the year and a bit more than we were expecting even when we gave guidance for the fourth quarter. So with the top validated we invested where we thought it was appropriate. ","Morey Marcus - Oppenheimer & Co.","Okay, perfect, thank you for your time. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. ","Jason Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thanks may be I\u2019ll dovetail off of that last question. So I know you are not giving specific guidance about the gross margin SG&A. But just kind of want to talk a little bit about this past year gross margin little bit more promotional it's flat year-over-year, the year before you had strong gross margin. So as we think about the cost of doing business do you think the levels that we are seeing now will kind of stay intact and as we think about operating margin expansion overtime which I know you\u2019ll talk about in the fall is this really going to be relying on the SG&A leverage, especially as I guess we kind of anniversary some of these higher investments that you need to make over this year and I don\u2019t know if potentially next year as well. ","So just wondering if you can just maybe kind of maybe guide a little bit on that?","Scott Settersten","Yeah Jason, I would say directionally if we look in the first quarter this year we expect to see some merchandise margin expansion. So the whole notion of us trying to do a better job with on offers with customers and trying to toggle back and forth in fourth year and try to pull back a bit on its amount of discount to drive the business we are still on that path. We believe in that last year we saw good response to that early part of the year when we saw a bit of rough waters we reacted to that in the fourth quarter. ","So that\u2019s still part of our plan and still expect to see some merchandise margin expansion in 2014.","Jason Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets","So we should see gross margin then somewhere between \u201912 and what you achieved in \u201912 and \u201913, I mean obviously not putting exact number to it but there will be gross margin expansion this year.","Scott Settersten","I wouldn\u2019t go quite that far, I finished my thought here. We are going to see merchandise margin expansion that\u2019s going to be offset by fixed or cross deleverage, especially the first half of 2014 we\u2019ve got a 125 new stores coming in into the maturity curve here and it's still very early days for those stores, will put pressure on us, [more so] over the end of the first half of the year. When we look out longer term it's not really a story of SG&A leverage, I mean we expect that to be part of operating margin expansion over the long term but we -- the key drivers are really prestige mix to the business, again it's a richer part we expect that to add, albeit probably not at the same rate we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of year. ","We expect e-commerce, again better merchandising there and marketing tactics we expect that to improve operating rate here in the future and supply chain investments. We are making a lot of significant investments there now, they are creating some headwinds for us over the near term but over the long term they are going to create a lot of efficiencies for us across the chain. ","Mary Dillon","Yeah and I would just add that back to the customer theme here, over the longer haul we know we can and will focus on how can we drive demand for Ulta in a way that people are more profitable over time right. So whether it's about new guests who discover us more footsteps in the store, more targeted promotions of more of a balance on spending the drives awareness and new guests versus price discounts. Those are the kind of things that -- it's all part of the business and that\u2019s also part of what we are going to investigate test as we go forward as they how can we continue to get even more efficient in terms of how we create demand across the business.","Jason Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay and just for clarification of the $0.10, how much hits SG&A? How much is gross margin? Can you just -- is there any break down there?","Scott Settersten","The majority of it hits the SG&A line. ","Jason Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay and the last question is housekeeping, just with fewer stores open this year how should we think about the pre-operating expense for this year? Is there can you guide at least on that for the full year? I know you gave for the quarter but just wondering if\u2026","Scott Settersten","I think we provided the store comp by quarter right, for the full year, I think you guys can probably do the math on what the average is and\u2026 ","Jason Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Fair enough. Okay. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. ","Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities ","Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions, first on the Lanc\u00f4me and Clinique do you plan to add any more of those boutiques this year and what's kind of the long-term thinking there on the expansion and maybe what have you seen in terms of the impacts of the stores that they are in? The second question is on the share repurchases. We've only seen you repurchase stock once on opportunistic basis. Should we expect a more regular program or kind of expect you to continue to be opportunistic there? Thank you. ","Mary Dillon","I'll take the first question on Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me. Just a reminder we opened over 80 boutiques last year between Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me. So from a sales perspective we will get benefit but those stores are still ramping and the stores that we opened in them. And basically we wouldn't breakout specific information beyond that. What I'd say is we are very pleased with platform of all the boutiques that we have between Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me and we are hopeful that we will be expanding both those brands in the future but today I have nothing to really announce or share with you at this time. ","Scott Settersten","And as far as the repurchase is concerned management and the Board continues to review best uses of excess cash and returning value to the shareholders. We will continue to buy back shares opportunistically and we will be maintaining our investment discipline and returns on that kind of thing. ","We will be framing up our long-term capital allocation and shareholder return methodology here, that's part and parcel of our strategy work that we are in right now and that you can expect that we will be sharing details with you on that in the fall when we communicate the entire strategy.

Please proceed with your question. ","Mark Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co. ","Good afternoon and congrats on the strong finish to year. I just wanted to touch quickly on the trends with fulfillment. Can you talk about where you are with in-stock rates in the stores and how much opportunity is there to drive better conversion through the supply chain investments and improvements in that area? And similarly can you talk about how you are going to balance the breadth and depth of the SKUs as you test these smaller format stores? ","Mary Dillon","Yeah, those are all great questions. Certainly our view on the supply chain investment overtime is to do several things for us; to build the infrastructure that we need for growth, capabilities to meet guest expectations across channels, optimize our end-to-end efficiency, certainly a piece of that is stronger allocation forecasting and replenishment capability. So all of those are areas that we know and plan -- have a plan for in terms of how we continue to improve. ","Our in-stock position we feel is good, we look at that obviously every day, every week. There is some transitions happening as we start the year in terms of some planograms and new brands and et cetera and that creates a little bit of some transition. But overall we are very pleased with our in-stock rate this year. Our supply team worked really hard against some pretty tough weather situations as we entered the year and we came out feeling very good about our position. ","Mark Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Great, thanks. And then just the balancing of the breadth and depth with the smaller format? ","Mary Dillon","Yes, great question. We are in the early stages of nailing that down and that's something that it's something that will obviously be working on as we finish our plans to open up the two small stores this year, small format stores. The overall idea here, I mean there's certainly been some thinking on that already but it's to bring an Ulta experience to our guest in a smaller way in a smaller format way. So obviously that's going to take some curating, the number of SKUs that we offer. But we expect that it will continue to be the kind of experience in which you have everything from prestige to mass brands, if she has a salon that she can use. So all that will be in the experience set and it's a matter of how do we curate from there. ","Mark Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jill Nelson with Johnson Rice. Please proceed with your questions. ","Jill Nelson - Johnson Rice & Company","Good afternoon. Just have a couple of quick clarification questions, did you mention in the fourth quarter that gift items were weak or were you just mainly talking about kind of the fragrance which is the main gift category for holiday? ","Mary Dillon","Well I would say items that are typically gift giving that we would see are more softer in terms of the category, so fragrance personal care appliance et cetera, that was I think a broader industry trend not just an Ulta trend.","Jill Nelson - Johnson Rice & Company","Okay and did you see any regions or categories that you did increase the promotions, just trying to see if you saw some nice correlation with traffic when you did increase promotional activity?","Mary Dillon","Yeah, I would say it was just pretty much across the board. ","Jill Nelson - Johnson Rice & Company","Okay, and then just a question on inventory plans how should we look at the inventory growth for the remainder of the year, looking to have a growing up store bases below comp expectations?","Scott Settersten","Yeah we would, Jill we would expect it to in 2014 to continue on the trend that we have seen at the end of the year. We expect our comp -- our inventory per door to be well below comp store growth. We believe we\u2019ve got good processes and systems that people in place to maintain the discipline here. During 2013 we were kind of lacking some unusual items with some inventory investments that we saw, that caused some variability early in the year but we\u2019ve got that now back on track where we want to be. ","Jill Nelson - Johnson Rice & Company","All right and then just some given of the recent management changes, is there any positions that remained open or are you looking at new folks still? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","No, I am really pleased with our management team, I think we are [joining] really nicely and right now I think we are in good place. Our business is always changing evolves, so you never say never but we are good. ","Jill Nelson - Johnson Rice & Company","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question. ","Dana Telsey \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group","Good afternoon everyone. Can you talk a little bit -- any more color on the new store productivity levels? What you saw and how does it compare to the prior year? And then just lastly what type of comp do you need to leverage expenses? And it's very exciting about all the new brands in 2013, how many brands in 2014? Thank you.","Scott Settersten","Hi Dana as far the new store productivity is concerned we continue to be very pleased with productivity in new stores and the investment returns that it's generating for our shareholders. If you adjust the comp, the 9.2 comp for e-commerce and super storm Sandy measurement, the calendar shift the stores are generally in the same vicinity as they were back in the third quarter and the way they were for most of 2013. So the new store model is intact, new stores are comping just the way we are expect in years one through three. And some of the older stores of course are in the healthy low single-digit range. ","So kind of where we expect them to be and frankly with the environment that we are in right now we are fairly happy with that performance. We think we can do better on that, that\u2019s a focus on 2014 for us to try to figure out how to better drive comps in some of our more mature stores. ","Janet Taake ","As far as new brands as Mary mentioned it's rolling to outdoors and beyond that I would really refrain from mentioning any new brands coming in. But we are always working on new brands, new products, exclusive products for our guests to surprise and delight her so there will be more coming down the pipeline.","Dana Telsey \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back to management for closing comments. ","Mary Dillon","Thank you. In closing I\u2019d like to thank all of our Ulta beauty associates who worked very hard to drive excellent top line growth and deliver solid earnings growth in 2014 despite a very volatile consumer environment. We opened a 125 stores, dramatically improved our e-commerce business and continued to enhance our merchandise assortment, royalty programs and marketing capabilities all while laying with ground work for continued strong performance.","Thank you all for your interest in Ulta Beauty and I look forward to speaking with all of you soon.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Laurel, good afternoon and we have a lot to share with everyone today. Our fourth quarter results capped an exceptional year. We made significant progress against our strategic imperatives, while achieving outstanding sales and earnings growth. We continue to benefit from the powerful combination of strong demand in the beauty category and Ulta Beauty's highly differentiated products and service offering. This unique positioning is driving business results that transcend prevailing trends across the retail landscape.","To review the fourth quarter highlights, we grew the top line 21.1% and delivered 12.5% comps on top of 11.1% comps in the fourth quarter of 2014, which was our toughest comp of the year. Comp sales were driven primarily by traffic, yet ticket increased nicely as well. The fourth quarter delivered the best two-year comp since 2011 with a 23.6% two-year stack. Product newness, our loyalty program, great in-store execution, and investments in marketing and store payroll hours are fueling this industry leading growth across both retail and online, with the fastest category growth in cosmetics on both mass and prestige sides of the portfolio.","E-commerce top line growth and profitability were better than plan, driven by improved fulfillment capabilities and execution during the holiday season. And our salon business maintained its solid top line performance.","For the full year of 2015, we achieved 11.8% comp, our best annual comp since 2010, with double-digit comps in each of the three businesses: stores, salon, and e-commerce. Sales strength was driven primarily by traffic each quarter during the year, and the full year comp was comprised of a very healthy mix of 70% transaction growth and 30% ticket growth.","Before updating you on the drivers of our fourth quarter results, I'd like to take a few of the teams' accomplishments throughout fiscal 2015. We drove top line growth of 21.1% and earnings increased 25.2%, well above our expectations at the beginning of the year, reflecting robust market share gains and strong execution. We brought significant newness and exclusivity to the merchandise assortment, and added 26 significant new brands during the year, demonstrating increased traction with our brand partners.","We accelerated growth in our ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program membership, adding 3.2 million members to reach a total of 18.2 million active members by year-end. We meaningfully increased brand awareness through our investments in television, radio, digital advertising and PR. We achieved strong and increased guest satisfaction scores as measured by NPS.","We improved our supply chain operations in a few ways. We invested in better processes and inventory to increase in-stock levels. We drove efficiencies in our e-commerce fulfillment performance, and smoothly launched the Greenwood distribution center. We also delivered against complex IT goals with the implementation of a host of new tools across the enterprise: our new warehouse management system, our new merchandise forecasting and replenishment system, and a new product information tool, among others.","So, for the past several quarters, we've been describing to the investment community our progress against our six go-to-market strategic imperatives. But we rarely discussed externally our foundational seventh strategic imperative, which is talent that drives a winning culture: guest-centric, value-based, high performance.","I believe that the results we've just reported are the reflection of our traffic category, down (05:22) strategies, great execution and also the progress we've made in building our company's culture. I'm still proud to see proof that our commitment to putting the guest and the associate at the center of our mindset is truly delivering marketplace results. We're respecting the opinions of those who matter the most: the guests, who give us her hard earned money; and the associates who really knows best how to optimize the guest experience and our operations.","We're also reading through the lenses of functional expertise, enterprise-wide thinking, and collaboration, which is required more than ever in this fast-chasing world of guest expectations. We now have evidenced that these efforts are having an impact, not just in business results, but also in our culture. In fact, we saw significant year-over-year increases in the level of engagement of our associates as measured by a third-party through our annual culture survey. We are gratified to achieve global top-quartile employee engagement scores among best-in-class companies. Highly engaged employees are tightly correlated with high performing companies.","So now, let's turn back to our fourth quarter results. In an effort to allow more time for Q&A, instead of going through each of our strategic imperatives, I'll call out some of the highlights driving our performance. Our loyalty program is truly one of our most valuable assets. Asset membership grew 23%, showing continued acceleration. The growth in our loyalty program has been driven by two major things. The successful evolution of our marketing strategies to include awareness driving tactics like television, radio and digital, is driving brand awareness and new guests to our stores.","In addition, our store associates have done a terrific job of making new guests aware of the ULTAmate Rewards program and then converting them in. At the beginning of 2015, active member year-over-year growth was a bit less than 17%, and that growth rate increased each month throughout the year. We're seeing excellent trends in retention rates, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average ticket.","Reactivation of loyalty members, who hadn't shopped in the past 12 months, remains robust as well, another indicator of the benefits of the changes in our marketing model. As we discussed at our Analyst Day in 2014, we're conducting ongoing marketing mix analyses using a customized modeling tool that correlates sales results to in-market actions at the store and category level. This work clearly demonstrates that we've successfully and profitably delivered on the promise of getting to a healthier mix of marketing strategies and tactics.","We're dedicating more resources to personalize offers through a loyalty program and newer tactics, including television, radio, expanded digital and PR. These marketing campaigns are designed to position Ulta Beauty in a meaningful and differentiated way with every piece of communication reinforcing our brand personality and elevating our beauty authority. This reallocation of resources increases the impact of marketing and we believe it's one of the several factors fueling the strength in our comp sales.","While we're reducing our spend on less productive tactics, to be clear, we will always make sure that our guests see Ulta Beauty as providing a great value in periodic promotions, loyalty offers, newness and great experiences in-store and online are all part of that value equation. These changes for our marketing strategy are also driving meaningful improvements in our brand awareness.","Our latest survey showed that aided awareness rose to 84% versus 77% a year ago, and unaided brand awareness improved to 39% from 36%. We believe this increase in awareness was driven in part by our national advertising campaign. Stronger awareness of Ulta Beauty is helping us to acquire new guests and reactivating guests who hadn't shopped recently.","Now, in terms of merchandising, we continue to gain share in all categories with particular strength in mass and prestige cosmetics. Urban Decay, It Cosmetics, Nyx, Redken, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lanc\u00f4me, Benefit and the Ulta Beauty Collection were among the best performing brands for the quarter. We launched several new brands in our skincare area, including Julep and First Aid Beauty.","The pipeline of new brands for 2016 includes exclusive brands like Jessica Alba's Honest Beauty, and Fiona Stiles Cosmetics, as well as the introduction of Buxom color cosmetics and the expansion of Clarins skincare and cosmetics. We continue to focus on products that are only available at Ulta Beauty with the addition of many exclusive products within existing brands, including a new line of color cosmetics from Tarte called Double Duty Beauty.","We're very excited to work with our brand partners to accelerate the rollout of Clinique, Lanc\u00f4me, and Benefit boutiques in hundreds of stores this year that will make us even more of a beauty destination. Our brand partners are finding increasing value in working with our CRM platform. The number of brands participating in targeted CRM campaigns rose meaningfully last year. We partner with them to increase the number of targeted e-mail and direct mail campaigns, and to develop exclusive offers for platinum members.","All of these efforts drove incremental sales and margin dollars. Our brand partners also love working with our data analytics team to drive trial of various products and categories. We continue to put product samples in the hands of our guests in several smart ways. It would triple the number of samples obtained from our brand partners during 2015.","We're executing our sampling programs through online beauty bags and targeted samples to surprise and delight our guests at point-of-sale and store. We also have sample box programs in fragrance, professional hair care, prestige skincare, and mass haircare that have proven to be extremely popular. And we doubled our sales of these multi-brand sample boxes during 2015. For example, our sample box called Secrets to Gorgeous Skin offered during a recent Skin Event was a big hit. And we plan to offer many more of these sample boxes in 2016.","Turning to services, the salon business comped 9.2% with continued strength in cut and color. Blowouts, hair treatments and makeup services were the highest growth categories. We're delivering trend-right training to our salon professionals and continue to integrate hair and makeup in our offerings. Our hand-picked Artistic Team work to develop haircuts, color and finishing techniques that are reflective of the season, then creates and delivers high-impact training programs for all the salon teams in our stores.","The trends curated by our team translate hair and makeup looks straight from the runway in partnership with our brand. We've recently launched spring and summer trends including nine different hair and makeup looks, such as Festival Style Hair, and pearlescent glow makeup. The Benefit Brow Bar continued its excellent performance with double-digit comp sales and a continued expansion of brow services now in 712 stores.","To report on store growth, we opened 14 stores in the fourth quarter to complete our 2015 program of 100 net new stores, ending with 874 stores. New store productivity continues to be very strong, reflecting our growing brand awareness, dedicated resources to grand opening activities, ongoing improvements to our portfolio of brands, and high quality real estate. We are increasingly a tenant of choice as landlords appreciate our growth profile, our ability to drive traffic to shopping centers, and willingness of other retailers to follow in our footsteps to participate in the healthy traffic we draw.","Landlords also appreciate the quality of our store design and the way our differentiated offering enhances the mix of retailers in their shopping centers. We also continue to enhance the store portfolio through improvements to our new store format, as well as investments to elevate existing stores. For the 2016 class of stores, we'll be implementing a series of enhancements to our store format that elevates both mass and prestige categories, give us the flexibility to respond to our growing access to brands, improve the signage and presentation of our Ulta Beauty Collection, and upgrade fixtures in key categories such as fragrance.","New stores will also put the excitement of our services offering more on the forefront, by placing the Benefit Brow Bar front and center. We'll also fully remodel about a dozen stores this year and touch 100 stores in the fleet with prestige boutiques and remodeled fixtures in key categories.","So I'll take you on our e-commerce business. Topline growth of 44.2% contributed 210 basis points to our total company comp. Significant improvements in fulfillment speed and customer satisfaction during holiday resulted in stronger than expected sales and much better profitability compared to year ago. We added Clinique to the ULTA.com assortment during the fourth quarter, so at this point e-commerce is virtually at parity with brick-and-mortar in terms of our breadth of assortment. We continue to launch some new brands online to test before rolling out to the stores, and offer some brands online only such as an expanded assortment of men's products.","Moving on to supply chain. We are clearly seeing the benefit of cross-functional collaboration and joint planning among our supply chain, e-commerce, and IT teams as well as store operations. Our focus on continuous improvement in simplifying processes led to efficiencies across our network of four distribution centers. During holiday, we achieved record network e-commerce throughput of 55,000 orders in one day, almost double our maximum volume last year.","Shipping lead times improved dramatically with a percentage of order shipped in three days or less at 92% versus just 14% last year, significantly increasing guest satisfaction. In stock levels improved despite achieving sales well over our holiday sales forecast. The Greenwood DC successfully ramped up to serve 125 stores through the holiday season and delivered 25,000 orders per day during peak holiday.","We remain very pleased with how the new DC is performing. We continue to ramp and serve another 100 plus stores in Greenwood by the end of this year. The new Dallas DC is on track to open this summer and we continue to rollout new systems like Swift (16:32), our merchandise forecasting replenishment tool, and we're also investing in space and assortment planning tools this year.","Now, let me turn over to Scott to discuss the key drivers of our fourth quarter financial performance and our outlook for the first quarter and full-year of 2016.","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Topline growth was driven by a 12.5% comp and a very strong new store productivity. The marketing mix analysis that Mary mentioned, show that we were able to achieve this comp through a healthier mix of business drivers including new brand launches and new products, more effective marketing, including TV, radio and digital, more efficient in-store labor and continued benefits from new store maturation. Increased sales of gift cards helped drive topline strength post-holiday.","During the fourth quarter, our comp continued to be a bit more weighted to transaction growth, with traffic about 70% of the comps and average ticket representing about 30%. For retail-only the 10.4% comp was composed of about 75% transaction growth and 25% ticket growth. Units per transaction were flat, but average basket rose 3% to just over $43. E-commerce growth was driven roughly 75% by traffic and 25% by ticket.","Now, let's talk about the key drivers of the 120 basis points of gross profit improvement, which was quite a bit better than our initial plan. The increase was partly driven by higher merchandise margins due to mix as we delivered strong sales in many of our better margin categories and brands, including the Ulta Beauty Collection. We also successfully continued our shift away from broad coupons and discounts and towards more targeted and relevant offers to our guests, supported by our loyalty program and CRM.","In fact, we completely eliminated one of our usual discount offers at the end of the quarter, which helped our margin rate. We leveraged store rent and occupancy expenses modestly on a double-digit comp. And while our supply chain investments were still a drag on margins, they were less so than in the third quarter, when we first opened the Greenwood, Indiana DC.","E-commerce fulfillment costs were also much more favorable this year. You probably recall that during the holiday season of 2014, we were challenged with fulfilling orders during the spike in demand between Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and the higher than expected e-commerce fulfillment costs for holiday 2014 weighed on gross profit a year ago, creating an easier margin comparison in the fourth quarter.","The team did a much better job getting orders to customers in a timely fashion during the 2015 holiday season. In addition to the successful launch of the Greenwood DC, which provided additional capacity, we also increased the efficiency of our other distribution centers with process improvements throughout the year.","The e-commerce marketing team did a nice job smoothing out consumer demand during the holiday season with promotional events planned before and after the Black Friday period, culminating in a much improved guest experience and significant profit improvement. The product mix for e-commerce continues to help as well, as we ramp up sales of high margin hair care products which were added to the site last February.","Moving on to SG&A expense. Deleverage of 100 basis points was driven primarily by planned investments and marketing and store payroll hours to support holiday season sales. While marketing expense was flat for the year, it was back half-weighted with the introduction of new vehicles to drive brand awareness, including the national TV and radio campaigns. We also invested in store labor hours and training to improve the guest experience, especially during the key selling weeks during the holiday. Corporate overhead also deleveraged slightly due to higher incentive compensation in concert with our better than expected earnings performance.","In terms of the balance sheet, inventories were up 16.1% on a per store basis, driven by investments in inventory to keep up with much better than expected topline growth, several new brand additions, and the continued expansion of Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me boutiques.","The team did a great job selling through holiday inventory and making sure we start the new year with very clean inventory across all categories. While we generally strive to keep inventory per door growth in line with comp growth, we had compelling business reasons to modestly exceed that benchmark, and are very happy with the quality of our inventory, and the resulting sales growth. With the large number of prestige brand boutiques and new brands being added in 2016, we expect inventory per door growth to remain somewhat elevated for the rest of the year, although at a slightly lower level than Q4.","Capital expenditures were $67 million for the quarter driven by 14 new store openings, investments in systems, store fixtures and supply chain. CapEx for the full-year was $299 million. We ended the year with $476 million of cash and short-term investments. The company repurchased approximately 262,000 shares at a cost of $46 million during the fourth quarter under our 10b5-1 plan. For the full-year, we've repurchased just over 1 million shares for $167 million. This reduction in our shares outstanding delivered about $0.03 of earnings per share growth for fiscal 2015.","Today, we announced our 2016 guidance. In light of our accelerated share repurchase plan and continued momentum in our comparable sales growth, our anticipated earnings per share growth rate is higher than what we expected when we discussed our five-year plan back in the fall of 2014. We plan to add 100 net new stores with all stores in the program in our traditional prototypical store size. We expect to open 11 stores in Q1, 21 stores in Q2, 44 stores in Q3, and 24 stores in Q4. We plan to complete 12 major store remodels and two relocations. We expect to grow e-commerce above 40%.","Total company comps are expected to be in the 8% to 10% range. We anticipate earnings per share growth of approximately 18% to 20%. Operating margins are expected to be flattish, similar to what we achieved in 2015. Gross profit margin will be pressured by our new Dallas DC coming online this summer, continued investments in core merchandising systems, and depreciation and write-offs related to our accelerate boutique rollout and store refresh program.","CapEx has been planned higher than our previous view, which was in the $300 million range. We now anticipate CapEx of about $390 million. This includes slightly higher CapEx per new store with the latest enhancements that Mary mentioned as well as a significant step up in boutiques in our new store program.","We have also added about $80 million to the capital plan to refresh hundreds of our existing stores, which will include a major expansion of Clinique, Lanc\u00f4me and Benefit boutiques, as well as a significant presentation upgrade for fragrance and the Ulta Beauty Collection. We believe these prestige boutiques drive increased productivity in our stores and improve our positioning as a beauty destination. We are delighted that our brand partners want to grow even faster with us.","In terms of share buybacks, our Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase program for $425 million, which replaces the previous program. As you saw in the press release, we announced an ASR for $200 million and expect to continue our open market repurchases, similar to what we did in 2015.","Turning now to guidance for the first quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.016 billion to $1.033 billion compared to $868 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 9% to 11% versus 11.4% last year. Online sales growth is expected to be in the 40% range. Pre-opening expense for the quarter is expected to be about $2.5 million, earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.30 versus $1.04 for Q1 of last year. We anticipate a tax rate of 37.8% and fully diluted share count of approximately 64 million.","I'll now turn the call over to our conference call host for the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of David Schick with Stifel. Please state your question.","David Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. It's David Schick and thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the quarter. Just a quick question or a basic question on salon, and then a quick question on gross margin. On salon, you're lapping those incremental salon booking capabilities already, and then \u2013 but the business is continuing to grow quite nicely. Can you talk about how you're able to grow that rapidly despite that lap? And then, separately, any color on how much private label is benefiting gross margin, would be helpful. Thank you.","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I'll start on the salon question, Dave, thank you. The salon business right now is \u2013 we're pleased with the growth. It's interesting only \u2013 it's really under 7% of our loyalty members are currently using the salon services. So, there is no reason for us to think that we can't just continue to grow that nicely by getting \u2013 driving more awareness of salon and more trial.","So the online booking tool is certainly one step in that direction, which is great. But we anticipate that as we think about how we can continue to drive awareness and trial and rebooking in our salons, that we'll be able to continue to grow that for years to come. As I mentioned in the script, we've got plenty of excellent offerings for our guests whether it's new trends right off the runway on cut and color, even things that people can try just for the first time like a blowout or a make-up service. So there's plenty of growth that we believe we can drive ahead there. In terms of the private label margins...","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary","Yeah. Let me jump in there, Dave.","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Go ahead.","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary","So we don't breakout specific categories or rate contributions by line, but obviously private label is a very high margin category for us. It's something that's key to the mix overall for Ulta and something that we use, right? We use \u2013 strategically to help drive the business overall both on the top and bottom lines.","David Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kelly Halsor with Buckingham Research. Please state your question.","Kelly L. Halsor - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess given the momentum that you are seeing in the business here, how do we \u2013 how should we think about some of the metrics that are implied in your longer-term targets? Is this \u2013 given the potential, given the strength of the categories across the board, any thoughts on the potential upside to margins, et cetera from here? Thanks.","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Kelly. Yeah. First of all, we're thrilled with the results and the momentum in the business today for sure and excited about that as we move forward. I would say this, we're very confident and we remain confident in the mid-teen operating margin target that we put out for our long-term guidance. And that's going to be a combination of growing topline, driving efficiencies, also investing for the long-term health of the business.","Having said that, there is also plenty of questions ahead as it relates to guest expectations in a changing retail environment. So we want to retain some flexibility to continue to think about innovation in that area. So we'll continually be refreshing our five-year view. At this point, we don't have any reason to think we'll change our five-year financial guidance though.","Kelly L. Halsor - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks. And just if I could squeeze in one more here. Could you just give any color...","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Nice job, Kelly, squeezing in a second question.","Kelly L. Halsor - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","It'll be quick. Just in terms of the categories, I mean was the growth still largely driven by the strength of cosmetics? Are we seeing any strength in the categories...","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, let me turn this one to Dave.","David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer","Yeah. Kelly, Mary mentioned in the script that cosmetics has certainly been very strong for us both in the prestige and the mass side, but we're really excited that we're seeing growth across really the whole store. The thing that makes us different is the unique combination of assortment, All Things Beauty, All in One Place, and we're seeing growth in hair for sure, it's a huge foundational element for us. So all aspects of hair, fragrance, skincare, accessories, so we're getting growth in all categories, but it is being led by cosmetics.","Kelly L. Halsor - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks for talking my question. Great quarter, great holiday quarter. I was really intrigued by the 10% to 12% comp guidance for 2016. I can't remember you guys giving comp guidance so high. And I'd love to hear maybe what are some of the factors that give you confidence this early in the year, and obviously the current trends are very strong but what's causing kind of the sea change in your confidence to be able to deliver that level of comp, especially in a retail environment where there is so little traffic out there? Is it the loyalty? Is it the new marketing campaigns? Is it something you're seeing in the store aging, the way older and new stores are behaving? I would love any more details there. Thanks","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Omar, first I'll say you're on the right track and that it's a lot of things. But let me tell you this, we're very excited about our comps, but we guided 8% to 10% for the year, just to be clear, okay? So that's what we just communicated. But stepping back \u2013 we're pleased with that, I would say that, as we're coming into this year, I guess, what I would say is that, at the highest level, this is a business model that's working and we're executing it really well.","And so we feel confident about the momentum and that continuing. It's a combination of a lot of factors coming together. So if you'll indulge me, let me just spend a minute on this, which is, first of all, it's great that we're in a great category that is a growing category, right? And so that's important to start with. And there is expandable consumption of beauty products. So these are everyday use, sometimes multiple times a day driven by innovation, there's plenty of innovation. So we're in a growing business, we at Ulta Beauty have a really, I think, very clear bead on who our target guest is and how to position ourselves against this guest. So this beauty enthusiast is a large and growing segment.","Dave just mentioned it, we are positioned as All Things Beauty, All in One Place, which is differentiated and relevant to that segment. We have exceptional brand partnerships, so it's about knowing who we're trying to target, but also offering her what she wants, so exciting products, new and exclusive. Really working with our brand partners to continue to have the great assortment of cross-category price point services, I'd also add that smarter use of demand creation tools. So our loyalty program is really the heart, I talked about that. We've got long-term awareness in equity building tools moving in the right direction, the role of e-com and digital improved especially on the guest service side of that as well. So the demand creation tools are working well. And then I'd say just exceptional collaboration in our \u2013 with our teams and executing against complex things.","So it's about making sure that the in-store experience is exceptional and that takes a lot, whether it's payroll hours or investing it in stock; the distribution side of it, the focus that our Greenwood Distribution Center, the IT systems to support it. And real estate is a core competency for us and we're quite good at selecting store locations, building them out, remodeling, and store productivity is even stronger than we expected it to be. So I would say that truly is a notion of kind of a great market opportunity coming together and being executed well.","And last thing I'd say is that we also are less subject to some other factors that some of the retailers are, so whether it weather, maybe weak mall traffic, or fashion hits or misses, a few other things, we're less subject to that. So you pull that together it helps. I feel very confident that we can transcend what seems to be overall retail trend and deliver the kind of comps that we just guided with you.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks for the color, Mary.","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray. Please state your question.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Good afternoon, everyone. I'll add our congratulations as well. Mary just an observation, it seems like you've moved from a position of you desiring bigger and better brands to bigger and better brands desiring you. So I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the 26 brands you added in 2015. How important were those to the comp? And also what are the plans for 2016 in terms of new brand additions? I think you mentioned several hundred boutiques, (35:36) if you could give us a little more color on the specific number? And then on any investments you're making in merchandising? Thank you.","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Steph, thank you for the question. And I'd like to turn it over to Dave, because he and his team are really the experts at all of these things. Go ahead, Dave.","David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer","Yeah. That's great. First, I'll start with new brands. That has been something that we have been focused on for a long time. We've added well over 100 new brands over the last five years. And as you said, and as Mary mentioned, we have 26 new brands in 2015 alone and that included brands, we brought Dior in late in the year, Skyn Iceland, Soap & Glory, First Aid Beauty, Revolution Makeup (sic) [Makeup Revolution] (36:15), Pacifica, Tony Moly, several others that were key across all categories and all different mass and prestige and hair. And so we brought growth. And we're really excited to be continuing to partner with our brands to leverage growth. And we feel like we've got a great relationship that has been in \u2013 that has been building and strengthening for many years and we're excited about our ability to do that.","We've got \u2013 Mary mentioned a couple, but as we look forward into 2016, we're as excited for the upcoming years as we were in our results in 2015. We've got some great brands already that have already come out in the spring trend magazine that you may have seen that came out. We featured over 2,000 new items across new brands and existing brands, just in that magazine alone.","Some key new brands that we're offering Honest Beauty, just launched, Mary mentioned that, Jessica Alba's brand that is exclusive with us; Fiona Stiles also exclusive with us. Fiona is a well-known makeup artist and we're proud to be working with her. Our existing brands continue to bring newness and excitement to us. Mary mentioned, Tarte with their Double Duty Beauty and we're finding growth across all of our key brands both big and small, continuing to expand and rollout brands like that we launched last year BECCA, Clarins, Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me, which I'll touch on in just a second.","And then all of our big brands \u2013 our big partners across every part of our store are great partners in finding new ways to grow and we're excited to be working with them on brands like a Bare and Too Faced and Philosophy and Urban Decay and Benefit and Chi and Redken and Matrix, the list goes on, Nioxin and L'Or\u00e9al. So we're excited to be working on with our brand partners and we think we've got a rich pipeline to come.","On boutiques specifically, we did mention that we're continuing to expand. I'd say boutiques are an important part of our growth plan, should be evident by this, they're not the only part of our growth plan, we're \u2013 but we're really excited to be continuing to work. We have four main boutique brands, Bare has been our largest boutique brands and they are essentially in every store. We're continuing to rollout Benefit. We have \u2013 they were in roughly 700 stores at the end of last year. And then, over the last several years we've been partnering and expanding our relationship with Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me; each of them ended up with roughly 200 stores at the end of the year.","In total, across the ones that we're continuing to expand into existing doors and new doors, Benefit Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me; we'll be adding over 500 boutiques across those three brands in 2016. So we're excited about all the brand innovation and brand expansion that will be coming this year.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","That's terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please state your question.","Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research. Please state your question.","Adrienne Yih-Tennant - Wolfe Research LLC","Good afternoon and let me add my congratulations. I was wondering if you can talk about the penetration in 2015 of the e-com business and your private label, and then your exclusives. It seems like there's a lot of growth opportunity in those three areas. So if you could give us a little more color on that that will be great. Thanks.","David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer","Yeah. Private label in total; when we look at total private label we include our Ulta Beauty Collection and then some exclusive co-brands like our IT Brushes With ULTA (sic) [IT Brushes For ULTA] (40:16) and those represent approximately 6% of our sales in 2015. Our e-commerce penetration ended about 6% as well for 2015. So those are \u2013 and they both have been growing. We're continuing to expand. As the rest of our business grows on a penetration basis there, we're seeing incremental growth in each of those areas as well. And was there a third? Sorry [ph] just repeat. (40:49)","Adrienne Yih-Tennant - Wolfe Research LLC","The exclusives.","David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer","Exclusives. Well, so I rolled in some exclusively like co-branded like our It Cosmetics. We look at a lot of exclusivity and we don't really have a number that we look at with that, but within nearly every brand and certainly every major brand that we have, we have exclusive products or lines, Tarte Double Duty Beauty is one example that I've already talked about and we have quite a few of those throughout the entire store.","Adrienne Yih-Tennant - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much. Best of luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Securities. Please state your question.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, guys. Congrats on a really strong finish to the year. So, I guess, Mary or Dave, as you look at your shoppers that are converting to multichannel, does that channel migration happen from store to web or vice versa? Are you seeing any change in where how the customers discover you? And then just quickly for Scott, how much did the Indiana DC weigh on gross margins this quarter and then what's the right way to think about the ongoing impacts from the DC is to margins? Thanks.","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll start with the cross-channel, maybe Dave add, if there is anything I miss here. But cross-channel shopping is actually a pretty small percent of our shopper base today, it's only about 6% of our guests or so. And we love them, because the cross-channel shopper is shopping more frequently and spending more than a single channel shopper by far. I would say that \u2013 you can think about digital as the center of pretty much everything now, right? So quite often maybe somebody is discovering and researching online before they come into the store, whether they discover us online or in-store, first, I'm not sure if I can break that up, but I'd say probably mostly in-store.","Online tends to be very incremental to us as well. Our guests love the experience of coming to the store, the whole beauty enthusiasts' vibe is about trying things and increasingly experiencing services, and then online she find things that are kind of incremental to perhaps what she even had time to discover. We push out lots of emails, not lots, appropriate number of emails to our guests around new and exclusive and exciting products and that has stimulated some online shopping as well. So to your premise about, will that be a big area of growth for us in the future? Absolutely.","David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer","And as far as the new distribution center is concerned, again as Mary stated, we're very happy with the performance the team put in there, getting it off the ground successfully. And you recall that third quarter was really the first time we had it in service.","So it was less of a drag on gross profit margin in the fourth quarter, because the building was operating very effectively. And as we look towards 2016, again we will have headwinds in the first half of the year because of Greenwood being online, wasn't there last year, it's still going to continue to scale up. And in the second half of the year we're going to start \u2013 we'll see more benefits there as we lap Greenwood, but then we'll be taking online the new Dallas DC. So you're going to have incremental headwinds there. So as we look ahead next year, it's going to be fairly challenging, I would say, from a supply chain contribution perspective, but we do expect to see merchandise margins continue to expand, so there'll be a bit of a help there overall at the gross profit line.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot guys. Best of luck in the coming year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. I guess I'll follow-up from my one question, I'll follow-up on the Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me rollout. So about 700 stores now. I mean, that's up pretty substantially. I think the last time I have numbers was 2013 where they were in about a 100 each. So it's clearly rolled out pretty quickly in 2014 and 2015 and likely a big comp driver, but with it in now what about \u2013 let's say, about 80% of your stores should \u2013 is the lift from that going to potentially slow over the next couple of years?","David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer","Let me clarify what I said earlier, kind of repeat that. The 700 stores number was specifically about Benefit. So, that's the Benefit boutiques at the end of last year. Of course, you know, with our Benefit, we have services. We do Benefit Brow Bar that's in those stores. What I've said about Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me is, you remember, 100 stores that had grown by the end of last year to about 200 stores each. And...","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I said \u2013 okay.","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary","And then \u2013 so that's where we are on those brands, roughly speaking. And then, the 500 boutique number is a combination of additions in new stores and existing stores of Benefit, Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me. We won't kind of talk specifically about any one of them, but in total, across those three brands, in both new stores and existing stores, we'll be adding about 500 boutiques.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood. Right. Yeah. So, since I got that completely wrong, let me ask one another question. You didn't \u2013 my fault, I wrote down the wrong number. You didn't talk about the small stores at all. So can you just update us on how that's going? Thanks.","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I appreciate you humiliated many when you get something wrong. Anyways, on the small stores, I guess, I would just say stepping back, we have, as you know, two small stores that we opened up in small markets of Vernal, Utah and Morganton, North Carolina, both are performing fine.","The most important thing is we're learning a lot about operating a smaller footprint and as we look into the future, a couple of things, I would say. One is that we know that smaller markets, like those markets, there is plenty of them out there and they offer another growth opportunity for us. Having said that, we could do 10,000 square foot stores, maybe even easier, because it's even better representation of the full brand experience. So, we're kind of getting similar experience in small markets. Those stores are doing well.","You'll also see \u2013 the other thing is that, as we look out in the future, we've not yet sized or put any kind of target out there on other opportunities like, say, urban stores or maybe the downtown \u2013 main street parts of, say, suburbs across the country where there smaller parcels of real estate.","So, as we continue to refresh our real estate view in \u2013 we're always doing that \u2013 if we decide to go after smaller stores, we'll have a lot better handle on what that looks like in terms of how we think about season (47:24) spacing assortments, the labor model and supply chain model. So all good learnings and I've seen it showing (47:32) consistently and we like to kind of a walk before we run. So, we're walking and learning and it's going to provide benefits for us in the future.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood. All right. Thanks for the color.","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory group. Please state your question.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon and congratulations. Sorry about that before. Thoughts on the mall stores, how you're thinking about the mall and opening stores in malls? And then, also, with the success of services, how are the margins on services? And is there opportunity there? And just lastly, any thoughts on the timeframe of the accelerated share repurchase? Thank you.","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Three questions in one.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","I know.","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. We have a mic and (48:16) get together run with it (48:18). So, mall stores are a small percentage of what we do today, but we have a fair \u2013 about 10% of our stores. And we are very selective about when we should open up in malls. And we're very \u2013 I think we understand that model well. There are certain markets, where that's an excellent piece of the real estate and we've got a lot of learnings about \u2013 even where inside the mall, how to think about where we're positioned and who are positioned by, where the \u2013 how the doors open, et cetera. So we'll continue \u2013 I don't ever expect that it will become any much bigger than it is, but certainly, we do not reject that, if we feel like it's going to give us the kind of return that we need. So, think about that as a smallish, I guess, opportunity going forward, but part of the mix. Okay, that's malls. Number two?","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Service margins.","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Service margins. What was \u2013 I'm sorry. Go ahead.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Is that \u2013 how do you think about margins on services and the opportunity?","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary","Yeah.","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Oh. Okay. Yeah, I mean, I would say we don't break out the margins specifically across the business, because of the labor involved, the margin on service is typically going to be lower than margin on retail products. That guest though who's coming to use services is going to be spending 2.5 times more than somebody who is not, so \u2013 and buying a lot of retail products, coming frequently. So, in total, it's very incremental in terms of profitability to our business model.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Okay.","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary","And to close out on the ASR, we're very happy to be able to announce that today. Again that would typically will begin as soon as the open window for us occurs, which is early part of next week. In that sizing, we would expect to be able to execute that over a course of 30 days, 45 days, roughly.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a really nice quarter. So, I just wanted to go back to your CapEx spend. We're seeing a lift this year in CapEx and you guys called out some of the reasons with the boutique expansions and additional fixtures, et cetera. I just want to I guess ask how do you think about the returns on investments related to these investments or fixtures, boutiques and even some of the refreshes?","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary","Well, we feel very confident that it's a good way to invest money. We've had experience \u2013 again, Mary mentioned, we crawl, walk, run. I mean that's way we operate here. So, whether it's the new fragrance fixture that we referred to, we already have that installed in a number of stores. We've monitored the results there, both from a sales and margin perspective, but also from a shrink perspective, right, it's always a 360 degree view.","As far as the boutiques are concerned, again, we've had a long history there with a number of these brand partners and we've been able to measure incrementality and halo effect and all those other things, when these are installed in our stores. So, we're very confident that they're going to produce excellent returns for investors over the long-term.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. Congratulations. Just two, I'll make them very quick. The first, Mary, you said that the five-year guidance is all about saving tax (51:25). Thinking about investments, right, we had two big years of investments, this being the second one. Is there any \u2013 how should we think about, I guess, next year, the out year, 2017, should we see the taper-off? And second question, it's one of those quarters, Mary, I think it's fair to ask, what's not going right in the business?","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","What's not going right? Interesting question, Simeon. Here is the thing, we're really focused on the future, and where the world is going in the next, I mean, maybe I'll be so bold to say five years or 10 years. But thinking about what are the innovations and\/or ways to think about the way that \u2013 way to think guest expectation is going to continue to evolve the change about seamless retailing and shopping.","So, it's not a problem, it's a great opportunity for us, because if \u2013 and I talked about this in the script, but I've got a team of people and their teams that think in a very integrated guest-centric way and store associate-centric way. So, we're thinking a lot about how do we think about just continuing to be ahead of the curve as it relates to the competitive environment in the shopping expectations of the future. So \u2013 and there is no one answer to that, I guess. So, it's not like it's anything is broken, it's a matter of where do we point ourselves to the future. And I mean that honestly. I think that \u2013 I'm very, very pleased at how many things are going well. We're not complacent about that. We push ourselves very hard. We are really focused on always improving.","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary","As far as the CapEx and long-term guidance implications are concerned, Simeon, I mean, we're very happy with where we are today. I mean the business is performing very strong. We're probably \u2013 we're a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be at this point in time. The boutiques were in our five-year guidance, I mean they were inherently built in there, but we are pulling them forward. So, there is an acceleration here. We expect \u2013 again those investments, we've demonstrated that they pay great dividends for investors over the long term.","So, the CapEx, specifically for next year, you can expect it to stay elevated. This boutique \u2013 the strategy we have in place with our brand partners is a multi-year rollout. So, we're going to touch as many of our comp stores. And again, that's what that $80 million is basically referring to is our existing store base. So, try to touch as many of those over the next couple years as we can.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks so much, and good afternoon. My first question \u2013 I'm going to ask a couple of follow-ups on topics that have come up. You talked about small stores, you didn't explicitly address store capacity. I think 1,200 stores is the number that you've had out there in the past. You will be at 900 stores at some point in the second quarter, adding 100 stores per year and the productivity looks terrific. There's no signs of saturation whatsoever, based on all those numbers. Any updated thinking on capacity as we think about the size of your outlook here?","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thank you, Matt. No, I'd reiterate what we said, which is that and you just recapped it, 1,200 stores full size, kind of prototypical, we see a very clear line of sight to that. We've also said that, beyond that, the small market opportunity probably represents another couple hundred stores. We are in the process of refreshing our real estate view and we're going to start to take a more specific look at the opportunities beyond that, so urban or downtown, suburban type pieces of real estate. So, I guess, I'd just say stay tuned on that. We'll continue to refresh that view.","But I feel very optimistic about our ability to continue to drive market share growth. So whether it's in terms of square footage or at a comp basis, we have \u2013 if you step way back, we have only 5% share of the spending of the beauty enthusiasts today in the U.S. and it's \u2013 beauty is highly fragmented, you can buy beauty products in thousands and thousands of places across the country, so we know that we've hit a sweet spot with the group that's actually, frankly, really, strong and growing in terms of the beauty enthusiast segment.","So, we're differentiated. They like us. So we're never going to get complacent about building out too much, but we certainly don't want to underestimate the other possibility here. So, I feel good about the targets that we've communicated. If that changes, certainly, we'll refresh that, but we're continuing looking at \u2013 the other thing I'd say is that \u2013 reiterate, new store productivity very strong, cannibalization very low, too low to even be material and it's actually gotten less, which is great.","And I'd like to mention that the real estate opportunities, very strong out there for us. And everything we just talked about as it relates to driving brand awareness of Ulta only helps. Every store that we open now, we've got people who kind of know more about the brand than they did a couple of years ago. So, I think all those factors are very positive for us.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And if I could follow up briefly with Scott on gross margin, you're coming off a massive increase. And I just want to understand a couple of the moving pieces that drive your gross margin outlook, that D&A and write-off piece is that significant, because it just seems like that would ultimately be non-recurring? Also, Dallas versus Greenwood, just in terms of relative impact? And then finally, shouldn't mix, as it did this quarter, help you overcome a lot of those factors?","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary","Yeah. I guess that the one thing I would say right off the bat is we're batting 1.000 here, right? I mean we've had a pretty good run in the last few quarters and you can't always plan for everything to go perfectly every quarter. So, as we look out towards 2016, I mean the combination of the DCs, we feel very confident now. We executed very well in Greenwood. We expect to do as good or better with Dallas coming online next year. Again, I won't break out basis points of headwinds or tailwinds from each one of those, but directionally, we feel very confident that these are going to deliver the kind of benefits that we expected upfront and that we described back in our Investor Day presentations.","I'd mentioned merchandise margins a little earlier here. Again, the core \u2013 the mix of the business is very strong in retail. All these new brands that are coming in were \u2013 we've got generally a very strong terms with our vendors, pulling back on some of the broad discounting things and doing things more directly focused with our customers that are only going to help drive merchandise margins higher in the future. So, net-net, we feel very confident that we're going to deliver, at least, flattish next year and we're hoping that we're going to be able to do better, similar to what we did in 2015.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Please state your question.","Courtney Willson - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Courtney Willson in for Oliver tonight. Thanks for taking our question. We're just wondering, of those 100 new stores expected to open next year, are they weighted towards new or existing markets. And then also, we're just wondering what you're seeing going forward on the promotional front and if the promotional cadence differs at all in the mass versus prestige categories. Thanks.","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary","Yeah. Let me start off with the mix. So, next year, basically new versus existing is getting consistent with kind of where we've been in the last couple of years. It's about 70% existing, 30% new. The one place we are seeing a bit of a change is in the types of centers. So, new centers versus existing centers, so it's still \u2013 the last couple of years, it's been 80\/20 existing, 70\/30 existing. Next year, we see a kind of ticking down a little bit to 60% existing center, versus 40% new. So, that's a great sign. We have new developments coming out of the ground.","David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer","Sure. And on the promotional front, we've talked about some of the gradual changes that we've made and trying to rely less on broad couponing and discounting to more targeted, and leveraging our loyalty program as a source of value for our guests. And we're going to continue to do that. We're not going to make any wild swings in 2016, but we will continue down that path. As far as mass and prestige there, each of those categories are very different in how they promote. But \u2013 so we tend to have more promotions on the mass side, of course. Prestige is not \u2013 that's not tend to be a promoted category. Although, starting on Sunday, Courtney, is our 21 Days of Beauty event, beauty's biggest event. So, it is one of the two times a year, where you can get pretty consistent prestige promotion. So that will be something we'll continue, focused events like that.","Courtney Willson - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Congratulations.","Operator","Our final question comes from Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. Please state your question.","Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Can you hear me okay?","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Dan.","Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Co. LLC","All right. I'll add my congrats once again. Just a couple \u2013 one clarification question back to the gross margin in the quarter versus the year-over-year trend in earlier quarters. Just, it sounds like mix was generally kind of similarly strong. But just given the gross margin, along with comp, was so much better than expected, was there \u2013 what would you call out as \u2013 was it less promotion? Was it \u2013 was the mix better year-over-year than it was in earlier quarters? What were the, I guess, things there? Was it the DC having ramped up? And then, I have just one question about not 2016 but 2017.","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary","Yeah. I guess, the answer to the first part of your question, yes. I mean, it was \u2013 again, it wasn't any one thing, Dan, it was a total team effort in the fourth quarter. Stores, e-commerce team, DCs, merchants, planning, everybody in the corporate support area just really executed at a very, very high level. The merchants picked the winners, the store teams did a great job selling gift cards, e-commerce mix was better than ever, things that we have been telling investors, we're going to improve on, the mix overall was good. Just the improved focus on giving the customer what she wants, right, so, pulling back and being more focused on some of the discounting tactics that we used. And overall \u2013 and the DCs just \u2013 and the work that our teams put in this year, it's not only to get Greenwood open, but to improve the existing buildings was just beyond what we expected. So, it was just really spectacular performance, overall.","Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. And then, as it relates to next year and, I think, you have an extra selling week like a lot of companies in 2017, if I'm not mistaken, a 53rd week. But if you put that aside, are you still thinking that we might even see a little bit of acceleration in earnings growth next year with some of the investments spending, sort of, normalizing or tailing off a little bit?","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary","Yeah. Our 53rd week is actually the following year. It's going to be 2017. So, just to make sure...","Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Co. LLC","Right.","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary","...the system there. Yeah. So for, 2016, now are you referencing acceleration or...","Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Co. LLC","Sorry, I was asking about the year that you have not specifically guided to. I was just thinking most of us model out the year. And I think originally in your plan, you were thinking 2015 and 2016 were going to be flattish margin years and then possibly you starting to increase again beginning in 2017, is that still the way you're thinking about that?","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary","Yeah, that is. It's consistent. I think Mary mentioned earlier, we're not changing our long-term guidance. We feel confident in the trajectory of the business. We think there is a lot of benefits coming out of these supply chain investments that we're making today. So, merchandise mix going up, supply chain efficiency is kicking in in a meaningful way in 2017. We feel very confident that we're on target.","Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Co. LLC","It's very helpful. Thanks again. Best of luck.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to CEO, Mary Dillon, for closing remarks.","Mary N.

Please proceed.","Laurel Lefebvre","Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Ulta Beauty\u2019s first quarter 2018 conference call. Hosting the call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Dave Kimbell, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you of the Company\u2019s Safe Harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Good afternoon, everyone. 2018 is off to a strong start with better than expected sales and earnings growth, reflecting our highly differentiated business model that continues to drive healthy retail same-store sales, excellent new store productivity, and continued outperformance of our e-commerce business. To recap our first quarter financial results, the Ulta Beauty team delivered 17.4% topline growth. Comp sales growth was 8.1% on top of 14.3% comps in the first quarter of 2017.","This performance was driven by balanced transaction and ticket growth, the successful reset of our mass cosmetics assortment and continued strength in skin care, fragrance and prestige boutique brands. Diluted earnings per share of $2.70 grew 31.7%. These results reflect continued market share gains across all major categories as well as steady progress on our strategic imperatives.","I will update you on some of our key accomplishments starting with our loyalty program and brand awareness. At the end of the first quarter, the Ultamate Rewards loyalty program boasted [ph] 28.6 million active members, up 17% year-over-year. The loyalty program continues to grow rapidly as we add benefits and enhance our CRM capabilities to make it even more relevant and personalized, while our store teams remained focused on converting new guests into highly engaged members.","Results from the newer elements of our loyalty program, including the Elite Diamond Tier and our credit card program, continued to exceed our expectations. Our gift card sales increased by 45% in the first quarter, driven by strong sales in all channels, including rapid growth through third-party distribution.","In 2018, we expect continued growth in gift card sales as we add about 15,000 more doors of distributions through our third-party partners. This continues to be an area of emphasis for us because our analysis demonstrates that gift cards are driving significant incremental sales and margin dollars.","During the quarter, our marketing team focused on programs to support the Ulta Beauty collection, Spring Newness, and our signature 21 Days Of Beauty promotion. We leveraged digital partnerships and PR to elevate and position the Ulta Beauty collection as a contemporary and trend-right brand. This included partnering with Cosmopolitan to execute a new first-to-market video series with Cosmo editor, Carly Cardellino and shoppable Facebook posts.","To celebrate Spring Newness, we increased our focus on digital and social with partnerships with Bustle, POPSUGAR, and Refinery29, as well as streaming audio with Spotify and Pandora. For 21 Days Of Beauty, we launched a partnership with Waze, the crowdsourcing navigation app and drove navigations to the store via branded pins and takeovers. We also partnered with Bustle\u2019s Instagram Story Series, driving 1.5 million views. Another innovation was to incorporate influencer tutorials with shoppable content to promote 21 Days Of Beauty Daily Steals through videos and gifs paired with shoppable products.","Overall, our media spend is shifting more into digital, streaming audio and streaming television to align with the beauty enthusiasts' digital-first lifestyle. Now these marketing programs are supporting the high levels of brand awareness we achieved last year. Aided awareness for the first quarter was at 90% compared to 87% a year ago, and unaided awareness rose 7 points to 53% compared to 46% last year. These levels jumped to 92% and 58%, respectively for the month of April in concert with our comprehensive marketing plan around 21 Days Of Beauty.","Now turning to merchandising. I mentioned strength in mass cosmetics, prestige skincare, fragrance and prestige boutique brands, but smaller categories such as suncare and bath, also delivered robust growth. Mass cosmetics after a significant step up in its growth rate in the fourth quarter, accelerated further in the first quarter, reflecting a major reflow of the categories completed earlier in the year.","This reflow highlights several new brands, including direct-to-consumer brands, Morphe and ColourPop, which are available in a retail environment only at Ulta Beauty. We plan to expand Morphe to all doors later this quarter from about half of our stores currently. We have continued opportunity to expand other best-selling brands in additional stores throughout the year.","We continue to drive very strong growth with the prestige boutique brands, which are contributing about a third of our overall comp. We've added 132 of the planned 675 new boutiques featuring MAC, Clinique, Lancome, and Benefit so far this year. The performance of the prestige cosmetics category, excluding those four boutique brands is still a bit mixed with some brands over performing, while others had a more muted growth result.","The top performers include Tarte, which built on success of the Shape Tape Line with a strong foundation launch during the quarter. Est\u00e9e Lauder and NARS, which continue to roll out into additional doors and benefit from guest interest in their classic products and their new launches; and Anastasia, which benefited from significant newness and the highest volume beauty steal during our 21 Days Of Beauty events.","One of the most exciting new brands is Chanel Beaute, which is off to a terrific start in the first few stores. We and the brand are so pleased with the early results that we are now planning to accelerate the number of stores this year compared to our initial expectation. Another addition coming later this quarter to our prestige cosmetics assortment is a new brand called Flesh. This is a color cosmetics brand developed by Linda Wells, Chief Creative Officer of Revlon and Founder and Former Editor-in-Chief of Allure Magazine.","Flesh is Revlon's newest foray into prestige beauty and Ulta Beauty will be the first to exclusively launch this brand. Offering 40 shades of foundation, the brand stands for diversity and inclusivity. In addition to the wide shade range, this new line offers vibrant pops of color that encourage self-expression.","Both fragrance and skincare continued to comp above the house as well. Driving the fragrance business were newness, strength in men's fragrances, and a successful Mother's Day Gift with Purchase campaign. Prestige skincare also benefit from significant newness from Dermalogica, First Aid Beauty and Juice Beauty, as well as stellar growth from Mario Badescu as social media buzz continues to propel that business.","We also continue to enhance our haircare assortment and rolled out Bumble and Bumble chain wide in April and launched Keracolor online and in an 800 doors, which is an innovative color-infusing conditioning cleanser. New brands like Bumble and Bumble, Drybar, and [Squash] combined with high growth brands like Pravana, Joico, and DevaCurl continue to support healthy comps and market share gains in the salon haircare category. Overall, we are encouraged by the opportunities we have with our brand partners to evolve our assortment and continue to add new brands and products to delight our guests.","Now moving on to our Services business. Salon sales increased 10.1% and comped 3.2% driven by average ticket increases. During the quarter, we rolled out our services optimization model to our central region. This initiative is designed to transform our Services business by attracting, growing, and retaining high-quality talent and delivering guest satisfaction better than ever before.","This includes updates to our menu, pricing, career development, and compensation models, as well as additional education and support for our salon teams. We continue to see increases in sales, guest satisfaction, rebooking rates, associate satisfaction, improved hiring and reduced turnover. We plan to introduce the new model to additional regions in August and complete the rollout to the entire chain in 2019.","The salon team also participated this year at America's Beauty Show in April, which is one of the biggest events in the salon industry, and plans to participate in additional industry events to position The Salon at Ulta Beauty, as the beauty destination for service and retail. These events help us attract top talent, great brand awareness, and gain industry credibility.","Also, our salon pro team entered the 2018 North American Hairstyling Awards and secured nine nominations in the finals for multiple hair categories. These prestigious awards celebrate hair artistry and are very meaningful within the stylist community and help us attract top talent to the salon. This demonstrates our continued commitment to leading the industry and trends and motivating and inspiring our 8,000 stylists nationwide.","Turning to skin services, we rolled out our latest skincare service model in 22 stores. This new model called the Skin Bar at Ulta Beauty offers quicker services and it's designed to meet the demands of our guests\u2019 busy lifestyle.","Our licensed skin therapists provide guests with the skin diagnosis and personalized recommendations for a proper at home skincare routine. The Skin Bar also spends a space for skincare brands by up to 12-feet of incremental retail space. So we can continue to evolve our product assortment. We plan to rollout a 180 Skin Bars this year in new and remodeled or refresh stores.","And now moving on to store expansion, we opened up 34 stores in the first quarter and closed one ending the quarter with a 1,107 stores. New store productivity continues to be very healthy, reflecting excellent price selection as well as the more significant presence of prestige brand boutiques in newer stores.","And if you're calculating new store productivity for the quarter, note that we opened six of these 34 stores on the last day of the quarter. Constant older stores remain positive as many mature stores are benefiting from new brands like MAC and Clinique rolling out to refresh stores.","Now to update you on our e-commerce business, Ulta.com sales grew 48%, maintaining strong momentum and representing 10% of total company sales. E-commerce contributed 340 basis points of our total company comp driven by transaction growth. Total site traffic grows 38% while mobile traffic was up 52%.","Better than expected growth came from strong response online to our 21 Days Of Beauty event, continued success of Ulta.com only offers like our weekly Beauty Breaks and programs like Fragrance Crush, spotlighting of favorite fragrance each month, and our newest program, Skin Saturation, which focuses on a key skincare trend each month, such as masks, oils and naturals.","We also continue to see significant growth in e-commerce from brands that are available only online or in limited distribution in stores, as well as from growing use of our store to door initiative that allows customers to purchase items online while shopping in our stores to be delivered to their home.","Recent addition of online only, brands include Storybook Cosmetics Sugarbearhair Vitamins, Men's Lines like Frederick Benjamin and Fatboy, Korean brands including Too Cool For School, TPSY, IPKN, Wish Formula and Touch In Sol, as well as influencer brands like Dominique Cosmetics.","Our store e-commerce IT and supply chain teams are working very closely to launch a test of buy online, pick up in store later this year as we continue to enhance our omni-channel capabilities.","And lastly, we also improved our Glam Lab try-on app to make it easy for guests to filter and sort by brand, color, finish and form factor. This capability helps guests find products to try on and purchase quickly and easily.","And finally, I'll touch on our supply chain operations. Our overall performance of our supply chain operations remains very strong as we continue to leverage recent investments and capabilities that support our growth and enhance the guest experience. While we invested in inventory to support comp growth, maintaining strong end-to-end in-stock levels and supporting brand expansions and new product launches, we were able to capture efficiencies within our network.","Inventory per door was down 3%, reflecting improvements and inventory management from the systems and tools we've implemented recently such as Swift, as well as the clearance event late in the quarter to sell through inventory related to seasonal items or transitioning planograms.","Our newest West Coast distribution in Fresno is on track. We've completed all construction activities and have started to receive inbound shipments. We plan to start shipping outbound to retail stores and e-commerce guests this summer, which will help us achieve our goal of delivering orders in three days or less for more than 95% of our e-commerce sales by year-end.","Last quarter, we mentioned that among the investments, we are accelerating 2018 was the optimization of our supply chain network. This entails among other initiatives, the recently announced closure of our Phoenix Distribution Center next spring. Closing any facility that impacts our valued associates is never an easy decision, but the right thing to do for our business needs and we are proceeding with the closing with great care for our people.","This step is part of our multiyear supply chain evolution as we continue to find ways to increase efficiencies, drive operational improvements, and improve our overall supply chain to better serve our guests and meet the needs of our growing store base as well as the rapid expansion of our e-commerce business.","And with that, I'll turn over to Scott to discuss in more detail the drivers of our first quarter financials and our outlook for the second quarter and the rest of the year.","Scott Settersten","Thank you, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Starting with the income statement, topline growth of 17.4% was driven by 8.1% comp and strong new store productivity. The new revenue recognition accounting added about $14 million of revenue. This represents the impact of income from our credit card program and gift card breakage, moving up to the revenue line as well as e-commerce revenue now being recognized upon shipment versus our previous accounting method whereby revenue was based on delivery of merchandise to the guest. These items are partly offset by the value of points earned in our loyalty program now deducted from sales.","Note that our retail comparable sales number was not impacted by the revenue recognition change. Traffic and ticket for the total company remained strong with a 5.1% gain in transactions and a three percentage increase in average ticket. The retail-only comp of 4.8% was made up of 2.1% traffic and a 2.7% ticket increase. Ticket was driven by average selling price with units flat. Including the salon comp of 3.2%, the combined retail salon comp was 4.7%.","Turning to margins. GAAP gross profit leveraged 10 basis points. The new revenue recognition accounting added about 50 basis points to the gross profit line, so the underlying roughly 40 basis points of deleverage was attributed to a combination of higher mix of e-commerce sales, a higher mix of sales from prestige brand boutiques and mass cosmetics relative to higher margin categories, investments in our salon business, and modest supply chain deleverage as we ramp up Fresno, offset by leverage of rent and occupancy expenses.","Retail-only margin rate was roughly flat year-over-year as we ran one postcard offer this quarter compared to two smaller events last year and we ran a clearance event at the end of the quarter to exit with very clean inventories.","Moving on to SG&A. We deleveraged by 80 basis points of which 70 were due to the new revenue recognition accounting. The remaining 10 basis points of deleverage were attributed to a higher store payroll expense, primarily related to the prestige boutique expansion, offset by corporate overhead and marketing expense leverage. This performance demonstrates solid expense management as well as the result of some planned dollars for investments in growth initiatives that were pushed later in the year.","Operating margin was 13.6% of sales and it was down 70 basis points as expected from last year's Q1 result of 14.3% with 20 basis points coming from the revenue recognition accounting change. The tax rate of 22.1% was lower than the expected 24% effective tax rate due to the impact from income tax accounting for share-based compensation. This contributed about $0.07 to Q1 earnings per share.","Diluted EPS increased 31.7% with about 17 points of growth from the lower tax rate and three points from the lower year-over-year share account as we return value to shareholders through our repurchase program. Excluding $0.07 from the lower than expected tax rate due to the share-based compensation, earnings per share came in about $0.15 higher than the high end of our guidance, about half can be attributed to better than expected sales, both from comparable stores and new stores.","The remainder is a combination of some planned expenses shifting into later quarters and a bit more favorability than usual from a number of smaller line items, such as a modest benefit from insurance recoveries from last year's hurricane related losses.","Moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory grew 8.4%, but was down 3% on a per store basis well below comparable sales growth. With the opening of the new DC in Fresno, we expect to see inventory per door growth step up in the next couple of quarters as we ramp up inventory in the DC before it goes live in August, but we expect per door growth to be well below our comp for the full-year.","Capital expenditures were $74 million for the quarter, driven by our new store opening program, investments in systems, prestige boutiques, merchandise fixtures, and supply chain. We ended the quarter with $469.1 million in cash and short-term investments. We continue to repurchase shares through our 10b5-1 program, buying back 618,551 shares at a cost of $133 million during the first quarter. $529 million remained available on the $625 million authorization as of quarter end.","Turning now to guidance for the second quarter and full-year. For the second quarter of 2018, we expect sales to be in the range of $1.475 billion to $1.488 billion versus $1.29 billion last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 6% to 7% versus 11.7% last year. E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the 40% range.","We plan to open approximately 20 new stores in the second quarter compared to 18 in Q2 of last year. Q2 pre-opening expense is expected to be relatively flat as a rate of sales. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.40 versus a $1.83 last year, and operating margin is planned to deleverage, including about 20 basis points from the new revenue recognition accounting similar to what you saw in the first quarter.","The tax rate for Q2 is expected to be 24%. This does not include any assumptions for the tax rate impact of share-based compensation accounting, which is difficult to forecast. Our fully diluted share count is estimated at 60.7 million. In terms of the full-year, most of the elements are of a full-year guidance remain the same, but we are modestly raising our earnings per share outlook for full-year 2018 to flow through a portion of our better than expected EPS performance in the first quarter.","We plan to open approximately 100 new stores. All are 10,000 square foot prototypes. We will complete 15 remodel and relocation projects. We expect to grow e-commerce approximately 40%. We anticipate topline growth in the low-teens, including the impact of the 53rd week last year.","Total company comps are expected to be in the 6% to 8% range with the retail comp and the mid single-digits. We now expect to grow earnings per share in the low-20s percentage range on a GAAP basis, including the extra week in 2017, up modestly from prior guidance of approximately 20%.","We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $375 million. Depreciation is forecasted at approximately $290 million. We expect to repurchase shares in the 500 million range for the year and the annual tax rate for the remainder of the year is expected to be 24%.","And with that, I'll turn it over to our conference call host for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Rupesh Parikh","Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So Mary, I was hoping to touch on more on some of your comments on the prestige cosmetics category. If you guys look at the balance of the year, just wanted to get your thoughts on what you're seeing from a newness perspective and whether you expect any improvements on the underperforming brands that you called out during the quarter? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Okay. Thank you, Rupesh. I\u2019m going to tag team this with Dave, since he is that much closer to all the exciting things coming. I'll tell you, first of all, I would just say this quarter I think is a good example of the strength of our business model, our team and our business model where we were able to deliver the kind of results that we just described despite the fact that there was a lull in a few key brands within prestige cosmetics, which is a very significant category and a lot of strength across all the other categories that we participate in. So prestige cosmetics is obviously very important to us driving a large \u2013 a large percentage of our business, and so we're very focused on it. So I'll ask Dave to just add some more thoughts on the rest of the year.","David Kimbell","Yes. We were confident about the rest of the year. We really look comprehensively across our portfolio to make sure that we're pushing on all angles. I think there's \u2013 it starts with our biggest brands and some of them have been struggling. Mary mentioned a few that have been really working quite well, Tarte, Anastasia, being a couple of those and we expect those to continue with great newness.","But other brands, as we look at their newness over the rest of the year, we\u2019re confident and excited about some of the products they are bringing in, including some exclusive lines that you'll only find at Ulta and we'll be sharing more details about those as we get later into the year.","We will also be expanding door count on key prestige brands that Mary talked about, our boutique brands, MAC, Lancome, Clinique, but also NARS, Est\u00e9e Lauder and a small increase in the number of doors of Chanel as well. So we'll see that contributing. Exclusive brands do play an important role for us and we're excited about the amount of exclusivity that we'll see over the rest of the year.","We've had a big success with a few brands that we've already talked to you about like Tarte Double Duty Beauty, innovation within that portfolio already this year has had an impact. We expect that to continue throughout the rest of the year. And Mary mentioned a new line that we're launching later this quarter, Flesh, that is exclusive to Ulta.","And then finally, I'd say the -- as we look across the prestige landscape, there's definitely changing dynamics as some of the big brands face new competitors from smaller independent brands and we're having a lot of success with those and rolling those out across our portfolio. We see Dose of Colors being one brand that started small and we're rapidly expanding that. Brands like a Storybook, Beauty by POPSUGAR, Dominique Cosmetics, which is online only right now.","Then also a brand like Morphe, which kind of spans in between kind of mass and prestige from a pricing and engagement standpoint. So we're taking a holistic push across all aspects of the portfolio and are optimistic about the collective impact of those changes throughout the rest of the year.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay, great. Thank you for all the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks so much and good afternoon everybody. My question, I know you want to restrict this to one relates to some of the new mass exclusives that you spoke about introducing and that we've seen in the stores. I guess my question relates to the economics of those ads.","Can you talk about the margin of the mass exclusive products, you talked about Morphe for example, talk about the margin profile of that product versus a prestige and versus your typical mass product and also it's an exclusive, but there\u2019s no boutique cost associated with it as you'd have some of your prestige ads. So what impact as these grow presumably, do you expect them to have in the profitability of the business? Thanks. ","Mary Dillon","Hey, Matt, I'll just say, you're right that an example of like a Morphe doesn't have a boutique associated with it. But we don't break out the margin on any specific brands and really it's kind of a mixture. I mean some -- I think in general, prestige products tend to have somewhat of a higher margin. There\u2019s plenty of exceptions to that as well as some strong \u2013 we feel like we are very focused on the profitability of the total box when we think about brands that we bring at across every category.","So there's going to be a mixture of profitability, but all we think adding to the profitability of the business. So can't give more color than that. But the great thing is that participating, as Dave said across so many aspects of the beauty industry with innovation and newness and exclusivity is really driving great growth for us as well.","Matthew Fassler","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Schick from Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed with your question.","David Schick","Hi. Very quickly. Just wanted to understand the wage outlook we're seeing in certain markets with a little more wage growth. Is there anything changing in your outlook there over the next couple of years?","Mary Dillon","Yes, I would say, I mean we certainly see some wage pressures like everybody does on the coast and larger urban areas, and we would expect it to be sort of a modest headwind going forward. So we're competitive. We've taken some of the investments around from the tax reform to make our benefits and wages a little bit more competitive, but we look at this very closely. We look out, we factor it into our business model and expect that to play out as planned.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question here. Quickly, kind of make sure I understand the gross margin dynamics in the first quarter. I think you said the retail gross margin was flat, but you did have one less sale event in the quarter compared to last year. I just want to make sure that I got that right and maybe, I don't know if you can put any context of how big that impact was?","And then I guess just the dynamics impacting gross margin as we go forward through the year. I think you pointed to e-com and the prestige brand rollouts being headwinds. Are there points on the horizon where the inflection \u2013 there's an inflection in the leverage on those or are those dynamics present as we go forward through the year?","Scott Settersten","Yes. Thanks for the question Michael. Maybe we'll just kind of step back and look at the bigger picture here. So again, there's a lot of things kind of flex and back and forth between the gross profit line in SG&A with the revenue recognition piece there. If I think about operating margin in totality for the year, I mean we guided 50 basis points to 70 basis points down and we feel like we're right on target with what we expect for the full-year.","So Q1, the net 70 basis points down versus last year, I think was a little better than we expected. Again, we had slightly stronger sales trends then we planned and then we had some of the planned expenses that we pointed to in our remarks. That got pushed back further in the year. So again, a slightly better result there than we expected.","As we look out to the rest of the year, I would say you could probably planned for slightly higher deleverage point in the second quarter. Not feeling quite as bullish with the sales in the second quarter. I think 21 Days Of Beauty is our signature event. It was fantastic overall.","So again, we don't have another one of those in the second quarter, although we expect the events to perform as well as we look ahead. We're going to have the Fresno DC continue to ramp up here in the second quarter. So you're going to see a full expense load there, but we don't actually turn it on so to speak until August, which falls into the third quarter. So that'll be a headwind as well. And then we'll see more of these tax savings, ramp up the span of those in the second quarter as the teams become more mobilized.","So I'd say the second quarter is probably the toughest for us. And then as we look at the back half of the year, I would think the deleverage starts to moderate. So that gets us back into that 50 basis points to 70 basis points range for the full-year. Dave spoke to the prestige, newness coming in the back half of the year that we're confident. We will hit well. Fresno impact will moderate as it starts servicing stores. And then of course in the fourth quarter we should get some sales leverage on those expenses as well.","So there's always going to be a mix of things on the gross profit line in and out, quarter-to-quarter. We pointed to the clearance event that we ran opportunistically at the end of the first quarter. That was something that we just looked at and we said we're better off in the long-term to try to move through some of this inventory in a discipline manner.","Michael Binetti","Thanks for the detail.","Scott Settersten","You are welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Forbes","Good afternoon. So you mentioned how some of the prestige cosmetic brands are facing greater competition, so maybe just touch on, on how your relationships with these vendors are evolving, especially as you start to better capitalize on the data from your membership base, right, your Ultamate Rewards membership base, and whether you foresee that translating into kind of a strengthening of that vendor, retailer relationship over time. And then more kind of access to these exclusive lines as you look out to 2019 and 2020. Is it something that we're early on as you think about that cycle evolving?","David Kimbell","Yes. When we take our relationships very seriously, we're proud of the partnerships that we built over years, and I would call them very healthy, and I think strengthening everyday as our business continues to grow and we provide I think a great opportunity for brands to reach new consumers and to grow their business.","So that's something that we work very hard on and you mentioned data and insights and that's something that we feel like we're getting even better at providing and developing insights that both help. Our brand partners understand the dynamics of consumers within our environment, but also help us identify growth opportunities, White Space and new areas to evolve our assortment to make sure we're meeting the evolving needs of our guests.","So insights, data understanding is something that we're working hard on and while we feel like we've accomplished a lot. There's a lot more we think we can be doing in there. As far as access to exclusivity, we've had quite a bit of that. It's an important part. It's not the only part. We have a lot of success with brands that are sold at some of our competitors, but exclusivity is important one because it does drive growth for us, but our customers \u2013 importantly our customers expect that from us. They get excited about it and it's a real motivating reason for them to come in and discover what's new in only at Ulta.","So we've had quite a few of those over the last few years. I mentioned a few, just in my comments a few minutes ago and I would anticipate us getting more of those over time as our environment evolves, our customer account grows and our contribution to brand growth continues to be strong and so we see a plenty more of that coming.","Steven Forbes","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph Altobello","Thanks. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So just want to try to understand, I guess the comp guidance a little bit better, maybe more the comp cadence for this year. Obviously for the full-year, you're still up 6% to 8% despite the outperformance in the first quarter. And I think the expectation coming into this quarter was that this was the toughest quarter of the year for you and that we would see some acceleration throughout the year, because of easier compares, because of merchandising activity, et cetera. So I'm just curious, why are we going to see a deceleration in the second quarter and then an acceleration in the second half and it's something that you guys saw in May that caused you to kind of take a step back for the second quarter?","Mary Dillon","Hey Joe. It's Mary. I\u2019ll give a start here, which is that, I guess first of all I'd say, as you said, we're guiding 6% to 7% quarter. We try to take a prudent view of sales and we have some visibility into the quarter because we are in it. So we just try to really be prudent about what we expect and guide the best we can. We continue to see, of course, the strength that we just described in the first quarter in mass and prestige skin, prestige boutique brands, fragrance, cited by the pipeline of newness.","But that is still somewhat offset by persistent challenges in prestige cosmetics. So I feel \u2013 my stance is let's wait until we see inflection in prestige and some key brands before we start to get more aggressive. You're right that we also have easier comparison in the second half, but we'll get more aggressive if we think that's appropriate.","Joseph Altobello","Okay. So there was nothing in May that caused you to get a little bit more nervous about the comp?","Mary Dillon","No.","Joseph Altobello","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Wissink from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Stephanie Wissink","Thank you. Our question Mary and Scott is regarding the supply chain progression. I think Mary, you mentioned that advances are strong. You\u2019ve seen some improvement in inventory per door, but can you talk a little bit about how we progress towards leverage on the warehouse and logistics network? Once Fresno comes online, is that interest closer to a point of leverage? And then also on the e-com, can you talk a little bit about closing that contribution margin gap over the next couple of years? Thank you.","Scott Settersten","Well, I guess we can start with the supply chain question. So again, I think we've shared with you historically that there's a multi-year roadmap that's been built very sophisticated by our supply chain team. So it\u2019s a multiple pronged driven program. Phoenix being a recent outcome of some of that planning. Fresno helps us to get a lot closer to our end customers in the California market, which is a very important market for us. I mean we expect that business to continue to grow at a higher rate for the foreseeable future. So that's a key element of what we're planning.","There's still a number of what I\u2019d call older legacy facilities that we're running. So we're running two different IT platforms to execute in those buildings. So that's all part and parcel of what we're thinking about the long-term and how we optimize the footprint and the network and all that goes with that over the long-term. So we're nowhere near close being finished with the plan, I guess I would say on that.","And then as far as the e-commerce contribution to the business overall and closing the gap there in profitability. Again, I wanted \u2013 this is a good place to remind folks, right that we've talked about this consistently talked about the geography challenge that we have with our e-commerce business.","It is a headwind. Yes, we know that. We've communicated it clearly. Gross profit rate does get impacted with the e-commerce business in a negative way, but we make up a lot of that on the SG&A line by leveraging some significant investments in technology and people that we've made over the last few years.","So on a net basis it's not that big of a gap between a retail sale in an e-commerce sale. And remind folks that those e-commerce sales are largely incremental sales and margin dollars, right? So it's a good thing for our business and by building Fresno, for example getting closer to the end customer, helps transportation cost, helps the model overall. So we're confident that over time we're going to continue to close the gap there.","Stephanie Wissink","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Oliver Chen","Hi, thank you. Regarding the future in terms of product categories, what are your thoughts on the mix that you'd like to see between cosmetics, skincare and hair as you look to really continue to bill a really four to five diversified model and on the application and on ultimate rewards, I think you've been really creative and personalize with a lot of the promotions and the connectivity with customers. What are your thoughts on the future use of data and how you can continue to innovate in terms of running interesting promotions that makes sense for brand health and are engaging to customers and creative?","Mary Dillon","Hey Oliver, all that sounds like a very good idea. I agree. I mean, it's really we're quite pleased with the ultimate rewards program on many levels, right, the size and scope, the growth, the engagement that our guests have, how much is driving our sales, right. And I feel very good about our team's ability to leverage insights and data to get that much more personalized and relevant and that's kind of what it's all about.","Having said that, we absolutely understand that there's more to be done as it relates to AI capabilities that we're building and investing in and going to continue to make sure that we are as advanced as we can be in terms of being as relevant, personalized, it\u2019s all about how do you drive demand in a way that's as efficient as possible in personalization as what that's all about.","In terms of categories, I guess we always like to kind of see where the customer will take us. So you mentioned cosmetics, skincare, hair, I mean the core categories that we're in today, I believe will always be in, right. The beauty of our model is all things beauty. We are the categories that guests care about and even categories that are I guess smaller like suncare and bath are examples of categories. We're driving innovation and profitability to share growth.","So generally I'd say the midst of sort of master prestige if you want to say that, and I think that continues to evolve in terms of the way that guests look at it. The general mix is probably right and somewhat going to be the same, but the products, the brands and the innovation exclusives underneath that will continue to evolve. So that's how we would envision the model for many years to come.","Oliver Chen","Should you acquire brands? Is that on the table in terms of priorities or is it not necessarily the right priorities relative to the opportunities you have and the Ulta brand itself is interesting in terms of your own private label and what you can do there to make it more emotional and functional.","Mary Dillon","Right, I\u2019ll consider the second or third question. So yes, Ulta Beauty question, really proud about that and you're absolutely right. We continue to elevate everything about that brand and we liked how it's performing. Can we buy brand, sure. I mean there's \u2013 we could, we haven't and I think for us right now the focus is around partnering with innovators, companies large and small that wants to work with us to drive distribution with the brand. So for now that's our focus.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Best regards.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Baker","Hi. Thanks. The increase in gift cards, I presume with the accounting, but even under all the old accounting, you don't necessarily recognize gift card sales, until people come into redeem that. So can the big growth in gift card sales be thought of as a leading indicator for sales that are going to come later in the year as people redeem those gift cards?","David Kimbell","Yes, we see \u2013 we do think that that's going to continue to one grow. Mary talked about just the distribution expansion and yes, when we saw the gift card, we see her come pretty quickly within the next couple of months typically. And the great aspect of our gift card business is not only the redemption of the card value itself, but typically we see her spend more than that in our store. So not only do those sales today translate \u2013 the gift card sales today translate into a future sales, it tends to get her more engaged.","And in many cases it is introducing a new customer to Ulta Beauty dependent on where that gift goes. So a lot of positivity on that. We are really pleased with the performance that we expanded that quite a bit going into holiday and saw strong results coming out of a holiday gift period. But we're seeing that continue and sustain and anticipate that being a positive driver of our topline sales throughout the balance of this year.","Michael Baker","And I guess natural follow-up, part of the same question, is that pick up that you just described included already in your guidance?","Scott Settersten","Yes.","Michael Baker","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Astrachan","Yes. Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to ask just broadly on promotions, it seems like they've just sort of been increasing across the category where historically there just hasn't been as much promotion, particularly perhaps in prestige. I guess curious how you think about levels of promotions going forward relative to the current base. And sort of related to that, if you could comment on just how you think about the transaction component of comp given the modest flow down there is sort of how those two pieces would fit together that would be helpful?","Scott Settersten","Yes. Thanks for the question. So let me start with this one because I want to make sure that we get this on the record. So we're talking about gross profit and operating margin deleverage here for the first quarter operating margins specifically, but I just want to be clear that that's not being driven by product margins, right. So we pointed to retail product margins being roughly flat year-over-year and that's 85% plus of our business, right, so we have to keep that in mind.","Keeping it flat year-over-year in light of what's going on in the department store sector right now and the dynamics in the prestige color business, we consider that a huge win for our enterprise overall. The clearance event we called out, that was one contributing factor, but a very small one in the big scheme of things. And again, it was the best thing to do for the business in the long-term.","We believe that there's probably way too much time and attention being invested in attempting to track the number of promotional offers each quarter and trying to read through that on the impacts of gross profit. I mean, the fact of the matter is we see reports quite often that place a lot of weight on a very limited view into only one element of our overall promotional tool box and that being primarily the 20% off postcard, right.","So you guys, nobody's taking into account all the other promotional things that we do that are part and parcel of our everyday business, things around merchandising discounts and offers, in our circulators and of course the loyalty program, right. That's another part of the discount equation that we use, right, to kind of mitigate some of the thing.","So we're always going into this with a very balanced view. In an important part of what makes Ulta unique in retail is the variety of tools that we have at our disposal and our ability to be very flexible and deploy those in a timely manner and in a very financially disciplined way.","So looking ahead, we've talked about, the long-term view for us is to focus more on loyalty and CRM and making sure that it's more personalized and targeted offers as we look ahead.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Goldsmith","Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. [Teams have] number of retailers from the mass players in the department stores are rethinking and renovating their beauty department. You have a unique app with a number of capabilities such as Glam Lab to the differentiator, how do you think you stand in terms of what the customer's looking for in a customer experience in an omni-channel retailer? Is there anything that you feel you're missing? You called out buy online, pickup in store as a test later in the year? Is there anything else either in store digital?","Mary Dillon","Yes, I would say broadly speaking, there is \u2013 you're absolutely right that the beauty category is a pretty competitive one, right. So in some ways we compete with a lot of players, and other ways, we really \u2013 nobody does what we do. We call this All Things Beauty, All in One Place, our model, it's differentiated, it\u2019s distinct because of the variety of categories and price point. The fact that there is services at our store, right, so brows, skincare, makeup services and really robust e-commerce platform all supported by our loyalty program. And I think increasingly sophisticated use of data and use of social media and digital, our marketing campaigns it really continued to evolve in that way as well.","So we feel that we've got \u2013 we're not perfect and we're not complacent, but a relevant model. And the reason we think it's really relevant, it has lots of relevancy for the future. We focus on a segment of shopper that we call the beauty enthusiasts, and that shopper is a large and growing segment of beauty. And she is really focused on exactly what we offer, which is, a lot of newness and excitement and experiences and like to shop in the way that we serve out the shopping experience.","And that segment of shopper is growing as we look at future demographics and growth around millennial, teenager, Hispanic. So fast growing segment to the population in the U.S. over index as beauty enthusiasts. And so we believe that our model is actually more relevant than ever for them, and our job is to really continue to innovate, think about what the shopping experience needs to look like 10 years from now versus today, right, because that's going to continue to evolve and we feel really good about that.","Michael Goldsmith","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Nancy Hilliker","Hi everyone. This is Nancy on for Ike. Just a quick question, you mentioned you're prioritizing skincare and expanding that by I think 12 feet. Is there something that\u2019s taking the place of? Is that mass? Or is that other prestige items? And then also just a quick question, are there any early learnings from your New York City store that you would share with us?","Mary Dillon","Well, I'll just say the New York City store we're really pleased with that. I'm thrilled that we have the store there, it\u2019s performance nicely, lots of foot traffic in that store anytime of the day or night if you go in there. So we think it was a really smart move for us. The skincare, I'm going to ask Dave to take it. I was referencing in my prepared remarks, a skin express bar that we're putting into a small number of stores next year and that's in those instances where this extra space will free up.","David Kimbell","That\u2019s right. And that space comes from just a new layout of the Skin Bar that does free up more space for product. So your question, what is it replacing? It's really just we are still offering skin services, but it\u2019s a more efficient use of that space and actually we believe in an elevated experience in our store that we are really excited about. And as Mary said, it\u2019s in a limited number of doors today, but we are encouraged by the results of the Skin Bar.","So then that extra space allows us to continue to expand our prestige skincare business. We\u2019ve added a number of brands over the last few years, some big brands like Origin, Shiseido, Proactiv. But also earlier this year, we launched several new smaller brands, House 99 by David Beckham and all those are off to great start. So a mix of both big established brands and new brands to fill that space and we are encouraged and positive about the result so far.","Nancy Hilliker","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. My question is just following upon the competitive environment. On the Bon-Ton liquidation, can you speak to what you\u2019ve noticed thus far for the stores that you have that co-locate with Bon-Ton? And then is there anything baked into your guidance on potential share recapture once these stores close later in the year?","David Kimbell","Yes. We\u2019re certainly watching that closely. We do have trade area overlap with quite a few of the stores that are closing. So we anticipate some opportunity there and we\u2019re actually exploring in a different ways to reach that consumer that maybe looking for a new beauty destination and so we do see some opportunity. What we\u2019ve noticed in other department store closing is, yes, there is some opportunity there, but we\u2019re not anticipating an immediate flood of new customers.","In some cases, store closing has actually changed the dynamics of traffic and so we will adjust that, but we\u2019re reaching out aggressively in those markets to make sure that we\u2019re seeing the best alternative. In some cases, in some markets, we are really the only alternatively for many of these brand. So yes, we do see opportunity. We would say that any upside there would be reflected in our guidance going forward.","Scott Settersten","Part of the business was flat. Yes, that excludes the impact that we see from the mix of the e-commerce part of the business, but does include some of the other shifts that we\u2019re talking about, prestige versus mass versus some of the prestige brand boutique. So again we think we can manage that over the longer-term.","We\u2019ve talked in the past about flattish merchandise margins in the assumption over the long-term in our plans. We\u2019re not expecting to see significant gains there. So we got headwinds that are effect. We've got a lot of [indiscernible] so to speak to try to mitigate a lot of that, its private label kinds of things. It\u2019s continued benefit like we just saw in the first quarter with inventory, performance improvements to help drive leverage there over the long-term. So we think we have a lot of nice tools to help us mitigate some of those challenges that we have.","Erinn Murphy","And when you guided it to merch margins flat that was excluding the e-com business all along or was it including the e-com geography change?","Scott Settersten","It includes it primarily. We\u2019re looking at the business overall. So we\u2019re talking long-term all of that\u2019s baked in to the merch margin, definitely.","Erinn Murphy","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks. Good evening. So two quick ones, the other half of the $0.15 upside that wasn\u2019t driven by the sales beat. Is that relatively balanced between the expense items and the other items that you called out and does most of that expense shift show up in the second quarter?","Scott Settersten","I think it\u2019s a fair statement to say. It\u2019s about 50\/50. So let\u2019s call it that $0.08. We said $0.15 half with sales performance called that $0.07. The other half just to be in the mix of unusual benefits that we saw come through in the first quarter and some deferred spending. So I\u2019d say we\u2019re allocating that 50\/50 is fair.","The timing of that, I mean that\u2019s one place where we\u2019re trying to be purposely vague, so some of the deferred spending is on the innovation and marketing things. And we like the whole that in reserve and use it when necessary, right. So if it\u2019s not we take into the bottom line, but if it is later in the year we\u2019re going to use it as we see best.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. And then just follow-up on the retail product margins, as you look at into the back half of the year, you're going to anniversary some stepped up coupon and promotions and such. Do you still expect that those retail product margins can expand in the back half?","Scott Settersten","Yes, we're not counting on that. I mean, again to Mary's point here earlier, we're just being a little, we're being prudent, which is what we always are and let's see, I mean prestige, the prestige color business is a big piece of the overall pie and it has better margin rates then some of the other categories that we sell. So we want to see some improvement there, some marked improvement before we get any more aggressive with our guidance.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question.","Julie Kim","Hi, this is Julie Kim on for Simeon. Thank you for taking our question. Can you give color on the comp progression you saw in the quarter and if momentum has continued into Q2, also if you saw any impact from weather or the calendar shift in the quarter? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","I would say really no impacts from weather and minimal impact on calendars shifts and the cadence was \u2013 as you saw we had a balanced ticket traffic or transaction in tickets results for the quarter. We certainly see some increased movement around things like 21 Days Of Beauty and other events like that. So pretty balanced I guess I'd say throughout the quarter and consistent coming into this quarter as well.","Scott Settersten","We don't normally share anything about the current quarter that we're in.","Mary Dillon","Yes.","Scott Settersten","Won\u2019t be able to provide any more detail on that.","Julie Kim","And if I could just follow-up on anything we should keep in mind looking for the rest of the year in terms of the calendar shift apart from Q4, of course?","Scott Settersten","No, I guess we could clarify for folks, right? We're comparing weeks one through 52, last year, right with one to 52 this year. So the 53-week is kind of out of the equation, so just to be clear on that part of it. So again for us there's nothing really \u2013 the way our events roll and the holiday's roll into our calendar. There's nothing significant to be aware off.","Julie Kim","Okay, great. Thank you.","End of Q&A","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mary Dillon for closing remarks.","Mary Dillon","Thank you. And I just want to close by thanking our 37,000 associates.

I'll now turn it over to Mary.","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report excellent second quarter results for ULTA Beauty, with strong sales momentum and better than expected earnings growth.","To recap the headlines, sales grew 19.4% and we achieved a 10.1% total company comp on top of a 9.6% comp in the second quarter of 2014. Transaction growth accounted for about two-thirds of our comp, with average ticket growth contributing about a third.","We continued to gain market share across all of our categories, with both Prestige and Mass Color Cosmetics achieving the strongest growth. Each of our businesses contributed healthy comp sales: an 8.8% comp in Retail, a 10.1% comp in Salon, and 43.4% growth in e-commerce. Earnings per share increased 22% to $1.15 compared to $0.94 in the second quarter of last year.","Scott will share the details of our second quarter results in a few minutes, but first I'd like to provide our quarterly business update through the lens of our six strategic imperatives, the framework we're using to drive sustainable sales and earnings growth and long-term shareholder value. The first imperative is to acquire new guests and deepen loyalty with existing guests.","Our loyalty team is driving great performance through the critical Ultamate Rewards platform, which drives well over 80% of our sales. We now have 16.1 million active members, up 18% over the prior 12-month period. Our store associates are doing a fantastic job converting guests to loyalty members, and they achieved a significant increase in conversion leading to an acceleration in new member growth. Member retention rate increased, and we continue to see higher frequency of purchases, higher average ticket and higher average sales per member.","As part of our efforts to increase awareness of and clarity about the ULTA Beauty brand, we've relaunched our brand communications across all touch points to create an integrated message and consistent visual look and feel that positions ULTA Beauty as delivering the fun side of beauty. We believe this work sharpens and differentiates ULTA Beauty in the marketplace, and shapes our brand equity through a coordinated approach across all of our marketing vehicles, including advertising, e-mails, Ultamate Rewards materials, website and mobile apps, digital ads, store signage, social media and customer magazines.","Based on our successful 2014 test market, our plan is to include national television advertising to support our upcoming 21 Days of Beauty next month as well as again for the important holiday season. This national television advertising campaign marks the first in ULTA Beauty's history, an important step towards driving a strong and sustainable brand position while increasing awareness among beauty enthusiasts and driving new guest acquisitions.","The second strategic imperative is to differentiate by delivering a distinctive and personalized guest experience across all channels. We continue to make progress here with in-store technology, associate training, and evolving the labor model to increase guest-facing time. And we've also had some nice wins enhancing personalization through our marketing tools. Let me give you a few examples.","As we continue to improve our ability to personalize our e-mails and make them more relevant to our guests, we're seeing very positive results. By leveraging insights about customer preferences and behaviors, we're able to tailor our communication to be more targeted and more motivating to our guests. During the second quarter, sales per e-mail delivered increased significantly year-over- as a result of this approach.","We launched personalized display ads in the second quarter to better target ads that are relevant to customer attributes and shopping behavior, moving away from predominantly static ad formats towards more dynamic ad formats. In addition, we're leveraging offline and online customer insights to make our online advertising more effective.","Now turning to Ultamate Rewards loyalty program, we continue to reward our best guests with a differentiated experience, driving increased engagement and satisfaction. In the second quarter, our Platinum members, our guests who spend more than $400 with ULTA Beauty during the year, received many perks including Platinum-only beauty steals, Platinum bonus points offers, early access to new products, a Platinum social contest, free shipping offers and targeted surprise and delight gifts.","Now moving to the third strategic imperative which is to offer relevant, innovative and often exclusive products that excite our guests. News and innovation was strong in the second quarter, and Prestige color cosmetics remained our best comping category. Sales growth was driven by newness across the board, including innovative foundations from Too Faced and Smashbox, Urban Decay's matte lipsticks and the excited Naked Smoky Palette as well as continued rapid growth in IT Cosmetics and IT Brushes for ULTA.","The contouring trend is still going strong, and the newer trend for strobing, or highlighting, drove comps in contouring kits and highlighters with newness from Anastasia, Lorac, Laura Geller and Tarte among the best performers.","We continue to roll out Clinique, Lanc\u00f4me and Benefit boutiques, and all these brands executed very strong product launches such as Benefit's Roller Lash mascara, Clinique's Pop Lip Colour + Primer and Lanc\u00f4me's Cushion Compact foundation. In addition, we're planning on expanding our Lanc\u00f4me presence by launching five of their best-selling items into every store, not just those with Lanc\u00f4me boutiques, starting next week. This full chain expansion is a further demonstration that our business model is successfully driving incremental growth for key brand partners.","Mass cosmetics continues to grow as well, performing well above industry growth rates. NYX, Maybelline and L'Or\u00e9al were growth standouts driven by newness and innovation. We also introduced two popular Indie Brands from the U.K., Makeup Revolution and Catrice, into our Mass cosmetics assortments on Ulta.com and in a limited number of stores.","The Mass category was also helped by solid growth in private label. We reset the ULTA Beauty collection in more than 300 stores at the end of the quarter with enhanced presentation as well as new formulations. The wall presentation is updated with color shelf strips and textured tile graphics, making it easier to shop as well as more efficient for our associates to stock the fixtures. We also introduced a fresh series of ULTA Beauty Kits offering great value and products that leverage current trends, including contouring, primers and brows.","The haircare category was also a big focus for us in the second quarter. We kicked off the quarter with our Love Your Hair Event in May, featuring Daily Beauty Steals, in-store events and live chats. July was headlined by our leader event featuring great deals on jumbo sizes of hair care products across all categories and brands. We also executed an extensive reflow of our Pro Hair planogram at the end of the first quarter, which refreshed our assortment and introduced clear, solutions-based signage to improve the guest experience. We believe this helped to set the stage for the most successful leader events in our history.","Our merchants, inventory and store operations teams work closely together to ensure strong execution and in-stock levels throughout the event. And this drove significant acceleration in the growth of core brands like Redken. This is a great example of how we can optimize growth on existing brands through a combination of guest insights, brand partnering and strong internal collaboration.","Other second quarter brand launches included several fragrance introductions, Sam Villa hair care appliances and Pacifica skin care products.","Next, our fourth strategic imperative, which is to deliver exceptional services in three core areas: hair, skin health and brows. Our Salon business continued to grow nicely, achieving total sales growth of 19.7% and comp growth of 10.1% as we continued to improve our offerings and sharpen our messages to our guests.","Top growth categories were haircuts and color, blow outs and make up services. Our comp was driven by about two-thirds guest comp growth and about a third by average ticket. Particular strength in new guest acquisition was driven by online bookings and CRM campaigns with targeted offers for first-time guests. We continue to attract new guests by offering services like blow outs and quick skin services. Promotions included offers to get the perfect blow out, special events featuring Living Proof's Perfect Hair Day products, and 25% off our 20-minute Dermalogica microderm skin treatments for first-time salon guests, all very successful.","During the second quarter we also trained all of our salon associates on the new fall and winter trends which were developed in partnership with Redken and renowned stylist Rodney Cutler, and supported by high quality training materials which integrate new styles for haircuts and colors with makeup trends for the very first time. This included product recommendations and technical instructions for how to get the various styles. And I'm sure you might be wondering what some of those might be. So a couple of examples: tortoise-shell hair with a suede eye and a rose blonde look with a petrol eye. Now these enhanced training sessions were very well received by our salon associates. We're now presenting these looks and trends in our integrated marketing plans across all associate and guest touch points.","Turning to our fifth strategic imperative: to grow stores and e-commerce to reach and serve more guests. We opened 20 stores during the quarter, ending the second quarter with 817 stores. New store productivity continues to be very strong for the class of 2015 new stores, which are comfortably exceeding their sales plan. We remain on track to open approximately 100 net new stores this year with plans to open 44 stores in the third quarter and about 15 stores in the fourth quarter. The real estate pipeline for 2016 looks very good as well, and we've already approved a significant number of sites for next year's store growth plan. The two 5,000-square-foot rural stores, which we opened last fall, continue to perform very well. We're encouraged by the results, and we're still gaining insights on operating a smaller box efficiently.","We intend to open more of these small stores when we have the systems in place to make this format more scalable. Meanwhile, we've opened several stores in smaller than average markets with our 10,000-square-foot format that are exceeding expectations like our new store in Pikeville, Kentucky. So we're very confident that rural markets represent a significant and incremental opportunity for our store-opening program. Insights from operating smaller format stores will also benefit us as we look ahead to urban and other market opportunities.","On the e-commerce side, Ulta.com continues its rapid growth with sales up 43.4%, contributing 120 basis points of the total company comp of 10.1%. The Ulta.com and loyalty teams continue to see excellent results from implementing more targeted digital marketing strategies to drive traffic to the site and guests insights to drive trial offers and incremental purchases. Sampling is a key driver of growth at Ulta.com. Along with our brand partners, we've had strong success with our signature online offers, such as our monthly beauty bags with deluxe size samples and limited-time beauty steals that drive awareness in trial. Our beauty-enthusiast guests love these offers, and brand partners also enjoy working with us through our CRM platform to get their samples to the right targeted segments of our customer base. We continue to explore other areas to drive trial and discovery as well.","The website has been re-branded to incorporate the new elements of the brand, personality and color palette, and guests have responded very positively to these changes to the online experience. We also continue to benefit from new brands that we've added to our website, including Lanc\u00f4me, Redken, Matrix, Pureology and It's a 10.","And finally, we have much to report on our sixth strategic imperative, to invest in infrastructure to support our guest experience and growth, and capture scale efficiencies. We celebrated the grand opening of our Greenwood, Indiana distribution center on August 3, and we started to fulfill a small number of stores and e-commerce orders. We launched with six stores, and we're now gradually ramping up this facility, which is operating on a completely different model from our existing DCs and includes all-new systems and material handling equipment.","While it's still early, we're delighted that the DC is off to a smooth start, the culmination of two years of hard work and collaboration across supply chain, IT, stores and the e-commerce teams. Now this DC will ultimately ramp to service 400 stores and 45,000 e-commerce orders when it reaches its full capacity over the next few years.","In addition to a more efficient operating model within the distribution centers, our stores will receive fewer, fuller and more stable cartons. Shipments will feature greater categorization, which makes it easier for our store associates to get product from carton to shelf, freeing up labor hours for customer-facing activities rather than tasking.","So we're also implementing a number of core merchandising systems and tools to drive productivity as part of the overall supply chain initiative. For example, this fall we'll launch a product information management system that integrates vendor information into ULTA Beauty systems and aligns product information across all channels to improve data governance.","We also plan to roll out a vendor scorecard to collaborate with our brand partners to drive improvements in performance, such as improved inbound lead time consistency leading to better in-stock levels and an improved guest experience.","We'll also start to roll out our demand forecasting and inventory optimization tool, which provides forecasting and replenishment models to improve supply chain capabilities. This tool will help us drive higher sales and less clearance and improve vendor fill rates as well as lead to better in-store presentation and higher in-stock levels. We plan to launch one category this fall then roll-out the system to all categories next year.","And finally, we're on track to open up our fifth distribution center in Dallas next summer, and all the merchandising systems and tools that we're in the process of implementing will work together to support our growth plans and improve the guest and associate experience. In the aggregate these new distribution centers, projects and systems are expected to drive significant long-term efficiencies to optimize our supply chain for product source to guests, and help us deliver the financial results we've committed to in our five-year plan.","That wraps up my update on the strategic imperatives, and now I'll hand it over to Scott.","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter sales were $877 million compared to $734 million last year, an increase of 19.4%. Comparable sales increased 10.1%. The retail comp was 8.8%, the salon-only comp was 10.1% and ecommerce growth was 43.4%. The total company comp was driven primarily by traffic strength, with transactions up 7% and ticket up 3.1%. Similar to the trend we've seen for the past few quarters, ticket was driven by higher average selling price as a result of strong sales in Prestige categories and less reliance on broad discounting. Retail-only comparable transactions were very healthy, up 6.3%, even stronger than what we achieved in the first quarter.","Ecommerce growth was driven primarily by traffic, but average ticket also increased. Gross profit dollars were up 18.2% to $306.5 million, but gross profit margin deleveraged 40 basis points to 34.9% from 35.3% last year. Gross profit benefited from improvement in product margins due to higher mix of Prestige products, offering a more complete assortment on Ulta.com, and less discounting overall. These benefits, however, were offset by planned supply chain investments including the startup of our new distribution center in Greenwood, Indiana.","SG&A expense increased 16.6% to $183.9 million, down 50 basis points as a percentage of sales to 21% versus 21.5% last year. The key driver of this improvement was marketing expense leverage, partly due to stronger-than-expected sales, but also as a result of concentrating more of our marketing expense later in the year. We still plan to keep marketing as a percentage of sales flat for the full year, since we will be ramping up our marketing spend in the second half to drive brand awareness through national television and radio campaign.","Pre-opening expense was $4.1 million compared to $3.6 million last year, driven by 20 store openings, one relocation and two remodels during the quarter compared to 19 new stores opened and four remodels completed during Q2 2014. Operating income increased 20.9% to $118.5 million. Operating margin was up 20 basis points versus last year to 13.5%.","Our tax rate was 37.5% versus 38.1% last year, driven primarily by the impact of accounting for equity compensation transactions. Net income increased 22% to $74.2 million or $1.15 per diluted share versus $60.8 million or $0.94 per diluted share last year.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, inventories were $705.7 million at the end of the quarter compared to $541.5 million at the end of Q2 2014, up 14% on a per-store basis. Excluding the investment in inventory to stock the new DC in Greenwood, inventory per door was up 10.9%, roughly in line with our comp growth. This increase was related to maintaining strong in-stock levels for our fastest-turning SKUs to support our rapid sales growth, the addition of new brands and the rollout of Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me boutiques.","Capital expenditures were $80.6 million for the quarter, driven by our new store opening program, merchandise fixtures and supply chain and system investments. We are on track to spend about $300 million in CapEx this year.","Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter were $39 million, and are expected to be about $170 million for the full year. We ended Q2 with $475 million of cash and short-term investments.","The company repurchased approximately 291,000 shares at a cost of $46 million during the quarter under our 10b5-1 plan as part of our program to return cash to shareholders. As of the end of the quarter $286 million remained available under the $400 million share repurchase program. We expect to continue to offset dilution with our 10b5-1 plan and still have the flexibility to repurchase opportunistically beyond that.","Turning now to guidance for 2015, in terms of our outlook for the full year, based on our strong performance in the first half, we are raising our sales and earnings expectations for the year. We expect to open approximately 100 stores in 2015 and remodel four stores. We plan to grow e-commerce sales in the 40% range. We expect to drive comparable sales in the 8% to 10% range. We expect to deliver earnings per share growth in the high-teens, from the $3.96 of adjusted EPS we delivered in 2014, which excludes the $0.02 non-recurring tax benefit in Q4 of last year. This guidance includes planned supply chain and systems investments, and assumes we continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution.","We expect to de-leverage on the gross profit line and modest leverage on the SG&A line, and operating margin is expected to be about flat. As a reminder, much of the investment related to our supply chain project will hit gross profit, including higher depreciation expense, which you'll really begin to see in the third quarter. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 38%. We expect to spend capital on a $300 million range and to generate free cash flow similar to last year's performance. We're very pleased to raise our annual comp guidance and earnings outlook to deliver high teens earnings growth while making significant investments in the business to drive sustainable, long-term market share gains and shareholder value.","Moving on to specific guidance for the third quarter; we expect sales to be in the range of $869 million to $883 million compared to $745.7 million last year. We anticipate achieving comparable sales in the range of 8% to 10% versus 9.5% last year. We expect to open 44 stores in the third quarter versus 50 stores opened in Q3 last year, so pre-opening expense should expected to be down slightly. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1 to $1.05 versus $0.91 for Q3 last year. We anticipate a tax rate of 36.9% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 64.2 million. And with that, I'll turn the call over to our conference call host to begin the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. First question comes from the line of Stephanie Wissink from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I have two questions for you. Mary, if you could just start with some of the new brand initiatives. We've seen some of the roll-outs in stores as well as some of your digital communication. Can you talk about some successes there and how you're thinking about strategically deploying those across some new initiatives for the back half? And then just a question on the DC; could you remind us, once that DC is fully up and running, what the total store capacity will be of your existing infrastructure and when you may need to invest again to support the next roll-out of some of the smaller format stores? Thank you.","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, let me just say that the newness that you asked about, I think it's really \u2013 we constantly know that our guests are interested in news and innovation. And as I mentioned, there's several things that were quite successful in the quarter. So brands like Benefit and Urban Decay with a smoky palette, brands like Anastasia, across all categories, Redken Frizz Dismiss, Mix is a hot brand. So there was really a lot of newness as well as existing brand newness, new brands and just core brand growth. And how that works in terms of our platforms in terms of marketing is that's really where we bring it all together is just making sure that our guests get to understand what we have that's new and exciting. I think our marketing tactics are breaking through the herd in even better ways all the time. So that's going to be a core part of what we do, and I think we're getting better at it all the time, more efficient and more effective.","In terms of distribution centers, so, this new DC will serve the 400 stores, 45,000 ecommerce orders. We're planning another distribution center that's in development, in construction right now in Dallas that will open next year. And that will be sufficient for the capacity that we need for some period of time. We'll continue to evaluate that. Whether it's small or large stores, we would anticipate that to be covered in the network that we're defining. But certainly that's fluid as we continue to grow and look out to the future; we'll continue to evolve that strategy and our needs.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you. Best of luck.","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your questions.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Congratulations on really spectacular growth here. Regarding the holiday plans and inventory optimization, which categories are most ripe for that process and will that impact holiday? And some retailers are potentially, in different categories are potentially over-inventoried in the marketplace, so how should we think about the main catalyst for you in holiday at large and what might be most different on a year-over-year basis?","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thank you, Oliver. I'd say broadly speaking of course holiday we've been focused on for months. We're excited about it. It's clearly something that is important to us and to our guests as well. I guess what I would say is that we just try to be clear about making sure that we've got adequate inventory for what we expect to be our top volume items. And we think we're in good position to do that. So I would say that that we look at that as a core part of how we do business. Given our growth trends, and I think our ability to really understand what's going to move, we don't have big concerns about things that don't work during holiday, I think historically we've been able to manage that really well and have a low amount of products that don't work well. But, so I think we're in good shape there. Is there anything you'd want to add to that, Scott?","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer","No, I would just add that really we don't have any concerns about our inventory position. Again, very little in the way of seasonality and what we carry in our stores. I think we probably have one of the best-in-class in retail as far as the ability to work through discontinued product or clearance things and partnering with our brand vendors to do that in the most profitable way possible.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the mobile front, is there any \u2013 where are you in the innings of like innovation there, and what are the next chapters for us to look forward to as this customer seems really engaged on the mobile frontier as well?","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I'll let Dave take that.","David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer","Yeah, that's great, Oliver. Yeah, mobile obviously is continuing to grow for us and for \u2013 it's increasingly the way consumers want to engage with brands and shop. For us in the second quarter, about 60% of our traffic came through our mobile applications, mobile website, and about 25% of our sales. So it's, we're well past the early innings on the impact that it's having in the marketplace, and we're continuing to optimize the experience in our total digital footprint, which mobile is a critical one. We're improving our app pretty significantly and trying to make that shopping experience easier when she's on our mobile website. All of the changes that we're making around trying to increase conversion and increase average order, that we're doing both on the desktop service as well as mobile are having an impact.","So we're trying to sharpen how the offers that we're highlighting, the way we can personalize e-mails that then drive her to the mobile website. So a lot that we're doing we think it will increase, continue to increase. It's clearly the way that she wants to shop and it's a big area of focus for us going forward.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Best regards.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin from William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.","Good afternoon. I'll echo the terrific results. Just a little more color, if I could. In a general trend within retail and omni-channel, retailers obviously, e-commerce sales and sometimes coming at the expense of the in-store business; clearly that does not seem to be happening with you guys seeing actually an uptick. Just curious what you feel like \u2013 you talked about marketing. Are there any, a couple of things that you feel like are incrementally resonating even a little bit more with the consumer? And then lastly, I'll just editorialize I'm assuming that the Donald Trump look is not one of the fall and winter looks that you guys are considering?","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We took that one off the table. That's funny. On the e-commerce omni-channel, let me just start broadly and then maybe I'll ask Dave to add some specifics. But I think a couple of things. One is that we're clear that for us, two things, one is that the multi-channel shopper is our best shopper. She's driving a lot. It's really a pretty incremental business for us. And the core insight is that the experience to go shop for beauty is one that largely women want to have happen in the physical bricks and mortar space. In our play, what we're trying to do is make the store experience just so inviting with the right products and the right level of service across the board, and we think that's working for us and is very sustainable.","She likes to come and explore and to try and to spend time there with services as well. Obviously, that's something you can't get done online. So for us, we see that as the core part of our business; e-commerce is working in a way that kind of neat because it's incremental. So the shoppers that we have that are shopping both online and in store are by far our best shoppers. They're, for example, maybe coming nine times a year versus store-only, which is like four times a year. That's only a small percentage of our guests that are actually doing that, so we like that. We think growth in e-commerce, obviously, is going to be incremental and profitable for us and fits with the consumer insight and the model that we're building.","David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer","I'll just to add to that, certainly, we look at total omni-channel customers, the one that we're most focused on continuing to grow. And so most of the marketing efforts that we're doing are driving both online and in-store activity. So that Mary mentioned some of the advertising programs in the second quarter, a fair amount of radio advertising, enhanced digital advertising, both of which through our analysis drives both in-store and online activities. Certainly, within the digital space itself, our social media activity has increased quite a bit. Our PR is much stronger. We're doing more with social influencers to drive greater engagement. And then, as we roll, as Mary mentioned, roll into the third quarter beyond into other tactics that we historically haven't used like TV. We think all of those will contribute to driving a more loyal guest. She is very attracted to our loyalty program. And that behavior then gets her shopping in both channels, and that's the behavior that we want to continue to drive. And we've had some success doing that so far.","Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.","That's great. Thanks. Best of luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from Nomura. Please proceed with your question.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon and congrats. Sorry if I missed it, within the traffic increase, can you share the breakdown between new customers versus increased frequency of existing shoppers? And then maybe can you talk about where you're still sourcing those customers from? And then just, Scott, given the moving pieces, can you help with the magnitude of the gross margin impacts over the next several quarters? Thanks.","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I guess I'll start. We don't really break out new customers versus existing. I mean we bifurcate the top; we talked about the fact that the majority of the comp, two-thirds of it was transaction or traffic based with the remainder being average ticket, and that was primarily driven by average selling price. So units were relatively flat year-over-year, more Prestige again, less promotion, which is driving the basket increase overall.","David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer","I'd say we are excited; we're really pleased with both, though, our new traffic, our new guest acquisition rate. Mary in her comments mentioned that our membership grew to 16 million guests or about 18%, and that was driven by healthy increases in new guests as well as strong retention, increase in retention of the existing guests. So we feel like we're both attracting new and then keeping even more of our existing guests engaged in our proposition.","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer","And a little color specific to 2Q as far as margin goes, we're very happy to see core product margins in our retail business, which again is more than 90% of our total sales, continue to expand. Prestige mix helped, less promotion overall helped. We did have a little bit of headwind; we didn't have as much fixed store leverage in the second quarter is what we saw earlier in the year or what we saw in a year-ago period. We also had a litany of other smaller items that affected the quarter; again we normally don't get into this level of detail, but salon for example, we mentioned in the script, Mary did, about some training for our salon associates for the fall trend look. We pulled forward some expenses there, so that was a bit more of a headwind than what we expected. And we also had the startup of the DC, which negatively affected gross profit in the quarter.","Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot. Best of luck for the rest of the year.","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Erica A. Eiler - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon. This is Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Congrats on the really \u2013 another nice quarter. So I just want to get back to e-commerce here, I mean it sounds like you've clearly done a lot to enhance the customer experience online. I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing from consumer purchases online, specifically maybe what the Mass\/Prestige mix of products looks like online versus in stores? And then also just wondering if perhaps consumers are buying more staple-like products, maybe their foundations or go-to mascaras versus maybe shaded goods or skincare products that consumers may want to experiment with in stores? That would be great. Thanks.","David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer","Yeah. Great questions. Again we're very pleased with our overall e-commerce success, and we see a lot of runway going forward. Specifically, some of the questions, we don't really break down between categories, but what I would \u2013 your question about Mass versus Prestige what I would say is that the \u2013 a key part of our total proposition, e-commerce, anywhere, in our brick-and-mortar and e-commerce stores is All Things Beauty, All in One Place, the breadth of assortment, the breadth of price points, the breadth of categories, that certainly is what drives our business and differentiates us and we see that within the e-commerce space.","So largely I'd say the assortment and the engagement that we have in our brick-and-mortar stores is largely reflected on e-commerce. There were some categories in e-commerce that we've talked about in the past that we didn't have as full an assortment, but much of that gap has been closed, largely in our professional hair care. So we see that really reflecting what we see in the in-store environment.","For staples versus trying new things, I'd say it's a bit of both. We certainly don't see only staple or replenishment-type items being bought online. That is happening, but what we find, particularly with those guests that are, that we talked about that are omni-channel guests that are really our best guests, she's shopping more frequently in total across both our retail stores and our e-commerce site and she's buying items that, yes, she can \u2013 maybe that are replenishment, but she's also indulging in things that she hasn't tried that are new items. She wants to get a purse; she wants to go online right when new offers are up and available. So she's doing a bit of both, and that's absolutely the types of things that we're encouraging. We'll find it, make it easier for her going forward to replenish those favorite items, but also continue to highlight news and exclusive and first-to-market items that get her excited when they come out.","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, and I'll just add, and I mentioned this in the script, our CRM capability gives us the ability to really get \u2013 to experiment a lot with how to get more personalized and more customized on what we e-mail, to whom, and really allow her to try things whether it's Beauty Breaks or just e-mail that introduce her to new products. So it's really a nice way for our guests to learn about new products and try new categories that they wouldn't have before.","Erica A. Eiler - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. That's really helpful. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Nice results. Mary, you mentioned evolving labor model in your prepared remarks. Can you update us on your thoughts there? I think at Analyst Day, you suggested you might experiment in some areas in the labor model. And then connected to it, you're being very successful with CRM and marketing. Curious in places where you're testing increased labor if you're seeing a benefit above and beyond some of the success you're seeing with CRM and targeting?","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Simeon. Just stepping back, let me just kind of big picture-wise I guess what I would say is that as we think about it, Kecia Steelman, who's our Head of Store Operations and her leadership team, we've got a very experienced set of store operators, and we're really focused on continuous improvement and excellence in operations and guest service kind of across the board. So while the payroll test is kind of a piece of it, just to give you a broader perspective, I mean, we're really kind of thinking about how do you put the guests and the associates serving the guests in the center of kind of everything we do, and really a holistic approach to \u2013 improvements, whether it's people, processes or tools. So that's everything from identifying the right talent, training and development, store processes, best use of labor hours as we kind of talked about there, all to kind of just really improve that guest experience.","So the payroll test is just a part of it. We're learning things. We've extended it to another 60 stores. We've gotten some specific learnings, things that we're trying that are differently. I don't want to get more specific on it than that because we're still learning, but certainly, we're measuring impact on sales and units per transaction and whatnot. It's kind of a combination of art and science. It'll be core to just what we do all the time. So there's no big kind of aha in one specific thing coming out of it, but think about it as just a piece of a broader focus on how do we get better every day, and what we do in store to serve our guests.","Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Thanks for taking my question. My first one is on the inventory. When we look at that 30% inventory growth you had, I think you said 16% of that was related to getting a DC in stock, and I assume some of that would be safety stocks. I wonder what the, of that 16%, how much is in stock versus safety stock? And does that normalize over the year, or do we really need to get past the DC that opens in 2016 to see those growth rates drop? And the second one is on advertising. With the testing you were doing last year, I know you were happy with those tests, and you expressed how good they were in the test-market stratagem. So my question is as you didn't do as much advertising in the second quarter, did those markets where you did the tests in continue to outperform the rest of the company or the company average?","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I'll start with that. I'm not, I wouldn't want to comment about kind of all the specific learnings. Clearly, we feel good about what we've learned, and it's been, we've been I guess modifying our marketing mix for some period of time, with Dave's leadership and his team. So what I'm excited about is that our marketing is getting more efficient and effective every day. And that's really critical for us through the long term to drive short-term results and to create a long-term, strong brand and brand equity. So that like, I'd say in the last quarter, seeing we added radio advertising. We did a lot of PR. We did a lot of digital. We also continued tactics that we've always done like tabs and magazines. All of those are getting more effective and efficient with less reliance on discounting.","In addition now, as I mentioned, next, this really starting next month, we're going to layer in national television advertising. We learned from the in-store tests that that was going to be effective for us, and so we're going to add that to the mix. So just I guess I feel confident in saying that we got a lot of good learnings out of the tests, and now we're moving forward, implementing all those learnings as we go. But again, it's art and science. So this won't \u2013 there's never actually one answer and it's never any one stopping point, right. We'll continue to evolve as we go.","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer","And with respect to the inventory, it was roughly $20 million at the end of the quarter which I'd say is all safety stock because we weren't servicing any stores out of that DC at that point in time, right. We started subsequent to quarter-end, so I would say we expect that to be kind of the high watermark on a per door basis for fiscal 2015. We expect to see some moderation now the second half of the year, and should stay roughly in that zone as we cycle through next year with another DC stacked on top. So once we get through 2016, again with all of the systems we're putting in place: the DC, forecasting, replenishment, other floor planning kinds of tools; we expect all of those to help contribute to improved inventory flows and improved turns.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good evening. So wanted to follow up on the gross margin question; how significant was the DC start-up costs and the 50 bps? And would you consider it one-time? And then on a related note, can you provide some color on the magnitude of the marketing shift out of 2Q? And whether those dollars spread roughly equally in the back half?","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I guess with respect to the gross margin, I'm not going to quantify the basis points here. We try to steer away from specific P&L line guidance. But it's going to be much more significant in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter, okay, so just directionally second quarter, a lot of payroll costs, right. We've got rent expense running through the P&L because we're in start-up mode, but the depreciation doesn't really start and that's really going to be the significant incremental cost, run it through the gross profit line starting in the third quarter, all right, for all the investment. And again, we called that out in our investor communications, right, it's upwards of $60 million, so it is a significant step-up from what we've done historically.","Marketing, kind of along the same lines, we're not trying to get too specific on what dollars moved where, but it's significant. I mean we saw some in the first quarter, we called that out. We saw more in the second quarter. And again, it's a result of us being smarter during the quarter. We're seeing sales trends, and if we see an opportunity to pull back we will do that. And we'll keep the dry powder for when the ducks are flying, so to speak. So fourth quarter there's a lot of shopping, a lot of new guests coming into a lot of new stores that we're opening during the course of the year, and we're going to deploy the marketing where we think it makes the most sense.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then \u2013 and just going back to the gross margin question, so understood, the depreciation steps up but you don't necessarily have the other items sitting in there like the Salon training which would pressure gross margin. I guess what I'm trying to understand is could gross margin in the back half be down in similar magnitude as it was in the second quarter?","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer","I don't think I want to get to that level of detail. Again, I would just say though there's always, every quarter is kind of standalone. There's ins and there's outs. The Salon we mentioned this time because that was a bit of an unusual item; e-commerce was strong, right, that Leader Event (47:38) that's another one-off, it was stronger than we thought it was going to be online which was great. They were incremental sales, but we had additional freights costs there, right, it's heavier product, it costs a little bit more to ship. So it's not \u2013 we don't think it's productive to get into reconciling the basis points every quarter.","But one thing I would point out is if you're looking at next year, we got a new distribution center coming online next year, right, where we're going to have a lot of these start-up costs and the same. So I wouldn't expect it to create the same level of headwinds just because you're kind of lapping a big event like that this year, but it will be additional headwind next year.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Just first question, I just want to go back to the inventory line for a second, I think Scott, you mentioned earlier obviously that that's going to remain a bit elevated here with the new DC coming online. When do you expect the year-over-year increase in per door inventories to migrate back to basically same-store sales growth? Is that next year?","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I'd say we're going to be in the neighborhood this year. I mean look at the comp that we're posting, it's an 11% comp so you're looking at ex that $20 million of start-up inventory I'd call it, we're at the comp level. So it's not \u2013 I wouldn't view the inventory as being out of control in any way, shape or form. I mean we feel very comfortable with the inventory that we have. Again, there's little seasonal or fashion risk to the inventory. I mean to be frank, we spend most of our time trying to figure out how to stay ahead of the trend usually when we're chasing inventory.","So with the cash and the balance sheet strength we have, we're not going to be shy about making some bets going into the fourth quarter, right, on hot products. So we're \u2013 I would say generally speaking there's nothing to see here, right. We're very comfortable with our inventory position.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. That's good to hear. And then secondly in terms of your decision to go into national TV advertising for the first time, why now? Is this something that you view as a natural extension of your marketing strategy? Was it something that was sort of debated internally? Or was this just an obvious move on your part? Thanks.","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It's really been part of our thinking all along, and really part of our five-year plan. The first strategic imperative that we described is driving new guest acquisition and more loyal \u2013 more sales from our current guests. We know that we have a gap in awareness of our brand relative to our competitors, whether it's aided or unaided. And there's \u2013 television advertising is one of the tools, one of the fastest tools to drive awareness. And we've been two years into it now. So it wasn't like we're just going to go and jump and do that overnight. We carefully developed brand positioning, created, tested it, tested the media plan, so feel confident that the time is right.","Also I would say we all know it's a very competitive marketplace. It's always been and probably always will be. So striking while the iron's hot I guess. We're in a position to build a long-term sustainable business model here. And we think this is a key part of it is to really keep pressing ahead with the marketing tools to drive both short-term and long-term results. And we feel it's the right time to do it. We're ready to do it.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Okay. Next question comes from the line of Kelly Halsor from Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.","Kelly L. Halsor - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on another great quarter. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the Prestige skin care category. It's been a few quarters since you guys have called it out as a top performing category. So what are you seeing in terms of trends and newness of products and brands beyond the rollout of the branded boutiques? Are there any opportunities to add new brands, especially in light of some of the well-known brands recently announcing plans again to do specialty multichannel in a bigger way? And then secondly, could you provide any more color around the cadence of the DC and the store ramp-up? How many stores do you need to get to start to see some leverage on costs associated with that facility? And just any timing around that would be helpful as well. So thanks.","David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer","I'll start with the Prestige skin care. Prestige skin care I think is probably aware is not \u2013 has been a little slower than historical over the last few years. It has slowed down as a category, although we see it as a critical central category to our overall proposition. And we're excited about the potential. I think it's a mix of great partners that we have in place today. Some of our biggest, strongest brands like Philosophy, Dermalogica, Clarisonic. Dermalogica with our partnership with Skin Services (52:28) is a key strategic platform for us. We continue to engage our guests and not only have her engage in products, but have her engage in services. So we see those largest brands continue to grow and provide opportunity both today in some of the innovation and pipeline that we know that they're going to drive going forward.","There are additional brands in our box that are relatively new or new or up and coming. A brand like Juice Beauty is a nice brand that we're excited about and that's performing quite well. There are, to your question, there are certainly additional brands that we don't carry today. I'm not going to talk about any of them specifically but there certainly are brands that we're continuing to explore. We have a full team dedicated to exploring, figuring out which ones would make most sense in our proposition and our box going forward. So we'll continue to add innovation in the skincare category. We see it as a mix. You're right that there's been some, a fair amount of, I guess consolidation, Unilever playing a bigger role in Prestige skincare. We think that's probably only good to get greater emphasis on the category, some new resources and we think it'll attract growth going forward.","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer","And, Kelly, the short answer on the leverage question on fixed costs there. We would expect, we expect to see benefits from the Greenwood facility, we expect to see some benefits next year. Of course those will be masked somewhat by adding another new DC in the Dallas area. Meaningfully 2017 I think is where we'd be able to see more presence of leverage on the P&L overall.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon, and great quarter. I have a bigger picture question. Mary, we've seen growth in popularity of these beauty subscription services. I think one of your competitors actually recently announced a launch in that area. Can you just give us your thoughts on the merits of that model? Is it something ULTA loyalty guests are asking for? Something you could see ULTA doing in the foreseeable future? And maybe any comment on where your capabilities lie there given the new DC investments. Thank you.","David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer","Yeah. I'll take that, Mark. We see the real benefit of that whole space as fundamentally driving trial and discovery of products for our guests. And that's something that we've been focused on for a while. We do a lot in that space. We do not currently offer an exact subscription-based model similar to some of the other ones that are out there. And we'll explore all our options going forward, although I'd say what we're really focused on is finding what we think are probably even better ways to drive that discovery and trial. We do a lot with our guests to provide products. We do programs through our e-commerce platform, Beauty Breaks, which are kind of weekly limited-time offers that give half prices and samples associated with it. We have Beauty Bags that are extremely popular that give premium size samples to our guests. And then we feel they're more targeted and more relevant.","We often partner those with buy-ins on certain products, so there's a \u2013 our customers are more engaged in it. They're expecting these products to come along with it, so their usage we think is really good. We're also experimenting in another variety of different ways again tried this (56:09) trial and discovery. For example, recently we had a program with a very popular YouTube blogger, created a sample bag with her favorite items that was exclusively sold through, or made available to her followers with a buy-in on our website. So we think it not only drove business, it drove engagement, it sampled products and discovery.","So the whole space around trial and discovery is one that we're \u2013 we think we're very active in. We've reached hundreds of thousands of guests with those kind of programs, and we'll continue to drive that kind of program going forward because it excites our guests, it gets them in, engaged in more and more of our products going forward.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, Dave, and best of luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good afternoon, everyone, and congratulations on the terrific results. As you think about the new guests that are coming in, whether going to the salon or even in the store with Prestige, do you think these salon guests, how many of them are coming from loyalty programs, how many of them are coming from the marketing efforts that you're putting into place, and what does this mean for conversion into loyalty members going forward? Thank you.","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I'm glad you asked that because it's an exciting area for us in terms of growth, future growth, because really a small percentage of our loyalty guests today are using the salon. We're doing a lot. I'd say it's coming from a lot of things. One is we've offered a new online booking service that we know is driving largely incremental new guests, thousands of them, in fact.","And then also our marketing programs right now are getting more and more focused on integrating makeup and hair and trend, and they're very exciting. And I think, and we're actually bringing to our store associates this kind of trend training that we talked about, bringing it to life inside the store. And certainly every guest that comes into the \u2013 to an ULTA store who is a potential new loyalty member, our in-store \u2013 our associates in store are doing a great job of converting them into the loyalty program because they understand that that's important for the business. So all those items will work together we think and will continue to be a key part of our growth story.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. I'm sorry, Mike, did you have a question?","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Sorry about that. I did the old mute thing. You guys talked about in your prepared remarks a metric of sales per e-mail sent out, which is an interesting metric. How long have you \u2013 can you give us some more color on that? How long have you measured that? Has the growth accelerated at all? Or what has that looked like in the past? Thanks.","David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer","Yeah. We won't get real \u2013 the specific numbers on it, but it is something that we've measured for a while, and we're seeing really, really healthy growth. And that growth in effectiveness of our e-mail campaigns is really fundamentally coming from I'd say two places. One is better targeting, so we're understanding our consumers' desires we think a little bit better, and personalizing the e-mails to them. And then, the offers, the items and the creative that surrounds them we think is better as well.","So the e-mails themselves are better, better items, better offers, better programs that are personalized in much sharper ways. And those things have really worked well. So we're sending out more e-mails, but we're getting much more effective and efficient in doing it, and we think it will be a big growth driver for us going forward.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. That makes sense. If I could ask one other, just on the supply chain; I assume we're still on line for that, the hit this year to be 5 percentage points relative to your earnings growth. And did that peak? It seems like that's going to peak probably around the third quarter. Is that right?","Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer","That's correct. You got that. Yeah. Third quarter when we flip the switch at the beginning of the third quarter and that's when it was right just doing a store or two, and now we're going to ramp it up, and it will get more efficient over time. And as we get into the fourth quarter it's going to service 130 stores, 140 stores. So at that point it will be more productive and be contributing more, or less drag overall I guess I should say.","Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Aram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC","Hello. Thanks for taking my question. It looks like we're in overtime here. A lot of retailers have struggled with trying to reduce promotions and still hold sales. You guys are one of the few where you've actually pulled back on promotions and sales have kind of held or accelerated. I know you are still using pretty blunt instruments when it comes to CRM and customer knowledge. I'm just wondering, is there potentially another round of that as you look at kind of the response that your customers have had to it. Do you think that if we, or you decided to kind of pull that lever again, that you might be able to go another round perhaps a bit more surgical, but kind of almost repeat that same exercise?","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say that \u2013 I don't know that I envision another big change here. This is a gradual process that we've been working on really for some period of time which is kind of the careful experimentation, testing and learning, trying things differently and changing such that our marketing mix now \u2013 I wouldn't say it's blunt instruments so much anymore. I mean I understand your question but I think we now have a really robust array of tools that are getting better and better as it relates to effectiveness and efficiency.","So I would just consider this a core part of how we're going to always do our business, which is constantly look for how can we be driving long-term brand equity, which is really important that people understand what ULTA is and they're aware of us, they understand that we are All Things Beauty, All in One Place. And then lots of surgical tools to drive the short-term day-to-day results that we need. So it's an ongoing piece of how we're going to do the business. Dave and his team are all over it. And that's how we look at it.","Aram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC","Let me ask it another way, is if you were to look at your level of promotion today versus the brand equity you think ULTA deserves or warrants, do you think those two are in balance now? Or are they still a little out of balance and which way?","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we're really just starting the national television advertising, as you know, so that's another kind of shift in the balance of the mix. I envision that we'll be able to hold our (1:03:00) ratio pretty consistent over time with the mix being \u2013 getting more in balance. But I'd say it's getting there gradually. It's not wildly out of balance. I think we're moving into a place that will be pretty sustainable for the long-term.","Aram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good luck with the new DC.","Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Okay, Ms. Dillon, it appears there's no further questions at this time.

Mary?","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon everyone. The Ulta Beauty team delivered another quarter of solid top line performance, gross margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth.","To recap our financial performance for the quarter, total sales grew 12%, comp store sales increased 6.2% on top of 6.5% growth in the second quarter of last year. Gross margin extended by 40 basis points and diluted earnings per share excluding the tax benefit increased 11.5%.","Looking forward however, we've adjusted our expectations for the second half of 2019 to reflect the headwinds and volatility we're currently seeing in the U.S. cosmetics market. We'll share more with you how we're thinking about the current sales environment.","But let me reiterate. Our differentiated model is winning in the marketplace and we continue to invest in building the long-term capabilities that will further extend our leadership position in the dynamic beauty industry.","Year to-date, we've continue to expand our market share across most categories; increase our brand awareness, delivered double-digit growth in active loyalty members, increased traffic and delivered double-digit growth in almost every key merchandise category.","I will also add that our salon business is showing real comp strength as we're executing on our optimization strategies. That said, the cosmetics category at Ulta which is roughly 50% of our business and one of our highest margin categories has only delivered in the low single-digit growth year-to-date, well outperforming the market but below our expectations.","So, let me explain more. Ulta Beauty continues to drive meaningful market share growth in makeup across mass and prestige. But it's clear that cosmetics and the overall U.S. market is challenged. After several years of very strong performance, growth in the makeup category has been decelerating over the last two years, but recently turned negative.","Based on the least track data, the cosmetics category in the total U.S. market has experienced mid single-digit declines to the first six months of 2019 and has been more volatile in recent weeks.","Notably, when we look at sales growth by brand, we see that most of the top brands across both mass and prestige are negative year to-date. We'd expected this trend to stabilize and improve as we move to 2019, but we now believe that the softness we've seen so far in 2019 will continue to the remainder of the year.","We believe that the main issue driving this softer cycle in cosmetics is that the newness and innovation that have been the focus of most brands this year has just not driven the kind of incremental growth we've enjoyed for some period of time.","Over the past several years, we've seen strong growth in cosmetics driven by new rituals and application techniques, like contouring and brow styling, and innovative new product formats like liquid lip, palettes and minis. This innovation resulted in new makeup routines requiring new products which drove strong incremental growth.","The most recent cycle of innovation has just not driven those behaviors resulting in a soft cycle for the cosmetics category in the U.S. as innovation and newness price the market has not driven the expected growth.","By contrast, as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing very strong growth in every other categories. In the case of skin care category and brand innovation is driving new rituals and incremental purchases, thus driving strong comp. And we're continuing to drive market share gains in the category, but of course skin care is a smaller part of the business.","We believe the industry-wide challenges in the makeup category will continue in the near-term and as a result we've adjusted our outlook for the rest of 2019 to reflect ongoing volatility in the category.","Leveraging our guest insights, we are working very closely with all of our brand partners to ensure that the innovation pipeline pivot to more exciting and incremental innovation. We are optimistic that cosmetics category in the U.S. market will move back to growth, but we need more time to move through this innovation cycle.","In the meantime, our team is laser focused on the exceptional execution in guest experience that we know our team delivers in-store and online. We'll continue to build on our momentum in non-makeup categories, while we work to stabilize growth in makeup categories.","To that end, we have a number of exciting new and exclusive product launches planned for the second half which I'll discuss in more detail in a little bit. Despite the near-term headwinds we remained confident that are differentiated and diverse business model, our commitment to our strategic investments and our highly engaged associates will continue to drive market share gains and deliver strong returns for shareholders.","Let me give you now an update on the progress we've made this year on our strategic imperatives. Our first strategic imperative is to drive growth across beauty enthusiast segment and we're making good progress.","Reflecting data for the February through July period, Ulta Beauty now represents 24.5% of the prestige beauty market as tracked by NPD, an increase of 210 basis points from a year ago. We continue to expand our brick-and-mortar footprint.","In the second quarter, we opened 17 net new stores, relocated four stores and remodel eight stores compared to 19 net new stores, one relocation and seven remodels in the second quarter of last year, ending the quarter with 1213 stores. New store productivity remains strong with first year sales trending ahead of plan and we remain on track to open 80 stores this year.","Now turning to our second imperative to deepen love and loyalty for the Ulta Beauty brand, our brand awareness continues to grow and our possibilities of beautiful campaign and inclusive positioning have been very well received and very effective as measured by our marketing analytics tools.","Unaided awareness grew 5.56% compared to the same period a year ago and our aided awareness increased to 91% from 90%. Importantly, we continue to strengthen our connection with consumers across the spectrum including the increasingly influential Gen Z segment where we've been recognized as a leader among beauty retailers.","Guests also continue to respond well to the compelling combination of our loyalty, credit card and gift card programs resulting in double-digit growth in all three programs for the second quarter.","Our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program has grown to 33.2 million active members, an increase of about 13% since the second quarter of last year. We continue to see nice growth in the number of guests to achieve platinum and diamond status, our most engaged guest, as well as growth in overall sales per member.","Our loyalty members account for more than 95% of sales and we're using insights about preferences to create more personalized recommendations, replenishment reminders and unique offers, all to drive deeper engagement and increase spend per member. We're making nice progress on this effort, as the number of guests receiving these personalized recommendations and replenishment reminders continues to grow.","We've also begun to use artificial intelligence in our effort to drive promotional effectiveness by leveraging data or identifying guest response to different types of offers and using these insights to help us determine the best offer to present each guest with the goal of building a larger basket and driving incremental sales.","Our marketing events in the second quarter were anchored by omni-channel campaigns including our gorgeous hair events, our new summer\/campaign and our semiannual Jumbo Love event. We augmented these multi-week events with a number of new smaller events including Mascara Bonanza and National Lipstick Day.","Now turning to our imperative to deliver world-class beauty assortment, our merchant team is doing a great job curating a highly differentiated omni-channel offering across all of our categories.","Newness drove about 20% of our total comp this quarter driven primarily by new items in skin care and cosmetics. From a category standpoint, we saw strong sales growth this quarter in skin care, hair care and personal care appliances.","Skin care continues to be one of our strongest growth categories with prestige, mass and sun care, all delivering double-digit comps this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, this category strength is been driven by strong innovation supported by new ingredients like moisturizers with SPF and sunless tanners and new skin care rituals like serums and masks.","Mask skin care delivered strong comp driven by growth from both new and core brands. We implemented our mask skincare reset in July and added several new brands to our assortment such as ACURE, a clean skin care lines and a brand called Naturally Good for You; which includes both skincare and supplements in the regime.","We also launched the Ordinary, a skin care collection founded to offer results-driven product at an affordable price point. We initially launch The Ordinary on ulta.com and recently expanded the brand to 400 stores.","Sales in Sun care were also robust driven by an extended selection of self-tanning products and sun protection options. In prestige skin care newer brand like Kiehl's and TULA line drove strong guests engagement, while more established brands like dermatologica benefited from strong product newness.","In addition, new exclusive emerging brands including Awake, Fountain of Truth and Cannuka, all contributed to the strong growth in the second quarter. In earlier this month, we launch a favorite Indie brand Sunday Riley, at all stores and later this quarter we'll extend our exclusive partnership with Kylie Cosmetics with the introductions of a full line of Kylie skin also in all doors.","Haircare delivered another quarter of strong high single-digit comp growth, reflecting the success of our gorgeous hair and Jumbo Love Event and supported by the reflow we completed in the first quarter.","Fragrance delivered solid mid-single digit growth this quarter driven primarily by Ulta Beauty exclusive, as well as newness from luxury brands; YSL and Versace. We have some exciting new exclusive coming in fragrance this quarter including Thank U, Next, a new fragrance from Ariana Grande.","Personal care appliances delivered strong double-digit growth driven by strong demand for Dyson products and the Revlon One-Step Volumizer Hair Dryer, as well as new one-step products from Bed Head and Hot Tools.","Now, as we discussed earlier, the cosmetics category overall at Ulta delivered low single digit comp for the quarter reflecting double-digit growth in mass cosmetic and low single digit growth in prestige cosmetic including iconic brands.","This performance was in spite of weak category trends in the U.S. market as I mentioned before especially prestige. Due to strength of our business model and ability to secure some important exclusives we continue to drive significant market share gains in the categories.","Mass cosmetic continue to benefit from the reflow we completed earlier this year, which allocate additional space for exclusive or limited distribution brands. In addition, newness continues to drive strong growth in traffic especially with our exclusive brick-and-mortar brands such as Morphe and Juvia's Place.","In addition, we continue to deliver newness and innovation through the Ulta Beauty collection. In the second quarter, we partnered with Frida Kahlo Corporation to launch an exclusive makeup line within the Ulta Beauty collection and guest response to the collection has exceeded our expectation.","And earlier this month, we made beauty exclusive Girls United collection, created by six talented African-American young women through a special mentoring initiative with ESSENCE Magazine.","Prestige cosmetics was mixed. We continue to see strong growth from our iconic prestige brands driven primarily by the expansion of Clinique and Lancome to additional stores. In addition, Prestige cosmetic sales benefited from strong growth from new brands such as Kylie Cosmetics and newness including the introduction of Tarte's Big Ego Mascara which launch personal to beauty and the expansion of a collection of vegan and cruelty-free lashes from multiple brands including Tarte in Velour.","These gains were offset by soft performance and a number of other established brands in the portfolio. Looking forward to the second half of the year, we have a number of new exclusive products and brand launches plan which we believe will have strong appeal for our guest. In prestige we have an exciting new exclusive brand launch plan this quarter; KKW Beauty by Kim Kardashian West is coming to Ulta Beauty.","With more than a 146 million Instagram followers, Kim is one of the strongest forces in pop culture and we are very excited to extend our partnership with her. The new collection will launch with 57 SKUs and include products that are most iconic to Kim including contour and highlight kit, new lip and versatile eye looks. And for holiday, we'll offer our guests two exclusive holiday kit available only at Ulta Beauty.","We also have some exciting news to share mass cosmetic. We just unveiled the launch of Florence by Mills, a collection created by Millie Bobby Brown star of Stranger Things. Millie is an influential voice within her generation has more than 27 million followers on Instagram. Exclusive to Ulta Beauty, Florence by Mills offers a fresh, fun approach to clean beauty with the universal range of both skincare and makeup product that will appeal to all guest especially Gen Z.","In addition, we have a number of new Morphe collaborations with key influencers in the pipeline for the second half. The first collaboration launched just this week with Jeffree Star, one of the most prominent social media influencers in beauty today and offers guest the collection of makeup and accessories.","As we discussed on previous calls, emerging brands and digitally-native brands are driving new growth within the beauty channel. At Ulta Beauty we have a strong track record of successfully working with digitally-native and emerging beauty brands and our footprint of more than 1200 stores in more than 30 million loyalty members positions us very well to be a great partner to these brands as they evolve and expand their reach.","To support this effort, last year we created a new dedicated team within our merchandising organization to focus on identifying smaller or emerging brands across all beauty categories and working with them closely to ensure they're successful in a retail environment.","Year to-date this team has launched more than 30 unique new brands. To showcase these brands and give guest the opportunity to discover, explore and play with new emerging brands we debut Sparked at Ulta Beauty at Beautycon earlier this month.","Sparked at Ulta Beauty is a new platform designed to feature a curated, ever-evolving selection of emerging brands across all categories, intellect stores and an ulta.com, while we're optimistic that these exciting makeup initiatives will enable us to continue to gain market share throughout the remainder of the year. We believe the U.S. cosmetics category will continue to be soft in the second half driving further declines in several leading brands and pressuring total makeup results at Ulta.","Now, moving on to our imperative to transform the in-store and beauty services experience, we've completed our services optimization program in all stores and we are very encouraged by the improving trends we're seeing across the board, and staff recruitment and retention, average ticket and guest engagement.","As a reminder, this effort is both associate and guest-facing. To attract and retain top talent we've implemented a more compelling compensation structure and a newly formed field-based leadership team to support industry-leading training and education program.","For the guests, we simplified our service menu, introduced new services and made our pricing easier to understand. We continue to leverage our highly influential Pro Hair team, which is made of industry-leading educators and platform artists which helps us to attract top talent.","This talented and award-winning team is creating excitement and raising awareness of Ulta Beauty's brand within the beauty industry through participation in national and local events that highlight artistry and opportunity that exist at Ulta Beauty.","In addition to optimizing services business, we're also integrating our services business with more of our marketing campaigns and larger merchandising strategies. In conjunction with a gorgeous hair event, we launch a new blowout program introducing five new looks created by the award-winning Ulta Beauty Pro Team.","And we continue to leverage back bar takeovers to introduce new brands like living Proof and LMS to guests and to drive add-on purchases. Now I'll turn to our fifth strategic imperative to reinvent beauty digital engagement.","During the second quarter we successfully completed the rollout of buy online, pickup in-store to all stores, while still early guest response to this convenient omni-channel experience has exceeded our initial applications. We know our omin-channel guests are our best guest and we believe this capability will make it even easier for guests to seamlessly shop between our online store and our physical stores.","In conjunction with the launch of Opus, we also enhance our mobile site and app with an improved product detail page that has a cleaner look and feel including better visibility to in-store inventory availability. We continue to leverage augmented reality in artificial intelligence to create compelling beauty experiences for guest.","During the second quarter we updated Glam Lab, our virtual try and experience to include live try on for android devices. We also began testing our skin care virtual beauty advisor online which is powered by AI and AR and provides guest easy ways to get skin care advice.","Lastly, I'd like to announce two partnerships in the digital space. First, we've recently announced a new exclusive partnership with Samsung and Revieve to provide beauty enthusiasts with access to personalized skin care diagnostic information, targeted product recommendations and the ability to quickly purchase products from ulta.com directly through Samsung's virtual assistant Bixby Vision.","And second, later this year we'll offer our guest the ability to use after pay on ulta.com. We know that some guest particularly younger ones are sensitive to accumulating personal debt. After pay allow shoppers to receive product immediately and pay for them in four installments without taking out a traditional loan or paying upfront fees or interest.","After pay, buy now, pay later option will offer guest more freedom and flexibility without the weight, underpinning and fueling our strategic imperatives, our ongoing efforts to deliver operational excellence and drive greater efficiencies.","We continue to enhance our supply-chain investment including a recent end-to-end optimization of our store shipment categories, which both improve the fee processing efficiency and reduce sorting type for product and stores.","In addition our store on-time delivery trend continues to improve this quarter delivering 80 basis points of improvement over last year. And finally, we continue to make progress toward our goal of two-day e-commerce shipping by 2021 with the successful conversion of our Romeoville Distribution Center to an e-commerce Fast Fulfillment Center.","The team completed the transition seamlessly and was able to leverage much of the existing infrastructure for the new operation. The facility began fulfilling guest's orders in early August and is currently fulfilling about 10% of our total e-commerce volume.","With that, I'll turn over to Scott to discuss our second quarter financials and our updated outlook for the rest of the year in more detail.","Scott Settersten","Thank you, Mary and good afternoon everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Sales growth of 12% was driven by a 6.2% comp and strong new store productivity. Increased traffic drove the majority of our comp for the quarter with transaction growth of 5.4% and ticket growth of 0.8%.","Although we no longer breakout e-commerce growth specifically, I can share that ulta.com growth was towards the high end of our expectations of 20% to 30% growth driven by traffic.","Looking at trends through the quarter, we began to see more volatility in our sales trends in July and pulled the number of levers to drive traffic and deliver healthy top line growth.","On the gross profit line, margin of 36.4% improved 40 basis points year-over-year from 36%, driven by leverage of rent and occupancy expense and stronger merchandise margin partially offset by investments in our services business.","Our supply chain operations were roughly flat as a percent of sales as leverage in our DC operation was offset by growth in e-commerce. To provide more color on our merchandise margin, we continue to benefit from efforts related to our efficiencies for growth or EFG program.","This goodness was offset by increased promotional activity to drive traffic, as well as ongoing mix headwind. SG&A rate of 23.6% deleverage by 90 basis points compared to the prior year's rate of 22.7%, reflecting planned deleveraging corporate overhead related to investments and growth initiatives including our efforts around digital innovation including omni-channel and personalization and our recently announced Canadian expansion.","We also saw deleveraging store labor versus last year primarily due to continued investments to support the guest experience. Operating margin of 12.5% of sales was down 50 basis points. Given our investment agenda, we had planned for operating margin deleverage for the quarter.","The effective tax rate for the quarter decreased to 23.1% compared to 23.9% in the second quarter last year primarily due to an increase in federal income tax credit. Diluted GAAP earnings per share grew 12.2% to $2.76 compared to $2.46 reported for last year's second quarter. Adjusting for the $0.04 of tax benefit this year and the $0.02 of tax benefit last year, EPS increased 11.5%.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow; total inventory grew 7.9% and was flat on a per store basis. We continue to manage our inventory effectively investing in key growth areas, while reducing unproductive inventory to hold average inventory per store flat to last year, while delivering a 6.2% comp increase.","Our in-stock position also remain strong through Q2 as we focused on investing inventory in our top sellers, new brand and product launches and key promotional events. Capital expenditures were $79.3 million for the quarter driven by our new store opening program, investments in IT systems and store remodels and relocations.","We ended the quarter with $327.4 million in cash and short term investments. We've repurchased 791,000 shares at a cost of $270.9 million through our stock repurchase program. $517.3 million remained available on our $875 million authorization as of quarter end.","We continue to expect our repurchase approximately 700 million of shares in fiscal 2019. But as always, we have the flexibility to modify the cadence of repurchases in response to market conditions.","Turning now to guidance. As Mary indicated, we have updated our outlook for the remainder of the year to reflect our expectations for ongoing challenges in the makeup category. Before I get into specifics I'd like to spend a moment giving you a little color on the bridge between our initial 2019 guidance and our updated view.","As we put together our fiscal 2019 plan, we assumed a strong mid single-digit comp based on an expectation that we would see strong performance from makeup overall and an improving trend in prestige makeup, which would contribute to both sales and margin improvement with an acceleration in the second half of the year.","These gains would be partially offset by necessary strategic investment to support healthy long term growth. Based on second quarter results and more recent trends in the U.S. cosmetics market, it has become apparent to us that we will not see the improvement we had expected in prestige makeup and that we will likely also see moderation in the mass make up sales trend.","As a result, we have lowered our sales and gross margin expectations for the second half of the year. We are adjusting controllable expenses where appropriate, but we'll continue to invest in initiatives that drive long term growth, such as digital innovation, our salon services strategy, expanding our omni-channel capabilities, IT security and infrastructure and initiatives to enhance the guest experience.","Specifically for fiscal 2019, we continue to expect to open approximately 80 new stores, all our traditional 10,000 square foot prototypes. We plan to remodel 12 stores and relocate eight stores and execute 270 store refreshes or mini-remodels to enable the addition of new brands and improvements to overall fixturing.","We anticipate driving top line growth between 9% and 12% with total company comparable sales plan in the 4% to 6% range, compared to previous guidance range of 6% to 7%.","We continue to expect e-commerce to grow in the 20 to 30 percentage range contributing approximately 200 basis points to comparable sales. Although, we are no longer providing precise quarterly guidance, we expect comparable store sales growth in Q4 will be stronger than Q3 as we benefit from holiday newness within the assortment.","We expect to deliver earnings per share in the range of $11.86 to $12.06 with approximately 60 to 70 basis points of operating margin deleverage. This compares to previous guidance of $12.83 to $13.03 and approximately 10 to 20 basis points of operating leverage.","We continue to expect to deliver a gross profit improvement for the year driven by merchandise margin expansion, rent and occupancy expense, cost leverage and the benefits of our credit card program albeit lower than our previous expectations. These benefits will be offset by more SG&A deleverage than initially planned due to the lower sales expectation which will increase deleverage of store labor and investments in growth initiatives and innovation.","Thinking about the flow of earnings in the second half, we are planning for EPS in the third quarter to be flat to lower as compared to the third quarter last year. While we continue to expect gross margin expansion in Q3 our lower comp expectations will result in more SG&A deleverage in the quarter.","For Q4, we are planning for EPS growth in the mid single-digit range, reflecting our higher expectations for Q4 sales. We plan to spend between $340 and $350 million in CapEx compared to previous guidance of $380 million to $400 million.","This includes CapEx of approximately $170 million for new stores remodels and merchandise fixtures, $130 million for supply chain and IT, including new fast fulfillment centers and about $50 million for store maintenance and other.","Depreciation and amortization expense is planned to be approximately $300 million compared to previous guidance of $350 million. We expect our tax rate for the year to be 23% which does not include any estimate for the impact of share based compensation.","A fully diluted share count for the year is expected to be approximately $58 million, and our plan assumes share repurchases in 2019 in the $700 million range.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mary.","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Scott. Before we'll begin the Q&A session, I'd just like to take a step back to recap our perspective on the quarter, our current challenges and the strength of our differentiated business model.","While the second quarter results were solid, as Scott said, we've updated our guidance to reflect our best assessment of second half performance based on our expectations for the U.S. makeup category.","We are doing our level best to both set realistic short term expectations and ensure that we work with our brand partners to stabilize and then grow the important color cosmetics category. I am confident we can do that.","Our unique business model representing all of the major categories of beauty, a range of price points and access to many exclusive and digitally-native brands is enabling us to drive growth and market share gains in spite of headwinds in our largest category.","We've expanded our gross profit margin, increase our brand awareness, driven traffic growth, expanded our loyalty program and exceeded new store performance targets. We are relevant to a large and diverse set of beauty enthusiasts and we're focused on attracting growing demographic groups like teens, millennials, Latinos who are all over index and beauty.","We have a powerful and increasingly personalized loyalty program with strong guest engagement. We're also driving strong momentum in our salon business based on our actions to optimize the experience. And I'm proud that we have a team that continues to deliver operational excellence and exceptional guests experience at every day.","That said we are not immune to macro cycles like what we're currently seeing in the makeup category. But I am optimistic and committed to ensure that we'll move through these near-term headwinds, and I believe we have the right strategy, the right business model and the right team to continue to grow and win over the long term.","And now, I'll turn it over to our conference call host to moderate the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Steph Wissink who's with Jefferies. Please go ahead, Steph.","Steph Wissink","Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Mary, I'll ask you to some first and then the related question for Dave. But if you could help us think about the comp guidance for the back half, what component is category versus your relative outperformance to the category? So, to ask another way, how much of that is purely macro or backdrop? And do you expect to kind of retain share and follow the backdrop or do you expect to see some about share advantage released?","And my question for Dave is on the comments that you made on mass versus prestige, I think you've indicated mass cosmetics up double digits, prestige up low single-digits. Anything in your data that would suggest the consumer is trading down from prestige into mass? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Steph, thank you. It\u2019s a risk of reiterating. I will just say that -- I think your question is spot on. We are very confident our business model is working and is going to continue to work. We are outperforming the rest of the market. We believe we're going to continue to do so because of the many assets that we have from a brand that's known and loved, our loyalty program, our omni-channel capabilities, digital capabilities, a lot of the exclusives that we have in our assortment. And you know the fact that we've got the ability to work across all categories, really works to our advantage, right, because we've had very strong growth in all the categories right now except for makeup. But yes, the makeup category is challenge. We're winning. I'd say we've hit -- the categories hit a bit of a speed bump and we'll work with our brand partners big and small really to pivot this.","And so to us, as we look at the second half it's really about -- we've talked about this for several quarters that after years of very strong growth, cosmetics has been growing but at a somewhat slower rate than it had been. But really I'd say trends deteriorated further late in the second quarter and even more recently into this quarter. And so, we would say as we look at this, we figure okay, it's going to stay for a while until we get through this cycle. But I'm confident that our ability to drive share gains will continue. I don't see here in the business model that makes me feel otherwise. And Dave, do you want to comment about the other question?","Dave Kimbell","Right. On mass cosmetics. So as both Mary and Scott said, our mass business did perform somewhat better than our prestige business. In both categories we gained share and we think we outperformed the total industry significantly which allowed us to continue to grow our business. On the mass side of the business, we probably had a bit more advancement in shifting our assortment away from brands -- broad brands into brands that are a bit more limited and exclusive distribution at Ulta Beauty. So our business has been stronger. But we believe and what we see in the marketplace that the mass total made -- U.S. makeup, mass makeup category is equally as challenged relative to prestige.","So we don't believe it's a shift between prestige and mass as much as an overall malaise driven by the innovation trends that Mary pointed out. We're confident that the innovation that we're bringing in both mass and prestige will allow us to continue to gain share. But the softness in the total cosmetic both mass and prestige category will provide these headwinds that we've described.","Operator","The next question comes from Erinn Murphy who's with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess just a follow-up to that question as we think about the comp cadence of 4% to 6% now for the year. And your one year into your Analyst Day which was 5% to 7% long term guide, I guess, what gives you the confidence or do you believe that you should be reaccelerating to 5% to 7% beyond this year? I guess it\u2019s a slowdown in cosmetics from what you can see just temporarily to the back half of this year. And then I guess Mary you commented or I guess, Scott, both of you commented on a little bit more promotional activity in the back half of the quarter. What are you expecting for the holiday season from a promotional perspective? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Okay. So I step back and say, I want to be really clear, we're really know a less confident about the attractiveness of our business model, our growth potential. We do see the current dynamics as a speed bump certainly as a speedy speed bump right? But we're confident that cosmetics category will return -- will continue to return to growth. The timing is a little unpredictable. But there's been in the past cycles that affect different categories and makeup was very strong for many years and it's going through a tough cycle. But as we look at demographic trends, as we look at engagement in makeup, as we look at the white space that we believe exists and I know our brand partners commitment to getting this back to growth, we feel that we still stand by that guidance.","Today we're not talking about a long term outlook. Now it's prudent for us to plan in the near-term for this potentially lower growth environment and we're thinking about that. But we have not changed our optimistic view of the future. On the promotional end, I mean holiday is always a highly coveted time for everybody to get traffic into their store. So Scott talked about promotion. I'd say, the good news is we have a lot of levers and that we have and we use those levers at different times. As everybody I think understands we've gone to much more targeted types of promotions over the years versus more broad based and with our loyalty program being kind of the core of what we do.","It's going to be I think a competitive second half, because everybody who's in beauty would be facing these same headwinds. So we feel we're well set up for holiday. Obviously that's a key focus area for us. But we're going to continue to -- I guess I'd say drive traffic, make sure that we capture guests into our loyalty program and not see that to competitors at a time that will be competitive, but at the same token I think again we are pretty smart about how we use the levers and we have more efficient levers than ever.","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Forbes who's with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead sir.","Steven Forbes","Good morning. Maybe a follow-up on that previous question, given that the comp provision is based really on the store level comp, right, first the e-commerce growth, you're giving that that's 20% to 30%. Can you discuss sort of the mature store comp outlook for the back half and whether the recent performance impacts whether it's the saturation target or unique growth outlook through 2021 that was provided during last year's Analyst Day?","Scott Settersten","We're happy overall with new store performance, I think we mentioned that in our prepared remarks. So we haven't seen anything in there that would give us any concern on the longer-term target of 1,500 to 1,700 stores. In a recent, over I would call the rolling 12-month period, we saw new stores performing well in the low- to mid-single digit kind of range -- again, vis-a-vis what we saw high single-digits in the years where we are delivering double-digit comps, so they have moderated somewhat.","As we looked at Q2 in absolute terms, the comps in the older cohorts were lower, they were in the low -- very low single-digit range. As you would expect when you do the mass on the overall comp makeup.","Again, when we look at cosmetics -- color cosmetics overall and what were the dynamics we're seeing in the industry, they affect all stores equally, there is nothing in special that stands out with a new stores compared to some of the other stores in the fleet. So again, very happy overall, it doesn't change our outlook and the long-term our store build out here in the U.S.","Mary Dillon","Yes, and I think, I would just add that I think you might have referred in your question about did it affect channels differently? And I say no. You know obviously it comes growing faster, the stores that hasn\u2019t been for a while, but that channels equally affected by the headwind.","Steven Forbes","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Simeon Gutman who's with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. A little bit of a follow-up. Right. You have this medium to long-term outlook out there and mid to high-teen DPS growth. Obviously the operating deleverage in the back half would stand at the disconnect to that. I guess, if you look at 2020 which I realize we're not talking about yet is the de-leverage that you could see, let's say, if you do a 3% to 4% comp, it's going to -- it could look similar to what we're seeing in the back half of this year or is there more flexibility on the margin side such that gets you back to your outlook.","And just within that, I know you've talked about the makeup market being soft and you need some times as I go through it, what is your going assumption on this? Mary, I don't know, if there is a conversations you're having with executives, who sell this product as well, but when do you think this recycle it in the market to get soft in the early part of last year even though you outperforming itself? Do we cycle at the beginning of the early part of 2020? Thanks.","Mary Dillon","Yes, let me start with that one Simeon. Yes. I don't exactly have a crystal ball on this, because there's a lot of moving parts in different brands that participate. I can tell you everybody is focused on this North America makeup market is important for everybody, and it needs to improve. I know, I'd say, it's going to take some time, because part of the what we think is driving it is innovation while good an exciting innovation or good innovation hasn't really driven the interim mentality, I mentioned this in the script of some previous forms of innovation, that would be like, on the contrary I need three products for that right. You know I\u2019m going to do my browser with two products.","So what we're focused on is pivoting to wide space that will drive incremental and exciting type innovation, and that doesn't happen overnight. And frankly, I'd say, it takes a while to assess incrementally. So it wasn't obvious probably until recently that some of that innovation, you have to go to its ground repeat cycle to see is it going to be incremental.","So, categories pivot in certain ways. We're very focused on that with our brand partners. And I don't have exactly a timeframe, but I think it's going to take some time to work through it, but I feel that by second half of 2020 at least we should be in a better place. But again, I'm not holding to that, I hope it's sooner, but I think it does take some time to cycle through.","Scott Settersten","And those who know us well understand, makeup, right. It's a huge part of our business and it's very high margin for us. So when there's a disruption there, it creates a lot of ripple effects across the business. So you know we believe over the long term there's still opportunity to expand operating margin, Simeon, you know through primarily through EFG initiatives that we've talked about before in the four work streams along with scale over the long term, you know it's just, it's we think it's too early to reconsider you know modifying our long term guidance outlook in any significant way here. We need a little time to let things shake out a little bit and of course we're looking to manage our investments and expenses and everything here really closely.","And assuming, we're thinking about this actively assuming, we're going to be in a lower growth environment here in the near term and adjust our priorities accordingly.","Operator","The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer Co. Please go ahead.","Rupesh Parikh","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So first on the tower side, we've seen some more mass companies talk about taking price. I was just curious you know just given some of the malaise [ph] out there, I want to get your thoughts on where you thought the consumer acceptance of price increases are?","And then second, Scott you mentioned that you expect Q3 comps to be lower than Q4. I would have expected potentially stronger comps in Q3 just given the easier comparison in Q3 versus Q4. Just want to get your thoughts on that. Thank you.","Scott Settersten","Yes, so maybe we'll start with the tariff question. So again, at this point for us, we've talked about this over the last few quarters. It's kind of difficult to predict what the impact is going to be in beauty products overall, again, we're not seeing any significant step up in pricing negotiations or issues with any of our vendors. We expect to be able to manage our way through that and navigate that as best we can. And so, we're managing that as best we can through supplier relationships today and we would expect that to continue overall.","As far as the comp stack year-over-year, I know, we can look at two or three years and trends and what you would expect. That's not the environment we're in right now. I mean, the disruption we're seeing in the prestige and color makeup overall is a step change in the normal flow of the business year-to-year and that's really what's driving our outlook.","Rupesh Parikh","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Beth Kite who's with Citi. Please go ahead.","Beth Kite","Hi, everyone. We have a question about your skin care exposure. And given the pressure in color cosmetics especially prestige, if you've considered a bigger move into skin, more brands, more shelf space, more space in store if you will. Have you entertained those conversations to shift the skin care exposure in a greater way more quickly?","Dave Kimbell","Yes, well, we are already experiencing strong growth in skincare, both on the mass and prestige side of the business. And we've made moves to continue to emphasize that part of the business through both the brands that we've been bringing in and partnering with strong innovation that Mary described earlier, and a further amplification within our -- both our store and our e-commerce and app business, so for sure we've been emphasizing and driving that part of the business as well as the other categories that have been driving growth hair and fragrance our personal care appliances, so absolutely emphasizing that. Having said that, and we are always on the move -- on the effort to continue to try to optimize our assortment and look to lean into areas that are demonstrated in those growth.","Having said that, even though makeup is going through this tougher cycle, we still are confident in the long-term growth prospects of this category. So we're not anticipating a dramatic shift away long-term from makeup, we'll continue to try to continue the strong share growth gains that we've had bring new brands and partner with our key brand partners to get those brands back on track, because the demographic trends and makeup are still a strong. Everything we're seeing around millennials and Gen Zs, Latinas, all the growth drivers, we're confident in. We're working through this innovation cycle that Mary described, but we believe we will come out of that. And so we'll continue to maintain a strong makeup business but absolutely emphasizing the growth categories like skin and others across our store.","Beth Kite","And the volatility in July through now, was that primarily color or did that impact your other categories?","Dave Kimbell","Yes, it was primarily color that we're seeing this year -- as we've talked, there's been a disruption in the makeup category, a slowdown in the makeup category for a little while now, but in many measures and are tracking and a view of the category there was more disruption, more recently over the last several weeks.","Beth Kite","Wonderful, thanks very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks. Good evening. So a couple of follow ups. First in terms of the comps that you're implying for the third quarter. Are you basically assuming the current trend that you've seen sustained? Or are you expecting 21 days of beauty in September to improve the trend? And following up on the fourth quarter, you're lapping James Charles, you're lapping Kiley. So are you sizings the newness factor bigger this year? Or is there something else on the common terms of newness that hasn't been announced or are you assuming investment in merch margins to try to drive the comp overall. Thanks.","Mary Dillion","Yes, I'll start and then I'll see if Dave wants to add anything. You know, we're not going to get that in that granular. We're in the quarter right now. Obviously, I'm just, you know we're trying to do our best to sort of call it, like we see it, and I'd say it is a combination of our view of category trends, and as we size newness and also all the things that we have in the fourth quarter just in terms of holiday promotions. So it's our -- it's our best call right now with a range around that. Okay.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Binetti who's with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions here. I was wondering maybe if you could just give us a little more color on the magnitude of the issues in July and in August, the magnitude of the guidance is quite heavy, and it seems like it's based on a fairly short period in time. And obviously, you saw a big thing -- you've described 2Q is less informative a seasonally about the underlying trend in your business, you still got big thing like 21 days of beauty.","Mary, the body language very clear, all of the commentary you expect cosmetics to improve. I'm just trying to figure out why cosmetics will improve. You said the incrementality hasn't worked. What's driving the comp improvement in 4Q versus third quarter based on those comments, especially [latter] obviously the bigger compare.","Mary Dillion","Yes. I mean, I see the first part of your question is just that it has been, is the category data that we have access to and some of the more recent than what you would see has shown more recent deceleration I guess. So that's sort of part of why the shift in more dramatic change. Again, we just try to call -- we take multiple views of how we build up our volume forecast, and so our Q4 is a combination of all the things thinking about category trends, not necessarily dramatically improving, but thinking about what we have coming, and giving our best shot at both Q3, Q4 cadence of promotional events and launches.","Michael Binetti","So I guess just to follow that, I think you started first calling out slowing prestige cosmetic trends in mid-2017. You've done a really nice job of gliding your business slower for almost two years now. I feel like, I just want to ask you like what do you think is happening in the industry. It's like; I'm missing something on why it must have changed lower so suddenly here recently?","Mary Dillion","Well, you know if I had the answer to that, I would have fixed that already. I mean, it's honestly, I think it's a combination of factors. And you\u2019re right. I mean, I share our business model. We're proud about the fact that we can select across categories, and when we drive in market share growth and carry a lot of fantastic exclusive brands. But you know as we look at, it's a combination we think of just innovation not really. You know a cycle of innovation that we're in right now, doesn't compare to what we've seen a few years ago, and it's easy to say that now, it's hard to know --prospectively that that's going to be the case.","Right. So, we think the combination of what our brand -- we bet on and what our brand partners would bet on just wasn't driving that kind of incrementality that we've seen in the past. So that's you know at the highest level, probably the biggest factor.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Thanks. Best of luck of with 21 days Beauty.","Mary Dillion","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager who's with Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark Altschwager","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Could you walk us through just a little bit further the puts and takes on the updated EBIT margin guidance from the back half of the year. How much of the change in expectations is on merchandise margin versus greater fixed cost de-leverage. Is there any help on the gross margin versus SG&A cadence over the next couple of quarters would be great.","Scott Settersten","Yes, I guess, we can talk directionally for the back half of the year. I'm not going to -- we're not going to get into specifics quarter-by-quarter. We're trying to move away from that, Mark. I appreciate the question. So I think, we stated in our comments that we still merchandise margin. Right. It -- we still expect to expand that. So that's the good news. Our EFG efforts are working; we're making progress on that. Unfortunately, it's going to be masked a little bit by the downward pressure we have in prestige right and the mix overall of the business.","So we're happy with margin expansion overall, blended up for the back half of the year is what we expect to see. SG&A is heavier, I mean, again, we pointed to these are necessary long-term investments for the health of the business that we're not going to back away from right now in some knee-jerk reaction.","So again, SG&A deleverage is going to be heavier in the second half of the year than what we expected. I guess, I would say there, it's probably a little heavier weighted to the third quarter than it is fourth quarter, because in fourth quarter we're kind of shut down and we're all on all hands on deck for holiday.","So also I would say, third quarter maybe you're kind of at peak with fixed cost, while it's leveraging year-over-year there's less of that in the third quarter, because we're getting a fuller load of new store openings and things like that weighted toward the back half of the year this year. So that's probably about as much color as I want to give on specifically the quarter's themselves.","Mark Altschwager","That's helpful. Thank you and best of luck.","Mary Dillion","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Goldsmith who's with UBS. Please go ahead sir.","Michael Goldsmith","What are you assuming about the company's level of market outperformance in the cosmetic category in the back half of the year? And does that represent a change from what we've seen the last couple of quarters? And given the market share gains achieved over the years, does that make it more difficult to pick up share in the category going forward?","Mary Dillion","Yes I\u2019d say that we are expecting continued similar share gains to the rest of the year, is probably the easiest way to put it.","Michael Goldsmith","And then, going forward.","Mary Dillion","I wouldn't comment on that yet today, but still we still see plenty of share for us to gain. That is out there and other channels that we've been successfully with our business model attracting new guests and share. So we see that playing out for a while.","Michael Goldsmith","Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Ike Boruchow who's with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Ike Boruchow","Hey good afternoon, everyone. Mary, I understand there\u2019s a lot going on right now and I do apologize to go back to Simone's question. But less than a year ago there was a multi-year plan that was laid out and it did call for 5% to 7% comps, and it specifically called out for margin expansion in 2020. I understand that there is no crystal ball right now, but I guess what I'd ask is given what's taking -- given it sounds like this is going to take some time to work through and looking at the comps and the leverage you're guiding to in the back half. Should we consider that plan stale at this point?","Mary Dillion","I think it's really too soon to say that. I mean part of what we need to do is sort of work through this cycle. We've not put our plans for 2020 together yet. You know we still feel very confident about the business model and we can make choices about pacing of what we spend in terms of investments.","You know we've been pretty aggressive. We go after a lot of investment this year that you know are multi-year important long-term investments for us. And so as prudent planners, we would say okay, we want to plan for it maybe a different comp cycle for part of the year, how do we then think about you know how do we stage investments and deliver the appropriate returns.","So I think it is. I mean, I think, Scott said it well. This is not a time to have a knee jerk reaction about the long-term prospects of the business. I don't believe that. But we're also being prudent how we think about you know how we do this kind of planning and stage investments.","Ike Boruchow","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","Dana Telsey","Hi, good afternoon everyone. As you think about the go-forward, how do you think of what type of comps that you need to leverage expenses given the new trajectory of sales growth and category growth? And also, as you think about mass and prestige, has there been a difference in the cadence of mass and prestige in terms of how they are performing most recently? Thank you.","Scott Settersten","Yes. So the first part of the question I guess I would say to Mary point she just made, the business has been very healthy for a long period of time, and we've been riding a wave so to speak on. Makeup, makeup in general right across both mass and prestige, which has allowed us the flexibility to be more aggressive on the investment front. So there was a time before that phenomena where Ulta operated very effectively, and very well performed, produced some really great financial results on much lower comps.","So we're no stranger to operating in a tougher, lower, growth kind of environment and that's just the kinds of things that we're pivoting towards right now. So again, we don't have all the answers as we sit here today, but you can bet that we're actively managing with that thought in mind.","Dave Kimbell","And on your second question about mass and prestige, just to reiterate, we are seeing in the total U.S. market weakness, softness in both mass and prestige at Ulta Beauty specifically. We are gaining share in both categories due to the strategies and the brands that we brought in and the focus we've had in that category. But as I mentioned earlier, mass has performed better than prestige in recent quarters as that business has been a bit stronger for us.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes the time allocated for questions on today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mary Dillon for any closing comments.","Mary Dillon","Yes. I would just like to close by thanking our very hard working more than 44,000 associates for delivering another quarter of solid financial results and great guest experience every day. And we look forward to speaking with all of you again soon.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laurel Lefebvre, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin.","Laurel Lefebvre","Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Ulta's Fourth Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Hosting our call are Dennis Eck, interim Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are: Alex Lelli, Senior Vice President, Growth and Development; Janet Taake, Senior Vice President, Merchandising; and Jeff Severts, Senior Vice President, Marketing.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call which are not historical facts may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC.

Ulta has a strong and tenured leadership team. Scott, Alex, Janet and Jeff are among the key leaders driving Ulta's business forward.","We will take you through the fourth quarter numbers. Ulta drove terrific results in the fourth quarter, wrapping up another year of sales and earnings growth. We will share our expectations for continued excellent performance in 2013.","For those of you who are not familiar with my background, I have been the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of Ulta for the past 10 years. I've worked closely with the management team over the last decade. I'm honored to take on the role of interim CEO. Our primary focus is to maintain a high-quality business at Ulta. I will be working with other members of the Board to find the right CEO to lead Ulta in the years ahead. The search is underway. We are working with Herbert Mines and Associates, a top executive search firm, to identify the best possible candidate to lead this company.","You saw our announcement about Scott Settersten's appointment to the CFO role today. I'd like to congratulate him on his well-deserved promotion. With that, I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott M. Settersten","Thank you, Dennis. As you've seen in the results we announced this afternoon, the Ulta team delivered another very strong quarter and year. Ulta remains a compelling growth story, which continues to build upon our successful 5-point growth strategy.","To recap, the Q4 headlines. We grew the top line 30%, including the benefit of an extra week in the quarter. Comparable-store sales were 8% on top of 11.5% in Q4 of 2011. We were pleased with our sales in January, which benefited from our planned inventory investment. This allowed us to reduce stockouts and to come out of the holiday season in a healthy and stocked position, while ending the year with inventory levels more in line with the rest of the year. We increased operating margin 110 basis points from 12.6% in Q4 of last year to 13.7% this year. Earnings grew at 37% to $1 per share. These excellent results wrapped up a strong year in which we grew sales 25%, drove an 8.8% comp and delivered 41% earnings-per-share growth for the full year.","I'll go through the financial statements in more detail and talk to you about our plans for this year in a moment. But first, I'd like to ask the team to provide some updates on our progress with Ulta's 5-point multiyear growth strategy. One, accelerating store growth. Two, introducing new products, services and brands. Three, enhancing our loyalty program. Four, broadening our marketing reach. And five, increasing our digital focus, including ulta.com. First, I'd like to introduce Alex Lelli, our Senior Vice President of Growth and Development, to talk about our store growth. Alex has more than 30 years' experience in real estate development for big-box retail, and has been with Ulta since 2005. His team is responsible for real estate analytics, site selection and all the elements of getting leases signed and fixtures, stores, fixture and open. Over the course of the last 8 years, Alex and his team have quadrupled our store count, and the quality of the real estate and the new store productivity speak for themselves. Alex?","Alex J. Lelli","Thanks, Scott. Good afternoon, everyone. Ulta is a compelling store expansion story. And my team has the expertise, creativity and proven track record to deliver 15% to 20% annual square footage growth as we build out our 1,200-store plan. 2012 was an outstanding year for us, and here's why. We increased square footage by 23%, opened 102 new stores, relocated 3 and remodeled 21 stores. That is a significant increase in activity compared to 2011. Focusing just on the fourth quarter, we opened 13 new stores and ended the year with 550 stores in 45 states. We continue to be very pleased with new store productivity, driven by high-quality sites, a growing awareness of the Ulta brand and strong grand opening promotions.","Let's look ahead to 2013. We are in very good shape to execute our 125-store plan. The vast majority of the leases are already signed. The mix of stores in 2013 will look pretty similar to last year, with about 75% in existing shopping centers and the balance in new developments. About 1\/3 of the new stores will be in new markets, and the rest will fill in existing markets, again, similar to last year. We expect to open approximately 23 stores in the first quarter, 32 in the second quarter, 55 stores in the third quarter and 15 stores in the fourth quarter of 2013. We plan to remodel 7 stores, as our primary focus is on executing our accelerated new store rollout.","The portfolio is in great shape. 90% of the chain is in our newest formats. Looking ahead to the next several years, we continue to see a high-quality pipeline of potential real estate sites. The dealmakers on my team all have at least 25 years of experience in retail real estate. Ulta is benefiting from their tenure and creativity to find ways to deliver the best sites in an environment where there's very little new shopping center development. We are also enjoying the benefits of our solid network in the shopping center industry, and strong relationships with landlords, shopping center owners and brokers, since we are one of the few retailers to have such strong growth potential. Our debt free balance sheet and our ability to drive customer traffic to shopping centers makes us a tenant of choice.","We're also benefiting from the repositioning now taking place in the retail industry, with many retailers closing or downsizing stores. However, as we have always maintained, we will not compromise our standards for quality sites just to deliver the quantity of stores in our plan. I'd now like to introduce our Chief Merchant, Janet Taake, to discuss the second element of our growth strategy: introducing new products, services and brands. Janet has been with Ulta since 2008, and has more than 30 years of experience in retail merchandising. Janet and her team have added 65 new brands to the Ulta portfolio in the past 4 years and 20 last year alone, fueling the strong comp performance we've seen over the past few years. Janet?","Janet Taake","Thanks, Alex. Merchandising is the heart of the growth for Ulta. Introducing newness is a powerful tool to continually surprise and delight our guests. Our business continues to grow faster than the beauty market overall, as we strengthen our assortment with new brands, new products and new services. We continue to curate the offering with trend right products to make the guest experience compelling. With over 20,000 SKUs and 500 brands, we have unmatched breadth of assortment which continues to evolve almost daily.","In the fourth quarter, we gained share across all categories, with particular strength in prestige cosmetics and skin care. We see strong trends in nail, foundation, both women's and men's skincare, and high-tech tools like Clarisonic. Celebrity tie-ins with hair care brands are boosting the growth of brands like Living Proof with spokesperson Jennifer Aniston, and Alterna, with brand ambassador Katie Holmes. They will be both be very prominent in our marketing.","Looking ahead, the merchandising team continues to build a strong pipeline of new brands and new products to add to our assortment. Starting with some great news, just this week, Ulta became the only retailer approved to sell OPI nail polish online, and we launched the full OPI assortment on ulta.com, including the new Euro Centrale collection of spring colors. Nail continues to be an important trend, with personalization at the forefront, supported by nail art tools and seasonal color trends.","And now, let me touch on a few new prestige brands we're introducing. St. Tropez luxury bronzing products, Lipstick Queen, a line of lipsticks with a cult following, and Deborah Lippmann prestige nail lacquer, which we will be rolling out to 200 stores in Q1. In the skin care category, we are delighted to launch Perricone MD, a prestige brand known for its antiaging formulations and clinical efficacy. Perricone is a great addition to the assortment as we continue to build a complete skin care offering. Newness in fragrance continues to be strong with Coach Love, Jimmy Choo and Dolce & Gabbana The One Desire, all launching in Q1.","Moving on to brand expansions, we're excited to announce we're continuing the expansion of Clinique boutiques in 2013, on top of the 43 boutiques already opened at year end. These additional boutiques will be fairly balanced between our new stores in 2013 and existing stores, while adding more Clinique boutiques to create some short-term pressure on the P&L. This provides excellent long-term benefits to Ulta and our guests. We have also just rolled out our exclusive CK One cosmetics brand from 180 stores to all locations. Benefit brand boutiques continue their strong performance. We now have Benefit Brow Bars in 400 stores, and we will be adding brow tinting to the service menu this year.","For a quick update on our services business, salon performance was very strong in the fourth quarter, driven by cut and color. On the skin care side of the business, we're seeing nice growth in micro dermabrasion services, as well as strong response to special promotions on our menu of 20-minute targeted skin treatments.","Turning to Q1, we're now launching the new 2013 salon collection with new cutting, color and highlighting techniques, and we expect our salon business to have another solid year of market share gains and growing awareness of our high-quality salon services.","As you can see, the pipeline of newness for 2013 strengthens our position as a beauty authority to succeed in merchandising, you need a strong partnership with marketing, and I am delighted to be partnering with Jeff Severts, the newest member of the leadership team. Jeff joined Ulta last fall with 20 years' experience in multichannel retail and consumer products marketing. Jeff most recently led the marketing efforts for Carphone Warehouse in the U.K. and he built the Geek Squad brand at Best Buy from a local phenomenon to a national brand. Jeff?","Jeffrey Severts","Thank you, Janet. I've really enjoyed my first few months here. This company has a vibrant business model, with so much natural strength. And as a marketer, I see tremendous potential. The good news is that we are already doing the hardest part of marketing really well. We have over 11 million active loyalty program members who are shopping more frequently and spending more money with us. But the untapped opportunity is penetration. Tens of millions of women in our treating areas have yet to discover the Ulta brand.","We know what it takes to win customer loyalty, and we'll continue to leverage our proven methods. But now, benefiting from our increasing scale, we can begin to invest in marketing in a way that will allow us to reach those millions of potential customers. We expect those efforts to be mostly digital, and we look forward to providing you updates on our progress in the quarters ahead.","Now, let me take a step back to recap our efforts on 3 initiatives during the fourth quarter, and also give you a preview of our activities in Q1. In Q4, we continue to broaden our reach beyond our traditional strength in direct mail marketing. For the holiday season, we opened many of our stores at midnight on Black Friday, and built excitement with great deals and an integrated marketing campaign. Leading up to Christmas, we offered 11 days of daily holiday Hot Buys, driving excitement and strong sales with great offers on prestige brands. We also continue to evolve our social media strategy, with increased communication through Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter. In January, we refreshed our popular skin care event, rebranded Love Your Skin, this 3-week promotion offered daily in-store events and gifts-with-purchase to encourage customers to reassess their skincare regimens.","Turning to Q1, we kicked off the quarter with a spring beauty preview in partnership with Allure magazine, promoting the season's newness and highlighting tips and trends. In February, the Oxygen reality show The Face debuted amid great fanfare. The winner of the contest will become the newest face of Ulta, and we've been very pleased with the buzz about the program in social media and with the coverage we've received in national titles like InStyle and Marie Claire. This week, we launched our semiannual 21 Days of Beauty promotion. We are backing this event with our most integrated campaign to date, featuring the largest digital marketing push in our history.","Turning to our loyalty program, we continue to build our member base to well over 11 million active members. We are testing and refining how we use our new CRM platform that we implemented in Q3. We've had some early success using customer behavioral data to deliver more compelling, personalized offers. As we use this platform more, we expect to find more efficient and effective ways to drive traffic. As you know, we currently have 2 loyalty programs running in different parts of the country. We are still assessing the results of last April's conversion in the central region. Once we have a full annual cycle of data, we plan to quickly decide on the size and timing of subsequent conversions. Our goal and our expectation is that we have 1 national loyalty program.","Moving onto e-commerce, in the fourth quarter, we enjoyed strong growth on ulta.com and delivered significant enhancements to the site's stability and speed. We were very pleased with our dramatic improvements in site performance on Cyber Monday weekend despite record volume. Looking ahead to Q1 and beyond, this is a very important year for ulta.com as we invest in a major site redesign, as well as in people and supply chain capabilities to continue to accelerate our growth. In summary, Ulta has a huge opportunity to reach new customers who've never discovered our brand. And to be even more compelling to our existing guests with personalized marketing communication. I'll now hand it back over to Scott.","Scott M. Settersten","Thanks, everyone, for the update on our 5-point growth program and a reminder of the significant runway that remains in each leg of our strategy. Turning back to the detailed P&L, net sales were $758.8 million, an increase of 30.3% compared to sales of $582.5 million achieved in the fourth quarter of 2011. This included an extra week of sales which came in a bit stronger than our previous estimate of $35 million. Our 8% comp was fairly balanced between traffic and ticket during the quarter. On a 2-year basis, the comp was more consistent with our typical trend, with traffic being the primary driver. Gross profit margin increased 10 basis points to 34.2% from 34.1% in Q4 of last year.","We continue to see leverage and fixed store costs on our strong comp and increasing leverage in our supply chain on efficiency improvements from our new Chambersburg distribution center. These gains were offset by weaker merchandise margins, which were primarily driven by our guests' stronger focus on value, meaning they are taking greater advantage of our promotions and coupons. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased 100 basis points to 20.3%, compared to 21.3% in the fourth quarter last year, driven primarily by corporate overhead and marketing leverage. Preopening expense for the quarter was $1.9 million compared to $1 million in Q4 of 2011, due to adding 13 new stores compared to 7 stores last year. Operating margin rate increased 110 basis points to 13.7% compared to 12.6% a year ago, with operating income up 41.7% to $103.8 million. The tax rate was 37.8% compared to 36.7% in Q4 of last year. The difference in rate is due to timing with the year-over-year rate relatively flat. Net income per diluted share rose 37% to $1, compared to $0.73 last year. This year's fourth quarter included about $0.05 of earnings per share from the extra week in the period. Excluding the benefit of the extra week, earnings per share growth was approximately 30%.","Turning to the balance sheet. Regarding inventories. We are pleased with the improvements in our overall [indiscernible] position and the quality of our inventory. While the average per door at the end of Q4 is a bit higher than we originally planned, we expect the per door average to be below our comp growth by the end of Q1. Inventories at the end of the fourth quarter were $361.1 million, compared to $244.6 million at the end of Q4 last year. Total inventories increased 47.6%, and average inventory per store increased 20.5% compared to the prior year. Inventory balances were driven by the addition of 101 net new stores, $6 million of incremental inventory related to the 79 new prestige brand boutiques completed during the year, $20 million of planned strategic inventory investments in core product categories to reduce stockouts and ensure strong in stock levels coming out of the holiday season, a pull forward of roughly $10 million in inventory to better support timing changes in the early 2013 promotional calendar and $5 million due to the incremental new stores in the pre-open queue versus last year.","Capital expenditures were $44 million for the quarter and $189 million for the full year, driven by our new store program, remodels and systems and supply chain investments. Depreciation and amortization was $23 million for the quarter and $88 million for the year. For the year, we generated over $50 million of free cash flow and paid a $63 million special cash dividend.","Turning to our outlook for 2013. First, I'd like to cover a change in our communication practices going forward. Consistent with our plans to become a more integrated business that focuses the entire organization on the guest and how she wants to shop, e-commerce sales will be included in the comp beginning in Q1. With e-commerce currently representing a low single-digit percentage of our sales, this is not a material change from a financial perspective. That said, we have high expectations for growth in e-commerce this year. If we achieve our growth plans, e-commerce could add close to a point to the comp number. We will break out the impact of e-commerce sales each quarter for the first year.","In terms of our financial expectations for 2013, we plan to deliver another strong year. We expect to deliver comparable-store sales growth in the range of 4% to 6% for the year, including e-commerce. We expect square footage growth of approximately 22%, and to achieve earnings per share growth consistent with our long-term financial model. We have exceeded our growth expectations over the last couple of years, with the acceleration of our store rollout in iconic brand boutiques, expanding faster than we anticipated. All great things for the business.","To prepare for the next stage of Ulta's growth, we are increasing our investment in a number of areas that will support strong, sustainable growth, while still delivering on our long-term earnings growth expectations. As a result, we expect to achieve EPS growth at the low end of our long-term range of 25% to 30% growth compared to 2012 earnings per share, adjusted for the $0.05 of EPS attributed to the extra week in Q4. Earnings growth will be driven by continued operating margin expansion, offset by approximately $0.13 of earnings per share in incremental investments to maintain the long-term health of our business. We will continue to invest in store growth, in more prestige brand boutiques, in a more robust digital strategy, in our supply chain and systems capabilities and in customer service in our stores to support the rapid growth of our prestige brands in our mix.","Let me give you a bit more color on each of these areas of investment. In terms of our new store program, with 25 more stores opening in 2013 compared to 2012, the impact of higher pre-opening expense year-over-year is about $0.02 to $0.03 of earnings per share. The impact of a large number of immature stores, 100 opened in 2012, and 125 opening this year, will also put pressure on the P&L, resulting in $0.02 to $0.03 of deleverage.","Turning to our digital strategy, Ulta has a huge growth opportunity in e-commerce, in addition to the need to better integrate our store and online shopping experience. We plan to make a substantial investment in systems to enhance online and mobile capabilities through a complete site redesign, which encompasses improved search capabilities and expanded personalization functions. We'll also make investments in our people and marketing to support hypergrowth in our digital business. The goal is to improve the guest experience, grow sales and improve the integration into the stores. We estimate the impact on the P&L will be approximately $0.03.","Moving on to investments in supply chain. To ensure we are positioned to support our continued growth, we need to invest in several areas to maintain an efficient supply chain and continue to provide great guest, store associate and e-commerce experiences. This year, we will be expanding our e-commerce fulfillment capabilities into another of our existing distribution centers. We will also begin to plan for an additional DC to be added to the network in 2014. Included in the additional facility will be an upgrade to our warehouse management system and warehouse control system. New warehouse systems will improve productivity within the supply chain functions and allow Ulta to introduce new multichannel capabilities, such as direct-from-store ordering. These capabilities, combined with future POS software updates, will significantly improve the customer experience across channels. These supply chain changes represent a multiyear investment, and we expect the impact on 2013 earnings per share will be about $0.03.","Finally, we will invest in our in-store guest experience. We are planning to invest modestly in store payroll to ensure our guest experience is optimized, as we continue to offer more prestige products requiring more associate knowledge. We expect modesty leverage in store payroll, which will impact the P&L by about $0.02. Turning to capital allocation, we expect capital expenditures for the full year 2013 to be in a range of $225 million, about $36 million higher than our capital program in 2012, driven by 25 additional stores, expansion of our prestige brand boutiques, as well as systems and supply chain investments. Depreciation and amortization are expected to be approximately $105 million. We expect to generate strong free cash flow for the year, and we will continue to evaluate, with our board, the best use of any excess cash.","Turning now to the specific guidance for Q1. We are taking a conservative view of the sales environment, which assumes a continuation of the consumer behavior we saw in Q4. With that as a backdrop, let me give you our expectations for the first quarter and then circle back at the end to provide a little more insight into gross profit margin and SG&A. We expect to achieve sales in the range of $568 million to $577 million versus $474.1 million in Q1 of 2012. We expect comparable-store sales to increase in the range of 4% to 6%, including e-commerce. We plan to open 23 new stores versus 18 last year. We expect to achieve earnings per share in the range of $0.60 to $0.63, versus $0.54 in Q1 of 2012. This earnings guidance includes higher store opening expense and investments in systems and supply chain initiatives. It also includes costs associated with the additional Clinique boutiques. As we continue to expand our prestige boutiques, accelerated depreciation and other expenses to prepare to open the Clinique boutiques are expected to cost us about $0.01 of earnings per share in Q1.","Gross profit margin is expected to decline 140 basis points at the midpoint of the range. While we will uncharacteristically see gross margins decline in Q1, for the full year, we expect healthy gross margin expansion. SG&A rate is expected to decrease 50 basis points versus last year's 23.4% rate. Operating margin is expected to decrease approximately 90 basis points at the midpoint of the range versus 12.1% last year. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 38.3%. We expect a fully diluted share count of approximately 65 million shares.","Going back to profit margin. There are a number of margin challenges specific to Q1. A couple of the larger drivers for Q1 include first, product mix. We planned an Ulta private label gift-with-purchase offer early in Q1, which unfortunately got hung up in U.S. Customs. We quickly substituted a replacement offer, which was successful at driving units, but hurt our margin rate in Q1 by roughly 40 basis points. Second is the large number of immature stores in the base, which will drive 30 basis points of deleverage in fixed store costs versus Q1 of last year. Third, as you know, we transitioned the central region to our ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program at the end of Q1 last year. Our guests love the program and over the long term, ULTAmate Rewards will be a gross margin driver. However, compared to Q1 of last year, the central region change comparison will have a modest negative impact on margin. We are also assuming that customer behavior, focusing on promotion and value, will continue in the near-term. I'll repeat. For the full year, we expect to see healthy gross profit margin expansion.","With respect to SG&A, most all of the incremental 2013 investments we described earlier impact the SG&A line. The $0.13 of incremental expense generally flowed evenly throughout the year. While we expect the SG&A as a percentage of net sales to improve in Q1, it will be roughly flat to 2012 for the full year. We have consistently communicated that we are targeting a mid-teens operating margin over the next several years, and that the mix of leverage between gross profit and SG&A would fluctuate over time. We made significant progress toward our operating margin goal in fiscal 2012, and expect to continue to expand operating margin in fiscal 2013.","Just to reiterate our long-term view. We remain confident in delivering our long-term financial model based on 4% to 6% comps with 15% to 20% annual square footage growth, yielding 25% to 30% earnings growth and targeting a mid-teens operating margin in the medium term.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Dennis.","Dennis K. Eck","Thank you, Scott. I am very comfortable with our outlook for 2013. The Board of Directors and I work closely with the entire Ulta team to review and approve the plans for 2013. There have been no changes to the budget as presented to the board at the end of last year. We expect -- continue to derive market share gains and robust earnings growth. This is balanced with the need to invest in the long-term growth of this company. I am very proud of Ulta's 2012 performance and in each of our 16,000 associates for a compelling experience for our guests. We are managing our business for the long term, and we are making the right investments to support our vibrant growth story over many years to come.","With that, operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Hofkin from William Blair & Company.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just a couple questions first on the selling environment. You, obviously, finished up the fourth quarter a bit on an upswing. I'm just curious, I know you're not a monthly reporter, but baked into your guidance, have you seen any choppiness recently, similar to what some other retailers have talked about the last month or so? And how much is that informed your guidance? That's my first question.","Scott M. Settersten","Dan, yes. Again, back to our prepared remarks. The choppiness we saw in the fourth quarter and the increasing take on our promotions and coupons, we've seen that continue into the early stages of the first quarter. So again, when we put our guidance estimates together, we consider all the elements of the current environment that we're experiencing. So you can rest assured that all of that is baked into our current thoughts.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, is there anything baked in, for -- in terms of your full year view for the potential comp benefit from the accelerated pace of store growth that really kicked in around the middle of 2012?","Scott M. Settersten","Yes. Again, we take a very disciplined, detailed look at the way those new stores are stacked up. Again, we discussed that in the past with many of you. So we are very clear and understand what the impact is, and that again, that's baked into our full year view.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I mean, to some degree, does that imply some -- you're expecting some further deceleration, excluding that?","Scott M. Settersten","Further deceleration in the comp?","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","In the comp. Because to some degree, wouldn't that benefit only show up in the second half of the year, the benefit from the accelerated store growth?","Scott M. Settersten","Well, we look at the comp for the -- for any particular quarter for the full year. We're baking in a lot of different elements, not just the new store ramp or the, how the model stacks up in future periods. So we have to take into effect or into account what the customer's feeling, and how we're seeing them react to our ads and our promotions and take the total picture into account. And obviously, that impacts the older stores as well. Everything's that in the comp base, not just the new stores rolling into it.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, where have you seen the most in to -- and is it more response to gift-with-purchase on prestige offers? Is it in some of the mass brands, in terms of greater offtake of sharply price promoted product? Where are you -- is that a -- some color on that?","Scott M. Settersten","We really -- we haven't seen any trade down in the customer. Again, for the comp during the fourth quarter was evenly split between traffic and average ticket. That's a little bit unusual compared to our normal trend, which is primarily traffic driven to the stores, driving the comp. We see the customer, just -- there's just a greater take. They're really capitalizing on the promotions when they're out there. They're taking great advantage of that. More so than they had in the fourth quarters or holiday seasons over the last couple of years.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And competitively, is there anything that you've seen change in that regard, either e-commerce or other brick-and-mortar wise?","Scott M. Settersten","We haven't noticed. We keep an eye on our competitors across-the-board. There's a lot of them out there, in a lot of different categories. We haven't noticed any major changes in their competitive environment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I had some clarification questions for Janet, if I may. Janet, I think it's a huge deal what's going on here with you guys getting exclusive for OPI on dot com. I'd love to hear from your perspective, what -- how OPI approached that with you, and what it is about the nature of your relationship that you think allowed you to get that exclusivity. And then, just some clarification on the number of doors. How many doors are you planning for Perricone for this year? And then, I don't think we actually heard the official door count for the new Clinique doors in 2013. That would be helpful. And one final follow-up, just on the merchandising side here, would be pricing on salon. You're rolling out a new menu. Is your pricing on salon actually going to go higher?","Janet Taake","Neely, thank you for the questions. OPI, we've had a very long relationship and a very solid relationship with OPI. It goes back from the very beginning of Ulta, and we were very pleased that we were able to launch exclusively and approved to the OPI online, and that was done with great partnership with George Saber [ph], the principal of -- the starter and owner of Ulta, or excuse me, OPI prior to Cody [ph] owning it. That's -- we're very, very pleased and excited to have it online. Perricone is rolling to all doors, and that will be in the next several weeks. You will see it in all of our doors. We're very excited about that as well. And Clinique, we did not mention how many doors we're expanding to in 2013. We are still finalizing that with Clinique. And we're very, very pleased to continue the expansion, and we will have more information on that later on this year. But we have opened 6 already this quarter. So we're expanding as we speak.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And in terms of salon pricing, Janet?","Janet Taake","The salon pricing. It's really just trends. What we're introducing right now is really more trend and color, but the pricing has not changed. Color and cut are really the heartbeat of the salon business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Tunick from JP Morgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, two questions. I guess maybe for Scott, just as you give your comp view for 2013, and as you just ended the year, anything you can share in regards to maybe comps by class of store for 2012. Just curious what's happening to the more mature stores and if that's having any influence on what people will view as a conservative comp guide? And then maybe Dennis could share his thoughts on the CEO search. Obviously, you have a lot of projects going on in 2013. So what's your thoughts on timing, how long it might take to have a CEO? And maybe what the ideal candidate, in your view, would bring to the table?","Scott M. Settersten","Brian, I'll take the comp item first. Again, looking back at Q4 and 2012 as a whole, we reported an 8 comp for the fourth quarter and 8 8 for the full year. So when you go back and look at the individual classes, they're all contributing in a solid, positive manner. I mean the new stores are doing very well, at or above targets, and some of the older stores are still contributing in a very solid level. Looking forward to Q1, again, based on what the consumer environment we fill and the choppiness we've seen, Q4 into Q1, we just feel it's best to take a conservative view of what the future holds for us.","Dennis K. Eck","Okay, then I'll take on the CEO question. You saw in the announcement that we announced that we had a selected a search firm. We have a spec that we're working against. There will be a step where they come in and have a conversation with SVPs of the business just to get an understanding of the strength of the team that we have here. And as I've become more involved with the day-to-day, we've indicated earlier that we had a great sense of confidence in the Ulta management and their ability to execute the plans as they've laid them out. And that's increased as I've been here. So we would like to move as quickly as possible, but that said, we're incredibly focused on getting the right person to commit to Ulta because we have so many good things going. We have plans that we're driving forward. We're really looking for someone who could come in and as seamlessly as possible just lead us to the next iteration, the next generation of Ulta, and that's our goal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions about growth. I guess, first of all, to sum it up, what's the hurry, in terms of accelerating to 22% unit growth? I know this decision was made recently. It seems like it's straining the financial model to some degree. You don't have a direct competitor essentially chasing you. And then, this is really directed, Dennis, to you, and to the board as well as to the management team, because I know it's a group decision. So given that the P&L or at least its -- the trajectory of the P&L is feeling a bit of stress related to this growth at least relative to recent earnings growth rates, why the need to go above 20% from a unit perspective?","Dennis K. Eck","I think is the board looks at the ways that we can deploy the cash that we're generating from the business. We look at the ability to open new stores with a really high degree of certainty that they're going to perform, because we've -- our real estate group and our operations group have delivered that. So we see this as really a chance for us to continue to use our strong balance sheet to move quickly, and Alex might want to make a comment about the fact that there are a lot of opportunities that are coming forward. And we want to make sure that we're taking those opportunities so we get the right locations for the future.","Alex J. Lelli","That's true, Dennis. So we are finding that with the repositionings that's taking place with other retailers, in terms of their downsizing and closing and some vacancies that have occurred over the course of the last couple of years, that this is an opportunity to get into top-notch real estate locations that are successful on a traditional basis. And it's an opportunity to get in after the fact, so to speak, and get to play into game that has existed on some of these intersections for several years. So it's an opportunity to move quickly right now, when we have no particular competition of great note for the space that we're interested in.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Do you think you will have more competition? And do you worry about cotenants who risk as you make these moves?","Janet Taake","We couldn't hear you very well, Matt. Can you repeat that?","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure, sorry. Are you concerned about having more competition for this space a year or two out? And are you concerned at all about cotenancy, given some of the retail store closures that we've seen from some of your peers and other sub-sectors?","Alex J. Lelli","Well, there is downsizing taking place amongst some other bigger boxes that will provide some competition for the same size box that we're interested in. But our preferential treatment, so to speak, based on the attractiveness of our offering, is giving us primary attention from the landlord. So there could be competition in the future, but I think at this point in time, we're eliminating that by moving quickly into the space as it becomes available.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful, and just a quick follow-up. On the rhetoric of the investments, as you itemized, the allocation of investment dollars, differ. Items like payroll and some of the prestige buildouts, all of which I think are sort of part of the ongoing plan of our end of the business day-to-day. So if you could just clarify on what way these are really extraordinary investments, as opposed to sort of a cost of doing business on an ongoing basis?","Scott M. Settersten","Well, I guess to your point, Matt, your perspective on whether it's a normal cost of business or not, what we want to make sure that's clear to folks, is that it's an incremental spend over what you -- what was reflected in our P&L last year. So in the case of the store payroll and trying to improve the guest experience, the $0.02 that we mentioned there or the 10 basis points deleverage we'll see in the P&L is incremental to last year, and there's a good reason for it. It's trying to improve the in-store experience. E-commerce, we got a functional site today that we're able to transact business on. But we're a long way from best-in-class type of environment out there. So we need to go back in, we feel we -- this is the point in time we need to redesign the site and get some of the other functionality things really resolved.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erika Maschmeyer from Robert W. Baird.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Could you talk a bit about what you're looking for with the ULTAmate Rewards program before rolling it out further? Is this a margin hit, what you're [indiscernible] came out the most, and is it possible you could tweak the program before expanding it? I guess sort of any color there would be helpful.","Jeffrey Severts","Erika, this is Jeff. So as you know, we have the luxury of having 2 great programs with the old Beauty Club in half the country and ULTAmate Rewards in the central region. So we have the luxury of taking our time and getting this decision right, and that's why we're talking about getting a full annual cycle of customer behavioral data before we determine the shape and the timing of the conversions. The other practical reason for getting that full annual cycle of data is that it will better allow us to forecast our business when make that conversion. Because the shape of the customer's engagement in the program is a bit different. The old program pushes all the redemption into a couple of weeks within the quarter. The new program tends to spread that redemption out across the total quarter. So having more time to watch how she engages with this program, we think is going to let us make smarter decisions for the launch and help us better forecast our business.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's helpful. And then for Janet, kind of a follow-up to Neely's question. I mean, one of the fears that's out there, that the management turnover could stall the expansion of adding prestige brands. How would you respond to that? And then, could you walk us through the various relationship points that Ulta has with new brands, existing brands? And can you talk about where the relationship lie?","Janet Taake","Well, I will just tell you that our relationships with all of our vendors are very, very strong, and we continue to improve every day on looking at brands we want to bring in and reaching out to those vendors. So our relationships are very solid. My merchant team and I continue to work on that. I think that the vendor community is very appreciative of our ethics and our straightforward partnership that we have in the marketplace. And that we're a growth retailer and we continue to introduce newness to our stores and to our guests, most importantly, and they want to be a part of that. But we have very, very strong vendor relationships.","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay great, and Scott, could you quickly clarify the -- on the past, you guys have provided some additional color on the breakout, basis-point-wise between a past fixed store leverage, fixed store comps leverage on the supply chain and merchandise margins?","Scott M. Settersten","For what period are you referring to?","Erika K. Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","For Q4. And then if you could talk about how you expect that to play out, that would be helpful as well.","Scott M. Settersten","Yes, well, at Q4 2012, the margin improvement was merely driven by fixed store cost leverage. Again, I think I mentioned in our prepared remarks that merchandise margin was weaker during fourth quarter. That kind of held us back from where we expected to be for the quarter. As we look to next year, again Q1 kind of prevents a type of perfect storm, as far as merchandise margin is concerned. So again, we are facing some challenges there. We do expect that the drivers in Q1 will have largely abate or will become more moderate as we go into Qs 2 through 4. So we do expect merchandise margin, we do expect leverage there in the back half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Balter from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Simeon Gutman for Gary. Scott, first following up on gross margins on Q4. It was still a little below trend. I think you mentioned the merchandise came in a little light. If you can share a little more color on that. And then, the second part, Scott, just to paraphrase what you said, if the investment spend, the incremental investment spending is spread evenly across next year, then it's just really a gross margin issue in the first quarter, and that gross margin issue technically goes away and therefore, that's what the acceleration in the EBIT and EPS growth is explained by?","Scott M. Settersten","Now let me take the first one on Q4. Again, just to refresh everyone's memory, Q4 historically has been our most challenging quarter to try to expand gross profit margin. Again and, we compete with all other retailers out there for the gift giving space, the promotional environment's a lot more aggressive during Q4 than it is the rest of the year. And what we saw in 2012 during the holiday was just a bit more of a challenge than it has been in recent years. That's what drove some of the weakness in merchandise margin. As far as looking at 2013, yes, again, I'd reiterate the investments deuce, kind of rolled smoothly throughout the course of the year, and we do expect to see merchandise margin expansion after we get past Q1. We've generated positive operating margin expansion in 2012 and then we expect to do that again in 2013.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Gary. Let me just, as a follow-up. Because we've seen now a few companies, not just you guys, but others that have said we're increasing our investment spend, and that's going to have an impact on earnings. And how do we think about that over the longer term? Because obviously, you're always investing for the future. So why is this investment spend something that wasn't spent last year? And what does it imply for future years? Like how should we build that into the model?","Scott M. Settersten","Let say, if I look at the laundry list, Gary, in new stores, the $0.05 -- $0.05 or $0.06 in total there that we're talking about, again, is something yet to be determined. We're not -- we haven't decided on what the 2014 new store plan looks like. As far as e-comm is concerned, I would say that our 2013 investment represents a fairly large portion of what we think we would need to put into that element of the business here over the medium term. When it comes to supply chain, I would characterize that as sort of a down payment. The $0.03 we're talking about this year, really relates to kind of the investigation process and trying to figure out exactly what it is we want to build. So there'll be more pets [ph], primarily expense this year. The capital will follow on top of that, the back half of 2013 into '14. So we'll give you more color on that when we get closer to figuring out what that looks like.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just one more back to gross margin, this is Simeon again. Some of the Q1 headwinds, you mentioned the product mix with purchase, I mean the mix -- gift-with-purchase, that we can get and can go away. The large number of an immature stores, I mean, last year you had a big step up versus the prior year and I guess this year, we're only going to see more. So why does that abate? And then, to rewards program impact, I take it that means you're not going to be putting more regions on the rewards program as the year progresses?","Scott M. Settersten","Fixed store cost, deleverage, you're correct, that, that's going to be a headwind for the majority of the year. It's a fairly large bucket in first quarter. We want to just remind folks of that. The loyalty program, I will say the customers love the program;, we love the program. The cost is not necessarily going to be an inhibitor on whether we move forward with that or not. To Jeff's point, we just want to make sure we understand how the guest is going to react to this over a full cycle so that we can predict with certainty what the future's going to hold there.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, and then one final question for Janet, if I can sneak it in. If you look, and you've done -- the company's done a great job adding and winning these brands, and if you look at, collectively, all the brands that you carry, how much of the prestige market do you think those represent? And that's not asking what Ulta's share is, but just more of, of all the brands that you represent, how much of the market are you looking at? And then much more is, obviously, left to go?","Janet Taake","That's a very broad market and if you're speaking just the prestige color, is that what you're referring to?","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes.","Janet Taake","It's very -- there's more to come. We have grown the portfolio considerably over the last several years, but there are many brands that we would still love to have in our home. So as I said before, we continue to evaluate the productivity and look for new brands and have conversations on an ongoing basis, but there's a large space still.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evren Kopelman from Wells Fargo.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Scott, I think I heard you say in the fourth quarter the comp, the ticket traffic was more balanced. If that's right, the ticket maybe contributed four points. I was a little surprised to hear that because of the higher uptake on coupons you mentioned and the promotional environment in Q4. Can you give us a little more color, what drove that ticket?","Scott M. Settersten","Yes. You're right, that is what I've said, that the comp was driven equally by traffic and by ticket. In the fourth quarter, we saw average selling place was up a little bit. Units were flat, so really, that's what was driving the ticket side of it. Again, we've seen this vary quarter-to-quarter over the long term, Evren. Over the long term, we expect traffic to be the major driver of the comp, and it does vary quarter-to-quarter, depending exactly on what we're promoting in our circulars and magalogs.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then on the store maturation, I guess model that you had shared, the 5-year, how the stores mature, do you -- would you expect any of that to change in now that you're opening a lot more stores?","Scott M. Settersten","I'm thinking back through the store model here. I'm just putting it through my imagination here. I don't foresee any major changes in how those stores stack up. I mean, they're still -- the model that we've posted is still the model that we're following. The stores again, the new stores are still performing very well. First year sales are at or above our targets. There's some minor variance in some of the CapEx numbers that we have in the model, but it doesn't have any material effect on what the overall payback is on a cash on cash basis over the model term.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So there's the sales growth rates in a year 2 or 3, those will remain within the, I guess numbers that you've shared in the past, you think, then?","Scott M. Settersten","We're still -- again, based on what we've seen through fiscal 2012, those numbers still hold up.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then lastly, I wanted to ask on brands, big brands like the Lancome and Clinique, in the stores that you have them, I mean, what kind of impact should we expect on the traffic or the comp from the introduction of such a large brands and kind of the boutiques in these stores? If you can give us any help in picturing what kind of lift that has, that would be great.","Scott M. Settersten","Evren, where we're still, really in the early stages of implementing or rolling out the Clinique boutiques. So while we feel comfortable and confident that it's going to help the total box, it's going help the comp over the long term, it's really not a significant impact at this point in time. Again, as we look at 2013, Janet mentioned that the advancement of that is going to be split between new stores and comp stores, fairly evenly. So again, there won't be as large an impact on the comps. Some of that's going to be in the non-comp or new store bucket.","Operator","Our next question comes from Irwin Boruchow from Sterne Agee.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I actually have 2 quick questions. So we've heard a lot of questions about how the new stores are kind of hitting the maturity curve profile and things like that. I'm actually curious more about the more mature stores, the stores that are 6, 7, 8 years old. Are you seeing any change there, are those stores comp-ing? I think you'd mentioned over the last 12 months they were still comp-ing, low to mid- single digits. Just curious, any change with the more mature store footprint you have? And then, the second question is, I think you stated that you expect similar impact on the SG&A line from investments throughout the year in each quarter? But you're guiding a 4% to 6% comp and 50 bps of leverage in Q1, and also a 4% to 6% comp for the year, but implying deleverage for the remaining 3 quarters. So just -- can you kind of walk us through why the leverage had turned to deleverage on similar top line, Q2 through Q4, versus Q1?","Scott M. Settersten","As far as the comp lead is concerned, again, through the end of 2012, we haven't seen any change in the way those old stores are maturing or producing. Again, still low single digits overall for some of the oldest stores. As far as the deleverage points go in 2013, again, I think it's more of a timing thing, on what we see when some of those -- how those investments play against some of the other things we're doing in the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Altobello from Oppenheimer & Co.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Two quick points of clarification. I guess, Scott, first in terms of gross margin, you mentioned obviously down pretty significantly in the first quarter, and then up for the year. Are you guys assuming that the customer focus on value dissipates throughout the year, or the other drivers you're talking about really going to offset that?","Scott M. Settersten","Yes, it's -- we're not assuming any change in consumer behavior. It's some of the other things that I mentioned, the mix item in the first quarter, just some other smaller things. Again, when you add up a bunch of small numbers, they kind of turn into something, but we don't want to get into all the details of it. So again, it's merchandise margin, deleverage in the first quarter, but course correcting as we get deeper into the year.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay and then secondly, in terms of the investments you're making this year, is it fair to characterize some of those as catch-up investments, or it's just that, the fact that, that because of the timing of them, that they tend to be somewhat lumpy?","Scott M. Settersten","Each one has a slightly different story, Joe. The supply chain, when you look at that one specifically, for example, why we opened up Chambersburg, D.C. earlier this year, we're very happy with the productivity there. That decision was made 2-plus years ago. So since that point in time, a lot of things have changed. We've accelerated the store program, the dot com business, we're kind of breaking out at the seams here in Romeoville. So it seemed like the proper time to a little bit more whiteboarding and kind of figure out what the long-term answer is there. So that's kind of what's driving that one. As far as e-commerce is concerned, we've been making investments there, to earlier points here. What we're looking at this year is a significant step up in that.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just one last one, and I apologize, this is a bit unfair for you guys, but you talked about the potential uses of cash, my screen, you're stocks at a bit of $75.10. Any thoughts to repurchases?","Scott M. Settersten","Well, we ended the year with roughly $320 million of cash on the balance sheet. Not all of that is excess cash, right? We need some here to run the businesses by way of working capital. Management and the board continuously assesses the best use of excess cash. Always with an eye on what provides the best return for shareholders. So, rest assured that, that we're watching out to see what the best use is.","Dennis K. Eck","We've had that conversation on an ongoing basis between the board and the management.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Wu from Telsey Advisory Group.","David Wu","In terms of the retail expansion, obviously, you continue to open up many of your stores and power centers and was wondering if you're starting to shift perhaps more of your openings toward mall-based locations? And what you think the opportunity there is? And if the profitability dynamics are different from the power centers?","Dennis K. Eck","We have already several mall stores in our portfolio and we expect to continue to add additional in-mall locations when it makes strategic and financial sense. We'll look at quality malls with high occupancies, solvent anchor tenants and good population density. Our preference however, still remains with big-box power centers, best of the breed co-tenants. The performance of our mall stores to date have been very good, and we continue to be very strategic and scrutinize those locations carefully to continue to maintain that excellent performance.","David Wu","And would you say the 4-wall profitability are pretty similar as the power centers?","Dennis K. Eck","Yes. In fact, in some cases, we're seeing an improved profitability, and I think a lot of that has to do with our heavy scrutiny of the site selection process when we do go into malls.","David Wu","Great. And in terms of marketing, can you perhaps talk about your ad spending plans for the year? And if you're planning to allocate the marketing mix differently from last year. I mean, it looks like you're doing a little bit more TV with the partnership with The Face, and want to know whether you've seen some good sales traction with some of these new initiatives?","Jeffrey Severts","This is Jeff. In terms of marketing, we're looking to build on what's been so successful for us, which at the heart, is our direct mail marketing capability and our loyalty programs. And, but as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the real opportunity is around penetration. So we're looking to add on top of what we do so well, marketing efforts oriented at reaching some of these customers who just aren't terribly familiar with the brand or in some cases, have never heard of us. So that doesn't mean more spending per se. That opportunity is afforded us by the increased scale that we're enjoying here as we grow. So we keep what we've got, we refine it, but now we're able to layer on this group of efforts against trying to get new customers into this tremendous loyalty machine we have.","David Wu","And then just lastly, just for clarification on the promotions, is -- would you say sort of the gross margin impact, how much of it is tied to sort of the increase in the level or number of promotions and coupons versus last year, versus sort of consumers just choosing to buy a more discounted product. Is there a sort the way to parse that out?","Janet Taake","We didn't add any promotions in the quarter, but it would be that they're really enjoying the advantage of coupons and taking advantage of the promotions of the store. But we did not add any additional promotions on top of last year's calendar.","David Wu","And in term -- in coupons as well?","Janet Taake","Yes. Coupons is part of our mailers and our tabs, yes.","Operator","Our last question is coming from Jason Gere from RBC Capital Markets.","Jack Kindregan","This is Jack Kindregan on for Jason. I was just wondering if you could clarify the -- in terms of your expansion, the leases you've already signed, you have focused more on, more urban versus suburban markets there?","Alex J. Lelli","Our focus is more oriented towards suburban markets. And 75% of our sites are located in existing markets.","Operator","I'll now turn the floor back over to Scott Settersten for our closing comments.","Scott M. Settersten","I'd like to say thank you all for your interest in Ulta, and we look forward to speaking with you all soon.","Operator","This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"20947":["Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance (NASDAQ:ULTA) Q1 2013 Earnings Call June 11, 2013  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Laurel Lefebvre - Vice President of Investor Relations","Dennis K.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laurel Lefebvre, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Laurel Lefebvre","Thank you for joining us for Ulta's first quarter 2013 conference call. Hosting our call are Dennis Eck, interim Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are Janet Taake, Senior Vice President, Merchandising; and Jeff Severts, Senior Vice President, Marketing.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's safe harbor language.

Eck","Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to announce a strong first quarter with better-than-expected sales and margin performance. The team is executing our 5-point strategy very well and our outlook for continued market share gains is excellent.","To update you on our CEO search, we are making good progress. We have been very happy with the high quality of candidates. As expected, there's a high level of interest in this opportunity. The Board of Directors is partnering with our search firm, Herbert Mines, where we are working through a comprehensive process to identify the best candidate. We hope to conclude our search in the near future.","With that, I would turn over to Scott.","Scott M. Settersten","Thanks, Dennis. 2013 is off to a good start with solid first quarter results. To recap the Q1 headlines, we grew the top line 22.9%. Comparable store sales increased 6.7%, including the impact of our E-Commerce business, which had a very strong quarter with 70% top-line growth. This compared to a 10.1% retail only comp in Q1 of 2012. Operating income increased 17.8%, while operating margin declined 50 basis points to 11.6%. Earnings per share increased 20.4% to $0.65 per share.","I'll walk you through our financials in more detail in a moment but first, the team and I will update you on our progress with Ulta's 5-point multi-year growth strategy, which includes: one, accelerating store growth; two, introducing new products, brands and services; three, enhancing our loyalty program; four, broadening our marketing reach; and five, increasing our digital focus including e-commerce. I'll start with the real estate discussion. In the first quarter, we opened 26 net new stores and in Q1 with 576 doors in 46 states, representing 24% square footage growth. We added our first store in South Dakota in Sioux Falls in Q1. New store productivity continues to be very good, driven by a high-quality real estate, growing brand awareness, dedicated resources for our brand opening events and marketing programs to help stores get off to a great start. We recently updated our store model to reflect the most current data for sales, capital and inventory. New stores are starting out a bit stronger than they have historically at roughly $2.8 million per store in year 1. They still ramp up to $4 million on average in year 5 and then are expected to continue to comp modestly thereafter. We spend about $1 million per store in capital and receive landlord allowances of $600,000 per store on average.","Inventory, net of payables, has gone up slightly to about $500,000 per store. As a result of the increase in our mix of higher value Prestige products. Preopening expenses decreased as we've shortened the time it takes to get stores opened and gain some scale efficiencies. All in, the total new store investment is about $1 million. The payback period hasn't changed. It is still roughly 2 years. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of the portfolio and are already making good progress on next year's new store program with roughly 50 sites already approved.","Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we are on track to execute our 125 new store plan. We expect to open 29 stores in Q2, 54 stores in Q3 and 16 stores in fourth quarter of 2013. We're on track with our plan to remodel 7 stores and we'll end the year with less than 40 stores in older formats, well over 9% of the changes in our newest formats, which we refer to as level 6 or 7.","Now, I'll turn it over to Janet Taake, SVP of Merchandising to update you on new products, brands and services.","Janet Taake","Thanks, Scott. Newness continues to be the primary driver of our comp sales growth. In terms of categories, Prestige Cosmetics and Skincare continue to grow at a rapid pace offset by softer performance in the more mature hair care tools category. To recap newness of note in the first quarter, we were pleased with the new brand launches of St. Tropez self bronzers, Lipstick Queen and the addition of Deborah Lippmann prestige nail lacquer in 200 stores. Perricone MD skin care line got off to a very strong start, we introduced HairMax, an FDA clear appliance for in-home treatment of hair loss for men and women, continuing to strengthen our offer in response to the trend and high-tech beauty tools in hair growth and hair-thickening solutions.","In terms of brand expansions, we completed our rollout of our exclusive brands CK One color cosmetics to the entire chain. We also launched some exciting new products within existing brands Urban Decay Oz, the great and powerful palettes; Clarisonic, limited-edition colors and Ultra CHI styling tools and new patterns. We introduced Living Proof good hair kits and Color Wow root cover-up, both exclusively available at Ulta.","For Mother's Day, to highlight the fragrance category including the new fragrances launched in Q1, we offered new and exclusive pastel totes as our gift with fragrance purchase. We also featured a customizable cosmetic bag with an Ulta brand product purchase.","On the services side, we continue to expand benefit brow waxing services now in almost 400 stores and after testing new brow tinting service in Q1 with strong results, we are now rolling it out to our Benefit Brow Bars.","To preview some of the newness in the current quarter, we're launching Sarah McNamara skincare this week. Sarah McNamara is a beauty industry veteran who developed her breakthrough product, Miracle Skin Transformer a few years ago and quickly developed a cult following. We are launching several brands of CC creams, or color corrector creams, in Q2 following on the heels of a hot trend BB creams, or beauty balm creams, that we've enjoyed over the past several quarters. We are also introducing a line of men's skin and body care products this quarter under the Ulta brand.","High-tech beauty continues to be a strong trend. Tria, a laser hair removal device, is an FDA-cleared device for home use. We had launched this new product in select stores and on ulta.com in the second quarter. NuBrilliance, a tool from microdermabrasion at home. NuFace and LightStim, new products skin rejuvenation and wrinkle treatments, were also launched this quarter.","Another trend is tools and products for healthier hair. We introduced Jose Eber and Rowenta professional quality hair care tool during the quarter. Jose is a celebrity hairstylist whose collection of high-quality appliances improves hair health with infrared light technology. On the product side, we introduced Redken's line of diamond oil haircare products designed to improve hair strength and shine. We also launched Ojon's rare-blend deep conditioners and a line of damage reverse conditioning products.","To update you on Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me, we're very pleased with the performance of these boutiques and our partnership with these brands. We continue to expand our partnership with Clinique with 8 new boutiques added during the first quarter ending Q1 with 51 boutiques, and we plan to continue to add boutiques throughout the year. We're also delighted to announce that we will open another 25 Lanc\u00f4me boutiques this fall, adding to the 80 boutiques we operate today. We ended last year with 79 Lanc\u00f4me boutiques and we just opened an Urban Store on Walnut Street in Philadelphia, including a Lanc\u00f4me boutique. By the end of this year, a significant percentage of the chain will have either a Clinique or Lanc\u00f4me boutique.","Turning to salon services, our salons performed very well in the first quarter. Driving strong sales growth through effective promotions like our Cut, Color, Style package offer. Other contributors to our salon business' strong performance includes improved integration between the stores and salon teams, improved career development plans for our associates, leading to reduced turnover, as well as excellent technical training on hair color and new hair trends.","In terms of new services, we have now fully rolled out microdermabrasion skin services in all our stores, and we will begin to market this service this month. After testing hair extension services earlier in the year, we launched this new service, chain-wide during Love Your Hair promotion in May. We are now testing eyelash services by our skin therapists in select stores. With encouraging early results as a result of great execution and broadening our service offering, we've seen good growth in our guest count as well as improvements in average ticket and customer retention. In some, whether it's on the product or service side, we're very excited about the pipeline of newness this year and our ability to translate current trends and a curated assortment that is compelling to our guests.","Now, I'll turn it over to Jeff Severts, SVP of Marketing, to cover enhancing our loyalty programs, broadening our marketing reach and increasing our digital focus.","Jeffrey Severts","Thank you, Janet. I'd like to highlight some of our marketing activities during the first quarter. And then preview some key second quarter events. I'll also update you on our loyalty program and CRM platform and, finally, provide some color on the performance of our E-Commerce business.","Our most important promotion in Q1 was the signature 21 Days of Beauty, an event that our guest anxiously await twice a year for the daily beauty steals and in-store events focused on Prestige brands. We have significantly increased our resources dedicated to positioning ourselves as a beauty and trend authority and this season's efforts featured an array of new marketing assets with a special emphasis on digital, including a display advertising campaign featuring rich media units and a social media content and Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest. A dedicated online landing page allowed customers to view that day's upcoming and upcoming beauty steals as well as the schedule of all our in-store events. The page also allowed customers to register to receive digital reminders throughout the event, so that they won't miss any of their favorite steals. We further enhanced our traffic driving efforts by utilizing Ultimate Rewards bonus point promotions to targeted customers via our CRM platform. Overall, it was our most integrated campaign to date and an exciting first step in our efforts to expand our marketing reach.","On the public relations front, we were pleased with the brand impressions generated by our sponsorship of the reality show The Face. In late March, the winner of the show's modeling contest was announced. Her name is Devyn. She will become The Face of Ulta beauty in our marketing campaigns for this fall and holiday season.","Looking ahead to the second quarter, we got off to a strong start with our Love Your Hair event. We are supporting Love Your Hair with a digital marketing campaign, similar in size and scope to what we did for 21 Days of Beauty. And for the first time ever, we have featured a celebrity on the cover of our direct mail magazine, Jennifer Aniston. Jennifer is the part owner and spokesmodel for the Living Proof brand, an important and fast-growing vendor in our professional hair category.","Turning to our loyalty programs. Last quarter we updated you on the status of our points-based program, ULTAmate Rewards. We shared that we wanted to assess a full year of customer data post last year's April conversion before making the final decision on the shape and timing of the next stage. We have recently completed our analysis of those data. While we have always known that ULTAmate Rewards is strongly preferred by our customers, we can now say with confidence, that this program also drives higher customer frequency and sales per customer. Consequently, we are announcing today our plan to convert the remaining 50% of the country to ULTAmate Rewards in Q1 of 2014. While we want to make this conversion as quickly as possible, we also want to be prudent about how much change we expose our employees and customers to during our most important season. With the supply chain project, website redesign and our aggressive store rollout plan already on the docket, we have decided that the smartest course for us is to wait until we're through the holiday period before we execute this final stage. This will support excellent execution of this complex process, which will involve significant planning and synchronization across systems, training, marketing and customer service.","One of the reasons we prefer the points program is that it allows for more effective use of our new CRM platform. Since implementing the CRM tool in late Q3 of last year, we've substantially ramped up our CRM activity. During the first quarter, we executed 25 e-mail campaigns targeted at specific customer segments, hoping to drive more traffic through more relevant and timely offers. Using a variety of approaches, including loyalty program bonus points, product discounts and free gifts with purchase, we continue to refine our understanding of what works best. In Q1, these campaigns posted strong incremental results over our mass e-mail efforts, exciting us, our customers and our vendors, who will now have a new means of growing their brands and gaining trial for their products.","Going forward, we will build on these successes and continue to expand our utilization of this platform. To that end, we've hired a new leader to further build out our customer analytics function. We have already made substantial progress in approving this capability and intend to be best-in-class at understanding our customers' behaviors, insider channels and applying those insights across our business.","Turning to e-commerce, our online sales delivered better-than-expected top line growth in Q1, while improving margin rate. Growth was driven primarily through strong sales of Prestige cosmetics and skin care and continued success with our beauty breaks and other online-only offers. Ulta.com had great success in acquiring new customers to this channel, especially during our 21 Days of Beauty promotion. To update you on the website redesign project, we are on track for delivery of the full site redesign by this fall. In Q1, we made some foundational improvements including enhancements to our rewards program, Customer Account Center, and it's the landing pages for Ulta's iOS and Android mobile apps. This quarter, we will deploy a streamline checkout process, hoping to enhance our online conversion. To further support our rapid growth in e-commerce, we continue to step up the team with new talent and we are expecting to launch this summer additional fulfillment capabilities in our Chambersburg distribution center.","Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made in the past few months in marketing, loyalty, CRM and our digital strategy. I'll now hand it back over to Scott.","Scott M. Settersten","Thanks, Jeff. Turning to a more detailed discussion of our financial results, first quarter sales were $582.7 million, an increase of 22.9% compared to sales of $474.1 million achieved in Q1 of 2012. Our 6.7% comp was fairly balanced between traffic and ticket during the quarter, as a result of good discipline around promotional activity, an increase in mix of our higher ticket items as we added more Prestige cosmetics and skincare to the assortment. Our same-store sales increase reflects 140 basis points of benefit from our E-Commerce business, which grew 70% during the quarter. Gross profit margin decreased 100 basis points to 35% from 36% in Q1 of last year. The gross margin leverage, most of which we outlined in our Q4 call, included a number of unusual items compared to the prior-year period, including inventory receipts flow and the conversion of our central region to our points-based loyalty program, both of which we have now anniversaried.","We also had the onetime negative impact from our private label Gift-With-Purchase issue and continue to see our customers' increased focus on value. The gross margin decline was less than we had forecast due to a slightly better fixed store cost leverage and stronger product margins as we manage promotional activity in a very disciplined way. SG&A expense as a percentage of sales decreased 60 basis points to 22.8% compared to 23.4% in the first quarter of last year, driven by corporate overhead and advertising expense leverage. These gains were offset by deleverage in store labor as we began to invest in higher service levels and labor to support our increased mix of Prestige products, which require a higher level of guest service.","Preopening expense for the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $2.5 million in Q1 of 2012, due to adding 28 new stores compared to adding 18 new stores and relocating 1 store last year. Operating margin rate decreased 50 basis points to 11.6% compared to 12.1% a year ago with operating income up 17.8% to $67.7 million. The tax rate was 38.2% compared to 39.3% in Q1 of 2012, primarily due to changes in our state tax liabilities. Net income per diluted share rose 20.4% to $0.65, compared to $0.54 last year.","Turning to the balance sheet, starting with inventory. Inventories at the end of the first quarter were $442.1 million, compared to $332.1 million at the end of Q1 of 2012. Total inventory increased 33.1%, an average inventory per store increased 7.9% compared to the prior year. Growth in total inventory was driven by the addition of 109 net new stores opened in the past year, and inventory related to the additional Prestige brand boutiques. Our inventory is healthy with very low obsolescence risk.","When we gave guidance in March, we said we expected inventory per door growth to be slightly less than comp growth. Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was actually up about 1 point higher than comp growth. The slightly higher per door inventory increase was primarily due to a shift in the opening schedule of 6 stores in 2Q, moving them earlier in 2Q resulting in us bringing in the inventory at the end of Q1. For the second quarter, we expect inventory per door to be somewhat higher due to the investments in the Prestige brands boutiques and new brand launches that Janet mentioned. For the full year, we expect our inventory per store to grow in line with our comp growth.","Capital expenditures were $42 million for the quarter driven by our new store program, the addition of Prestige boutiques and systems and supply chain investments. Depreciation and amortization were $25 million for the quarter. After authorizing a share repurchase program in March, for an aggregate amount the $150 million, we repurchased 500,500 shares of our stock at an average cost of $74.58 per share for a total of $37 million.","Before we discuss our guidance for Q2 and the year, I'd like to mention a coming change to our disclosure practices. We have decided to discontinue announcing holiday sales and updating Q4 guidance in early January. This was a practice dating from our previous participation in the ICR Conference in mid- January, when we are in our normal, quiet period cycle.","Now, turning to our outlook for the full year. We remain committed to delivering results for the full year 2013, consistent with our long-term financial model. This model is based on 4% to 6% comps with 15% to 20% annual square footage growth, yielding 25% to 30% earnings growth and targeting a mid-teens operating margin in the medium-term. We are maintaining our previous guidance for 2013. We expect to deliver comparable store sales growth in the range of 4% to 6% for the year, including e-commerce. We expect to grow square footage approximately 22% and we expect to achieve earnings-per-share growth at the low end of our long-term range of 25% to 30%, adjusted for the 53rd week in 2012. We expect to spend about $225 million in CapEx, including approximately $125 million for new stores and $100 million for everything else, including merchandise fixtures, remodels, initial investments and a new D.C. plant for 2014 and other systems and e-commerce capital needs. Depreciation and amortization are expected to be approximately $105 million. We expect to generate strong free cash flow for the year and we'll continue to evaluate with our Board the best use of any excess cash.","Turning now to second quarter guidance. We expect to achieve sales in the range of $579 million to $589 million versus $481.7 million in Q2 of 2012. We expect comparable store sales to increase in the range of 4% to 6%, including the benefit from e-commerce sales. We plan to open 29 new stores versus 22 last year. We expect to achieve earnings-per-share in the range of $0.64 to $0.67 versus $0.54 in Q2 2012.","Gross profit margin is expected to increase 40 basis points at the midpoint of the range. We expect healthy product margin expansion and modest supply-chain leverage offset by the impact of cost associated with preparing for Lanc\u00f4me and Clinique boutiques and modest deleverage of fixed store cost driven by our accelerated store growth.","SG&A rate is expected to increase 70 basis points at the midpoint of the range versus last year's 22% rate. Driven by investments in store labor to improve the guest experience, in supply chain, as we develop our blueprint for the future, and in e-commerce, as we accelerate growth in that business and prepare to deliver a better guest experience.","Operating margin is expected to decrease approximately 20 basis points at the midpoint of the range versus 11.9% last year. For the full year, we continue to expect to make meaningful progress towards our mid-teens operating margin target. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 38.3% and we anticipate a fully diluted share count of approximately 64.7 million shares.","In summary, we plan to deliver very strong growth in sales and earnings while continuing to invest in the long-term health and sustainability of our business.","With that, operator, please open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gary Balter with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's Simeon Gutman for Gary. Gary's right next to me give, I was just -- he's driving, that was his shut out. Scott, last quarter we talked about gross margin and there was some promotional, I guess, spending but there was some promotion that the business is, over time, going to be weaned off of it to some degree. Can you give us some color on that? Did that begin in the first quarter and then how did that progress as the year goes on?","Scott M. Settersten","Just as a reminder. For first quarter, we guided gross profit margin down roughly 140 basis points at the midpoint of the guidance range. So comp store sales were a bit better, so we did get some leverage on fixed store cost, which helped, overall. We also saw product mix towards Prestige skin care and color cosmetics continued its strength, so that helped margin rate overall for the first quarter. E-commerce also helped us quite a bit. It was a tailwind as that business continues to scale up. With respect to the promotional environment, the first quarter, we kind of ran head-to-head. Things kind of shook out the way we expected them to. As we talked about that in the big, big scheme of things, our intention, over the long-term, is to moderate some of the general coupon drop, so to speak, and so offset that with a bit more of the CRM initiative, to do more one-on-one, more sophisticated marketing with our customers. So that's the trend. As Jeff mentioned, we've had some good successes there. We've been ramping up the efforts there. We've seen some good, positive results. But again, we're still in the very early stages of the CRM tool and platform.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then one follow-up for Janet. She mentioned a couple of the categories per segment that's strong or that are outperforming some of the other categories. Can we just drill a little bit more deeply into the 2, I think, that you called out on the positive side, and you mentioned a couple brands. And then also a follow-up on the, I think, you said the appliance category was a little soft. There are some introductions that are upcoming. I don't know if that's something you think will turn around the space or et cetera. If you can comment on that?","Janet Taake","Well first of all, the Prestige side, when I mentioned the Prestige skin and color cosmetics were very strong for first quarter, I didn't mention specific brands and it continues to be strong for us. It has been for several quarters. As far as other categories that are gaining traction, we're seeing a lot of healthcare or therapy and hair care. And its in liquids as well as some tools. High-tech tools, I mentioned before, have been a trending category for us and it's -- a lot of it is high ticket products. The HairMax we launched earlier in Q1 along with other tools that are coming in from Q2 that I mentioned, and a lot of hair removal -- home hair removal techniques are also trending. So there's the hair therapy, there's hair tools and then there's also the home-care with hair removal that's also been trending.","Simeon Gutman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","What about the appliance category? I mean you sold a couple of products in the past couple of weeks that looked pretty promising on the curling side that looked like that could revise some of the category. I don't if expectations built into that?","Janet Taake","Yes, we have newness coming in. We usually don't speak too far out, but we do have some new technology coming in. I mentioned from Jose Eber, the infrared flatiron that's coming in which is new technology for us and also a new brand. And there's some other product coming in that has to do that's associated with curl that we have not launched yet that will be coming in this quarter. There is some newness. It is also a slower-growing category.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair & Company.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just I guess following up on the topic of the CEO search for a second, if there's anything you can say at this point in terms of some of the characteristics that you're particularly looking for, that you're trying to zero in on? That would be my first question.","Dennis K. Eck","Yes, we've been very focused on -- we have a very strong team at Ulta. We think we're headed in a very good direction and what we're looking for is somebody that can take that and move it on to the next step. So we're being very, very thoughtful and careful about somebody that can do that. And as I said in the last call, we're going to take our time and do it right and that we'll be back to you as quickly as we have something. But we're pleased with the progress.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then my other question relates to e-commerce. The 70% growth, seems like that may be a step up from what you had been seeing, correct me if I'm wrong on that. And if so, what were some of -- was there any like particular 1 or 2 events that drove well above trend growth or was that a fairly steady growth trend during the quarter?","Scott M. Settersten","Hey, Dan, the 70% growth rate that we saw in the first quarter, again, while e-commerce is still a relatively small piece of the business, I wouldn't model that in as kind of the go-forward run rate. Historically, it's been in that 30-ish, 40-ish kind of range, which I would say is still probably a good estimate for you to use. As far as category drivers on e-commerce, it's really -- we saw higher ends, skin care kinds of things and some of these tech tools that Janet mentioned which lend themselves very well to the kind of digital e-commerce space. We were able to get it in stock and get it promoted and get it out there in the website in a real timely fashion. So more than anything else, it was the higher-end categories that were driving the growth.","Jeffrey Severts","Sorry, this is Jeff. I'd just add to Scott's answer about later in the year expectations for e-commerce. Remember that we do have the site relaunch only happening in the fall and quite naturally, with that kind of relaunch, we would expect to see some transitional bumping as the customer gets used to that new site.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","But fair to say that, that was -- that the type of growth you saw, even -- was kind of above your historical average pretty steadily? It wasn't 1 or 2 key events that drove explosive growth or anything?","Scott M. Settersten","No. It was the general trend across the quarter. And again, it was because of the introduction to some of these new products that just worked out extremely well.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And I guess, lastly, as it relates to what you mentioned about some of the styling tools, do you think that there's any competitive pricing things there? Or is that primarily what you mentioned just kind of maturity of the category?","Janet Taake","We're always aware and pay attention to the competition but we also deliver what we feel is going to drive our guest to the store. So on both sides, we manage the styling tools appropriately.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you give us a sense of Lanc\u00f4me and Clinique, maybe the impact they're having on the stores that have the boutiques? Is there a significant difference in comp or store traffic that you can speak to in those stores? And what's kind of the maybe the sell-through of those brands relative to expectations?","Scott M. Settersten","Evren, we're not really going to be able to get into the details with you on specific brands or categories, but we are very happy with the performance of the boutiques, both Lanc\u00f4me and Clinique. I think our partners, our vendor partners, are happy with the performance as well, which I think is demonstrated by our continued expansion with them. It does drive additional traffic to the stores. It helps the box overall. It helps our guest experience in the stores and the offering that we have. So again, I think we're happy in all fronts, we've been happy with the expansion and we look forward to more in the future.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then a follow-up on the stock buyback program. Should we expect you to be more opportunistic or is this going to be more regular use of the program, possibly to offset the dilution from options? How do you think about the usage of the program?","Jeffrey Severts","In the near-term, I guess the short answer we'd say, opportunistic, would be the answer, the short answer, again. This is a responsibility that management and the board takes very seriously. We've got $150 million authorization out there. It's kind of a judgment call on where get into the market and what we do. But again, it's a thoughtful process that we're in continuous conversations on with the Board.","Dennis K. Eck","And we're measuring that against the need for cash for the other things that we need to do to continue to build and grow Ulta. So we discuss this at nearly every board meeting.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I guess my question is going to be based on the merchandise margins. Scott, you talked about the gross margins in the quarter and how they came in. Is there any way you could break apart the gross margin that you saw in terms of merchandise margin and occupancy and buying deleverage in Q1?","Scott M. Settersten","I'm not sure if we're going to be able to do that on the call. Should we? I mean, again, overall the mix was better, Prestige skin care and color continued its strength during the quarter, so we continue to mix up a bit on that side of the business, which helped the rate. We did get slightly better fixed store cost leverage because the comp was stronger than we are expecting or what the midpoint of the guidance range called for. We did get supply chain. We were expecting that to deleverage slightly in the first quarter. That ended up being a little stronger than we were expecting because of some of the inventory receipts during the quarter to support some of the initiatives with the new brands and the boutiques coming into the Q. So I don't think we're going to be able to give you any more breakdown than that at this stage.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I guess what I was going at is in Q2, your guiding gross margins at the midpoint up 40 basis points. They were just down 100. I'm assuming that, that has a pretty nice inflection in the merchandise margin and I was wondering if you could comment there, give color. I know there was one-time things in Q1 that impacted you, but maybe what are you seeing going forward? What's your visibility into positive merchandise margins for the remainder of the year?","Dennis K. Eck","I would preface that by saying, again, in the big picture, we've kind of cycled through a lot of those headwinds in the first quarter that we saw with, primarily, inventory receipts but also a couple of the other items that we talked about here on the call. As we pivot and look ahead to second quarter, again, a big driver of it is the promotional and merchandising strategies that we use. So again, for second quarter, we're looking at some different events that we expect to drive better rates for us overall. We expect to continue to see strength in the high-end Prestige skin and color categories, which will continue to drive rate, as that continues to mix up. We'll also see some leverage in supply chain in the second quarter, which we didn't really see in the first quarter. So those are the primary levers that we look at as we look ahead to Q2 with margin expansion.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Scott, I have just one quick clarification point and just a bigger picture question on e-commerce. Clarification on the promos. So we definitely noticed as well in our own analysis that the promo trends were actually down this year versus last year as you guys have more of this direct kind of segmented e-mail marketing. So are you expecting embedded in guidance for Q2 to be kind of a similar sort of year-over-year trend in Q1 or kind of matching that with the promos of Q2 last year?","Scott M. Settersten","We expect Q2, year-over-year, to be consistent, so Q2 this year versus last year. When we talk about promotional events, we're talking about the direct mail pieces that we send our customers and the newspaper inserts kinds of things. So those will be even up head-to-head year-over-year for Q2.","Jeffrey Severts","Sorry, this is Jeff. I was just going to add, yes, we do, I mean, anniversarying, year-over-year, the major events. You'll see no changes to that. What you will notice, I think, what you noticed in first quarter is us taking opportunities to nip away at the corners a bit and be more selective and targeted in our promotions.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Absolutely. We thought it was very well executed. And then my big picture question on the e-commerce side is if you think about e-commerce growth and expansion, based on our observation, we noticed companies really see kind of that lift in business overall when they're either expand SKUs online or basically offer some amazing new customer service function like free shipping, free returns. Where are you guys on that spectrum and how you're thinking about probably primarily SKU expansion online and availability relative to what you have in your stores? And then also any sort of latest thinking around free shipping, free returns or something to that effect?","Janet Taake","On the SKU expansion, we will be expanding a brand that we may have in-house and add SKUs online that we don't carry in the brick-and-mortar side of the business. We're also looking at adding brands that we don't carry in brick and mortar. And it's continuing to evolve and we will continue to manage that and look at opportunities to expand beyond, once again, what may be in brick and mortar.","Dennis K. Eck","Otherwise, we are not planning any major changes to the customer proposition. We feel like we have strong proposition already. We want our customers to buy from us online because they're buying from Ulta, first, and that the online channel is just their channel of choice at that time. You won't -- we are not planning on trying to grow online sales for online sales' sake. We're trying to grow Ulta sales.","Scott M. Settersten","I would just close that one out, Neely, by saying in the big picture, this E-commerce business is a place where we're playing catch-up right now. So when you talk about major new changes that will drive guest engagement and have them shop our site more often, a lot of that is to come. So part of that's going to be with the web redesign that we have coming out in the fall, integrating the points-based loyalty programs across platforms, so it's seamless to our customers, and expanding the assortment here that Janet spoke to across, so that more closely resembles the in-store experience. So that's all ahead of us. All good things to come in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with JPMorgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Two questions really regarding, I guess, stores. First one is given the ongoing CEO search, we were wondering what is the timing of your budget process when you need to lock-in how many new stores you're planning for 2014? And then the second one is really on the store maturity curve, I guess, Scott, you updated and, I guess, when you guys think about the faster ramp that you're now seeing and you try to isolate whether or not it's about the markets now you're in or the real estate locations or the brand awareness, sort of what do you isolate as sort of being the reasons that the store maturity curve is what it is? And when you think about the double-digit comps you put up the last 3 years compared to your guidance, what's really changing? Is it mostly the mature stores? Just trying to figure that out.","Scott M. Settersten","Well let me take the easy one first, which is kind of the budget process, all right? I mean can -- I think we mentioned we're well on our way. The pipeline looks good for 2014. We've got 50 sites already approved, internally approved. We're still working on the leases and all the details. So we feel we're in very good position for 2014 and we can lever that up and back. Our real estate guys are very seasoned. We can work to meet the number, whatever it is, again, depending on the quality of the real estate. As long as the quality is there, we can execute. As far as the new store ramp is concerned, again, we updated our model here just recently. So the stores are starting out a little bit stronger than they had, than what we had seen historically. So again, that first year step up in the comp, maybe is a little bit more moderated -- moderate than some of you may have had in your models. So again, instead of high teens in second year, because they start at a higher rate, so the second year might be closer to midteens kind of step up, all right? Again, what we're seeing when we look at the models and stack up the stores every quarter, we're seeing that the store ramp is consistent over that 5-year period with what we've seen historically. Broader picture, we're closing in on 600 stores across the U.S. We're kind of following the natural flow of the beauty industry, overall. As we look back to 2012, I would say it's not double-digits the last 3 years, Brian. But it was very healthy, high single-digit growth last year and when you pivot that against what we saw here in the first quarter, which, you know, again it's a low 5% comp for the bricks and mortar part of the business. That is a change. When we look across the classes, we're not seeing any significant changes by class or geographic area of the country. The stores in general, there's not a lot of variability between the stores outside of the normal ramp up of new stores. So when you look back now at some of the older stores, like the greater than 5-year-old stores, last year when he had really high single-digit comps, they were comping at healthy single-digit kind of levels. This year, those older stores are comping in the low single-digit kind of area. So again, the good news is they're not hurting the comp, all right? And while they might not -- those older stores might not be helping drive a higher comp, they are contributing very healthy store-level earnings and cash flows for the company.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","One question, one follow-up, both sort of around the e-commerce, retail interaction. First, thanks for the very detailed disclosure on the store's comp and the e-commerce comp. If you think about traffic and ticket, should we think about that 140 bps from e-commerce really driving that traffic number? Because I know you gave that for the base, overall, without differentiating between channel.","Scott M. Settersten","Look, again, the comp was 6.7% for the quarter, roughly equal transaction drivers and ticket drivers, the ticket side of that was primarily units, all right? Average selling price was basically flat year-over-year. When we break down the business and built up a comp map, we break apart the E-Commerce business, the salon business and the retail business. And when we say it's roughly equal transactions or traffic and ticket, the same goes for the E-Commerce business. So it's not -- we don't just throw it all in the traffic side of the comp driver. So it's [indiscernible] .","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then secondly, given your loyalty program, you have, obviously, a better visibility than most who your customers are. As you think about the big e-commerce spike that you saw, what's your sense about whether these are existing Ulta customers, loyalty program members or not, relative to people who are new to the brand and joining you through the e-commerce channel?","Scott M. Settersten","Generally speaking, customers that use our e-commerce site, by and large, are aware of Ulta and are already part of the Ulta guest kind of profile in pool, all right? That's the majority of the users. We have seen, with some of these new product introductions here, especially recently Q1, that it has been able to draw in more new customers. So as we look at it overall, we're happy to see that, that it's a way for us to mine and draw in new customers.","Dennis K. Eck","Yes. I would just build on that. Generally, most of our online channel growth is coming from existing customers, and we're just getting another visit or more frequency out of them, which is fantastic for us. But this quarter was a bit peculiar. We had a couple of new products, SeroVital being one of the them, where it was a hot product where we -- we're one of the few distributors around the product and it brought a lot of new people into the franchise.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to stay on e-commerce for a second. Looks like, obviously, the 140 basis points boost you got in terms of comp growth in the quarter from that was a little bit better than you guys were looking for. It definitely was better than we were looking for. So could you help us out in terms of the full year, I think in the past you've said that it will be less than a point to full-year comps. Is that still your view at this point?","Scott M. Settersten","Yes, exactly. For the full year, we're estimating it's roughly 100 basis points to the comp for the full year. As Jeff mentioned, we started out at the gate here very strong in Q1. We expected to moderate a little bit. We've got this new site redesign that's going to roll out in early fall. We expect there to be some transition time period there. So again, for the full year, rough and tough, 100 basis points.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then in terms of gross margin, obviously, the quarter there too was better-than-expected. On your last call, I think you had mentioned that you guys did expect to see \"healthy\" gross margin expansion for the year. Didn't hear any commentary today, at least, on the full-year gross margin outlook. Is that still your view that, that gross margin will be up healthy this year and SG&A roughly flattish or have those components changed a bit?","Scott M. Settersten","Joe, we're reconfirming our full-year guidance. So again, exactly as we described to many of you over the last couple of months, we do expect to see healthy gross margin expansion for the full year.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay and I apologize, but if it's down 100 and up 40 [ph], and the fourth quarter, I think, you've said is going to be pretty promotional, so you probably shouldn't expect to see much in the way of gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter. It sounds like a lot of the gross margin expansion this year you're looking for is going to be in 3Q.","Scott M. Settersten","I wouldn't say that's a fair statement. Typically, fourth quarter is a more promotional time period but again, as we shift some of our marketing and merchandise strategy, the CRM initiative continues to gain speed of momentum, and we're able to pull some levers back and forth in other parts of the promotional kind of basket, we feel confident that we'll be able to do what we said.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Wu with Telsey Advisory Group.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","First, can you talk about the longer-term opportunity of the Prestige business, including any plans to introduce additional large flagship brands into the mix, as well as a longer term potential for a new brand boutique, especially as Prestige segment obviously is expected to continue to outperform over time, yet it still appears to be relatively under-penetrated category for you?","Janet Taake","We will continue to evaluate new brands and new products in Prestige but, more importantly, across all categories of our business, it's important to look at the total business. Our box is very flexible so we can -- and we're very agile as an organization, so we can move pretty quickly within our stores if we needed to add boutiques or any type of presentation that goes from mass to Prestige. As we look at the total mix, we will introduce, we can constantly have conversations with vendors and we will, once again, across all categories, and we will continually add and look for newness and it will be an important part of our business. But overall, I don't see a significant change from the total mix of the box year-over-year.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great. And with the new brand boutiques that you've been opening and -- as well as introduction of more sort of higher-end product and tools, have you noticed any changes at all, to your customer demographics, whether age or by income?","Jeffrey Severts","David, no. This is Jeff. We have not seen any substantial shifts there. Nothing that would show up in any of our tracking tools. So same customer, generally, in terms of what she looks like, how old she is, where she's from.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great. And then I thought it was interesting, you talked about ongoing [ph] some of the private label men's product this quarter. And I was wondering if you could perhaps talk about sort of the overall men's opportunity?","Janet Taake","We have a men's shop in our stores and men's, we carry fragrance, skincare and some bath categories that we just launched with Ulta. We're very pleased with our business but, overall, it's a really small percentage of the total business for Ulta.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Got it. And is this a category that you may focus on more over time?","Janet Taake","Once again, it's a small part of the business, but we will always look for opportunities to grow categories at two other category. So as I mentioned, we just launched Ulta, which is totally new and it doesn't compete with anything else within the category and we will continue to evaluate men's skincare. It's been a nice category for us.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Excellent. And just lastly, in terms of your store expansion strategy, I know obviously that the focus here is still on opening stores in power centers but can you perhaps elaborate more on the mall opportunity and if the sales and profitability dynamics are attractive enough to make it a viable alternative to the power centers?","Scott M. Settersten","We do look at mall sites occasionally. Again, when we're looking at 100 or 100-plus new store opportunities a year. There are certain geographic locations where the mall is the only place really to do business in a specific town or geographic area. So we do look at those from time to time. We do have a number of stores that are adjacent to malls, attached to malls. So we do look at every one of those opportunities that comes about. The stores that we do have opened that are connected to malls do just as well as stores that sit on independent pads or are in power center lineups with other tenants. So again, we look at them on an individual basis to make sure we're happy with the physical space, that the co-tenant mix is the right one for us, that we get the right kind of economic model overall and that we feel good about the store. So again, it's an opportunity and it's something that we take a look at as need be.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jill Caruthers with Johnson Rice & Company.","Jill R. Caruthers - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Is there any way you could quantify the number of Clinique boutiques you'll be rolling out this year?","Janet Taake","Thank you for asking that question. Not today. We will be able to update you on the next call.","Jill R. Caruthers - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. Should we assume that it's a more material number or there's just no real comment there?","Janet Taake","No comment.","Jill R. Caruthers - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And I guess just trying to see how -- I feel like these brands pull in, possibly, a department store customer that isn't fully aware of what Ulta has. How are you going about advertising these -- specifically these brands, Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me, given they're not storewide across your base? Is there any advertising you're able to do at this point in time throughout this rollout?","Janet Taake","Yes. Actually, we've been marketing in our mailers to the zip codes in which our stores are located that have a Clinique or a Lanc\u00f4me or both and we've been doing that for several years and we will continue as we continue to expand.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird.","Jacob Zitter - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Jacob in for Mark. If you're looking at the loyalty data over the past year, will the program be tweaked at all going forward versus the initial points-based model? And then I guess as a follow-up, do you expect the rollout to impact gross margin positively or negatively next year as new customers enter the program?","Dennis K. Eck","Thanks, Jacob. So no material changes to the customer proposition on the program, it will be the same program that you see today. Some very minor modifications in the way we launch it, on the basis of what we have learned in the first launch in the first 50% of the country. But nothing significant and certainly nothing visible to the customer. Did you want to handle margin?","Scott M. Settersten","Yes. As far as margin or the financial impact of transitioning the rest of the 50% of the country that's not on points-based today, I think I've outlined, again, for a large number of folks over the last couple of months that there was some initial margin rate impact based on the new program, because people are more engaged. They spend more money, so they earn more points. So we have to reserve more and there is an impact on the margin rate. But over the long-term, and we're hoping next year, that's another element that plays into the early 2014 implementation, that over the first year period, all that kind of moderates by and large. So we've learned some good lessons over the years with how this program works and what they expect, and we feel very comfortable now and confident that we can forecast that appropriately.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Scott M. Settersten","Thank you all for your interest in Ulta and we look forward to speaking with you all soon.

Good afternoon. The Ulta Beauty team kicked off 2017 with excellent first quarter results. Strong sales growth driven by product newness and solid execution of our merchandise and marketing programs translated into better than expected earnings growth even excluding the significant tax rate benefit.","Comp sales grew 14.3% on top of 15.2% in the first quarter of last year maintaining the more than 29% two year comp trend we achieved in the previous couple of quarter. Comp sales were driven by balanced traffic and ticket and the growth in our stores and remarkable strength in e-commerce.","We\u2019re particularly proud of these results in light of the challenging environment many retailers are experiencing. Our differentiated increasing compelling assortment, the experience and nature of our stores, the strength of our loyalty program and CRM capabilities that help us drive traffic and mange promotional activity with greater precision. The supply chain investment we\u2019ve made to support the acceleration of our e-commerce channel. All of these assets are contributing to our exceptional growth.","Now let me provide some more detail on the components of our strategy that drove our first quarter performance. Starting with our strategic imperative to acquire new guests and deepen loyalty of existing guests.","During the first quarter we acquired $1.1 million net new loyalty members, bringing the ultimate rewards program to 24.5 million active members. This represents growth of 26% year-over-year, driven by continued strong execution by our store teams were passionate about converting new members and healthy traffic in our stores, supported by our merchandising and marketing efforts.","As we anticipated the growth rate is beginning to moderate slightly as we cycle the big impact from initiatives that led the conversion rate over the past several quarters. But we still expect to see rapid growth in loyalty membership well above square footage growth.","All of the metrics we track, including retention rate, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average member ticket, remain very strong. We continue to find ways to enhance the benefits with the program, particularly adding products for our most engaged platinum level customers, who spend more than $450 a year.","Our brands are increasingly interested in partnering with us on loyalty and CRM efforts. An example of this is our most recent free birthday gift for loyalty members, who with the deluxe sample of Lanc\u00f4me\u2019s new Monsieur Big Mascara, offered to our members before the full size product launch in store.","Our credit card program continues to exceed expectations and we\u2019re excited to be launching a gift card program with Blackhawk in grocery [ph] stores this quarter. To update you on progress in increasing brand awareness, in April we reached 86% aided awareness versus 84% a year ago, and our unaided awareness was up 6 point at 45% this year, versus 39% last year.","Awareness of Ulta\u2019s Beauty brand is at an all-time high, as our marketing and PR activities, including TV and radio advertising for 21 days of beauty, partnerships such as those with POPSUGAR, Refinery 29, which included an activation at the Cotele [ph] festival and stronger focus on social media all are contributing to make Ulta Beauty top of mind.","Key promotional periods during the quarter included our spring trend report, where we highlight new staff sales in products through the integration of care and makeup trends in our print and social media channels, 21 Days of Beauty, our Signature Prestige beauty event that just keep getting bigger and better and Mother's Day, when we highlight the fragrance category. ","For the spring 21 Days of Beauty event, we enhance the daily beauty feel program with additional [indiscernible] and elevated our Ulta Beauty collection offering, resulting in our strongest 21 Days of Beauty event ever. One of our daily beauty steals Anastasia Beverly Hills iconic Brow Wiz pencil broke the record for the best beauty steal in the history of the event.","For Mother's Day, we upgraded our gift with fragrance purchase offer and elevated both our [indiscernible] pretty and our Mother's Day gift guide. This year\u2019s social media activation invited our guests to share their mom\u2019s beauty wisdom, which is our best tips in makeup advice and this garner high engagement on social media.","Now turning to our efforts in merchandising, we continue to gain share across every major categories with particular strength in prestige cosmetics, as well as in skin care in both the mass and prestige categories. IT Cosmetics, Tarte, Too Faced, Mario Badescu, BECCA, Anastasia, Clinique, Lanc\u00f4me, Benefit, TONYMOLY, Yes Too, and the Ulta Beauty collection were among the best performing brands for the quarter.","Half of the product launches included, IT Cosmetics confidence in a Compact Serum Foundation, Too Faced peanut butter and honey pallet, Smashbox's Be Legendary, liquid metal lip color, BECCA\u2019s Sunchaser or Bronzing Palette, Stella\u2019s Magnificent Metals Eye Shadow and a new line of 30 Estee Lauder lipsticks exclusive to Ulta Beauty that are now features in 650 stores.","The new brand, [indiscernible] remains robust as well reach in addition to the Prestige cosmetics portfolio include several brands much loved by beauty enthusiasts, including Nudestix and Cover FX. In prestige skincare, we launched Nikayo and a new brand targeted to Millennials, NIA which stands for Not Into Aging. We also added a handpicked assortment of K beauty favorites to our prestige skincare offering.","Our pro hair assortment received a significant assortment refill -- reflow with the additional of Klorane, Aquage, Flawless by Gabrielle Union, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty and Madison Reed salon quality hair color.","In mass cosmetics, we launched several new brands in select stores, L.A Girl, Catrice and Model Zone. The Mass skincare portfolio added skin food and derma E essentials. In addition, many existing brands expanded into additional doors, including NARS, Origins, Drybar and Estee Lauder. ","Now to update you on our MAC introduction, we launched about 600 MAC Skews online a couple of weeks ago and the brand is off to a very strong start in the website. To generate buzz for the e-commerce launch, we ran a one day flash sale for lip palette on Instagram a week before the launch. The excitement is building for our MAC launch in store this quarter, we're on track to open more than 100 MAC doors before the end of the year with the similar breadth of assortment. The first MAC Boutique will open in June 10th in Davenport, Iowa. ","Moving on to services, the Salon business grew 16.7% and comped 9.9% with strength in color services, laurels and makeup services. We're investing in people and processes in our services business to continually improve the guest experience and drive sustainable market share gains.","So for example, we're investing in training and brand building for the salon through the recently announced formation of the Ulta Beauty Protein. This is a group of five artists and educators from some of the industry's top professional hair care brands Redken, Matrix, L'anza and Vella. ","With over 100 years of combined experience these professionals will elevate the profile of Salon at Ulta Beauty, and help to educate and inspire on stylist across the country by working to enhance our salon education programming, building trend collections and providing training. Their efforts will be complemented by the Ulta Beauty design team who'll bring these collections to life of the company's aided educators who in turn will train Ulta Beauty's 6,500 stylists. ","In addition, we've created dedicated key team at corporate to build out our analytical capabilities and will be testing a variety of changes to our model including pricing, staffing and technology enhancements. As a result of all these investments, we're very optimistic by the opportunity to continue to enhance our market position in salon services.","Now turning to store expansion, we opened 18 stores in the first quarter to launch our 2017 program of 10 new stores. We closed two stores, relocated two and needed the quarter with 990 stores. New store productivity continues to be very strong, reflecting excellent site selection, growing brand awareness and an increasingly appealing assortment of brand.","We're on track to open a handful of high profile stores this year including a store at Michigan Avenue in Chicago opening in a couple of weeks, our first store at Manhattan planned for October and a store in the Mall of America expected to open in the fall as well. As a result of these higher rent locations as well as the higher percentage of stores on the West and East Coast with generally higher rent in the center of the country, we expect some modest pressure on rent per square foot for the change.","We're confident we can offset this impart by continuing to optimize lease terms. We're very active with renegotiation of rents as part of the lease renewal process after the initial 10 year term to ensure we're paying the most competitive rents.","To update you on the e-commerce business, the ulta.com team delivered growth of 70.9% in the first quarter. This was the highest quarterly growth rate for our e-com business since the first quarter of 2014 back when the base was only $17 million. This sales growth contributed 340 basis points to our total company comp, driven almost entirely by transaction growth.","As we study our guest purchase behavior, our e-commerce business has proven to be largely incremental. The Ulta rewards member who shops online are also increasing their purchases in bricks and mortar versus shifting their purchases online. We continue to improve our site experience and fulfillment capabilities. Ulta.com drove very strong growth during 21 Days of Beauty and other event including the limited time offers we called Beauty Bets and Beauty Break and special offers for platinum loyalty members.","These events are often a catalyst for retail guest to become omnichannel shoppers, which brings many benefits. The number of omnichannel loyalty members continue to increase and now represent 8.6% of our members, up 140 basis points year-over-year. We continue to add online only brands and expand the assortments of brands we carry in-stores. During the quarter total traffic growth was up 77% and mobile traffic rose 107%, driven by growth in pay search, affiliate, display and social including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.","And now turning to progress in our supply chain and systems, supply chain operations really performed well across all matrices in the first quarter, maintaining a high inside position throughout the quarter, while managing multiple reset introducing new brands and working with some of our brand partners to get back in stock after strong holiday demand. ","Our supply chain supported ulta.com strong performance as we continue to ramp order volume shipping out of our new more efficient distribution center. Our DCs process significantly more e-commerce shipments have forecasted during the quarter, while improving productivity decreasing cost per shipment and keeping labor cost in line with forecast.","For an inventory management perspective we maintain high inventory in stocks to support our best ever 21 Days of Beauty and better. Our task skews continue to be fully supported as we identify opportunity to make our inventory more productive.","Finally to update you on our new distribution center in Fresno California, construction is underway and we\u2019re on track for a summer 2018 opening. As a reminder this DC is similar to our Dallas DC a 670,000 square foot facilities that can serve us up to 400 stores and 45,000 e-commerce orders per day. This DC will enable new distribution technology that would increase our productivity and significantly reduce transit time to our West Coast customers.","In summary, 2017 is off to a great start and I would like to hand it over to Scott to discuss the drivers of our first quarter financials and our outlook for the second quarter and 2017.","Scott Settersten","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon everyone. Starting with the income statement, sales for the quarter rose 22.5% to $1.3 billion, driven by 14.3% comparable sales growth and continued very strong new store productivity. The total comp of 14.3% was made up of 8.7% transaction growth and 5.6% average ticket growth.","The retail comp was 10.5% composed of 6.2% traffic growth and 4.7% average ticket. With ticket roughly split equally between units per transaction and average selling price. The salon business comp 9.9%, driven primarily by ticket growth although traffic growth was the strongest we\u2019ve seen in several quarters. The retail and salon comp combined for a total store comp of 10.9%.","Operating margin increased 60 basis points driven by SG&A leverage. The drivers of our P&L were fairly similar to what we saw on the fourth quarter with gross profit decreasing by 20 basis points and SG&A improving by 80 basis points.","On the gross profit line, we leveraged rent and occupancy cost and product margins at retail were about flat. This reflects similar levels of promotion year-over-year with one exception. As you know we introduced the ultimate rewards credit card in August last year as an important tool to enhance loyalty and drive higher share of wallet of our guest."," We\u2019re very happy with the program and the positive overall impact to the P&L. However, it impact some of the geography of expanses and benefits. When guest signup for the card they receive a onetime 20% off and begin to earn extra loyalty points.","Both pressure gross margin rate, but we see offset of these factors with the credit card income including signup royalties, labor support and lower transaction processes fees which are included in SG&A.","On the mix side we benefited from strong growth in the Ulta Beauty collection in some of the higher margin brands, but offsets included headwinds from higher mix of boutique brand sales. As a reminder, some of the prestige brands we\u2019ve added are contributing significant margin dollars, but are dilutive to margin rate. With the hundreds of prestige brand boutiques we rollout last year and are now accelerating this year we are seeing a higher percentage of sales from these brands and anticipate that this margin rate headwind will continue. ","We also fell some pressure from a higher mix of e-commerce sales, investment in the salon business, as well as higher distribution cost as our recent DCs and newly implemented systems continue to scale up.","Turning to SG&A, the improvement here was primarily driven by advertising expense leverage on strong sales, corporate overhead savings as we anniversary G&A investments made last year to support our supply chain and systems initiatives and benefits from the ultimate rewards credit card.","We also had some savings due to the timing of certain expenses, with some planned activities in areas like marketing and consulting that didn\u2019t occur as expected in the first quarter. But these dollars are expected to be deployed later in the year.","These timing impacts represented about half of the earnings upside in the quarter excluding the tax rate benefit. Investments in store labor to enhance the guest experience and to ensure strong execution of planogram changes, partially offset these improvements. ","Just to touch on the tax rate for a moment. You saw that we called out a $0.14 earnings per share benefit in the quarter, primarily related to the new accounting standard, that changes how companies record the tax effects of employee stock option exercises and vestings of equity awards. The tax benefit moves from the balance sheet to the P&L.","Going forward we may see fluctuations in our tax rate quarter-to-quarter, which will be difficult to forecast. Broadly speaking we expect the full year rate to be about a point lower than last year or approximately 36.5%. Our guidance will assume a 37.5% tax rate for the remainder of the year.","Moving on to the balance sheet, inventories increased 11.2% on a per store basis, well below the comp rate driven by solid inventory management, especially in light of the inventory additions for new brand and boutiques as well as ramping up the Dallas distribution center. Capital expenditures were $77 million for the quarter, driven by new store openings, systems and fixtures for prestige brand boutiques.","Depreciation and amortization were $62 million for the quarter. We ended the quarter with $472 million in cash and short-term investments. In terms of share buybacks, we continue to repurchase shares through our 10b5-1 plan. During the first quarter we repurchased approximately 185,000 shares of our stock at a cost of $51.6 million or an average share price of $279. As of April 29, 2017 approximately 395 million remained available under the 425 million share repurchase program announced in March 2017.","Turning now to guidance for the second quarter and fiscal 2017, for the second quarter we expect sales to be in the range of $1.257 billion to $1.278 billion versus $1.069 billion last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 10% to 12%, versus 14.4% last year. E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the 50% range. ","We plan to open approximately 25 new stores in the second quarter versus 24 last year. So pre-opening is expected to be slightly higher. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.72 to $1.77 versus $1.43 last year. With leverage on the gross profit line and modest deleverage on the SG&A line, with overall operating margin rate flattish. The tax rate excluding any impact of the new accounting standard for share based payments is expected to be 37.5% and our fully diluted share count is estimated at $62.4 million.","Now turning to full year guidance, we plan to open approximately 100 new stores all of which will be our prototypical format. We plan to complete about 11 major remodels and six relocations during the year. We expect to grow our e-commerce business approximately 50%. ","Total company comps are expected to be in the 9% to 11% range. CapEx is expected to be $460 million including new stores, remodels, relocations approximately 700 prestige brand expansions and investments in systems to improve inventory visibility, which will enable future omnichannel capabilities.","We are increasing our annual earnings per share guidance to flow through the tax rate benefit reported in Q1 and about half of the operating upside to account for the timing of planned expenses shifting from the first quarter to later in the year.","We anticipate earnings per share growth in the mid 20% range compared to our earlier outlook of low-20s EPS growth. This includes the impact of the 53rd week, assumes approximately 300 million share buyback and assumes a full year tax rate of 36.5% and a tax rate of 37.5% for quarters two through four.","To be clear, our EPS outlook excludes any impact from the new accounting standard for share based payments for the remainder of the year. Operating margin is expected to increase in the 20 to 30 basis point range.","And with that, I'll turn it over to our conference call host to moderate the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first comes from Mark Altschwager of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Altschwager","Great, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, congrats on the continued success. I did want to ask about the loyalty program, you've had a lot of success in the past year, reactivating some of the laps to loyalty members. Just curious how much opportunity remains on that front? And then first some of your more mature stores is how are you thinking about the balance between adding new members versus capturing that incremental share of wallet to drive the comp moving forward. Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Mark. Let's -- I'll break into two, I\u2019ll take the second part of the question first. Let's say in total wherever our stores exists whether they're more mature or newer stores, we see plenty of opportunity to continue to drive market share growth of loyalty member growth. And so overtime, certainly it's about more share of wallet of current members, but we believe there is opportunity out there as we look at the marketplace for both of those kinds of growth going forward.","In terms of lapsed users, do you want to... ","Dave Kimbell","Yes absolutely from our [indiscernible] we have had a lot of success as you mentioned continuing to reengage lapsed guests. And that has continued and continued in the first quarter of this year and we more opportunity in that. We've got a larger database beyond the number of members active members and we continue to reach out and attract them both through our broader marketing that we know reaches them and encourages them to come back and then some direct marketing efforts that we start to do experiment with. So we see continued opportunity on that side as well.","Mark Altschwager","Thanks for the color and best of luck. ","Mary Dillon","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Oliver Chen","Hi, congratulations and I need to get some of that NIA I can\u2019t wait to try that out so\u2026","Mary Dillon","Not into aging, you got to love that. ","Oliver Chen ","It\u2019s pretty phenomenal looking stuff. So the question we had is a broader question on that topic regarding Amazon, what are your thoughts on how you preserve the specialness of your brands, and how you will continue to do a really excellent job with the growth in loyalty you're seeing in the face of Amazon, which as you know have so many -- such a big user base.","And then if you could just brief on your thoughts around your smaller formats, pros and cons in terms of what you're thinking about flexible format as you continue to grow and be relevant across different types of opportunities given that there is opportunities in different formats I'm sure. Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Okay, the two pronged question got it. In terms of -- I would just step back and just say that I think we feel as we've discussed at length about as we look at the category we operate, the consumers that we're focused on, the beauty enthusiast our loyalty program is quite large 24.5 million people and growing. ","The uniqueness of our business model is that we're in a category that\u2019s only growing, but as we look at demographic trends and we look at Millennials and GenEx and Latinos, all fast growing sectors of our economy these are all bolster really are engaged in beauty as frankly love the way that we offer how to shop for beauty with notions of all things beauty all in one place clearly is resonating.","And it's a very much about of an in person experiences as well as we're seeing a very incremental online experience. And so the notion of continuing to have a wonderful shopping experience with the great assortment of products and categories and brands launch services plus the ability to have a great online experience we see plenty of runway for us to continue to be a very relevant both bricks and mortar and online player.","We know that the beauty enthusiast wants to shop in person and our associates love that interaction with the guest as well. So that we think -- I believe strongly that platform will continue to do what we do by just getting better at it all the time, is what we are focused on and why we feel confident about our ability to continue on the growth path.","In terms of formats, we just have a couple of those smaller format stores and we learned a lot about operating them, we like what we saw but we also feels as we have said very confident that our basic overall 10,000 square foot format is our most productive best for our guest, we see plenty of real estate opportunities to do more of that. And we see opportunities both to go deeper into markets that we are in, to go open up stores in more one store kind of market as well as urban opportunities.","In most of those cases we\u2019d say the 10,000 square foot can be a little bit less, could be a little bit more, but bringing Ulta Beauty in kind of a full throttled way that we do is really we think the best way to continue to see it.","Oliver Chen ","Thank you, best regards. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please proceed with your question. ","Mark Astrachan","Thanks and good afternoon everyone. I am curious how you think about the ultimate number of boutiques and stores relative to current levels if you start to think about it, on a longer term basis. How do you think about the existing brands for those versus newer brands? And related to that how do you think about picking up more brands from some of the larger beauty companies like the L\u2019Oreal and Estee compared to Indi brands that may not have broader distribution?","Mary Dillon","I\u2019d say as we think about this as a continuation of some of all of those all of the above how is that, our guest they are really interested in brands that they know and love that want to be able to access so is in a more convenient format like Ulta Beauty, as well as discovering new brands that maybe we\u2019re first to bring to market. So that mosaic of interesting brands and we will continue to play that out in the future.","In terms of boutique, Dave do you answer that?","Dave Kimbell","Yes, we as we said before we are adding about 700 boutiques across the chain this year with those key boutique brands Clinique, Lancome, Benefit and MAC. And we see more expansion certainly as we build new stores many of them will get all of those or a most of those boutiques. And then we will continue to penetrate our existing stores, where it makes sense and we have the opportunity to back and do that.","So that will be a continued source of growth, but as by no means the only growth and as we are building on what Mary said continued mix of both big established brands like a MAC or an Estee Lauder. But also uncovering new emerging independent brands and bringing that balance to our guest which is what you want.","Mark Astrachan","That\u2019s helpful. If I could squeeze in one more sort of related question. Just curious how you are thinking about with now a few weeks of MAC online, how you are seeing that doing relative to on expectations it might not be the best way to think about it, but just in terms of how sales have been whether you think it\u2019s cannibalizing each stores outside of Ulta. And sort of thoughts about how that would fit into the e-commerce expectation, which would seem like to be even better than that given that MAC just started?","Dave Kimbell","We not talk too specifically about any individual brand performance, other than say we are very pleased with just a couple of weeks in. Mary mentioned in her comments that we are happy with the results. And then we have included that our anticipation of continued success there in our forward-looking view of the business. So we are excited about it and we will continue to drive that business going forward.","Mark Astrachan","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. ","Chris Horvers","Thanks, good evening. So wanted to first follow-up on the MAC question. I know you are pleased with these results so far, but I guess could you share any thoughts on the demographics that you are picking up on the MAC side, and how maybe that -- how your core customer is also responding to MAC offering? And then in terms of how the quarter play out for you obviously you guided a lot lower to start the quarter, was February hurt by tax refund? And then it sound like you basically just recaptured that into the balance of the quarter. ","Mary Dillon","Yes I\u2019ll start with that, I guess which is -- yes, I mean, I think we saw some -- a little bit of choppiness overall kind of averaged out, but we saw a little bit of volatility I would say late January early February probably due to the same factor that others saw with the tax refund. April was our strongest of the periods as that was also benefited from a change in Easter timing.","So in total I\u2019d say it kind of all worked itself out and it wasn't -- we felt good about -- I mean, we did better than we had guided, better than we thought. And I think the e-commerce business in particular was stronger than we had planned. So that\u2019s kind of how it netted out.","In terms of MAC, I would say way too early. We just launched it online, but I appreciate the question. And I would say I would expect that this will be very much our core guest will love it and is already showing online response this year I wouldn't expect it to be different than who would be interested in many of the other brands that we offer. But she's excited to be able to get at Ulta Beauty that's for sure.","Chris Horvers","Understood. And I think the biggest question out there right now is what you're seeing in the promotional environment from the department store channel, I mean, there were some news out there that you added a couple of incremental promotions it sounds like it went to your best customers that optimize the value to them. But what are you seeing in the department store channel and is there a wholesale change going on in terms of the complexion of the industry?","Mary Dillon","Well, that's a deep question I'd say the beauty it's really always has been a competitive category. I would just step back and I'd say I think our results in terms of traffic and market share scores that what we are doing is working, right it's competitive. Also I would say yes in the quarter we over the past several quarters and several years we've actually been modifying our approach to marketing task, this was a meaningful reduction in the broad based to more kind of balanced and targeted mix.","We do use postcards and we do it more limited and targeted basis really than we ever have. So in the quarter, we did too, we did one that was -- they're both digital one was very targeted to our platinum only guests in February. So here we\u2019ve got a lot of different levers that we can use influx as we need to in terms of demand creation.","So I feel that we will always be offering a great value proposition to our guests, and we've got the right tools to allow that to happen. So will some competitors get more aggressive price motion sure. That sometimes happens in a competitive market, but we've got the levers that we can use to respond in a dynamic environment. ","I'd also add that we always -- we work with our brand partners to make sure that we have really great exciting offers for our guest all the time and again I would say that our results are showing that that\u2019s working.","Chris Horvers","Understood, thanks very much. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. ","Rupesh Parikh","Thanks for taking my question and congrats on another great quarter. So I was hoping to get a little more clarity in terms of how you guys are thinking about gross margins for the balance of the year. It sounds like the greater e-commerce sales this quarter and greater prestige sales weighted on your margins in Q1. So just want to get a sense if you expect similar pressures or potential decline to continue for the remainder of the year. Thank you.","Scott Settersten","Yes, I mean, the one thing that I would just remind folks that we're lapping some pretty significant promotional kind of pull backs here over the course of the last whatever call it six to eight quarters right. So we're lapping some pretty tough compares I would say on the margin line, recently.","So the big schema things we look at each quarter individually and try to optimize as best we can to deliver the best overall results for the business. There is nothing as we sit here today that would indicate that there would be any significant change in the trend that we\u2019ve seen here recently. We'll just do our best right to try to of course correct as we think necessary as we navigate through that.","Rupesh Parikh ","Okay great. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel of Nomura. Please proceed with your question.. ","Simeon Siegel","Thanks guys. Good afternoon and obviously congrats. Are you -- Mary or Dave are you see any change in your incremental customer as your brand awareness grows. And are you reaching any new demographics with marketing? And then how is the awareness in City Center just particularly ahead of the high profile store openings? Thanks.","Dave Kimbell","Yes, we had a definitely an effort to continue to expand our appeal across all consumers in all markets and geographies. And I think we're seeing success with that. Our awareness in total continues to grow and certainly is much higher than it was two or three years ago. Our aided awareness is at 86% or our unaided awareness remains about at all time high around 45%. So we're feeling very good about that.","We have a big focus this year and we've talked about it in the past in expanding our efforts to reach Latina guest. We\u2019ve had more dedicated marketing partnerships with key media sites like Viva La, Top Sugar, Latina and others kind of reach out directly through influencers. We're testing some Spanish Language advertising later this year that will give us the opportunity to reach them more directly.","So, there is -- we see strength there and lots of opportunity to continue to build that. As far as urban centers, we do measure and look at awareness across major centers. And it\u2019s actually quite strong, I mean, Loss Angelis as an example we\u2019ve opened quite a few stores there over the last few years and we have strong awareness that really mimics our national Chicago, New York we\u2019re building and it\u2019s quite strong.","So there isn\u2019t big packet of undeveloped in urban areas, but we see more growth potential across the board and specifically with key group like Latinas.","Simeon Siegel","Okay, thanks. And then just to the point of the leveraging marketing, what\u2019s the right way to think about the marketing dollar growth or as a percent of sales? And then Scott I don\u2019t know if I missed it, but did you say what the right way to think about total SG&A dollar growth for Q2 and the full year would be? Thanks.","Scott Settersten","We don\u2019t really talk about SG&A in terms of dollars like some of big box guys, I mean, when we\u2019re thinking about the full year I guess this gets back to Rupesh\u2019s question as well. I mean, I think we set operating margins flattish in the second quarter up a little bit on the gross profit line down a little bit on the SG&A line.","I think as we navigate through the rest of year the third quarter I would say gross profit were going to have a little bit more pressure on that because some of the rent the heavier rents we are going pay for some of those higher profile kind of stores that are coming in Manhattan and Mall of America and a few others in the Burroughs of the New York metro area.","So that might be a little tougher on the gross profit line, we\u2019ll get a little offset during SG&A to offset it there again. I would say maybe slight deleverage in the third quarter overall and then we make it back up in the first quarter when we\u2019ve got we\u2019re lapping the Dallas DC there and we\u2019re scaling up on e-commerce and retail overall. So, we see more leverage in the fourth quarter.","Simeon Siegel","Great, thanks a lot. Best of luck for the rest of the year.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Baker of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. ","Michael Baker","Hi, thanks. More of a longer term bigger picture question, typically I think you saw this quarter as companies grow their e-commerce it does pressure margins because I think contrary to [ph] five years ago, e-commerce can actually be a lower margin business. The question there was how does that leverage as your e-commerce business grows, does the e-commerce business gets bigger, do the margins on the ecommerce itself get better? And then therefore it becomes less of a drag or if that doesn\u2019t occur as e-commerce grows does the drag actually get bigger?","Mary Dillon","Well, first of all I step back and say just reiterate that was great about our e-commerce business group, which is that as we measure and look at it closely it look to be very incremental business to us. So, I\u2019ll come back to margin but in total this is incremental dollars and it\u2019s supported by the consumer behavior that we understands our guest, especially our most engaged guests she loves to buy a lot of offers from us. And so when somebody becomes an omnichannel shopper they ends up basically being our best guest because they are spending 2.5 times amount of money of somebody who is just shopping in store.","21 Days of Beauty is a great example of an event that can drive that kind of incremental additive behavior it\u2019s 21 days a lot of days everyday has special offer. So guests might come in a couple of times and then see a couple of things online that she also want to get to the incremental shopping occasion. So, it plays out that whether it\u2019s an event or pallet that you can only get online at first before we put it in stores or other special things she is looking for it sort of feeding into this behavior and creating a nice incremental business for us.","That said, we also -- the margin yes it\u2019s somewhat lower on our e-commerce business and we don\u2019t really break this out in a lot of detail, but basically they are pretty -- it\u2019s getting closer, the gap is not that large and it\u2019s actually closing. So, it\u2019s incremental dollars at a somewhat less but narrowing gap of a margin and it\u2019s just the kind of decision we think is right for our business as we continue to grow the business in total. And our supply chain estimates has certainly helped us to make this part of our business more efficient overtime.","Michael Baker","Okay. I appreciate the color. I\u2019ll turn over to someone else for questions.","Mary Dillon","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Ike Boruchow","Hey, thanks for taking my question everyone. Scott, so I saw the prestige brand business was higher margin for you, but I think you said in your prepared remarks the new prestige boutique sales are a little dilutive. Can you maybe just walk us through some of the economics and how the boutique business differs from the other prestige business that you guys have?","Scott Settersten","Sure, Ike. There is an interesting mix and that's why we\u2019ve been trying to walk people back a little bit from counting a number of boutiques we\u2019re putting in and what stores locations and so on that we are going into. Because it is kind of an interesting mix and dynamic that we have in the store and it\u2019s the overall offering and the variety of brands and the different price points, I mean, collectively with services that\u2019s driving the results, right.","So, that directly more to your questions, so the prestige boutique brands are -- well take a step back prestige generally overall is higher margin business than mass is, alright. So that\u2019s one general statement but there is a lot of exceptions to the general rule unfortunately or fortunately for us.","So on the prestige side, those boutique brands are lower than a lot of our other prestige brands, right. So adding into the mix while it\u2019s driving incremental sales and margin dollars on a rate basis creates a headwind for us. So again fantastic comps, very healthy growth there, excellent overall result for us.","On the mass side, well again it\u2019s generally lower margin business the exceptions there Ulta Beauty Collection, right, very high private label margins there, mix would be another one that provides better than average mass margin rate. So the secrets are that Ulta having all those different levers and ability to promote and drive conversion on those brands to help deliver the best overall results.","Ike Boruchow","Got it, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Shannon Coyne of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. ","Shannon Coyne ","Hi, thanks congratulations on a great quarter. I was just wondering if you could talk directionally about the growth rate in the prestige brands versus the mass brands do you find that the growth rates are widening or converging overtime. And then maybe if so kind of what\u2019s driving those differences, any changes that you might be seeing? Thanks.","Dave Kimbell","Yes, so I\u2019d say, if you just look across the industry as a whole, over the last several quarters, a year or so, prestige in general has had higher growth rate than mass both have been growing. And that\u2019s been true largely true at Ulta that our prestige brands have been growing or prestige portfolio has been growing a little bit faster than mass.","Having said that mass is quite strong. Prestige has benefit of -- we are still building our penetration adding probably more brands into prestige than into mass over the last year or so. But our focus is to drive growth and we are pleased with the growth that we are seeing on both sides of the business again that\u2019s one of the key differentiators for us is the mass, prestige the ability to offer all things beauty all in one place.","So we are really happy with the growth and nice benefit of having a diverse portfolio is we can take advantage of wherever there is growth in the industry and then drive our own business that way.","Shannon Coyne","Okay, thanks. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the David Schick, Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed with your question. ","David Schick","Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted an update on as you have added the prestige brand, is it bringing in a different customer at a different clip. I think we have talked about that over the last year, but any update to whether it\u2019s a different customer, your existing customer trying those brands, what\u2019s driving the ticket?","Dave Kimbell","Well we have been adding as we talked about over the last several quarters, we\u2019re really pleased and I guess proud of new member growth that we have been having. I\u2019ll tell you that growth comes some are coming in for new prestige brands, many are coming in for the first time and buying mass brands, they buy hair brand.","So there is still a mix of the new brands, I\u2019d say yes, adding brands anywhere in the house can help us attract new customers if it\u2019s a known brand or a new brand that we are launching with social buzz exclusivity. So certainly that helps to add new prestige brands and driving new members in. But by no means is it the only source of new member growth in our business.","Ulta Beauty does a great job of introducing customers to their prestige brands would many often our guest that come in and buy mass discover brands in the prestige portfolio for the first time at Ulta Beauty. So that\u2019s a big growth driver for us and an important growth driver for our brand partners.","Mary Dillon","I would just ad one thing what Dave which is kind of the core premise that we operated off of it because really the deep understanding of the consumer segment in the beauty market. And the beauty enthusiast is a phrase that we use that really defines the core segment, really a large segment it\u2019s 57% of shoppers by definition they are made by products and brands all across the spectrum in terms of price points and categories.","So I wouldn't expect that by adding certain types of brands like prestige brand that could have fundamentally changed who is attractive to Ulta Beauty. I think as Dave said well it kind of add to the mosaic, but she consistently -- she might change that shift that mix a bit overtime, but she loves the fact that she can get an array that's what we call all things beauty on the play. So this we expect to continue, we expect the beauty enthusiast segment to grow as well. ","David Schick","Thanks so much. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Altobello","Thank you. Hey guys good afternoon. So I was hoping to get a little more insight into the spending patterns for your typical ultimate awards members and how that plays out overtime. How long do you see that ramp before there is a plateau, and how does spending patterns of your newer members differ from spending patterns of your more tenured members?","Mary Dillon","Well our newer members, our members spend more overtime and she gets more engaged with Ulta Beauty and certainly if she becomes the multiple an omnichannel shopper. As you step back we still really only have a third on average of our shoppers\u2019 beauty wallet certainly higher for some lower for others. We also know that most of our members -- our members always shopping about a quarter of the categories that we operate in.","So it's hard to kind of pinpoint an exact feeling. I think there is plenty of opportunity for us to continue to drive a growth through share of both new members coming into the programs as well as the beauty wallet of our existing members. Plenty of opportunity for them to continue to expand.","Joe Altobello","Okay got it. And then if I can just sneak one more in for Scott the ROIC of the non-traditional doors versus your typical 10,000 square foot variety?","Scott Settersten","I think we said on our fourth quarter call right probably not at exactly the same kind of returns, at least in the early years we're not expecting that, I mean, these are significantly higher cost kind of real estate deals, but they are subject to the same exact disciplines that we used for every other store in the chain.","These are not the term flagship in any way shape perform are expected to be very productive stores over the long-term. We're just allowing ourselves a little cushion to see to give ourselves a little bit more ramp up time in those stores. But again we expect them to produce very solid financial results for our investors.","Joe Altobello","Great, thank you guys. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Adrienne Yih","Thank you, good afternoon and congratulations on a great quarter. Mary I guess my question is going to go back to e-commerce and the tremendous strength and growth you saw there up 70%. Were you surprised by that first of all? And then secondarily were you doing something to kind of move the customer to that particular channel.","And Scott, I guess in that vein when we're looking at the gross margin or the margin both gross margin and operating margin, on the gross margin side is it pressuring because they're inclusive of free shipping, they're smaller lower margin items there. And then is it operating margin accretive. So to the extent that we see this channel it should be accretive to earnings. Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Okay thanks Adrienne I'll take the first part on e-commerce. Yes so it was a stronger result than we have planned. We're very, very excited about the fact that because of our supply chain investments we're able to fulfill what the guest wanted in a way that was very exceptional so that was terrific.","And I would say we're probably benefiting from some newer digital marketing tools that we implemented last year. So paid search, display advertising, paid social those are all building momentum to really drive traffic, so that certainly is benefited our e-commerce business. We also just had great offers, I think, I believe smartly targeted site improvements and again the supply chain investments that have made the overall experience for the guests even better. So those things in total I think created that kind of momentum on e-commerce.","Scott Settersten","And that's a good question Adrienne. I think people get -- it gets a little fuzzy when you're talking about margin and contribution on e-commerce versus retail I know myself. So we've been spending a lot of time here actually we just refreshed our board here recently and just new ways of thinking about that. So the difference at the gross margin versus operating, I\u2019d say at the operating margin level we're almost to the point now where we're kind of agnostic on what channel she buys in.","And so when you think about the dynamics there, it really almost not quite, but it\u2019s close to being a wash with the trade-off behind the shipping. We have made a lot of progress, right, on the efficiencies in our DCs here over the last couple of years, we have the full assortment online now, remember wasn\u2019t that longer go that we didn\u2019t have Pro Hair online, which is one of our higher margin categories. So we have gotten to a good place overall with our e-commerce business, where at the operating margin line it\u2019s almost kind of a net zero. ","You are trading off shipping cost for store labor and boutique investments and all those things that you are doing in the store right labor investments to go along with that. So that\u2019s the good news. Working our way backup to the gross profit line, really what\u2019s going on there it\u2019s more of a I\u2019d call it a category, a product mix kind of issue, right. So the margin there is lower online than it is our typical store at lease today it is and it\u2019s generally because it\u2019s we over index on things like PCA, right. ","So take $200 hair dryers where it\u2019s easier you are going to price compare that maybe a little bit more closely that you would if you were walking on our store, you got easier access to a coupon, right, it\u2019s easy to go find is there some kind of deal I can get on this appliance when I am spending this kind of money.","So that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s putting pressure on the gross profit line I would say right now, but again we kind of make up for a lot of that as you move your way down the P&L. So the good news there as well as it\u2019s something that we are aware of and we are working on and thinking about ways that we can try to improve that for our business, as we look to the future.","Adrienne Yih","And then to your gross margin up a little bit in the second quarter, what dynamics change there or what\u2019s the underlying e-commerce growth in Q2?","Scott Settersten","It\u2019s approximately 50% comp we set for the second quarter. ","Adrienne Yih","Okay, very good. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Omar Saad of Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. ","Omar Saad","Thanks for taking my question, great quarter. It\u2019s interesting to us that it seems like your traffic numbers are phenomenal, but almost as they slowed down just a little bit you are seeing the e-commerce side accelerate. And I am wondering through the great data that you guys collected at the loyalty program. If you can see patterns or trends it\u2019s the same consumers shopping less in stores and more online, is it total incremental trips that are coming online in addition to what they have been doing in the stores or is it new people who are shopping online only. Would love to kind of get a perspective on that those changing dynamics between your online and physical stores. ","Mary Dillon","Yes, I will start, Dave if anything else you want to add. But we really have very few people that shop online only at all, it\u2019s really the bulk of our business people shopping obviously in store and then around 8.5% of our guests are now doing omnichannel shopping. And really as I said earlier, as we study it, it looks to be quite incremental. ","So I mean in any given quarter there is going to be variations I guess on traffic patterns and what not. But the incremental -- what\u2019s happening with the e-commerce business really for those guests as we\u2019ve kind of separate them out and look at them they are growing in terms of retail sales the same with similar looking guests, or adding e-commerce trip I guess you would call it and purchases on top of that.","So I think it\u2019s a very healthy place to be, pleasing to the consumer insights that we have about how should like the shop most engaged shop or likes to try a lot of things that we offer which goes up well online. So I think it\u2019s a continuation of that, which is great for our business longer term because these omnichannel shoppers are best guests not unlike our store on guest, most engage at that. ","Dave Kimbell","The only thing I guess\u2026","Omar Saad","Definitely, sorry go ahead. ","Dave Kimbell","I was just going to say the only thing I\u2019d add is it goes back to Mary\u2019s wallet share opportunity and I think that\u2019s really the big driver of this as we\u2019re -- we believe it\u2019s very incremental and because of that it\u2019s capturing just a greater share of the wallet.","So we see a lot of runway there without it cannibalizing stores. So our goal is to have them work together. We want a new guest that we acquire online to get into store as quickly as possible and then we are working hard to convert our in-store customers to online. So, there doesn\u2019t appear to be a big trade off at this point and we see a lot of runway ahead of us.","Omar Saad","Yes that\u2019s definitely pretty interesting, now you are not saying the in-store trips and spend drop off that much as they add online trips to their menu. Thanks for all of the information, it\u2019s very helpful. ","Mary Dillon","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Kelly Halso of Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your question. ","Kelly Halso","Hi, thank you for taking my question and congrats on another great quarter. I just want to follow-up on a previous question since there has been a lot of chat around the beauty category lately. So how did the total beauty category grow, prestige beauty in particular and prestige cosmetics? And just remind us of how it grew in FY16? ","And then as you go deeper with some of these premier prestige brands and have you thoughts about how that opens you up or possible makes you more exposed competitors who may not be as discipline with their promotional cadence. And is that conversation you\u2019ve had with some of these key vendors historically they have been very discipline with their pricing and promotion.","And then just secondly, I know Pro Hair Care is a pretty important category in the second quarter, how has that category been growing is there been any changes in growth or anything we should be thinking about? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Let me just start with the first part and see if Dave can come back in on the category type work. So I guess I would just say as I said before it certainly a competitive category, there is a light of moving dynamics. I\u2019ll give you a split of offence and I think our offence proven to be a pretty good offence, right. So, we offer our guest a whole array of ways to get great deals and being a great total value proposition is important for every consumer category that exists. ","And so we can flex up and down, I would say that our ability to be very targeted, to be very varied in our marketing mix and our demand creation tools and the ability to leverage our loyalty program to get insights and drive work with our brands partners to offer really targeted smart promotions is pretty unparalleled.","And so I think that for us as we work with our brand partners, we are making sure that we have always working to make sure we got great guest offers that are compelling and differentiated. And I\u2019m confident that that's going to continue to be a way for us to be -- continue to win and drive share growth in a dynamic marketplace. ","And frankly our guests love the fact that when she buys more from us she gets more points and she can then redeem in the stores. So the royalty program really is the foundation of helping offsetting being protective in our competitive position. On category.","Dave Kimbell","Yes, on the total category I don\u2019t if we\u2019ve got full inside on the combined category. What I will -- and although we feel confident in beauty as we have for a while and see a lot of growth all the demographic trends that we\u2019ve talked about are everybody is true today as what we\u2019ve talked about in the past continue to see high engagement in beauty. Young women with Latinas, with African American, there is plenty of growth ahead of us.","I will say we see strong growth in categories that hadn\u2019t been growing strong like skin care is strong we\u2019ve seen strong performance in fragrance, bath is doing well. You asked specifically about hair, hair has been strong for us and you are right that we\u2019ve got -- hair is always important for us and we\u2019ve got some big activities on hair we\u2019ve launched several new brands.","And there is strong newness across key brands like Paul Mitchell and Dyson and Mary mentioned the Flawless line that we just launched. So there is Madison Reed lots of newness, lots of strength good marketing and promotional strategy in hair so we\u2019re confident about that. So we feel really good about the total category and are seeing some strength in key pockets that we\u2019re excited about.","Kelly Halso ","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen we receive end of the question and answer section. I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Mary Dillon for closing comments.","Mary Dillon","I\u2019d just like to say thank you to our 34,000 associates who delivered a terrific start to 2017 and has set the stage for another year of strong top and bottom-line growth.

Ms. Lefebvre, you may begin.","Laurel Lefebvre","Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Ulta Beauty third quarter 2016 conference call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Dave Kimbell, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer.

Good afternoon. Ulta Beauty\u2019s top line momentum accelerated in the third quarter driving record sales and earnings performance. The team continues to execute exceptionally well against our key strategies. Highlights of the quarter include success in acquiring new brands, strength in overall newness, increases in awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand, continued excellent results from our loyalty program, improving performance of our supply chain and systems, and robust growth in our e-commerce business.","In the third quarter, we grew the top line 24.2% and delivered 16.7% comp sales on top of the 12.8% comp in the third quarter of last year. This is the best comp performance on both the 1- and 2-year basis in our history as a public company, driven by healthy traffic and ticket growth. We achieved the strongest quarterly comps of the year in all three channels. E-commerce growth was well above planned and the retail and salon businesses also delivered their best top line growth of the year.","In terms of categories, cosmetics, both mass and prestige continues to lead our growth, with new brands and new items from existing brands contributing to better than expected performance. Strength on the top line was broad-based as we gained market share across all major categories. Earnings per share rose to $1.40, representing 26% growth significantly better performance than what we anticipated going into the quarter when our initial outlook called for 13% to 17% earnings per share growth. This upside in EPS was due to better than expected top line growth and our continued success with loyalty and CRM efforts.","I would now like to highlight some of the key drivers of our third quarter performance in the context of our strategic imperatives starting with our loyalty program. We grew rolling 12-month active membership by 28% to reach 21.7 million active members as our store teams continued to drive excellent conversion at checkout. Similar to the trends we have seen all year, the loyalty program metrics including retention rate, sales per member, frequency of purchase, and average member ticket all continued to be very strong. We continued to prioritize more personalized CRM offers for our loyalty members versus broad discounts and promotions, and as evolution in our marketing strategy continues to benefit margin rate and allows us to invest in other parts of the marketing mix such as television, radio, and digital advertising, which continued to drive awareness and clarity about our brands.","Our Ultimate Rewards credit card program continues to be well received since its launch in August. We are seeing strong guest engagement both in-store and online. Our team carried out extensive associate training and planning ahead of the launch, resulting in seamless execution of the program. Credit card signups are exceeding expectations. Some of the compelling promotions we are offering for new cardholders are driving higher average baskets and units per transaction as guests take advantage of one-time offers.","Turning to our marketing and brand awareness activities, our third quarter marketing plan features signature promotions like 21 Days of Beauty in September, our Gorgeous Hair events in October, and a series of activities focused on raising funds for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. We returned as the official partner to The Ellen DeGeneres Show, putting BCRF and Ulta Beauty on a national stage to millions of viewers each week to raise awareness and funds. Our store teams raised nearly $3 million during this year\u2019s Gorgeous Way to Give campaign, and our salon stylists were proud to perform more than 50,000 beauty services at our Cut for a Cause event in support of our BCRF fundraising program.","From an advertising perspective, during the fall, we ran national TV and radio ads to support our 21 Days of Beauty and Gorgeous Hair promotions. We created this new and built on the inaugural campaign from last year. We continue to also see significant growth in our social platforms, especially Instagram and Snapchat. We recently surpassed 2.6 million fans on Instagram and held our first-ever Snapchat takeover with YouTube influencer, Jenny Fox. We have Wende Zomnir, the Founder and Chief Creative Officer of Urban Decay take over our Snapchat and Instagram channels, yielding millions of impressions. And we also announced a partnership with E! News, with the launch of freeSTYLE a weekly Facebook Live show. The program includes fan interactions, discussions, and reviews of the best and most relevant people, products, and trends that matter to the 9.5 million highly engaged E! News Facebook fans.","Now, on the merchandising front, new brands and new products within existing brands drove better than expected sales growth with strength across all categories. Similar to what we have experienced all year long, makeup brands like Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Anastasia, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lanc\u00f4me, Benefit, Real Techniques, and Ardell delivered the highest growth rates in the quarter. Our own Ulta Beauty collection was also a top performer. We have restaged the brand with new packaging, branding, and innovation, and about 600 stores now feature an enhanced mall presentation with improved signage and elevated fixtures.","In mass skincare, Tony Moly and Boots No7 were standouts. And our Pro Hair business accelerated, with newness from DevaCurl and Living Proof contributing to strong comps in this category. Living Proof also partnered with our services business for a 1-day salon takeover event to introduce salon guests to this brand, and we discussed many of the new brands we are adding to our assortment at our Analyst Day just a few weeks ago, but let me recap a few of the highlights.","During the third quarter, we launched Est\u00e9e Lauder skincare and cosmetics in 30 stores and online. We launched Shiseido, Origins, and Proactiv, greatly enhancing our skincare offering. We added e.l.f. to our online assortment. We introduced the innovation \u2013 the innovative Dyson hairdryer in 200 stores and online. We have also completed almost all of the 500 plus Clinique, Lanc\u00f4me, and Benefit boutiques planned for the year. In addition, we added the best of Clinique end cap in all stores that don\u2019t have a full Clinique boutique.","Now, turning to our services business, salon sales grew 16.7% and comped 10.3% with strength in color, hair treatments, and makeup services. Our services business is increasingly using CRM campaigns to drive awareness and encourage trial of our service offerings. We rolled out our improved online booking experience to all stores during the quarter to make it even easier for our guests to make an appointment in our salons. We continue to focus on elevating our in-house artistic team and curating design trends exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Our fall and holiday trends include a look we call Sombre, which is a new softer way to achieve an ombre look and a new color we call ronze, highlights that bring together beautiful shades of copper and auburn. The artistic team participated in several designer runway shows at Fashion Week, driving awareness to Ulta Beauty\u2019s hair authority and inspiring the entire salon team across the chain, and our Benefit Brow boutiques continued their excellent performance with brow services now available in more than 800 stores and a successful launch of the wide range of new brow products in more shades. We are now testing online booking for brow services to make it easier for our guests to make an appointment in our Benefit Brow bars.","Turning to store growth, we opened 42 stores in the third quarter on our way to executing our 2016 program of 100 net new stores ending the quarter with 949 stores. Our growth and development team has completed almost all of the 500 plus prestige brand boutiques we planned for this year, including new stores and remodels, along with updates to the Ulta Beauty collection in fragrance and nail fixtures. New store productivity remains very strong with the class of 2016 stores performing well above budget and far above sales hurdles established to meet our internal rate of return thresholds. We have already approved all of the 100 stores planned for 2017 program, including a new store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago.","As you heard in our Analyst Day, we completed our in-depth analysis of the real estate opportunity in the U.S. and announced a new launch room target to rollout between 1,400 to 1,700 stores, with opportunities to further penetrate existing suburban markets, expand our penetration in small markets and begin to develop urban markets. At the same time, we updated our new store maturation ramp based on current trends and higher new store productivity, upgrading year one sales from $2.8 million to $3.1 million and revising upward our year five sales estimate to $4.5 million from $4 million. We are confident that our stores will continue to produce very attractive returns.","Turning to our e-commerce business, ulta.com sales grew 59.1% on top of 56.3% growth last year, contributing 240 basis points to our total company comp. The strong revenue growth was driven entirely by increased transactions. We continue to evolve and upgrade the guest experience while improving site performance. We made enhancements to our mobile app, including our product detail page redesigned to better display product options and information, integration of our briefly launched content platform called The Mix and the addition of our new salon appointment booking tool. We launched the try and feature called Glam Lab last month to allow guests to virtually test products and shades within our iPhone and Android app by uploading a selfie or choosing a model with a similar complexion. Our technology partner for this platform is a company known for best-in-class realism and accuracy of color matching.","Finally, to update you on supply chain performance and investments, we are very pleased and proud with how smoothly our team has executed on a very complex set of initiatives and system rollouts in addition to opening two new DCs in the past 1.5 years. Our Greenwood DC is now servicing 227 stores and fulfilling 44% of our e-commerce orders. Our newest distribution center in Dallas is ramping on schedule and currently fulfilling 130 stores and 30% of total e-comm orders. On the systems side, we are starting to see benefits from the core merchandise systems we recently implemented. SWIFT, our new forecasting replenishment tool, continues to ramp up and help us optimize inventory. Our store level in-stocks are improving and more of our inventories in our stores versus in our DCs improving the guest experience. We now have all the tools in place to help us make better, more database assortment and inventory decisions.","So that wraps up my third quarter review. Looking at the holiday, we are expecting healthy traffic and strong sales growth as a result of our integrated merchandising and marketing plan. From a product standpoint, we are excited to offer an array of newness and exclusivity in our holiday assortment across all categories and brands. To share a few highlights, we will feature an assortment of Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me products in every store for holiday. We just launched NARS, featuring three hero products; their famous blush, bronzer and a multipurpose stick, The Multiple. These are available online and featured on [indiscernible] and every store in time for holiday with a more expansive assortment offered online later this month and then launched in select stores next year.","Our merchants have done a great job partnering with our brands to offer exclusive products across many brands and categories, a wide variety of holiday themed kits and stocking stuffers and men\u2019s grooming and fragrance kits. This year, we upgraded our fragrance kit with purchase program, complementing the exciting newness in our holiday fragrance assortment. And we have also launched an elevated Ulta Beauty collection of our traditional blockbuster kits that have already shown strong consumer response. And to support our compelling merchandise offering, we rolled out our holiday advertising campaign Joy to the Girl, which is integrated from a design and messaging perspective across all touch points, from in-store signage to new TV and radio spots running now to print and even the packaging of our Ulta Beauty collection holiday assortment. Our campaign encourage our guests to see us as a great gift giving destination as well as a place to get glammed up for holiday events with a visit to our salon. The guest kits and get glammed theme is featured in our television and radio spots through inspirational content on our social media platforms and on the mix on our website.","Key to executing our holiday plan, our store operations, e-commerce, supply chain and systems teams have all done an excellent job, preparing for the busy holiday season and our efforts have already paid off with the successful Black Friday, Cyber Monday weekend both in stores and online. All areas are stacked up and ready to delight our guests during the big weeks ahead.","So now I will hand over to Scott to discuss our third quarter financials and our outlook for the fourth quarter.","Scott Settersten","Thanks Mary. Good afternoon everyone. I will start with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 24.2% to $1.13 billion, driven by 16.7% comparable sales and continued strong performance of new stores. The total company comp was composed of 11.1% transaction growth and 5.6% average ticket growth. The retail comp of 14.6% was comprised of 9.6% traffic and 5% ticket. Ticket growth was driven about a third by units per transaction and about two-third by average selling price. The salon business comped 10.3% and similar to the recent trend was driven by ticket growth. The combined retail comp and salon comp yielded a total store comp of 14.3%. Gross profit increased 90 basis points. The improvement was the result of product margin expansion and leverage of store rent and occupancy expenses on strong comps, offset by planned supply chain investments.","Turning to SG&A expense, we de-leveraged by 80 basis points, driven by investments in growth initiatives, including store payroll to support our boutique strategy and a differentiated guest experience and de-leveraged overhead costs, in part due to an impairment charge related to the closure of a store in Louisiana due to the August flooding. This was partially offset by modest leverage in marketing. The tax rate was 37.4%, consistent with the first half of the year. Last year\u2019s Q3 tax rate of 36% reflected the benefit of some tax true-ups.","Moving to the balance sheet, inventories increased 16.5% on a per store basis, which is slightly below the comp rate. Similar to the recent trend, we continue to invest in inventory to support sales growth, seeing access to new brands and expand the presence of prestige boutiques in our stores. Also, our new distribution centers in Greenwood and Dallas are ramping and performing well, but are still far from being fully optimized. Capital expenditures were $131.6 million for the quarter, driven by new store openings, fixtures related to the continued rollout of boutiques as well as investments in systems. We ended the quarter with $243 million in cash and short-term investments.","In terms of share buybacks, we continue to repurchase shares in the open market as part of our 10b5-1 plan. During the third quarter, we repurchased about 179,000 shares of our stock, net of cost of just over $44 million. Year-to-date, including the accelerated share repurchase program and activity under our 10b5-1 plan, we repurchased approximately 1,450,000 shares at an average price of about $205 per share. Share repurchases under our current authorization are expected to contribute about 2 points of EPS growth for the year. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $148 million remaining available under the $425 million share repurchase program announced in March 2016.","Turning now to guidance for the fourth quarter, we anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.516 billion to $1.541 billion versus $1.268 billion last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 12% to 14% versus 12.5% last year. E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the 14% range. We plan to open about 25 stores in the fourth quarter versus the 14 last year, so pre-opening expense will be higher. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.13 versus $1.69 last year, with modest leverage on both the gross profit and SG&A lines. The tax rate is expected to be 37.5% and our fully diluted share count is estimated at $63 million. At our Analyst Day event in October, we raised our guidance for the full year 2016, expecting comparable sales to grow approximately 12% to 14% including the impact of the e-commerce business and EPS to increase in the mid 20s percentage range.","Now, with the upside to third quarter earnings, we expect full year comparable sales to grow 13% to 15% and earnings growth to be in the high 20s percentage range. Operating margin is expected to be up modestly for the year. CapEx is on track to reach approximately $390 million, driven by slightly higher CapEx per new store and also includes about $80 million for boutique expansion, with 500 plus store touches for Clinique, Lanc\u00f4me and Benefit boutiques as well as fragrance fixtures and Ulta Beauty collection updates.","Now, I will turn the call over to our conference call host to moderate the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Fassler of Goldman Sachs.","Matt Fassler","Thanks a lot and good afternoon. Congratulations on obviously terrific quarter. Anyway you look at it, you saw meaningful acceleration. Mary, you spoke about the 2-year comp, if you look at the typical seasonality of the business you really broke out. What would you say, among the different drivers of the business really changed the most? I mean you talked about the credit card as being new and being successful. Would you say that, that was decisive? Would you say it was the convergence of brand ads? Would you say it was anything on the online side? How would you \u2013 what would you identify as the primary catalyst to drive that kind of step change in sales momentum?","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Matt. Honestly, I would say it\u2019s the convergence of multiple factors, some of which you just said. So, we have been on a path for a while to drive increased brand awareness that obviously starts with the fact you will need to know who we are. I would say that certainly the assortment of products of brands, the acceleration of new brands, and the \u2013 frankly, the great performance of newness of brands and newness within existing brands has been a key factor, and I want to also say that our sort of demand creation engine just gets more fine tuned and the team has done a great job through loyalty evolving the way that we promote to becoming more personalized, our CRM platform working extremely well. As you mentioned the launch of the credit card has been another layer of a way for us to drive relevancy and drive share of beauty wallet with our shoppers. So, it\u2019s really a combination of all those things coming together, plus I would say, fantastic execution. So in store, the experience we think just gets better. Our associates have done a fantastic job of converting guests into our loyalty program. And obviously, our loyalty members are driving the majority of our sales. And of course, our in-stocks are just getting better all the time with supply chain and systems and teams behind those are working to just make sure their guests have what they want. So, I hate to fill the laundry list at you, but it really is a combination of all those factors working in concert.","Matt Fassler","Can I ask a quick follow-up without breaking your rule?","Mary Dillon","Matt, you just broke the rule. Go ahead.","Matt Fassler","So to the extent that loyalty has typically generated the majority of your sales, as we look at the growth in loyalty members per store, is that a pretty good representative of your \u2013 representation of your view of the growth in customers who are new to the chain on a same-store basis?","Mary Dillon","Yes, I am not sure if I could do exactly the equation you are doing. But that the majority of our sales are -- vast majority are driven by loyalty members, and so that\u2019s where the growth is coming from. And we know that we are getting new \u2013 I mean, we just really keep accelerating the growth of the number of people in the loyalty program having 21.7 at the end of last quarter. So yes, I would say that those things go together. And awareness is part of what\u2019s driving them in, but it\u2019s also the relevancy of our offers and everything else that we are doing.","Matt Fassler","Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel of Nomura.","Dan Stroller","Hi, this is Dan Stroller on for Simeon. Thanks for taking our question. With regards to the online booking, is there anyway to quantify how much that contributed to performance? How should we think about the benefits this might provide to the Brow Bar and then other ways you could leverage this tool? Thanks.","Scott Settersten","We are really excited to have it particularly on the Brow Bar. No, we are still monitoring and tracking it as relatively new on the Brow Bar. So, there is no real specific data that we are ready to share about direct impact, but we think it\u2019s really important for us across all services to make it as easy as possible for our guests to make appointments and engage with us. And so, we will continue to evolve the technology and we know that will improve the guest experience and we are excited about that going forward.","Dan Stroller","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih of Wolfe Research.","Adrienne Yih","Good afternoon. Congratulations. Great performance. Mary, I was out in the stores over Black Friday and Black Friday weekend and it was tremendous conversion. I was wondering could you give us some metrics on kind of some of your Black Friday traffic stats and also kind of what you did differently this year over last year and what the results ended up being? Thank you very much.","Mary Dillon","Sure. Thank you, Adrienne. Yes, I can\u2019t get specific about the quarter that we are in. I will just give you a little bit of color on it. We are pleased with how the holiday is starting, very pleased. And I think you saw that in action. I would say, there is kind of a few things. One is that really it\u2019s about what we sell, what we offer. So, I mentioned some of this already, but we have really got great new brands, existing brands with great newness, and then I would say we just keep raising our game as it relates to whether it\u2019s partnering with our brand partners and exclusives and great holiday kits or really raising our own game like on our Ulta Beauty collection blockbusters and products. So that, I would say, is a continuation of just improving. It\u2019s not new, but it\u2019s what we do, but doing it better, even our gift with purchase, stronger than year ago and really pull together in a really fantastic 360 degree marketing plan. So more to come in the holiday, I am pleased with how it\u2019s starting both in-store and online frankly. And again, I\u2019d say that our store teams and our supply chain are working together to make sure that the experience is great for the guests.","Adrienne Yih","And I will just add that the salon was incredibly busy during that weekend, so good job there.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Baker of Deutsche Bank.","Mike Baker","Hi, this question is for Scott. I believe you said that SG&A was leveraged in the fourth quarter, slight leverage, I think you said. And if that\u2019s right, this will be the first time in four quarters when you leverage SG&A. So, is that a sign that we are now fully through all the supply chain and systems investments and then should we, therefore, think that we should be able to leverage these really strong comps going forward?","Scott Settersten","Yes. I would say, as we looked at 2016, the third quarter kind of represented the high watermark, I guess I would say as far as the deleverage is concerned. Again, a lot of factors come together at that particular point in the year, whether it\u2019s boutiques ramping up, new stores, right, 42 new stores there as kind of the high bar, the supply chain, we are just getting out of the gate with our Dallas there. So, it takes a while for those things to scale up. So fourth quarter, as we go in with the heavier sales lift in the fourth quarter, we expect to see operating margin expansion and SG&A leverage as well. As I look to \u201817 and beyond, I would just be a little careful there. Again, we have given some long-term financial framework there, right when we expect operating margin to expand. And I think we said generally heavier on the gross profit line, a little bit less so on the SG&A line, but they both are expected to leverage in \u201817 and beyond.","Mike Baker","Okay, understood. Thanks. I will keep to one question.","Operator","Our next question comes fro Joe Altobello of Raymond James.","Joe Altobello","Thanks. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. First question, I guess, for Scott, obviously the upside to the gross margin in the quarter much better with what we are looking for and I think you guys have talked about that being flattish last quarter. And Scott, you mentioned product margin helped there as well as fixed cost leverage. Can you kind of give us a little more color on what happened on the product margin side that led to that upside? And then secondly if I could for Mary, as you look at the introduction of new bands going forward, do you feel like there is more of an opportunity on the department store brand side or more from upstarts? Thanks.","Scott Settersten","Yes. So, as far as the product margins are concerned, Joe, it\u2019s really just a continuation of all the things we have been doing over the course of the last couple of 2 to 3 years, right? So, just being smart about our marketing, our merchandise mix, how we are optimizing the business for both in short and the long-term. So, we mentioned pulling back on broader kind of promotional efforts and kind of redeploying some of that into more targeted things with our loyalty and CRM tools. I mean, that just continues to work really well. So, we are a pragmatic crew here. One of the fortunate things we have in this model is being able to toggle while we are in the corner, right and watching sales trends. So, we mentioned the credit card got off to a spectacular start as we got into the quarter. We weren\u2019t expecting it to be quite so strong. So again Mary mentioned there is a nice offer there right, 20% off for your entire purchase when you sign up initially. So as we saw that kind of take off, we are able to pull back on the postcard that we typically do later in the quarter. So again, just looking at all the different elements and levers that we have to pull-in to try to optimize total results each quarter.","Mary Dillon","And Joe, I will have Dave take your second question. Dave?","Dave Kimbell","Yes. So about new brands and where we see opportunity, I will start with just saying we see opportunity across all parts of the store, that\u2019s one of the real secrets to our success is this all things beauty, all in one place that we are looking for growth, in prestige brands, mass brands, hair, skincare, fragrance and we have been \u2013 and that\u2019s part of the reason we have been having success is w have been bringing in new brands or expanding with existing brands in all parts of the store. Specifically, you asked about department stores brands, our big established brands versus upstarts. And frankly, I think we are looking for both. We talked about expansion in some of the biggest established prestige brands. You know we have been continuing to expand our partnership with Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me. We are just getting started with Est\u00e9e Lauder and NARS. But then upstarts have been a big part of our success over time and we feel really privileged to be partnering with smaller brands that are innovating in new and creative ways, Makeup Revolution in the mass cosmetic space is one example of that that has demonstrated some nice growth. So we will look for those opportunities as well and both of those areas will continue to drive our growth.","Joe Altobello","Perfect. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh","Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. So my one question is around your advertising efforts. So again, in the past few months, you guys again run the TV campaigns. It sounds like they are still meeting your expectations even as you lap some of the prior year offers, I just wanted to get a sense of what\u2019s helping you drive still strong performance on some of those advertising campaigns?","Dave Kimbell","Yes. So yes, we are really \u2013 feel really good about where we are from our overall marketing campaign. We did this third quarter was the lap of our first national TV campaign in the fall of 2015. And as Mary said, we repeated that again, really supporting our 21 Days of Beauty effort in the middle of the quarter and the results were quite strong. We track that, we measure it very closely, but we see strong and growing ROI across that probably most visible vehicle in TV. But other elements of our marketing plan, really all elements of our marketing plan are coming together to drive awareness in growth. Radio is a strong contributor to that, but we have been investing much more heavily in the digital space, in awareness, in social media, influencer, really across our entire digital footprint to connect with our guests where she wants to be connected. Mary mentioned in her remarks, our Ulta Beauty mix is an example of that on our own website, of creating our own content, as a big push, also partnering with influencers to drive that. So TV is a big part of it. We are pleased with the results. We are continuing that as we speak over the holiday period. We are back on air and we see that as a part of our mix, but we will also continue to innovate in all parts of it to make sure we are really taking advantage of the awareness opportunity that we see ahead of us.","Rupesh Parikh","Great. Best of luck for the holiday season.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Tunick of Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Tunick","Thanks. Good afternoon. I will add my congrats as well. I guess my first question is, ticket versus traffic, just curious I know you don\u2019t probably manage the business to it, but just curious as you think about, when you head into 2017 or beyond, what do you think is the makeup of that comp performance you had laid out between ticket and traffic and what might be the drivers. And then just a second quick one is online profitability versus the store four walls, like what kind of sales volume perhaps to the online business need to be to reach parity? Thanks very much.","Mary Dillon","Yes. I would say on the traffic versus ticket, to me their deal was just to be balanced and we have been doing that I think pretty effectively in the last quarter I think were about two-thirds traffic, one-third ticket and retail online was mostly transact traffic, which is great. But that balance is important because it\u2019s the ability to just continue to grow the business and not be reliant on just sort of set number of people and visits. So, a balance I think we would expect to hope certainly it\u2019s never going to be exactly that every quarter but that\u2019s the overall goal. In terms of the e-comm profitability, I mean I guess that\u2019s the constant area of focus. First of all, our e-commerce business has gotten more profitable in last couple of years as we expanded the assortment. Certainly, in the investments in the supply chain, being able to get those orders together in a more effective and efficient way. It will probably always be a somewhat lower profit margin than in the bricks-and-mortar parts of the business just because of the shipping cost. But we are happy with it. I mean the online business, as you can tell as we have talked at the Analyst Day it looks to be quite incremental to our guests in terms of how she uses the channel. And so as we continue to close the gap on profit margin, it\u2019s the great part of the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","Hi everyone, congrats on another great quarter. I guess my question, I am not sure Scott, I think this is for you, I am not sure if I am looking at this right, but I think you said supply chain pressures should be the most pronounced in Q2 and Q3 and your gross margins were up really nice in Q2 and Q3 about 100 basis points in those quarters and it looks like if you are assuming expense leverage in Q4 that the gross margin expansion should be much more moderate in Q4, I guess my question is, is there a call out there, is this just holiday being a more competitive quarter for you or is this just general conservatism, if I am thinking about this right?","Scott Settersten","Yes. I mean directionally, we are on the same \u2013 when I say it\u2019s the high watermark for supply chain we leverage it, but we don\u2019t \u2013 we are not expecting a lot of improvement, I guess I would say in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s directionally about roughly the same kind of de-leverage level. But again, it takes \u2013 these are, I would say, we \u2013 inside joke here, we are kind of belt and suspenders crew and we think that some of this is behind the curtain complex new systems and processes that we are implementing. So better to be prudent and careful and make sure that we can execute to make sure we keep our guests happy and the performance in both of those buildings is outstanding. They are doing much better than original target and expectations, so we are very happy with the performance.","Ike Boruchow","Got it. But is there a specific reason why the gross margin gains you have been seeing, which have been pretty massive over the last 12 months, why would those taper down significantly in Q4 and going forward, may be?","Scott Settersten","Yes. I would just say overall, the guidance is prudent, right. I mean, the holiday is wild and woolly. A lot of things can happen. Weather, other kinds of things, so we just want to make sure that we are prudent with our outlook and make sure that we provide financial targets that we feel comfortable that we can hit.","Ike Boruchow","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Altschwager of Robert W. Baird.","Mark Altschwager","Good afternoon and congrats on the continued success. One of the follow-up on the boutiques, big investment and ramping up throughout the year here, can you just give us a better sense of maybe how that\u2019s impacting the basket size and ticket expansion within those stores, is it a trade up versus an incremental purchase and if you found a lift from these recent additions to be consistent of what you have experienced in the past and perhaps, difficult to view these things in the back view, but just interested in any other learnings you have from the recent rollout?","Dave Kimbell","Yes. Overall, I would say, we continue to be really pleased with the addition of these boutiques. We have shared specific incrementality, although we say this is incremental to our business and the new boutiques are performing as well or better than \u2013 at this stage in their life as the previous boutiques that we launched. So we wouldn\u2019t \u2013 have any reason to believe that they wouldn\u2019t continue to add in the way they have been adding. Having said that, of course there are just \u2013 is a portion of our new brand additions. So while they are important, a lot of other things have been driving our overall comp growth in new brand additions, so we are pleased with it and we see growth come in as we look into 2017.","Mark Altschwager","Okay. Thanks and best of luck.","Dave Kimbell","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Yes. Thanks and good afternoon everybody. I wanted to ask about what\u2019s driving comp growth by category, if you can give a bit more granularity there, makeup, skincare, etcetera. And then just sort of a broader question and elaborating on one that was previously asked, I appreciate the kitchen sinking answer to the question of sort of what is rising comp growth, but what is the price you most since March given the original plan was 8% to 10% now, you are expecting 13% to 15% just sort of? Any granularity there would be helpful?","Mary Dillon","Yes, I will start with that which is that, I think it\u2019s really the performance of some of the new brands and the newness in existing brands have been stronger than we perhaps had forecasted, credit card stronger than we initially thought. So, those are a couple of things that I\u2019d say were somewhat more accelerated. It really is \u2013 those aren\u2019t the only things that are driving the comp growth, right. So, that\u2019s why I listed the dynamic of multiple factors working together, but those will be a couple examples of things that probably stronger than we would have thought back then. And then, Dave, on the other question?","Dave Kimbell","Yes. On the specific categories, I guess, I just say, we are one really pleased across all categories that we are seeing strong growth. I think Mary mentioned in her remarks that we are gaining share in each of our key categories and the drivers overall, we have talked about in the past is just a highly engaged consumer in beauty and our continued ability to connect with her and gain market share and gain her trust and loyalty and wallet share. And we think specifically within makeup, lot of trends driving makeup, it is the fastest growing segment of beauty right now and that\u2019s really driven by a high-level engagement, particularly with the young women, teens and millennials, but really across all age groups and all ethnicities, Hispanic and all women of color, in particular, are heavily engaged in makeup. There is more education and training and knowledge and trends around different makeup looks and styles. So, it is just a really healthy category and our participation in that has expanded through the brands that we are carrying, the way we are marketing it, the way we are participating in social media. So, we are benefiting from that. Skincare has been struggling for a few years, but has shown some nice signs of growth. Korean skincare has played a role in that. We are seeing strong growth in different aspects. Masks are a big part of other Asian skincare trends are driving growth. And overall recognition by millennials, in particular, that it isn\u2019t all about makeup, but you need to make sure your skin is in good shape as well. And so we are seeing a nice rebound of skincare. Other categories, fragrance, nice \u2013 isn\u2019t going anywhere near the level of makeup, but a lot of innovation in that space. We, of course, have been driving that with your one example of that is our Sarah Jessica Parker exclusive stash. So, lot of different reasons throughout key categories and it\u2019s a big focus for Ulta to make sure that we are front and center in all of those trends.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan.","Chris Horvers","Thanks. Good evening. So, I wanted to ask about the cadence of the quarter. You pre-announced in sort of mid-October at 14% to 15% at the Analyst Day. Were you anticipating the potential election disruption that didn\u2019t materialize? Was there an acceleration or was it just being prudent and conservative in the outlook?","Scott Settersten","Yes. Again, there is always a lot of things to consider during the course of the quarter, right and this pre-announcement always presents a little bit of risk. So again, you want to be confident in the numbers you are offering up to investors, right, that you feel confident that you can hit the target. So, there was some hurricane things floating around there in the middle of the quarter, there was the election, the uncertainty, again, we didn\u2019t see it reflected in our business day-to-day, but everyone else seemed to be talking about it. So, again it was just making sure we are prudent and comfortable with what we were communicating.","Chris Horvers","Understood. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up, was there any incentive comp pressure that you had in this quarter, because the numbers came in much better than expected and could you quantify the impact to SG&A? Thank you.","Scott Settersten","Could you repeat that question again? Chris, I don\u2019t think I quite followed it.","Chris Horvers","Was there any incentive \u2013 any bonus accrual\u2026.","Scott Settersten","I am sorry, I did share the comp piece, not the incentive. Yes, so that year-over-year that there was an impact in SG&A. It\u2019s not the most significant piece of it, but there definitely was higher incentive comp this year, obviously because of the performance that\u2019s right from what we initially thought early in the year.","Chris Horvers","Understood. Thanks very much. Have a good Halloween.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gere of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Jason Gere","Okay. Good evening and congratulations on another great quarter. Just a simple question, I guess, as you think about the holiday season now, are you surprised by what your competitors are not doing differently than maybe over the last couple of years? Because it seems like based on our checks, they are doing kind of sticking to the script and we know how that story kind of turns out. So, I don\u2019t mean to put you on the spot, but just in terms of other retailers out there and how they are approaching the holiday season, it\u2019s a great category obviously, but you seem to have kind of the right recipes to surprise that some of your competitors have not adjusted their strategy?","Mary Dillon","Well, thank you, Jason, I don\u2019t know. I mean, I really can\u2019t just focus on playing our offense, which sounds clich\u00e9. But I think we have got a really good beat on the insights and Dave talked about this that core focus on is our guests, current and perspective guests, what their needs are, how to think about a shopping experience, partnering with our brand partners to have great products, and then our teams putting together great demand tools whether it\u2019s a CRM platform, credit card, all the marketing. So, I mean I really can\u2019t really comment on what people are doing or not doing. We certainly pay a lot of attention out there watching it as well. I am proud about the fact that I think we are leading to guest insights and really driving execution through a lot of collaboration and its working.","Jason Gere","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kelly Halsor of Buckingham Research Group.","Kelly Halsor","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats again on an excellent quarter. I just want to follow-up on the boutiques. I think, correct me if I am wrong, you called out 500 touch points related to the three brands where you have boutiques currently. And I know you guys said that you had accelerated the growth of that this year kind of ahead of the holiday season. So, is that the case? I mean, what\u2019s the kind of opportunity into next year? I mean, are there opportunities with new brands in terms of the class of store, is this a situation where as you go to the kind of next tier down of stores that we shouldn\u2019t expect the same sort of returns on the boutiques or perhaps you are not wanting to expand further. Just any color on the boutiques would be helpful? And then secondly just on e-commerce, with the implied deceleration relative to 3Q. I mean, we saw that last year as well, but I know you guys had just opened up the Greenwood DC. Now, that the 2 DCs are running together and seemed to be doing pretty well. Is there any opportunity there that you could speak about? Thanks.","Dave Kimbell","Yes. So, on the boutiques, you are right, we have talked about 500 total boutique installations across the entire chain, both new and existing stores and with those three brands, Clinique, Lanc\u00f4me and Benefit. We said before that we intend or anticipate that \u2013 about that same amount next year both new stores as well as existing stores. I wouldn\u2019t think of it as much of going to a different tier of stores, we have really been ruling them out in our comp stores based on what\u2019s optimal from a scheduling standpoint, where it can fit lease terms for stores, because we do other activities within the storm when we put a boutique and we will update our Ulta Beauty collection presentation in some cases we put in a new fragrance presentation. So, it is a part \u2013 an important part, but only a portion of the activity that we have in store when we put that in. So, we will continue to put those in next year and see that again. I would say, well, so that\u2019s important. It is one element of new brand activity that we will have across the whole chain next year. And as far as e-comm growth in the fourth quarter, we just \u2013 we feel confident within the guidance that we have given and we will continue to try to focus on that business. We are happy of the results we have had so far this year and it\u2019s an important season for e-comm, for our e-commerce business and we are confident in our efforts.","Kelly Halsor","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephanie Wissink of Piper Jaffray.","Stephanie Wissink","Thanks. Good evening, everyone. I just have follow-up question on the e-commerce business. Could you compare or contrast a bit your online orders versus some of the store level analytics? Is it similar from a category mix or mass versus prestige? And then as you think about overall your loyalty program, how important is that online business if you are driving kind of a multi-channel shopper over time? Thank you.","Dave Kimbell","Yes. So the first part of your question around mix, generally yes. It is very similar in both online and in-store. Her shopping behavior is reflective of the in-store experience. In particular, over the last couple of years, as we have rounded out our portfolio not so long ago, we didn\u2019t have all the brands in professional hair care or even in prestige online that we had in-store. Now that we do have that and so her behavior is very similar and we really see it as a complementary part of our in-store business. She looks to find what\u2019s the most convenient for her as we book. As far as loyalty and the importance of that, your question is about loyalty and importance of both online and in-store and how we drive that, is that right?","Stephanie Wissink","Yes. And I think historically, you have given us some metrics around that cross channel shopper precise and kind of important versus the single channel?","Dave Kimbell","Yes. So we shared some of those statistics back at our Analyst Day is it\u2019s really consistent in that 6% range of online omni-channel shopper. It\u2019s growing a little bit. But when our base store growth is so strong that takes a really high e-commerce growth to make a complete difference in that number, but importantly, an absolute number of omni-channel shoppers is expanding. And that\u2019s very much part of our overall strategy. We see that as a big part of our future growth as to get her fully engaged in all aspects of our business. E-commerce, retail business, services and salon, we feel like once we can get her engaged in all parts, then her loyalty rates or spend has gone up, we shared those numbers before and so we are continuing to see that in the third quarter and will be a focus for us going forward.","Stephanie Wissink","Thanks guys. Have a great holiday.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Oliver Chen of Cowen & Company.","Oliver Chen","Hi. Thank you. We are curious about the next few years with mobile innovation and what\u2019s on your radar towards making sure your experience is set apart and in that context, the reality of Amazon making strides in this category, what are just some of the factors that really continue to set you apart as you look to the future and continue to really distinguish yourself with a product assortment with the loyalty program with the newness factor as well versus Amazon. And then, if you could just tell us, is strobing and contouring still middle innings, because it seems like it continues to be a hot trend? Thanks.","Mary Dillon","I love it. Oliver, I appreciate your knowledge about the categories. I will say, contouring and strobing, highlighting all of that is still popular. Interesting, false eyelashes is on the move too, right, so it\u2019s something that you wouldn\u2019t think of the timing, but it\u2019s a fast growing kind of trend too. So anyway, that\u2019s a great thing about beauty there is so much innovation and interesting trends that cycle in and out. I would just say, I will make a comment about mobile has saved to add more color and context here, but you are absolutely spot on, we all \u2013 everybody stands at mobile is the center of everybody\u2019s life. But it\u2019s our appendage, our attachment. And I am proud about the fact that I think as a company our team has really been increasing our focus and our execution around mobile. It\u2019s becoming more important to us than ever in terms of driving sales and traffic and its fast growing. We have been innovating in terms of our mobile platform and I mentioned already, but an example is Glam Lab, which is a nice little piece of technology that I am not good enough to take myself to really execute it well, I have tried. But it\u2019s a great thing for millennials who wanted to have a more interacted experience. So as our offerings and our execution in mobile improve, we just get stronger there. And it\u2019s certainly going to be the epicenter how we think about sort of a mobile first mentality as we go forward. Is there anything else you might want to add, Dave, which was innovation there?","Dave Kimbell","I would just say in mobile, to put it simplistically, it\u2019s certainly for us it is the focus of really all of our e-commerce efforts on this. So we will continue to work on that desktop, but where all the growth is and the attention is in mobile, over two-thirds of our traffic is kind of coming through mobile right now and a growing part of our sales. And two core components of that content in commerce and we will keep building that content experience that gives her access to information when and where she wants it and then just make it as easy as possible for her to shop. And then as you well know it\u2019s a different shopping experience on a mobile device and so we are continuing to innovate in that space and make it easy through finding products, paying for products and exploring new information and trends. So it\u2019s really a focus for us.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Best regards.","Operator","Our last question comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks. Congratulations again. First, I will put them in two parts. On the top line, you said a lot of the sales or a majority are getting done in the loyalty card, as we know, can you tell us how, I don\u2019t know if this was mentioned, the mix of either new sign ups and that\u2019s where the majority of the sales are coming versus existing and how that\u2019s trended versus prior quarters. And then, this is also a clarification to an earlier question, on the expense line, if I heard right, even excluding the impairment charge, did the corporate expense line de-lever and if so, I am sorry if you said, but can you tell us why and if that should continue?","Mary Dillon","Yes. On the loyalty Simeon, so I mean we are growing rapidly and adding new members, but the majority of the sales are coming from existing members or members that have reactivated. But as we get new members into the program everyday, frankly, every week, obviously that gives us a great base for future sales growth.","Scott Settersten","And as far as the SG&A line is concerned, the answer to the question is yes. It did de-lever even ex the store impairment charge. And it was primarily kind of a mixture of things, store payroll and one of the primary drivers again part of it is connected to the boutique strategy. So there is a lot of training and payroll preparation associated with those new boutiques that are kind of just getting off the starting line during the course of the third quarter, right and setting us up for success in fourth quarter and many quarters beyond that. And then, we also kind of \u2013 we were also \u2013 with people costs associated with expenses in the quarter. Again in the way we kind of operate out, but we finally get all of our corporate headcount kind of in place as you see the third quarter, so again that\u2019s max de-leverage point during the course of the year. And then a little bit of incentive compensation that goes along with that year-over-year comparison again. We leverage that as we go into fourth quarter and then into the following years.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Ms. Mary Dillon for closing remarks.","Mary Dillon","I just like to thank our 30,000 associates for another fantastic quarter and all the hard work that everybody has put in and continues to put it to give our guests a great shopping experience over the holiday season. And thanks to all of you for your interest in Ulta Beauty and we wish you a happy and healthy holiday.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laurel Lefebvre, Vice President Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Laurel Lefebvre","Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Ulta Beauty first quarter conference call, hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also, joining us is Dave Kimbell, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company safe harbor language.

Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. We make references during this call to non-GAAP earnings growth adjusted for the impact of income tax rates due to accounting -- for equity compensation.","During the Q&A session, please ask one question only to allow us to accommodate as many of you as possible during the hour scheduled for this call.","I'll turn the call over to Mary.","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Laurel and good afternoon everyone. 2019 is off to a strong start with solid first quarter financial performance. Total sales increased 12.9% and we achieved a 7% comp on top of an 8.1% comp in the first quarter of 2018. These top line results reflect a healthy balance of traffic and ticket growth as well as continued double-digit comp across growth -- in mass categories, skincare, and fragrance tempered by missed performance in prestige cosmetics.","We're driving stellar growth with expansion brands like Clinique, MAC, Lancome, Estee Lauder, and Nars. But this isn't yet sufficient to offset the continuous softness in several large established prestige cosmetic brands.","Gross profit leverage was a highlight during the quarter, benefiting from progress with our efficiencies for growth initiatives and stable promotions year-over-year, which helped to offset ongoing channel, category, and brand mix headwinds. Continued progress on our strategic imperatives drove our performance during the quarter and I'll give a brief update on each one.","Beginning with our strategies to increase loyalty and evolve our brand. Our ultimate rewards loyalty program grew to 32.6 million active members, representing member growth of 14% on a rolling 12-month basis. Our store associates continue to do a fantastic job converting new guests to the program. We're also seeing healthy increases in diamond and platinum members. Credit card account growth was above plan, and we're maintaining the nearly 50% increase in incremental spend from guests once they become card holders. Gift card sales increased 32% in the first quarter, continuing to benefit from the expansion of our third-party distribution partnership.","Brand awareness continues to reach new highs at 56% for unaided awareness compared to 53% last year and 92% for aided awareness compared to 90% a year ago, reflecting the ongoing success of our possibilities of beautiful campaign, and more broadly our strategies to make a more emotional connection with our guests.","We're making good progress driving awareness across age groups and ethnicities. And we're maintaining a position of strength relative to competition. Our marketing activities during the quarter focused on our spring trend promotion, our signature 21 Days of Beauty event, the launch of our exclusive Tarte Sugar Rush brand which is targeted to Gen Z beauty enthusiasts, and Mother's Day.","This year we enhanced our Mother's Day efforts with the launch of a new in-store program in partnership with Save the Children. We invited our guests donate to the Ulta Beauty Charitable Foundation at point of sale in support of Save the Children's early childhood programming and disaster relief efforts in the US, raising more than $1.1 million. We continue to advance our brand purpose with our Girls United partnership with ESSENCE, supporting and empowering young black women through mentorship.","Moving on to the strategic imperative to delight our guests with a merchandise assortment where innovation, differentiation, exclusivity, relevancy, and speed to market are key. Our merchant team is focused on curating a highly differentiated set of offerings across all categories. We continue to gain share across all major categories in both mass and prestige, with Ulta Beauty again driving all the growth in the prestige beauty industry year to date based on NPD data.","We're very pleased with the performance of fragrance, mass cosmetics, prestige iconic brands, prestige skincare, pro hair, sun care, and PCA. However, prestige cosmetics is still quite a bit softer than the rest of the portfolio, with spring newness generally underperforming our expectations. However, late in the quarter, we set several promising new collections, including highly anticipated launches such as Urban Decay\u2019s Game of Thrones collection, a Disney Aladdin limited edition collection by MAC, a line of Nars limited edition blushes and lip products, and Tarte\u2019s Big Ego Mascara.","Also, we\u2019re encouraged by the pipeline we see for the rest of the year. Kylie Cosmetics continues to drive traffic and incremental sales with new products, including eyeshadow palettes and the [indiscernible] palette. We plan to add blushes, highlighters, bronzer, and a birthday palette which will be flown to stores in a few weeks. In April, we launched Ooma beauty, a new makeup line inspired by African beauty, which is exclusive to us. Alma is an innovative bold product line with a focus on diversity and unity and offers vivid color and inclusive shades for all women. The centerpiece of the brand is a line of foundations with six custom formulas, including skincare benefits offered in many shades.","We continue to roll out Clinique, Lancome, Benefit, and MAC in additional stores, adding a total of 50 new doors during the quarter. Performance was strong across the board with mass leading the pack. We plan to add several hundred expressions of these four brands this year in various formats, including boutiques, gondola runs, and wall presentations. The majority of the rollouts throughout the remainder of the year will be in presentations without dedicated payroll. Mass cosmetics continue to perform very well following a significant reset earlier in the year. This brief low further differentiated our mass cosmetics assortment, with additional space dedicated to exclusive or limited distribution brands that are preferred by younger consumers including Morphe, Revolution Beauty, BH Cosmetics, e.l.f., and ColourPop.","We plan to continue to invest in fixture and labored to execute more frequent reflows to keep our vibrant unique assortment fresh and compelling for our guests. Prestige skincare delivered double-digit comps helped by the success of our new and loved curated assortment highlighting guests favorite brands. Heels has a dozen of their top sellers in all Ulta Beauty doors in this section and the brand will be in more than 100 doors with a broader assortment by year end.","We're bringing a focus on wellness to the forefront in our prestige skincare assortment with clean ingredient brands like Tula, Kopari, Little Barn Apothecary, Trilogy, and the Better Skin Company. While new brands were the key driver of our performance in skincare, we also drove impressive growth in a legacy brand like Philosophy by running a special event which highlighted the brand and our services business.","Fragrance, despite tough comparisons from last year, was the best performing major category during the quarter, delivering a high teens comp and significant market share gains. New fragrances from Ariana Grande and Versace led the growth in this category. Haircare delivered strong high single digit comp growth, aided by reflow that improved the assortment and shopping experience for color and texture. These categories significantly improved their comp trends following the reflow.","Smaller categories were also very robust with accessories and sun care delivering double-digit comps. Personal Care appliances were bolstered by strong demand for Dyson hair dryers, and the Revlon One-Step Volumizer hair dryer. In the bath category, we are responding to consumers growing interest in wellness and clean beauty and are launching a new wellness assortment of 350 stores. This will expand to 700 doors later this year and features eight brands. Many of the 80 items in the assortment are exclusive to Ulta Beauty, including the Ulta Beauty essential oils collection.","Our emerging brands team launched eight brands in the first quarter across multiple categories, including clinical skincare with CBD, Black Moon Cosmetics, DHC skincare that brings together Japanese innovation and botanical ingredients, Grande Cosmetics, Sara Happ lip products, Nurse Jamie skincare products and tools and Erborian skincare that combines sophisticated Korean technologies with high quality ingredients derived from herbs found in traditional Korean medicine. More than 20 additional brands are planned to launch in the second quarter, including many online only brands.","So, next, an update on our services business. Our services team drove strong performance across all major categories; color, cotton style, blowouts, and skin treatments. After launching the ability to redeem loyalty points on services, we saw a meaningful increase in loyalty members using the salon for the first time, as well as an increase in overall asked as members using the salon. We also drove new guests acquisition through events like our Galentine's day promotion offering $30 blowouts when guests book with a friend and receive the gift with service.","We are now rolling out our services optimization program to the full chain. As a reminder, the components of the program are compensation designed to attract and retain top talent, industry leading internal training and education, simplified menus, transparent pricing, and an updated skill team focused on business and technical training in each district. We train district managers and general managers on the new programs during the spring and in-market training is taking place across the country, with all regions planned to be rolled out by the end of June.","We're seeing significant improvement in stylist retention in regions that were converted to the new program last year. And this is an important metric since tenure of our salon associates has the highest correlation to our best performing salon. The program is also driving a significant increase in product sales in the high margin professional haircare category. Ulta Beauty\u2019s pro and design teams had a big presence at America's beauty show in Chicago, hosting demos during this key industry event, which welcomed over 65,000 salon service professionals.","Hundreds of attendees were excited to submit applications onsite to join the Ulta Beauty salon team. Through events like this one, we continue to focus on hiring and retaining great talent and elevating Ulta Beauty\u2019s profile in the salon industry.","And now turning to store growth. We opened 22 new stores in the first quarter compared to 34 net new stores last year. Ending the quarter with 1,196 stores. New store productivity remains very strong with first year sales trending ahead of plan as well as IRR sales hurdles. We're on track to open 80 stores this year, the majority in suburban strip centers and power centers.","And now I'd like to share some exciting news about our growth plan. While we have years of attractive domestic growth ahead of us, we've been evaluating the potential for growth beyond US borders for some time. Today, we're announcing our decision to expand internationally and establish Ulta Beauty as a global brand. With our first market entry in Canada. International expansion represents an attractive and incremental long-term growth platform, which extends our core capabilities and leverages our value proposition. Over the past few years, we've extensively studied the market opportunity in multiple countries and evaluated various operational model. We believe that the Ulta Beauty value proposition is very relevant and differentiated in multiple geographies around the globe.","And Canada is an attractive and logical place to start. We're planning to launch stores and e- commerce in Canada. But we won't be sharing a lot of details yet for competitive reasons. We can say that we're planning to start small but are prepared to scale quickly as we learn and see success. The startup investment to support the Canada launch is expected to put modest pressure on the P&L this year, but we still expect to deliver financial results within our guidance range. Our Canadian business is not expected to be material to sales or income for the next few years, as we thoughtfully build a foundation to become a global beauty retailer over the long term.","Now, moving on to an update on our progress in our digital experience and innovation. We continue to invest in omnichannel capabilities to enhance the guest experience and support our buy anywhere fill anywhere strategy. Our save the sale program called store to door where store associates assist guests with ordering products online when they aren't available in store is performing well. It's improving guest satisfaction particularly as we expand our assortment of emerging and digitally native brands that are frequently offered in limited doors.","Store to door demand increased about 20% versus last year during the first quarter. We're also seeing growth in awareness and usage of buy online pick up in store, currently operating in 47 stores. We redesigned the find in store functionality on our website to support the upcoming full chain rollout of buy online pick up in store to improve and simplify the guest experience. We've also rolled out enhancements to the mobile app including an improved order history view to make reordering or replenishing more efficient and improve usability of our Glam Lab, live try-on function driven by our recently acquired Glam Street subsidiary. We're launching live try-on for Android next month after launching the iPhone version back in January.","Augmented reality innovation includes testing in in-store Ulta digital stylists in six pilot stores. This tool intended for associates in the salon or brow bars to show possibilities to guests in the store offers virtual try-on for hair color, makeup, and eyebrow shaping. From an AI innovation perspective, we launched the skincare virtual beauty advisor on ulta.com enabling guests to explore skincare assortment by concern or by product. The virtual beauty advisor asks a series of dynamically generated questions and presents a set a personalized recommendations that can be further reviewed and then purchased. This user-friendly interactive experience is another great example of how last year\u2019s strategic acquisitions are adding value.","Our e-commerce team recently partnered with Guest Services and IT to deliver our first production chatbot experience on our customer conversation platform. These initial experiences automate our communication with guests in response to frequently asked questions about loyalty points or birthday emails.","And lastly, I'll recap our supply chain performance. We delivered excellent in-stock levels in the first quarter with a rapid recovery following better than expected Q4 sales and post holiday out of stocks. With good control of overall inventory levels, inventory turns improved, it came in ahead of our goal. Our transportation team continues to focus on service level enhancements and costs and improved on-time store delivery by about 40 basis points in the first quarter.","We're also collaborating closely with our brand partners to measure and improve performance and compliance with our supply chain requirements. Since implementing the program in the fall of last year, we've seen a 200 basis point improvement in fill rate. As part of our omni channel strategy, buy online, pick up in store will be deployed chain wide this summer and will begin testing ship from store capabilities in five stores this fall.","Our Fresno distribution center continues to ramp up and is now serving 245 stores and facilitating 22% of e-commerce orders. The conversion of our Romeoville distribution center into an e-commerce fast fulfillment center is underway and on track to open this summer. The second FFC is planned to open in the summer of 2020 in Jacksonville, Florida. FFC serve e-commerce orders only and are designed to fill up to 30,000 orders per day during peak time. These facilities are part of the infrastructure plan we're executing to attain our goal of two-day ecommerce shipping by 2021.","Now before I turn over to Scott, I want to share with you that this will be Laurel\u2019s last earnings call and she's decided to retire after seven years at Ulta Beauty and a long and successful career in Investor Relations. She's been a value partner and resource to me, our leadership team and our board of directors and we're grateful for her many contributions to the company. So while we're very sad to say farewell to Laurel, we are delighted to welcome Kiley Rawlins who's joined us to succeed Laurel and lead our Investor Relations function.","Many of you already know Kiley who has more than 25 years of experience building and leading investor relations for retail fortune 500 companies. She has served in Investor Relations and Communications leadership positions at Michael, Family Dollar Stores and Dollar General, demonstrating her ability to proactively manage Investor Relation programs and engage with internal and external stakeholders to serve as an effective spokesperson to the investment community.","Kiley holds a Bachelor Degree in Commerce from the University of Virginia and is a CFA. You can anticipate a seamless transition of Kylie joins Patrick Flaherty, our Senior Manager of Investor Relations to support our mission to provide high quality service to analysts and shareholders. I know you'll be joining me in congratulating Laurel on her well deserved retirement and in welcoming Kiley to the Ulta Beauty team.","And with that, I'll turn over to Scott to discuss in more detail the drivers of our first quarter financials and the outlook for the rest of the year.","Scott Settersten","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Starting with the income statement, our top line growth of 12.9% was driven by a 7% comp and strong new store productivity. Traffic was healthy with transaction growth of 4.3% and ticket growth of 2.7%. While we are no longer breaking out e-commerce growth specifically, I can share that ulta.com growth was in line with our expectations of 20% to 30% growth, driven by traffic.","The retail comp was balanced between transaction and ticket growth. On the gross profit line, margin of 37% improved 70 basis points year-over-year from 36.3%, driven by strong merchandise margin and leverage of rent and occupancy expense, offset by investments in supply chain and our services business. Merchandise margin benefited from early gains from our efficiencies for growth program. SG&A rate of 23.1% de-leveraged by 70 basis points compared to the prior year\u2019s rate of 22.4%, reflecting planned de-leverage in corporate overhead related to investments and growth initiatives, including store labor, offset by leveraging marketing and variable store expenses.","Operating margin was flat year-over-year at 13.6% of sales. Diluted GAAP earnings per share of $3.26 grew 20.7% compared to $2.70 reported for last year's first quarter. Adjusted for the $0.18 of benefit from a lower tax rate associated with equity compensation accounting, the underlying earnings per share of $3.08 were up 14%. EPS rose 17% on a like-for-like basis, adjusting for the tax rate benefit in both years, which includes a $0.07 benefit in Q1 of 2018.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, total inventory grew 10% and was up 1.8% on a per store basis, well below comparable sales, as we continue to gain efficiencies from improved systems and processes. Capital expenditures were $69 million for the quarter, driven by our new store opening program, supply chain systems and merchandise fixtures.","I'd like to touch on a new lease accounting standard and how it impacts Ulta Beauty\u2019s financial statements. We adopted a new accounting standard on February 3, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in the recording of operating lease assets of $1.46 billion and lease liabilities of $1.84 billion as of the beginning of the year. There is no impact on our income statement or cash flows. Our Form 10-Q, which was filed this afternoon, includes comprehensive disclosures related to our adoption of the new lease accounting.","We ended the quarter with $521.8 million in cash and short term investments. We repurchased 318,000 shares at a cost of $107.4 million through our 10B51 program. $788.2 million remained available on our $875 million authorization as of quarter end. We continue to expect to repurchase approximately $700 million of shares in fiscal 2019. But as always have the flexibility to modify the cadence of repurchases in response to market conditions.","Turning now to guidance, we are maintaining our previous view for the remainder of the year and are flowing through the $0.18 of earnings per share benefit related to the lower tax rate in the first quarter. We are on track to open approximately 80 new stores, all our traditional 10,000 square foot prototype. We plan to remodel 12 stores and relocate eight stores and execute 270 store refreshes or many remodels to enable the addition of new brands and improvements to overall fix stream.","We anticipate driving top line growth in the low double digits with total company comparable sales planned in the 6% to 7% range. We expect e-commerce to grow in the 20% to 30% range, contributing approximately 200 basis points to comparable sales. We expect to deliver earnings per share in the range of $12.83 to $13.03, with approximately 10 to 20 basis points of operating margin expansion. We expect to improve gross profit rate driven by merchandise margin expansion, rent and occupancy expense leverage and the benefits of our credit card program.","These benefits will be offset by de-leverage in SG&A due to store labor and investments in growth initiatives and innovation. Areas such as digital innovation, our salon services strategy, expanding our omni-channel capabilities, IT security and infrastructure, personalization efforts, our strategy to pursue emerging brands and initiatives to enhance the guest experience and now our investments ahead of launching operations in Canada are the factors driving corporate overhead de-leverage.","We reiterate our previous comments on the cadence of earnings per share throughout the year, excluding the tax rate benefits from the first quarter with EPS growth slightly weighted to the back half with more of the benefits of our efficiency for growth cost optimization program occurring later in the year. Excluding the Q1 tax rate benefits, we expect low teens EPS growth and modest operating margin de-leverage in the first half of the year and high teens EPS growth and modest operating margin leverage in the second half of the year.","We plan to spend between $380 million and $400 million in CapEx. This includes CapEx of approximately $190 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $140 million for supply chain and IT, including new fest fulfillment centers, and about $60 million for store maintenance and other. Depreciation and amortization expense is planned to be approximately $315 million. We expect our tax rate for the remainder of the year to be 24%, which does not include any estimate for the impact of share based compensation. The fully diluted share count for the year is expected to be approximately 58 million.","Our plan assumed share repurchases in 2019 in the $700 million range, contributing about four points of earnings per share growth. And with that, I'll turn it over to our conference call host for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh","So first, congrats to Laurel on your retirement and also welcome Kiley. So I guess one of the questions I had is just going back to Mary your comments on the mixed prestige cosmetics backdrop. So it seems like we've continued to have challenges in some of those larger established cosmetic brands. So I just want to get a sense of what you think is actually weighing on those brands and any sense in terms of how long this can continue?","Mary Dillon","Well, it's, I mean, the good news is with our model that we offer a lot of different brands and categories, et cetera. So, we have discussed this before, prestige cosmetics category has struggled in \u201818. And some of the brands continue to struggle in terms of comping over some strong growth in previous years. We continue to gain share in all the track channels, which is great. We also, not all the data that you see is measured, or the marketplace is not all captured and tracking reports. So there is a lot of growth happening from digitally native brands. And we're obviously participating in that well.","So we continue to see the category is healthy overall, we're going to continue to add new brands and work with our brand partners to continue to drive innovation pipelines, and balance, I guess, the risk of that with the other great newness that we bring into the pot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen","Thank you very much and Laurel, best regards. We're going to miss you a lot. Regarding the Canada opportunity, which sounds really promising, what are your thoughts on the size of the box and also, as you think about the assortment architecture, and pricing, just considerations there? And if you could brief us on why it makes sense now and how you're competitive that may or may not be different.","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Oliver. As you can imagine, I'm going to stay very high level on this in terms of we're not one, we don't want to disclose a lot to folks about what we're doing exactly. Okay. But we do -- we're very excited about the opportunity. I mean, we've got years of domestic growth ahead. But we do see this as a next step in our long term growth journey. I would say, we've done a lot of diligence in the last couple of years, understanding consumer categories, competitive dynamics, just like you're asking, not just in Canada, but in other key geographies. Studying success and failure precedents and learning.","And bottom line is that we do believe white space opportunities exists for the Ulta Beauty proposition and because it's differentiated, right, in terms of experiences in store and online, breadth and depth of offerings in what is an important and growing category. So it's incremental growth for us, I guess that's your question. I would think about it more leveraging our core competencies, but also being open to some modifications and local adaptations is needed. So how that plays out relative to offerings, you can imagine that, our real estate model, but overall, we plan to stay true to the Ulta Beauty business model. We know it's working. And what we have studied and believe is the opportunity is something that's pretty close to that.","Oliver Chen","Okay, thanks, Mary. And just related to that, as a quick follow up, how will the consumer awareness build in Canada, and your thoughts in terms of like, how the awareness is in that market now versus your leverage, the marketing programs to build your unaided awareness in the market?","Mary Dillon","Yeah, lots more details to come. But you can imagine, I think that's, we feel good about our ability to create the Ulta Beauty brand. And that's obviously behind our list of important priorities from the start. So it's all I say now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. And I will bid Laurel, farewell. We will miss you. Congratulations on the retirement. I guess my question. Two questions actually, really real quick for Scott. Scott, I don't mean to nitpick, but I'm going to have to do it anyway. I think you said in the first half, the EPS ex the tax benefit low teens, I think that would imply like a low double digit EPS growth for Q2. I'm kind of making sure we're thinking about that the right way?","Scott Settersten","No, you got the message that that was the signal we intended to send for folks without being too literal about things. There's still a fair amount of investment that's embedded. I guess, I would just back up and say that the gross margin leverage you saw in the first quarter, I think directionally is what you can -- how you can think about it for the rest of the year. But there is a fair amount of investment that\u2019s in the plan. All the things we started last year around innovation and personalization that we accelerated last year, we won't start lapping that to the back half of 2019. And then we have some incremental things that we've kicked off this year, most notably the Canada thing that we just announced here recently. So there is a fair amount of corporate overhead, de-leverage that's coming in the second and third quarter.","Ike Boruchow","Got it. And then just a quick follow up for Mary, just on the Prestige business, I understand the softness kind of persists and sounds like you're confident in the pipeline. I just feel like we've heard confidence in the pipeline for a while and the business has been great. But that prestige business hasn't really -- doesn't seem like it's really picked up any real momentum. Do you have visibility in that category for yourself? Or is this just kind of your best guess at the moment, just trying to understand what kind of visibility you have?","Mary Dillon","Yeah, I'll make a couple of comments. I\u2019ll ask Dave to add more to this because he obviously is quite expert in this arena as well. But I would say this is not a factor for all brands and Prestige, right. So it's really like a few large Prestige brands that are having a tough time comping over some amazing growth they've had for a couple of years. We have many Prestige brands that are doing quite well. So, we do our best level best to be as direct and transparent as we can about how we feel about the pipeline. But of course, it's in partnership with our brand partners. And like I said, the fact that we have an array of choices that we can make in the marketplace work to our advantage, given our box.","So Dave, anything else you want to add on the proceeds?","Dave Kimbell","I'll just say as we look at the total Prestige makeup business, many of the things that Mary had talked about are critical to us compensating for some continued struggles that the bigger brands that have been in our store for a while are going through. So, continuing to focus on digitally native brands, and driving exclusivity with both new brands and existing brands such as double duty beauty, and too faced with tutti frutti and other elements like that. On the existing brands, yeah, they are going through many of them, as Mary said, not all of them, but many of them and including some of the biggest brands that had been driving growth over some time are continuing to struggle, there's a transformation in the makeup business right now. The category remains healthy.","But there's a shift in consumer preference on brands. What we know about these brands, though, is the equities in all of our studies and understanding remain strong and healthy. We're confident in the teams that are driving these businesses, they're focused on driving innovation and adjusting to evolving market conditions. We do have visibility to their innovation throughout the rest of this year and even into the first part of next year. And then we see some positive things but time will tell on some of these. So we're not, as we look forward in our business, we're not anticipating these -- some of the big brands that have been a drain, turning around immediately. But we're confident over time that these brands will regain their footing and get back to growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JP Morgan.","Christopher Horvers","Laurel, it\u2019s been such a pleasure working with you all these years, going back to your time in Framingham, and certainly a top notch job the whole time and best of luck in the next phase of your career. Kiley welcome. Clearly, some similarities to Laurel as well, given both of you made a great trade, a timely transition in your career and coming to Ulta. So\u2026","Mary Dillon","Oh, I love it. I wish you could see their faces. Good and thank you.","Christopher Horvers","I'm sure you've talked about that. So, can you talk about a couple of questions. I'll put it all in one. Can you remind us what caused the deceleration in last year's second quarter comp relative to the first? And then in the gross margin, how did that come in relative your internal plan, was the investment expense versus the merch margins? How does that shake out? And then the last one, of course, tariff, what are your comments there? Thank you.","Scott Settersten","And I can kick -- take a swing at last year\u2019s second quarter. It's just a -- it's part of the cycle of the business, I would say. Second quarter has just been a little bit tougher for us the last few years, the 21 days of beauty phenomena, I guess is probably what's driving first quarter and then we do it again in the fall. And that's really a great event for us that drives healthy business and a lot -- in a variety of ways. So it's probably really just the impact of that.","And as far as margins and business overall results versus the forecast, we're very happy with gross margin leverage that we had in the first quarter. I mean, I would say, we're right on target, coming through the first quarter, we had a similar conversation with the board earlier this week, we're right on plan, kind of right where we thought we would be, the leverage on the gross margin line is where we thought we would be and then the investment cycle here. So again, heavier maybe than what some of you were modeling or expecting, but kind of right in line where we thought we'd be at this point in the year.","Mary Dillon","And I'll add lastly on the tariff question, so -- and we've said this before, we're certainly less exposed than other retailers, most cosmetics, fragrance hair care liquids from North America and Europe, but we have some Ulta Beauty collection, some things that are made in China but we're, it's small, we're managing it through supplier relations and pricing if needed. So we consider that a pretty small impact for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, guys. This is [indiscernible] on for Simeon. We want to ask about D&A. It looks like guidance of 315 million was reiterated. But the Q1 run rate is a little bit lighter than that, is there anything around timing there?","Scott Settersten","Yeah, I would attribute that primarily to the investment notion that we've been talking about, Canada kind of plays heavily into that. So, there's a lot of things coming around system, upgrades and things like that and a lot of that is expense related. And I'm not sure if you're familiar with the way some of the new pricing is working with SaaS solutions and things like that. So it's more of an immediate hit and there's more of that back half weighted.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. So back half weighted D&A.","Scott Settersten","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","Great, thanks. Good afternoon and congrats to Laurel on your retirement. It's very well deserved. Look forward to working with Kiley as well. I guess my question is either for Mary or Dave, you guys have brought in a lot of newness over the last year. And I think, last quarter, you talked about driving 400 basis points of contribution to the comp, could you just share with us what the benefit was in Q1? And then Mary, you talked about a lot of initiatives within wellness in particular, I'd love to just hear you talk about what the opportunity is in that category, as you start to really play that out in the future. Thanks.","Mary Dillon","Probably we will tag team. I\u2019ll take the newness one and then I'll give Dave the other question, which is great. I would just say, yeah, newness is really obviously, continues to be really important to our business and to our guests. In this quarter, we saw strong contribution from some categories like prestige skincare, mass cosmetics or refill I talked about, those are the exclusives, we saw strong contributions there, I'd say, somewhat less on prestige cosmetics, there's some tough comps versus year ago on some of that. So overall, I'd say not as significant in terms -- relative to Q4, where we had some pretty high profile launches. But still obviously a very important key strategy and we continue to feel good about the continued cadence of newness that\u2019s coming.","Dave Kimbell","And on wellness, the broader idea of wellness or clean, we're seeing the positive effect of that really across the entire store. Most categories are benefiting from a elevated engagement from consumers, elevated awareness. So we're seeing brands, organic, natural, gluten free, vegan and cruelty free, ethically traded all across the board, a number of brands that either have had those attributes for a long time, or are newly created brands that are focused on clean or natural wellness beauty are driving a lot of growth.","And some of the brands that we see benefiting from that, Tarte certainly has been a leader in that they've launched new brands, much of which are new sub lines, many of which are exclusive to Ulta, that's been driving a growth for minerals, Origins, Juice Beauty, Peter Thomas Roth, and a number of new brands we launched an in cap in a few hundred doors in Q1, a vegan impact -- in cap that featured a number of brands that are 100% vegan, 100% cruelty free. And we plan to expand that to more doors throughout the year based on the success.","We have a wellness section in the bath category, that's in about 350 doors, and we\u2019ll plan to roll out to more doors throughout the year, Mary highlighted some of the brands that are part of that. And in our broader communication to our guests through all vehicles, or magazines or social media digital efforts, our app highlighting wellness and clean brands and some of the efforts that we're bringing into that space and it's been received very well. So, definitely a strong trend across all categories and one that we see driving growth for some time to come.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS.","Michael Goldsmith","Congratulations, Laurel. The new productivity, as we calculated, it looks like it was a bit lower than what we were accustomed to. First, is that right? And if so, was there anything unique from a timing perspective for the markets that you entered during the quarter? And should we think about this in the 70% range going forward instead of maybe the 80% we've seen in the past couple of years?","Scott Settersten","Yeah, I don't know that we could say anything specific on the 70% to 80% range modification, but we didn't really see anything in new store productivity. I mean, it may be a function of a fewer less stores right open in the first quarter of this year. I think it was 22, versus 34 last year. We looked at the comp waterfall, we look at historical basis of the whole fleet every quarter in detail, something we keep a close eye on, we didn't really see anything, any material changes overall in the business. New stores, I think Mary pointed out in her remarks, were happy with productivity there and how they've come out of the gate so far this year. And so we're still very confident in our 1500 to 1700 range in new stores in the US over the long term.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research.","Adrienne Yih","Nice quarter and Congrats, Laurel. My first question is for Mary, can you talk about the promo environment? It seems to have abated somewhat, and we haven't seen a lot of these sort of vendor based promos. So what's the opportunity as the year goes on, to continue to pull back on those promos?","And then Scott, housekeeping question on the legacy distribution center that's going offline? Can you remind us which quarter that occurs? And if there's any notable margin impact from that, thank you very much.","Mary Dillon","Sure, I'll start with the promotional question, Adrienne. I would say that certainly the beauty market remains competitive and offering a strong value proposition is always going to be important for us. So we haven't seen, I guess, I'd say material increases in competitive promotions. But it's as intense as ever, I guess I'd say. And it's evolving, we're going to continue to evolve. Our promotion level for the quarter was pretty consistent year-over-year. So obviously, we always look for opportunities to sort of optimize how we think about using promotional levers.","And that's not going to change. So, we prioritize our loyalty and our CRM platform and getting more and more able to be more personalized the offers, obviously, that's a kind of a Holy Grail. We continue to test and learn behind the scenes, there's a lot happening that is hard to track, but testing different circs and values and reminders and durations, all those within the spirit of optimizing return on that investment. So, I think we've got the right track, the tools to drive traffic and sales and deploy them in a balanced way and will continue to, as we do all the time, keep a very close eye on the competitive environment as well.","Scott Settersten","And then specifically on the question, so that was our Phoenix DC and that's behind us now. That was completed early part of the first quarter of 2019. And it just gives you a little color so we're not quite lapping Fresno opened last year, right, so there's a moderate de-leverage in the first quarter for Fresno that kind of moderates here once we lap that in the second quarter and so second and third quarter pretty, pretty flat. I guess I would say overall in supply chain and in fourth quarter a bit of de-leverage with -- as we stand up the FFC for Romeoville here and then our deeper into the planning stages for Jacksonville, which is coming early part of next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities.","Steve Forbes","I want to do a focus on the refresh program. So maybe if you can, just how many of you complete in the first quarter? And then bigger picture, can you sort of give us some color and expand on what expressions maybe you're most excited about, right, as you head into the back half of the year here, given some of the commentary about prestige cosmetic trends and just the industry in general?","Scott Settersten","Yes, so I can start on that one. So the refresh, I think they'll go on throughout the course of the year, it's really just kind of getting off the mark in the first quarter, Steve. So, percentage wise, I'd say somewhere in the 10%, 20% range of the total 270. And we have plans for the year, was completed the early part of the year. So the best is yet to come, so to speak on impacts from that. And then overall, the assortment in the store. So again, it's more of those, I guess we call them growth brands in the script today, but have historically referred to them as the iconic brands, right. So again, those will go in stores, those will be the biggest newness as part of the refresh program. And again, those will go in a variety of presentations right, not, the historical square footage allocation that you're familiar with, but in a number of end caps, in line runs and things like that across those 270 stores.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies.","Steph Wissink","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. And thanks a lot Laurel for all your help over the years. This question is actually for Dave. Just curious, Dave, as you look at your CRM and maybe some of the business analytics or insights that you're able to glean from that, with respect to the decline in prestige cosmetics, are you finding that some of your core customers in that category may be navigating over into prestige skincare and pairing it with some of the initiatives you've had in mass cosmetics, is there a bullet share kind of shifting across the store?","Dave Kimbell","I will answer them in a few ways. One, we are definitely seeing strong growth across skincare, our mass cosmetics business is healthy, and even with, though but even with the struggles that we've had on some of the brands in prestige cosmetics, we're still growing in prestige cosmetics. That business is still positive, comping even though some big brands have been a challenge for us. So we're still attracting new consumers in that, in some cases through big existing brands that we've launched, exclusive lines, such as in too face, new brands that are coming in, attracting new guests, brands like Beauty Bakery, Kylie, and others. So we're definitely still seeing a healthy consumer engagement in Prestige.","It just isn't growing at the level that we've had seen in the past and that we think it can grow in the future. But having said that, there's a -- we're really pleased with the overall consumer engagements. One of our best opportunity is to continue to gain wallet share to gain spend per member is to get our guests to shop in multiple categories across the store. It's a big focus for us. And you mentioned our analytics and CRM capabilities, as we advance our personalization and AI efforts, a big focus for us will be to help our guests migrate into different categories, still keep them engaged in safer stage cosmetics, but if they're not shopping in skin, or in hair or in bath or fragrance to help them see other parts of the store. That has been working, we're having a lot of success with that. And that'll be a focus for us going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with Nomura Instinet.","Simeon Siegel","Hey, guys, good afternoon and congrats Laurel. Wish you only the best in the next chapter and welcome Kiley, Mary or Dave as the gift cards and Kylie grow, are you seeing any notable shopping differences in the customers that are brought in from them versus the others? And then can you talk to your expectations for the trajectory of just channel and product mix from here with kind of thought underlying impacts to gross margin with those shifts?","Dave Kimbell","On Kylie, as we discussed, I think, last quarter with the launch work, we're again, really pleased with that partnership. Kylie and her team have just been great partners with us from the moment we launched it, and we did see early on and it is sustained of strong engagement from our existing guests, but also new guests coming in and particular, younger guests and more diverse guests. And so we're really pleased with that. And we would anticipate that continuing.","As we've seen with other new digitally native brands across the store, it's helping us attract new guests and contributing to the new guest growth that we've experienced in Q1. So we'll drive \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to drive that part of the business and we see that success coming.","On the margin, please, Scott.","Scott Settersten","Yeah. So, a lot of the headwinds or crosswinds that we talked about with channel in category and brand mixes, I mean, those are in the first quarter. We've talked about that historically, that we expect those, we anticipated that, and that we were still planning through and again, EFG this quarter, to be able to mitigate much of that, and just running our business smarter. So that's what you see in the gross profit leverage in the first quarter. And we feel good about where we are and plan to see more of that as we move into the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse.","Michael Binetti","Let me add my congrats to Laurel and welcome Kiley and congrats on the nice quarter. I just wanted to ask you one nitpicky question as well. On the gross margins, I think when we talked last quarter, you were thinking first quarter would be the weakest gross margin quarter of the year. It came in above how we were thinking this quarter. It sounded like though in your earlier comments that it was closer to actually being in line with your plan. So I'm wondering if you sounded directionally, like you didn't think it was going to be above that the rest of year. I'm just wondering if anything has changed on rest of your outlook for gross margin to flag it all.","Scott Settersten","Yeah, so I guess we\u2019d kind of walk in a bit of a tightrope here, we\u2019ll try not to get too specific on guidance by quarter right for the rest of the year, we're trying to move away from that a little bit. I would say, we got better traction on the reflow. So again, we're pointing to EFG and being smarter about the reflows that we rolled out here in the first quarter, they just, they took off faster, right, than maybe we would have anticipated. So that's great news. And again, directionally as you're thinking about the rest of the year, I mean, gross margin leverage directionally should be consistent with what you saw in the first quarter. And actually, we might get a little, a bit stronger in the second half of the year, as more of the EFG initiatives are scaled up across the business.","Michael Binetti","Okay, let me back up and just ask a bigger picture. Mary, you made some comments, it sounds like maybe there's a bit of a pivot in the prestige boutiques format to some formats without a dedicated payroll, anything you would want to call out there, is that, I don't know if that's just something to be able to push these further into some of the lower volume stores that?","Mary Dillon","So we talked about this last quarter as well. So it's an evolution, I guess, is the way I think about, as there are brands that have a service component, like Benefit Brow, and makeup artistry will continue to have dedicated labor most stores, other brands, Clinique and Lancome is rolling them into all of our stores with various expressions that makes sense to the store from -- could be a full boutique as we know it today with labor, it could be a gondola run, a wall presentation. So we're working with our brand partners to really optimize the best way to do that for both us and for them.","Michael Binetti","Okay, let me \u2013 if I can sneak one more and you've seen with Canada, I know, we are -- just not good in that. A couple of US retailers have gone up to Canada. And I think the results have been fairly mixed. But, one thing that's been a tougher thing to figure out is, how much they can lean on US infrastructure versus building discrete assets to service Canada. I know, you don't want to get into the competitive aspects here. But on the back end, do you think there's an opportunity to leverage your US assets? Or do you need to put discrete assets in Canada, and maybe any of the case studies that you've looked at, as you think about that market and obvious similarities that you can emulate or some clear misses from strategies you've seen from these closures?","Mary Dillon","Yeah. And today is not the day I'm going to get into details on this. But I can assure you that we have studied this intensely for a long period of time deeply. And that includes case studies around success and failure. So I think we're fully aware and trying to take into consideration everything that we know and have heard and take it, like I said in the script, sort of start small but be prepared to scale aggressively if we see success. So I appreciate the comment. Understand that fully, all those things are things we'll talk more about as we get further down the pike.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird.","Mark Altschwager","Thank you and congratulations, Laurel. Scott, I was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on the progress with efficiency initiatives, I guess, what are the primary areas where you're seeing savings this year. Any updated thoughts on how you see those savings building over the planning horizon? And of the bigger buckets you outlined at the Analyst Day, I think from CPI and direct procurement and others, just any big themes that are emerging this year as you've been ramping up those initiatives? Thank you.","Scott Settersten","Yeah, no, I mean, we're kind of right on track with where we thought we would be overall, again, kind of rolling back to Analyst Day and we talked about the various buckets, the major pieces being procurement and real estate and around our core merchandising, inventory management practices. So really, it's the core processes, again, probably not that the easiest, or the sexiest to talk about and describe to people. But what we saw in the first quarter. So again, EFG takes many forms and shapes as we think about it across the business. But in the first quarter, and one that we're really counting on is making smarter merchandising decisions.","So, it's executing, first of all, determining what brands, what the space allocation is, what the profit profiles are on those brand and making sure we're driving good economic outcomes for the business overall, making sure that it's balanced right with other challenges and opportunities we have across the assortment, and then executing that. So we call -- talk about transitions, making sure we got the teams ready, we got the right labor, we got the right products and marketing and all the other things that go along with that at the right place at the right time. And just making sure we\u2019re taking out as many inefficiencies out of that process as we can. So, I mean, that was the big driver in the first quarter. And all of that kind of activity is something that's a long term driver for the business, because we do a lot of this day in and day out in our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.","Mike Baker","Hi, Scott, maybe this gets too close to that quarterly guidance that we're trying to get away from? And if so, let me now, but should the same store sales follow that same trajectory of the earnings, i.e., a little bit less growth in the second quarter. And maybe a second way to ask that, as you said that the second quarter has been tough for you for the reasons that you outlined with the 21 days of beauty, is that sort of an expectation that we should think about for this year, second quarter as well.","Scott Settersten","That's fair observation overall. Again, we try to give you a little bit of color on the ins and the outs and the de-leverage points as we go through the year, maybe I can just give a little more color on that, right. So on the gross margin line, besides the great positive outcomes on merchandise margin, we also, last year, started doing some clearance activity, you'll remember that, it started late in the first quarter and ran pretty heavy through the second and third quarters.","And again, we're not expecting to repeat that this year. So that'll be helpful, fixed or cost leverage, I think was stronger in the first quarter this year than it was a year ago. And again, the store sequencing, right, the cadence this year is a little bit different. So just keep that in mind, as you're looking at the rest of the year. It's helpful in the first half of the year, less so in the back half of the year, as we put more stores in line in the third quarter this year. Salon is kind of a headwind all year, heavier in the first part of the year as we roll out services optimization, but then we expect to get traction, and we're going to drive sales and productivity in the stores in the second half.","And I think I already described supply chain and how we see that kind of playing out through the rest of the year. So again, I would just maybe clarify for folks, we're really happy with the gross margin leverage. But a lot of that's driven by investments in the SG&A line, right. So there's people, there's process, there is tools, there is D&A that goes along with that, to help drive productivity improvement in our stores. But again, over the long term, we expect that to pay for itself, right and that SG&A de-leverage will moderate over time.","Mike Baker","Makes sense. And my part here by saying congratulations also to Kiley and Laurel.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Good evening and congratulations on the results. Laurel, bravo. What a great career and wonderful success on your next chapter. I'm sure whatever it'll be, you'll be terrific at it. And Kiley, look forward to working with you and welcome to the Ulta team. Mary, Dave, and Scott, as you think about the opportunities on AR and AI, and what you're learning there, it seems like there's an increased emphasis on what it's doing to drive sales. What should we be looking at through the year? And how do you see that rolling out? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","I'll start at a high level. I'll open it up to Dave, if he wants to add more. But yeah, Dana, thank you. This is one of those things that I would say, it's not going to be like a flick of a switch, where all of a sudden, you'll be able to sort of feel this dramatic impact, it's going to build over time, I'm really excited that we have got a strong start. And that the acquisitions that we made last year, the team is integrated exceptionally well, with our team, digital innovation to drive our top line and other efficiencies will be a key theme really, for us, I guess, forever. I don't think that ever changes. So, I use a few examples in the script that are already live now. And I think a great example is our glam lab, which is live trial functionality, it works really well. And that's a big improvement to what it was before with a static photo, many examples. So, I guess we know, behind the scenes, we're constantly measuring, testing and measuring. And we're confident that this is going to continue to drive growth for us.","Is there any other color you want to add to this, Dave?","Dave Kimbell","I\u2019ll just add one more example of the type of impact that our advancements in this area can have on the business. And that's around our new member on boarding and we're actively testing and experimenting with different programs to take the millions of new guests that we've been acquiring every year, and making sure they stay engaged with us. We have a high retention rate to begin with, but we think it could be higher. So it's a good example by exploring a lot of different communication techniques, programs, offers to new guests, and then leveraging our AI capabilities. We're already seeing a positive response in doing that. And we think over time, it will take a little time, but we'll just get smarter and smarter and smarter through the capabilities that we have. So as Mary said, it will take time, but it's exciting frontier for us for sure.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mary Dillon for closing remarks.","Mary Dillon","I\u2019d just like to close by thanking all of the Ulta Beauty associates for a strong start to the year and delivering solid financial results and operational excellence across the enterprise, while everybody's been working very hard to also lay the foundation to realize our many future growth opportunities.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Laurel Lefebvre. Thank you, Laurel. You may begin.","Laurel Lefebvre","Thanks. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Ulta Beauty's fourth quarter 2014 conference call.","Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer, and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are Janet Taake, Chief Merchandising Officer, and Dave Kimbell, Chief Marketing Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's Safe Harbor language.

Good afternoon everyone. Ulta wrapped up a very strong year of sales and profit growth, actual performance in the fourth quarter. The whole Ulta team and I are very proud to celebrate this as our first $1 billion sales quarter.","To review the numbers, sales grew 20.7% and delivered an 11.1% total company comp on top of a 9.2% comp in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our best comp of the year was driven by our strongest traffic growth of the year. While average ticket also contributed nicely to the overall result.","The key drivers of our performance were continued strength in prestige and mass color cosmetics, a successful holiday selling season, execution of more effective marketing and CRM strategy, double-digit comps in our salon business, 55% comp sales growth in e-commerce. Earnings per share were up 24% to a $1.35 compared to a $1.09 last year. ","Scott will cover the details of our financial results for the fourth quarter as well as our guidance for fiscal 2015 and the current quarter in just a few moments. But first I would like to provide an update on our six strategic imperatives.","This is the long-term strategic framework we developed last year designed to deliver continued market share gains and strong sustainable sales and earnings growth. The first imperative is to acquire new guest and deepen loyalty with existing guests.","Our loyalty program and growing CRM capabilities continue to be highly effective tools to increase loyalty and grow our share of wallet with our members. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our ultimate rewards program had grown to reach 15 million active members. Having all of our guests at a single platform for all almost all of 2014 delivered significant benefits to us. ","Customer reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. Sales per loyalty member increased about 6% in 2014, driven by both higher purchase frequency and higher spend per transaction. We also saw healthy increase in member retention last year. And finally we were successful in targeting less engaged segments of our loyalty customer base with specific offers to engage those customers. ","While we are delighted to acquire millions of new loyalty members last year, we believe there are lot more beauty enthusiasts out there waiting to discover Ulta, so increasing brand awareness is a continued opportunity for us. ","We were encouraged by the results of our TV advertising tests in select markets last fall, where we saw comps increased versus the control group, as well as an increase in new member sign ups. Message testing demonstrated that our campaign was relevant and memorable.","We also launched a national holiday radio campaign which reached millions of prospective new guests and resulted in strong consumer recall. We also heightened our focus on earned media with outreach to long-lead publications and beauty bloggers to increase awareness of our holiday offering. ","As a result of these efforts, aided awareness of Ulta jumped up seven points year-over-year. Looking ahead, we expect to implement radio, TV and digital advertising campaigns in conjunction with various promotional events throughout the year.","We plan to fund these brand awareness building activities by reducing Sunday newspaper inserts and other print vehicles, as well as through our ongoing efforts to reduce our alliance on broad price discounting in favor of more targeted marketing activities. ","During the fourth quarter we experimented with CRM offers focused on acquiring new customers in our salon business. Fewer than 7% of our active loyalty members are salon customers which provides us a great opportunity to mine our loyalty customer base. ","In fact, we were able to acquire thousands of new salon customers by testing various offers and marketing channels with targeted customer segments. We believe our focus on new customer acquisition in conjunction with an elevated presentation of our salon business in direct mail pieces and then our website, contributed to be a significant increase in new salon guest count and an acceleration in our salon sales performance.","Our second strategic imperative is to differentiate by delivering a distinctive and personalized guest experience across all channels. Investments in in-store technology provide solutions that help our store associates to be even more effective.","We've tested and are rolling out to the entire chain a task management solution and an inventory management application, both delivered on mobile devices. These tools are designed to optimize productivity, and create efficiencies for our store associates which importantly will allow them to spend more time assisting our guests. ","We are also leveraging in-store technology to support a more personalized guest experience with our new client telling app which is currently being piloted in 30 stores. The app will replace the paper based consultation process and enable store associates to interact with guests on the floor in a number of ways that were previously only possible at point of sale.","Associates us the app to sign up guests for ultimate rewards, can review point balances and past purchases and create guest profiles with their preferences and interest in order to better recommend products.","We are also implementing the learnings from our recent payroll test-and-learn initiatives to enhance the guest experience. We continue to study the impact of adding additional labor hours to create more guest facing time in various types of stores and different areas of the store. And we are planning to implement additional hours in another 60 stores this year. We expect this additional labor expense to be self-funding to higher sales and conversion. ","The third strategic imperative is offering relevance, innovative and often exclusive products that excite our guest. While we continue to see great customer response to our recent launches like IT Cosmetics and our exclusive IT Brushes that were strong news in innovation throughout the Prestige Cosmetics assortment. ","During the fourth quarter we partnered with bareMinerals to ensure successful launch of their new product Complexion Rescue. Urban Decay, Benefit, Anastasia, Tar and Too Face were top performing brands featuring lots of newness such as Anastasia\u2019s blockbuster contouring palette and Urban Decay\u2019s limited edition Naked On The Run palette. Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me brands were also very strong.","Following on the success of our Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me boutiques we are continuing to partner with both of these great brands and are rolling out additional boutiques throughout 2015. We are also excited to expand a number of stores offering Clarins skincare products after launching in a small number of stores in online in the third quarter.","Another standout was the mass cosmetic category. Here we achieved growth well above the industry and delivered double digit comps. Brands like Nick and the overall lip category drove the performance. ","Now, we also had a strong holiday selling season were we increased focus on Ulta as a great gifting destination. The categories are personal care appliances, fragrance and bath all performed very well. In addition to a strong holiday product assortment and offers, we invested in customer facing payroll and inventory on a most popular items to enhance the guest experience. ","Another highlight of our holiday season was the significant lift in sales of Ulta gift cards. We created new designs, utilized more display locations and boosted the presence of gift cards in direct mail, emails, our website and social media. This focus drove strong sales performance and retentions contributed to our sales momentum post-holiday.","Professional Haircare also performed well in the quarter, driven by customer engagement with our semiannual leader event, featuring compelling prices on jumbo sizes of Professional Haircare products. ","In January following the success of our newly branded Happy Healthy Hair Starts at Ulta, we launched a new campaign for skin called Growing Gorgeous Skin Starts at Ulta. Our goal was to distinguish Ulta as a skincare authority by delivering a cohesive guest experience and programming 21 days of daily events, featuring new products from our top skincare brands, including new high-tech tools featured on skin rejuvenation.","Next, our four strategic imperative, delivering exceptional services in three core areas: hair, skin health, and brows. Our salon business grew 20.9% and comped 11% for the quarter, contributing 10 basis points to the retail comp. Our best categories were cut and color, blow outs, and makeup application services.","Our online appointment booking capability has been ramping nicely, since launching last summer. We booked 53,000 appointments online in the fourth quarter, and 75% of those were new salon guests.","We leverage our store-wide skin event in January to take advantage of the biggest month for skincare sales in the industry. We highlighted Dermalogica skin services with special offers and gifts with purchase. Our newest skin service, Dermalogica's power resurfacing peel, has exceeded expectations since it launched.","To update you are on our brow services offering, we finished the year with almost 600 Benefit Brow Boutiques. Nearly 400 stores are now also performing brow tinting services. These boutiques continued to perform extremely well with both products and services.","Turning to our fifth strategic imperative, growing stores and e-commerce to reach and serve more guests. Let's start with stores. We opened 10 stores during the quarter and closed one, ending the year with 774 stores, increasing total square footage by about 14% for the year. New store productivity remains very strong, and the class of 2014 stores candidly exceeded expectations.","We're very pleased with the two small stores we opened last fall, which are beating their sales plan and generating store level earnings higher than what we had modeled, to earn a strong return on investment.","We continue to evaluate performance and guest behavior to glean operational insight and to prepare for the scalability of this format. We expect to open more small store format stores over time, and in the meantime, we remain focused and opening 10,000 square foot stores.","Looking ahead to our real estate program for 2015, we're on track to open approximately 100 new stores this year, and are seeing plenty of availability of high quality real estate sites.","In terms of the pace of store openings this year, we'll open about 20 in both the first and second quarters, about 45 in the third quarter, and about 15 in the fourth. Approximately one-third of the 2015 program will be in new markets, and two-thirds in existing or fill-in markets.","Turning to e-commerce, Ulta.com's growth of 55.2% contributed 230 basis points to the total company comp. E-commerce represented 4.6% of total company sales in 2014, on our way to our goal of growing to 10% of our business over the next five years.","We believe Ulta.com's impressive growth was primarily the result of higher customer engagement, driven by more relevant content and offers. This was evidenced by higher open, click, and conversion rates for our promotional emails, which drove sales productivity far above the increase in the number of emails we sent.","From a product perspective, the prestige cosmetics category remains very strong online. We also drove excellent growth in professional hair care and mass cosmetics by adding new brands in pro hair and elevating Ulta brand products on the website.","While the Ulta.com team had a great year in 2014, we're excited about the continued growth potential as we make strides in offering an even more compelling assortment online.","In early February, we launched key professional hair care brands on our website, including Redken, Pureology, and Matrix, previously only available in store. And just last week, we began selling Lanc\u00f4me on our website, a significant step forward for our prestige assortment.","Moving on to our sixth strategic imperative, investing in infrastructure to support our guest experience and growth, and capture scale efficiencies. Throughout our organization, planning and ensuring the successful execution of our supply chain transformation is a top priority.","The new distribution center in Greenwood, Indiana is right on track to begin to fulfill demand in the third quarter of this year. The building has all new systems, and a new operating model, and is designed to ramp up to provide capacity for more than 100 stores and significant e-commerce volume by next holiday season. This will be very important going forward, as we know we can drive tremendous demand on Ulta.com during the Black Friday Cyber Monday weekend.","In December, we stretched our ability to deliver a consistent guest experience, since our speed to fulfill orders was constrained by our supply chain capabilities during this very busy time of the year.","We expect to make significant progress on fulfillment speed next holiday season as we ramp up our Greenwood facility. We also recently selected a location for our next distribution center in the southwest. This facility will be in the Dallas market and we plan to open it in the second half of 2016.","That wraps up my update on our strategic imperatives. Before I turn it over to Scott, I'd like to announce some changes to our leadership team. Janet Taake, Chief Merchandising Officer has decided to retire, after a phenomenal six year career at Ulta Beauty.","During Janet's tenure, she oversaw a dramatic evolution of our merchandise offering. She and her team added more than 100 major new brands to our assortment, developed our current store format, which significantly increased the presence of prestige brands in our mix and brought tremendous discipline to the merchandise function.","Janet and her team have developed excellent relationships with our vendors and established Ulta in the marketplace as a collaborative, entrepreneurial and highly ethical business partner.","We're all extremely grateful for Janet's many contributions to our success, and she will surely be missed by me and the entire organization. She has agreed to stay with us through May 1st to ensure a smooth transition.","This change gives us an opportunity to create an integrated merchandising and marketing team structure, by organizing these functions under one leader. Dave Kimbell, previously Chief Marketing Officer, will now lead Merchandising, in addition to his current responsibilities over marketing, CRM, loyalty, and e-commerce, in the newly-created role of Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer.","Prior to joining Ulta, in his previous role at US Cellular, Dave was responsible for all aspects marketing and merchandising, including pricing, vendor negotiations, promotions, and inventory.","In addition, he spent several years on the vendor side of CPG at Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo, where he gained extensive experience in maximizing retailer and vendor partnerships.","I believe this new structure will bring many benefits that will help drive Ulta's continued growth with the seamless linking of product assortment, promotion, marketing communication, e-commerce and store design, the guest expense can become even more distinctive and powerful.","Now two of our most respected and experienced senior merchants, Tara Simon and Julie Tomasi have been promoted to Senior Vice President, both reporting to Dave. Tara has been with Ulta for three years as Vice President of Merchandising, managing the prestige cosmetics category. In addition to her new role, Tara's responsibilities will expand to include prestige skincare, fragrance, and trend development.","Julie has been with Ulta for five years, most recently as Vice President of Merchandising, managing the professional hair care, professional male, and personal care appliances category. In her new role, Julie's responsibilities will expand to include all of the mass merchandising categories, private label and pricing.","We're very fortunate to have these strong leaders on the team to take on increased responsibilities, and enable the creation of a structure that will further strengthen the organization and drive continued success for Ulta.","With that, I will hand it over to Scott.","Scott Settersten","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Fourth quarter sales were $1.048 billion compared to $868 million last year, an increase of 20.7%. Comparable sales increased 11.1%. The retail comp, including salon, was 8.8%.","The total company comp was driven by a healthy combination of transaction and ticket, with transactions up 7.7% and ticket up 3.4%. The ticket increase was driven by increases in average selling price, driven by strong sales of prestige categories and less discounting overall.","Retail-only comparable transactions were very strong, up 5.7%. Gross profit dollars were up 19.1% to $349.7 million and gross profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 33.4%, from 33.8% last year. There were two primary drivers of this decline. Increased costs associated with the ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program and the impact of e-commerce margin.","We have previously discussed with you all of the great benefits associated with our loyalty program, and importantly, since early 2014, having all of our guests on the same loyalty platform.","But as expected, while it drives more sales and gross margin dollars, it is a bit more expensive on a rate basis, since guests are much more engaged in the program and take advantage of the benefits to a higher degree than the previous certificate programs.","We've now anniversaried the loyalty program conversion that took place in February of 2014, so we don't expect to experience this level of rate pressure going forward.","On the e-commerce side, the deleverage comes from Ulta.com's lower margins due to product mix, less efficient supply chain capabilities, and shipping costs. Offsetting this mix impact were improved retail product margins, reflecting reduced reliance on price discounting, and modest leverage on rent expense.","SG&A expense increased 18.6% to $210.7 million, down 40 basis points as a percentage of sales to 20.1%, versus 20.5% last year. The key drivers of this improvement were payroll and marketing leverage on stronger than expected sales, offset by investments in people to drive our strategic initiatives, as well as increased depreciation of IT systems.","Pre-opening expense was $1.6 million compared to $1.8 million last year, driven by 10 store openings during the quarter, compared to 11 new stores opened during Q4 2013. Operating income increased 20.4% to $137.5 million. Operating margin was flat to last year at 13.1%.","Interest income was $231,000, net of credit facility fees. Our line of credit remains undrawn. Our tax rate of 36.6% included about $0.02 of earnings per share benefit, related to a non-recurring deferred tax adjustment.","Net income increased 23.5% to $87.3 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, versus $70.7 million or $1.09 per diluted share last year. Excluding the non-recurring tax benefit, net income increased 21.6% to $86 million, and earnings per share increased 22%.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, inventories were $581.2 million at the end of the quarter compared to $457.9 million at the end of Q4 2013, up 10.7% on a per store basis.","We have been fairly aggressive in investing in our highest velocity SKUs to keep up with the strong demand we're experiencing. We're pleased with the quality of our inventory coming out of holiday, and thus far, we have not seen any material impact from the West Coast port issues. We continue to stay close to our vendors to assess and mitigate any potential impact down the road.","Capital expenditures were $76.6 million for the quarter, driven by our new store opening program, supply chain investments and systems. We spent $249 million in capital for the full year, slightly lower than planned.","About 45% of our 2014 capital spend was for new stores, remodels, and relocations, about 15% was for merchandising, store maintenance and other capital. The remaining 40% was for supply chain systems and e-commerce investments.","Depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter were $35.7 million and $131.8 million for the full year. We generated about $148 million of free cash flow for the year and ended the year with $539 million of cash and short-term investments.","The company repurchased approximately 235,000 shares at a cost of $30 million during the quarter, under our 10b5-1 plan, as part of our program to return cash to shareholders. We spent about $40 million on share repurchases in 2014, since implementing our plan in September last year.","Effective March 17th, our Board has approved an increased authorization for our current repurchase plan, adding $100 million to our existing $300 million share repurchase authorization put in place last year. We expect to continue to offset dilution with our 10b5-1 plan and still have the flexibility to repurchase opportunistically beyond that.","Turning now to our guidance for 2015. In terms of our outlook for the full year, we expect to achieve results in line with our long-term guidance provided last fall, updated from the new 2014 baseline, reflecting our earnings upside in the back half of the year.","More specifically, we expect to open 100 stores in 2015 and remodel four stores, grow e-commerce sales in the 40% range, drive comparable sales in the 6% to 8% range, and deliver earnings per share growth in the range of 15% to 17%, from the $3.96 of adjusted EPS we delivered in 2014, which excludes the $0.02 non-recurring tax benefit and Q4.","This guidance includes planned supply chain and systems investments and assumes we continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution. We expect deleverage on our gross profit line and modest leverage on the SG&A line and operating margins are expected to remain about flat. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 38%.","We expect a bit more variability in our quarterly earnings performance due to the timing of our supply chain investments, the addition of prestige boutiques, and the fact that we will be comping over some very successful product launches in the second and third quarters of 2014.","As a result, we expect stronger performance in the first and fourth quarters and somewhat softer earnings performance in the second and third quarters. We expect CapEx to be in the $300 million range and to generate free cash flow similar to our 2014 performance.","In terms of specific guidance for Q1 2015, we expect sales to be in the range of $833 million to $847 million compared to $713.8 million last year. We anticipate achieving a comparable sales increase in the range of 7% to 9%, versus 8.7% last year.","Again, we have our easiest comp comparisons in Q1, so we expect comps will moderate a bit after the first quarter, as we lap some of the terrific brand and product launches, like IT Cosmetics, IT Brushes and a new foundation from bareMinerals that helped drive strong comps, starting in Q2 of last year.","We expect to open 20 stores in the first quarter, versus 21 stores opened in Q1 last year, so pre-opening expense is expected to be relatively flat. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.93 versus $0.77 for Q1 of 2014. We anticipate a tax rate of 38% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 64.4 million.","With that, I'll turn the call over to our conference call host to begin the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Co. Please proceed with your question.","Oliver Chen","Hi. Congratulations on a really spectacular conclusion to the year. Regarding your comments in the opportunities ahead on the supply chain side, could you characterize to us where you are in terms of where you see the longer term going? And specifically I was also curious about fulfillment, planning and allocation.","And also related to your comment on e-commerce and supply chain capabilities, you see the margin improving as your capabilities improve in this discipline? I also had a question about awareness.","Mary Dillon","Okay. Oliver, thank you. And let me just start with kind of supply chain, as you know, it\u2019s a multiyear project and I guess I would just say really touches several assets to the business. So overall goal are going to be building infrastructure to support the growth that we have planned, also to enhance capabilities that we know we need from to be really relevant omni-channel retailer as our customers want to shop, and then also, of course, efficiencies over time.","So really this multiyear plan has several benefits that we -- we are excited about. Examples, increasing delivery frequency to help and improve in-stock condition, having the cartons arrived at the stores and easier to stock to shelf kind of format, we call that store-ready. Even looking to see if we can be more efficient with our footprint and leverage, inventory across our footprint to fulfill omni-channel order. Forecast and replenishment, yeah, that certainly part of it.","Down the road, if we have more store format like the small stores ensuring that that's easier to scale it to operate, that's also part of it. And also that we continue to improve processing time on our e-commerce business. So all of those are aspects and benefits that are expected and built into the five-year plan relative to the supply chain investments.","E-commerce, yes, we do expect that margin will improve as we get more efficient, the two new distribution centers are really being built from the start with that in mind. So really fulfill e-commerce as well as store order is efficiently as possible. So as well as we continue to improve some of the mix of what we feel in e-com.","Oliver Chen","Thank you, Mary. And also on the awareness front here, that's been a nice theme for your bigger strategic plan. Where do you -- where would conceptualize customers as coming from as you make these nice leaps?","And as you post-game holiday, it was a really great execution. But if you had to think about it from post-game perspective, you know, are there any things that you just slightly did as you think about next year? Thanks a lot. ","Mary Dillon","Okay. Well, we are constantly in a mode of continues improvement seriously. So I think we are always looking at what worked well, what we could have done better. Honestly, we are very pleased with how the quarter turned out, but there is always -- there is -- we can continue to improve. ","Question about where the customers are coming from? We know that we have opportunity gap in our awareness relative to some of our competition and that's opportunity for us. And that's why we have been working to balance the mix of how we do our marketing to drive -- to have awareness generating tactics and that's proving to work for us. ","As you step way back, we have, as you know about just under 3% share of the beauty market in the U.S. So our guess is, you know, loved us and she is loyal and coming more often. But there are two sources. One is beauty enthusiast who perhaps have not been in Ulta ever and not been in Ulta for long time or current guests that are maybe spending money across, you know, different retailers early they spend everything all in one place for any one category, but if she is increasing giving us more of her share of wallet.","And our loyalty program is a key part of that. It really provides a great incentive to spend your beauty dollar Ulta, because the points are valuable and, you know, more you spend, the more valuable they get for our guest. So it\u2019s really current guests spending more with us as well new guests spending with us instead of other places. ","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Best regards.","Mary Dillon","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks. Good afternoon, congratulations. I have one question for you Mary, and then I don\u2019t if Janet is there. But if she is not, I will ask that of you as well. ","Mary Dillon","Yes, she is here.","Simeon Gutman","Great. Okay. Great. So first on the momentum in the business, very strong and I am guessing it\u2019s combination of a lot of things. More curious about the marketing side, how effective you are getting a customer targeting. Are you able to attract the pulse of people responding to your offers and seeing a higher response rate and able to attract it on a real-time basis.","Mary Dillon","Yeah, maybe David and Janet are both here. So perhaps we can ask them a little bit. But I would say the momentum on the business that we are seeing is really cut across a lot of dimensions which was great and our job is keep those levers all working. But really if you think about the new product launches and new product news was a big part of the fourth quarter. So Bare Escentuals, Urban Decay, Benefit, Clinique, Lanc\u00f4me all good examples. ","Our loyalty program, all and everybody, our one program actually even improving our in-store sign up. And then yeah, so then this notion of our improved marketing strategies and tactics, it\u2019s kind of this combination of using different type pieces of the mix as well as really positioning ourselves, I guess, is more of a beauty authority. So all of those combined and I mentioned in the script gift card as well. So really a lot of different things were working for us in the quarter. ","Anything on this, Dave?","David Kimbell","Yeah, I think we have made -- we continue to do a lot of the things that have worked for us historically behind many of the print vehicles, our magazines worked well and reaching our existing guests. But we have also introduced an improved several of the taxes we go to market with. Mary mentioned in the script for the first time bringing radio into the mix which we think was a really strong addition to our promotional activity or key holiday season. ","We also -- to your question specifically about improving the effectiveness, there is a lot that we can read around our guest responsiveness our activities in one area in particular that I would highlight is the impact we are having with our email. So as we get better information around our guest, we are able to more personalize the communication offers, the type of information, the frequency of the information that we are delivering to her. ","And so we saw a dramatic increase in the effectiveness which has measured by essentially sales per email in that fourth quarter. So we feel like we are expanding as well as getting sharper in the types of things that we are doing. ","Simeon Gutman","Okay. And then for Janet, and congratulations on your retirement. I just want -- you have this unique six-year or so perspective at Ulta and dealing brands. And so I wanted to actually trying to something all-encompassing of sort of what's changed in brand perception of Ulta then versus now, how they look at online versus -- you mentioned one Lanc\u00f4me, is that inevitable for prestige brands to allow Ulta to sale it, or do you think their own online ambition will get in the way?","And then also do you think there is much an appetite for them to look outside of Ulta to other specialty retailers to sale the prestige product to?","Janet Taake","That was more than one question.","Simeon Gutman","It's all for you. ","Janet Taake","Well, thank you so much. First of all, I think that what I would say about vendor, as you know, my team has great relationships with vendors in the marketplace. Across all categories we do business with them and we had for some time and I think that continues to grow. Our vendor partners really enjoy our straightforward approach to how we run our business and also that it truly is a win-win for them.","We hold our vendors accountable to our comps and we look at our business that way, every single day. Yes, we're a fast-growth retailer, but I really think they appreciate that we want to win at a comp level is so which important to us. But we really partner with them to try to make guests experience the best possible experience it can be. And with that I think that they are lot of interested and also based on the respect that we have in the marketplace which I am quite proud of. ","As far as online, we have made a significant progress as Mary has mentioned this past year. The largest gap just to refresh to refresh her memory was really in professional hair care and we added 12 brands in 2014 and then three at the beginning of this year. So we have products out there. And we are very, very excited about Lanc\u00f4me coming online. We are truly closing the gap down with very few that are not saleable online at this particular point in time. But I am always hopeful that we will not get into zero for sure. ","Simeon Gutman","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. ","Daniel Hofkin","Hi. Are you able to hear me okay?","Mary Dillon","Yes.","Daniel Hofkin","Okay. I will add my congratulations on a fantastic quarter. And just I wanted to delve a little bit possible into the gross margin in terms of buckets, and it sounds like -- is it fair to say basically in terms of the directional changes and even maybe the magnitude that most of the aspects of puts and takes were as good or better than expected despite some of the mix shift and the impact of loyalty in e-commerce?","Scott Settersten","Yeah, I see that's right on target, Dan. I mean, it\u2019s a -- there is always a few, right, unplanned surprises that you managed against during the course of any quarter or year. In the fourth quarter, Mary mentioned we had a few challenges in our e-commerce fulfillment side of the business, because again as always the demand always seems to exceed our expectations. So we had a few more, I would say, inefficiencies, labor inefficiencies there that we had to deal with and some additional freight expense to make sure we try to meet guest expectations as best as we could, so we reacted to that.","But really I\u2019d say that was probably the one, I\u2019d say, on the negative side of the ledger. On the positive side, I mean, everything seem to work spectacularly in the stores, execution was good, in stocks were fantastic and so we are very pleased with overall performance on retail side of the business. ","Daniel Hofkin","And it sounded like you've said that the less discounting and certainly Prestige being among the strongest general categories. So fair to kind of infer that the general underlying product or merchandize margin trend is -- continues to be kind of a key component area, it sounds like. Is that fair to say?","Scott Settersten","Yeah. Let me repeat that. The core retail product margins, so 90% plus of the business, they were better year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. All right? So the core of the business is very healthy and we are just managing along in our e-commerce side of the business and the loyalty thing is kind of a one-time hit I would say and now they were anniversaried again we wouldn\u2019t expect to see that kind of pressure on margin rate going forward. ","Daniel Hofkin","Okay. And then -- in terms of the brands you have, can you just provide a quick update on where we are at this point with Lanc\u00f4me and Clinique. I know you said you are planning to add some of each and if there is any color you can shade on that at the beginning of the year that would be great. Thanks.","Mary Dillon","Yeah. As I mentioned in the script and we are planning to expand our boutiques of both of those brands. I'm not going to get into specifics. But we are excited we've got great partnership, great momentum on the brands and we will be rolling out to more stores. ","Daniel Hofkin","Great. Well, great job and best of luck.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Scott Settersten","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. ","Aram Rubinson","Hi there. Can you hear me?","Mary Dillon","Yes.","Aram Rubinson","Okay, great. All right. Thanks for taking the call. So want to ask you question about online. It looks like you had by our math about a $55 million increase in e-commerce sales in 2014 over 2015, it\u2019s like the equivalent of about 13 stores. So I'm just kind of wondering, A, where the e-commerce shopper is coming from?","Can you give us something about geography, demographics and maybe there is opening fewer stores kind of almost feed the business in a way, because you are getting to satisfy that customer without putting up the bricks?","Mary Dillon","Yeah. Go ahead, Dave. ","David Kimbell","I -- no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s associated with our store growth. Obviously, we opened 100 stores last year. And where that growth is coming from, where our best customer is coming from is we really get an incremental transactions from her. What we see is our -- those guests which is a more -- majority of our online business are coming in and buying both in-store and online. So we get actually close to -- actually little bit more than double the number of transactions from a guest that is actively buying online and in-store versus a guest who is just buying in-store.","So really its fundamental and a key part of our overall Omni-channel effort is to be -- have the experience where and when she wants it and what we find is there is times where it\u2019s easier for her to buy what she is looking for, she is attracted to something online and she is at home and she wants to get it. But we also know a big need for us is to get her into store and she is doing both. So we see that as really an incremental purchase and an incremental opportunity for us to drive growth and related to the store growth. ","Aram Rubinson","Thanks. If you had to just kind of pick a number of guest added, what kind of -- what comps are coming from existing customers versus new, is to ballpark?","David Kimbell","Do you mean in the online space you\u2019re talking\u2026","Aram Rubinson","No, I was thinking more in the stores. I'm just curious how many more new customers you seem to be bringing into the tent?","David Kimbell","Well, we said we were attracting millions of new customers every year. Retention remains really high. So we have good strong retention. But we continue to attract new growth in customers. I will say one of our opportunities going forward -- it\u2019s the reason we are trying to build awareness is to bring even more new guests going in. But we have high retention. We have high percentage of sales that come from our guests and that's a key driver of our business continuing to delight them and drive strong performance with that group.","Aram Rubinson","And last thing just a little bit housekeeping, in Q1 in the guidance, what kind of investments does that include and then I will hand up.","Scott Settersten","It includes of litany of things, many of those things Mary described in her prepared remarks. So there is new investments going in stores with test management system, we've got new mobile technology; app system is going in stores with iPads to allow us to be more engaging with our guests in the stores. ","Of course, the biggest investment is the Midwest, DC, which is going to ramp up. It\u2019s ready to open in summer of 2015. So there is a fair amount of gross margin deleverage, that\u2019s where most of that expense flows through the P&L and it will ramp up. I mean, it\u2019s there in first quarter, but the heaviest -- it\u2019s mostly backend loaded in 2015. Third and fourth quarter is the heaviest expense.","Aram Rubinson","Thank you. It\u2019s great to see the hard work pay off.","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Aram.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan Chase. Please proceed with your question. ","Christopher Horvers","Thanks and good evening. So I want to follow up on the email personalization opportunity. Can you talk about where you are from a segmentation process? How finely can you group your customer base in to different types of buckets that you are using? Can you get down to, let\u2019s say, I know these 10,000 people are bareMinerals customers and so I'm going to send them an email and perhaps other buckets that you are using. And how personal will it be a year from now?","Mary Dillon","So, Chris, I will tell you what that is part of the secret sauce in some ways that I want to be careful about how much we say, because it\u2019s really an important lever for us. And I got to tell you I think our team is -- I know they are all over this and we are very deep in our knowledge, our precision, our ability to target and use this to various effects. But I wouldn\u2019t want to say more than that, because it\u2019s really an important tool for us. But we are excited about it. I think it\u2019s just going to continue to be a great lever for us.","Christopher Horvers","So I guess, maybe, you could characterize in terms of the classic basic, any insights. Where do you think you are versus let\u2019s say best-in-class in retail not versus let\u2019s say online retailers, but best-in-class in retail?","Mary Dillon","Yeah, I think we\u2019re probably still in early innings. Right. I mean -- so I think our capabilities that we -- we've had the loyalty program for a long time, but it\u2019s really like now that we are at this one platform everybody that just simplifies our life and makes it more powerful and the team is really actively experimenting with lots of ways to leverage that. But -- so I think we are really in early stages. ","Christopher Horvers","Okay. And then as a follow-up you raised the share buyback program by 100 million and let\u2019s say we assume the stock set at 1.60 tomorrow, that start 2.3 million, 2.4 million shares open to buy. Can you talk about how many shares you need to be repurchased this year to offset share dilution and is the idea of raising the authorization so early, is that to allow increased flexibility to be more opportunistic? Thanks.","Scott Settersten","Yeah, we wanted to maintain maximum flexibility. So again, the plan -- the stated plan, our 10b5-1 plan, the focus is on offsetting dilution which we said I don\u2019t know if I have the number of shares that it takes. But its roughly 500,000 I think was our early model. 500,000 shares a year roughly which equates to about 1%, that's how we set up earnings growth. ","Christopher Horvers","Thanks very much. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Evren Kopelman","Thank you. Good afternoon. Congratulations. My question is for Scott on the guidance. The first quarter comp guidance is the 7% to 9%; it\u2019s very strong, of course, nothing to complain about. But it\u2019s significantly below the 11% you just delivered. Is that just conservatism built into guidance or have you seen the business slow down the Q1 so far?","Scott Settersten","Yeah, we don\u2019t -- as you know we don\u2019t talk about current quarter performance. But we had whether just like everyone else did in the February. Right? So we take everything into account at the current conditions reflect. So we feel very confident, strong momentum coming out of fourth quarter.","We mentioned gift cards; there is carry over from that. Post January there is good newness in the pipeline coming online, there is good tailwinds coming from the new store classes that are starting to roll into the comp base. ","So, again, we try to look at all of the facts and all the levers at our disposal and try to come up with the most prudent guidance that we can. ","Evren Kopelman","Thank you. And then two housekeeping, one is, the quarterly store opening cadence is that going to be similar to 2014? And then in your EPS growth guidance for the year, does that assume that 64.4 million that you guided for Q1 or does it assume more buybacks to lower the share count?","Scott Settersten","Yeah. I think the star program by and large pretty much in years 2014\u2026","Mary Dillon","We said 20-20.45 in 2015. ","Scott Settersten","Right, which I think is roughly above long-term last year, so it\u2019s like-for-like more or less Evren. And on the shares, again, I think for the full year 64 -- you\u2019re going to build in roughly 400,000 to 500,000 shares, right, off buybacks which would equate to the dilution effect that we described.","Evren Kopelman","Perfect. Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. ","Jason Gere","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions. I guess, the first, a more clarification the gross margin, I guess, deleverage this year. Is that primarily because of the new DC in the second half of the year? I know you talked about the loyalty card anniversarying. So just wondering if there is anything else in there that we should be taking into consideration. ","Scott Settersten","No, Jason, that's primarily it, kind of, what we described as part of our long-term guidance that we expect to be continue to deliver very strong earnings growth going forward adjusted for the investments, primarily for the DCs. But there are other related investments in our round core systems around merchandizing and other store things that we described in our remarks that we feel we need to support, strong, healthy earnings growth in the future.","Jason Gere","Okay. And then longer term, I know just back in the fall you gave the long-term EPS guidance that gets low 20% and obviously that would imply, start to see a pick-up in margins and this year I think we are implying really flat margins even though comps will be pretty nice.","So I'm just wondering how you think about the long-term margin opportunity. Who out there in specialty retail really benchmark yourself to? Because certainly at 12%, kind of, operating margins, it seems to be you are under earning on that end and recognizing that there are investments now that will probably go on for another year or so. ","But really, where do you kind of benchmark yourself to and what could be kind of that longer term opportunity. I'm not asking you to quantify, but just kind of how you look at it?","Scott Settersten","I think we still feel very confident with the guidance that we provided last fall which we think is very realistic to get to a mid-teens operating margin over the long-term, over the five-year period.","Again, in 2015 and 2016 operating margins are going to be flattish because of some of the supply chain, DC and other core system investments that we will be making. But once we get pass that we expect it to be making significant progress towards that target -- mid-teens operating margin target in 2017 and beyond. So lots of good news coming out of these investments, that's what we expect. Unfortunately, we have to make the investments upfront and you\u2019ll start seeing the benefits more in the outer years. ","Jason Gere","Okay, great. That will be it for me. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Ike Boruchow","Hey, good afternoon everyone. Congrats on a great quarter. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Scott, thanks for the help on the variability on how the year should play out. Can you help us when you talk about Q2 and Q3 being tougher. Is that more so on the gross profit and SG&A lines and on margins or should we assume that also -- because you mentioned some product launch compares, so we assumed that that\u2019s also an impact on the comps. ","Scott Settersten","Yeah, it\u2019s a mix of both. I mean, Q2 if you line them up, the stack year-over-year, you will see last year was a -- what a 30% EPS growth year-over-year. So when you just starting doing the math, you can see that it\u2019s a tougher comparison. Part of it is being derived from the tough comp compares with some of these product launches which were very strong last year. And some of it is just to build on the deleveraging growth in supply chain cost that are going to effect the P&L. so it\u2019s really a combination of the two.","Ike Boruchow","Right. I mean, I ask because the strongest comp for the year was in Q4 this year and so you are saying Q2 and Q3 are the toughest compares, so that\u2019s why I was trying to clear up if it\u2019s just margin or it's also comp?","Scott Settersten","No, it\u2019s a combination of the two. I mean, margin -- I would say the margin piece is more of a Q3, Q4 and the sales is more of a Q2, Q3 timeframe.","Ike Boruchow","Got it. Okay, thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello of Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. ","Joe Altobello","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions on some of the tests you guys did this quarter. It sounds like the advertising test went fairly well with the comps above the control group. Was that the same for the increased staffing in the 60 stores you tested this quarter? ","Mary Dillon","Yeah. The payroll testing model, we\u2019re really pleased with the learning, Kecia Steelman who is our Head of Store Operations, has really dug deep in all over this. It\u2019s a actually little bit less of a clean test than an adverting test in some ways, right? The inputs are little bit different, because it\u2019s about store-by-store, managing the payroll, hiring, getting the right people there and managing that to an outcome that you want.","So what we saw -- and that's why we feel confident that there are sources we are going to after this and we\u2019re going to increase labor hours because we believe it\u2019s going to pay for itself in terms of increased sales, frankly, by having more guest facing time and more conversion. ","So but it\u2019s also something that because it\u2019s subtle, it\u2019s a little trickier to manage. We\u2019re going to walk before we run. So it\u2019s not -- what we know is that over time as we continue to play out the supply chain investments for our associates in the stores, it will get easier to have more guest facing time, and that's exiting. In the meantime, we want to see if we can accelerate that, but we\u2019re going to kind of take it step-by-step. ","Joe Altobello","Okay. So any learnings early on from that test at all?","Mary Dillon","Just that -- particularly when we executed really well, where we held the General Manager accountable to new sales target with those new increased hours and whether that store was able to hire the right person quickly and get the right people trained in a position. It was efficacious for us. That\u2019s why we are confident to add more labor hours in certain subset of stores because we think managed right it\u2019s going to be a good investment for us. ","It\u2019s really about that overall guest experience as well. And when our guest wants to interact with our associate, our associates want to be there to help them. And so it really is a flywheel that helps the business and we like where it\u2019s going. ","Joe Altobello","Got it. Okay. And just moving on to the smaller format store test. It sounds like you guys are going slow there. If it\u2019s successful how many locations you think you could have in terms of that smaller format over time?","Mary Dillon","We talked about up to about couple of hundred stores incremental to the 1,200 stores that we've already mapped out for our large format. And, yeah, I mean, we love how they are performing. They are great stores, great team, the guests love them, and it\u2019s really I believe in pacing, again walk before you run.","So it\u2019s a little tricky to operate a completely different store format which it is, but we\u2019re really pleased with where it\u2019s going. ","Joe Altobello","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Altschwager","Good afternoon. And let me offer my congratulations as well. Just a quick follow-up on the small stores, I know it's early, but any metrics you can share on just the productivity you are seeing there or average gross margins versus your typical store?","And then separately, what pieces need to be in place from a distribution standpoint in order to enable the scalability of that concept?","Mary Dillon","Yeah. I'm not going to share a lot of the details on this, because it's really early and I want to protect some of that insight. But I will just tell you that we set certain sales and productivity targets and we're exceeding them.","So, they would be the normal targets that we set for any store. So we feel good about that. It's really about forecasting replenishment models that I think are going to be the key to getting us to a position to more easily run the store format. So, it's not that far off.","I mean it's not like we're going to wait a super long time to do this, because we're excited about the prospect. And I'll tell you what the guests in these small towns were very excited that we showed up, so it's a great opportunity for us.","Mark Altschwager","Great. And then just one more quick one, I think you're two quarters in with this new POS system. Have you seen any benefits from that? And any metrics you can share on that front? Thank you.","Scott Settersten","We don't really have any metrics we can share. I would tell you that the rollout went very smooth. I mean this was one that was pretty high risk and we accelerated it, to make sure we could get it in before holiday, so things went very smooth, all things considered.","We did get some step-up in the technology as far as cyber protection as part of that system, so we are very happy that we were able to accelerate the implementation of that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with question.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon. I want to start by talking about the loyalty program. You spoke about the loyalty program having a diminishing impact on margins, as you have now cycled the move to a single platform. Can you talk about the typical sales maturation curve that you have seen from customers after they have ramped onto that platform? Is it a multiyear curve, is the big sales kick in year one? Just how we should pick about the impact on sales of cycling that, as well?","Scott Settersten","Matt, historically, what we -- as you well know, we've been experimenting with this model for quite some time. So, historically, as we roll it out to new markets, we saw a sales hit in year one as people got comfortable with the program, and we saw that moderate over the course of the year. So, the going-in assumption was like a one year cycle time to get back to what I would call an equilibrium with the guests.","This rollout, the conversion that we did with the 50% of the country in 2014, we didn't see that. We saw sales actually accelerate from our expectations and, of course that equated to more points being earned and more of a margin headwind, because of that, because people are more engaged and it's easier to understand. So--","Matthew Fassler","And if you think about what year two has typically looked like and whether you think it will be any different for this round?","Scott Settersten","Yeah. We haven't really seen that. Again, it's a different scale now. We've got the whole country on this program, and I can just tell you from the inside, we are very excited about what this program provides to the company and the opportunities that we're going to have to drive more engagement, more focused offers to our guests, by using our CRM tool. And again, we're in the very early stages of this.","Matthew Fassler","And then one other question, you've dealt with this a number of different ways so far this afternoon. If you think about the acceleration that you saw, in the online business in the quarter where you have the highest volumes, that acceleration, is that much more meaningful, would you tie that in directly to CRM efforts and customer acquisition?","And I guess you're seeing customer acquisition disproportionately commence online, or is it evenly distributed, or proportionally distributed across channels?","David Kimbell","Yeah, a couple things. First we are seeing an over-index of new customer acquisition online, although it's still the minority of our customer -- new customer acquisition. The things that are driving our growth from an e-commerce, is absolutely a combination of a number of key factors. It is a great portfolio of products, first and foremost.","They are really attracted to -- the same things they are attracted to in store, they are attracted to online. And we had great success behind many of the launches and the products that Mary touched on.","We also, as Janet described, added several new products throughout the course of the fourth quarter and even into this year. We've been successful at driving traffic to our sites, so our customer acquisition and traffic driving activity has really been exceeding our expectation. And then once they get there, some of the changes we've made within the site experience to convert them have been working.","And then, I would say the other activities for within loyalty, to your point, around email and other communication, even our magazines and really every touch point that we have, encourages her or reminds her to come online, just as much as it does remind her to come in store, so all that seems to be working.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen we have time for one more question. Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray, please proceed.","Steph Wissink","Thank you for letting me sneak one in and all the best wishes to you, Janet, really a remarkable finish to your ULTA career.","Janet Taake","Thank you.","Steph Wissink","The question is actually for you, specifically. Just to give us a status update on the percentage of SKUs in the mix now that crossover between stores and e-commerce?","And then a big follow-up question to the panel. If you think about the influence of content, and I think, Mary, you mentioned this in your prepared remarks, whether it's your own content or content that's created by your vendors, how important is that, do you think, to building your competitive advantage in the marketplace?","Mary Dillon","I will start with the content. And absolutely, we are very focused on that. And this is a category industry that is so driven by trend and content, new discoveries, so we're building content, we are working with our vendor partners to acquire more content and you'll see more of that to come from us for sure.","Janet Taake","As far as online SKUs, basically now, with the additions that we made in Professional Haircare and Lanc\u00f4me, we're well within a very high range of what we have in the store. We have over 20,000 SKUs in the store, so it would be comparable online.","As I mentioned before, it's a handful of brands that are in store that are truly not online for sale today. So, we have made significant progress in 2014.","Steph Wissink","Great. Best of luck to you all. Good bye.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Okay. So, in closing, I'd like to thank our 22,000 dedicated associates for a really terrific 2014 and their tireless efforts to differentiate ULTA Beauty and to continue our strong momentum into 2015 and beyond.

Our team achieved another quarter of excellent top and bottom line performance, while making significant progress on many elements of our growth strategy.","Highlights of the quarter includes the continued impact of a strong pipeline of newness and innovation in merchandising, progress in growing our brand awareness, reaching major milestones related to our loyalty program, continued rapid growth in our e-commerce business, and successful execution of our supply chain investments.","To summarize our second quarter financial performance, total Company sales grew 21.9%, and comp sales rose 14.4% on top of 10.1% comps in the second quarter of 2015, driven by healthy gains in both transaction count and average ticket.","Strength in cosmetics both mass and prestige continues to be the biggest driver of our growth, but our other major categories are contributing as well. e-commerce performance was very strong and the salon business achieve solid top line growth. We delivered earnings per share growth of 24.3% despite significant investments in the business, including the opening of our new distribution center in Dallas, implementing core merchandising systems, and rolling out a large number of prestige brand boutique and related store remodel.","Let me cover some of the highlights driving our performance in the second quarter. Starting with our efforts to acquire new customers, our loyalty programs surpass the 20 million member mark and now boast 20.6 million active members, growing more than 27% year-over-year on a rolling 12 month basis. We believe our evolving marketing strategy with a growing focus on multimedia advertising and digital marketing is working to raise our profile in consumer awareness and to better define our brand.","Once people discover Ulta Beauty our store associates continue to do a fantastic job, signing them up for our ultimate rewards loyalty program. Retention rate, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average member ticket remains very strong. We are also very excited to launch our new ULTAmate Rewards credit card program chain-wide just a few weeks ago. We now offer members an Ulta Beauty private-label credit card which can be used in any of our stores and at ulta.com and we offer a cobranded credit card which can be used wherever MasterCard is accepted.","Our team is still working diligently on this project for more than a year designing a program we know our members will love, upgrading our POS systems, preparing our store associates, and developing a robust marketing program. It's a great example of enterprise-wide collaboration across multiple areas of the business. The credit card is designed to enhance our Ultimate Rewards program by offering greater benefits to our members, which we believe will drive increased engagements and loyalty.","While we don't expect this new program to have a material impact on our results in the short-term, early indications are quite positive and we believe this will create tremendous value for our guests and our Company over the long-term. Our marketing mix continues to evolve with increased use of television, radio, digital, and social media and less reliance on traditional print vehicles.","During the second quarter, we executed a successful Gorgeous Hair event, supported by national radio and visual campaign. Reflecting our 2016 focus on the lip category, we continued our Lip Happily Campaign and launched the hash tag ThisIsHowILip digital campaign with native content integration, influencers, dedicated emails, video and banners with mass reach beauty sites like Vivala, Refinery29, and POPSUGAR.","Now turning to merchandising. Newness and innovation continues to drive the business. We are seeing ongoing strength in both mass and prestige cosmetics with impressive growth in Urban Decay, It Cosmetics, Nyx, Anastasia, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lancome, Benefit, Maybelline, Real Techniques and the Ulta Beauty collection. The professional hair care category was also strong, anchored by great execution of the signature Ulta Beauty promotion our leader event featuring compelling prices on jumbo sizes of salon hair care brand.","New items contributed significantly to the overall comp. Noteworthy additions included Urban Decay's new assortment of 100 shades of Vice lip stick. The introduction of Anastasia's color cosmetics, the launch of Soap & Glory cosmetic, hundreds of new SKUs from Nyx, and innovation in the nail category with Essie's Gel Couture nail polish featuring up to 14 days durability.","We added several new limited distribution brands including Shiseido, E.l.f., Gillette, Drybar, Maui Moisture and Vita Liberata. We also expanded clearance skin care to additional stores and rolled out BECCA cosmetics to almost the entire chain. The Ulta Beauty collection continued its rapid growth with new products and an upgraded presentation, which includes a new wall layout and improved graphics. We are also improving the shopping experience with our chain-wide tester program for the Ulta Beauty collection as well as Nyx within the mass cosmetic assortment.","We are very pleased with the strong execution of a large number of Clinique and Lancome boutique installations that are planned this year and the stores are excited to introduce these prestige brands to our guests. We will continue to enhance the overall assortment with a strong pipeline of brands for the rest of the year and many more brands in the wings for 2017. Also we recently launched the iconic Est\u00e9e Lauder brand our Web site and we'll roll it out to 30 stores in September with a broad expansion plan for next spring.","To update you on our services business, our salon sales rose 14.3%, and comped 8% with strength in hair color, hair treatments, and makeup services. We saw strong response to CRM campaigns drive services and continue to develop additional strategies to drive new customer acquisition over the long-term. One example is, we\u2019re testing enhancements to our online booking software and expect to roll out the new platform this fall. The new booking tool will make it much easier for our guests to select for service and schedule her appointment online where and when it's convenient for her.","Also our salon stylists were excited to experience our fall winter training programs developed by our elite artistic team, featuring a glamping theme, which is designed to integrate on trend hair and makeup looks like Ron's hair color, a blend of coppery red and brown and Natural Darling makeup which is a fresh take on no makeup-makeup. We also introduced Bro Layage, the first time we feature a men's hair care color service.","Our Benefit Brow Bar business continued its strong performance with brow services in 785 stores at the end of the quarter with more than 500 of these offering brow tinting as well. We also enhanced Benefit's product offerings during the quarter with the addition of 36 new innovative brow products which are merchandised in the boutiques, as well as on custom fixtures in our stores.","Turning to new store growth. We opened up 24 stores and closed three stores in the second quarter. One closure was the Chicago State Street location and the other two were relocation. We are on track to complete our 2016 program of 100 net new stores and ended the quarter with 907 stores. New store productivity continues to be excellent with new stores performing well above their budget and their IRR target.","In addition to the new store program, our growth and development team is very focused on ensuring high-quality execution of our prestige boutique rollout and we complete a large number of the more than 500 Clinique, Lancome, and Benefit boutiques planned for this year. We are taking advantage of this boutique expansion activity to further refresh our store fleet with improvements in fragrance, nail, and Ulta Beauty collection fixtures and looking ahead we\u2019ve already approved 100 stores for next year's real estate program.","Now moving on to ulta.com our e-commerce growth was very strong, up 54.9% and contributing 180 basis points to our total company comp. Site traffic accounted for almost all of the growth, as we continue to invest in digital marketing. E-commerce margins improved in part due to the more efficient fulfillment costs from orders delivered from our new Greenwood distribution center.","Similar to our performance in stores, the fastest-growing category were prestige and mass cosmetic. Professional hair care was also a stand out as this category ramps up online, following the addition of many brands previously sold in store only last year. Our signature leader event featuring jumbo sizes of hair care products at compelling prices was very successful online during the quarter. To highlight our authority in hair care, we also conducted our first ever live beauty chat with expert salon stylists. These members of our elite Ulta Beauty artistic team answered guests questions on hair products, tools and tips.","Turning to assortment newness, we launched Shiseido skincare products in the Web site ahead of our limited in-store launch. Continuing on our efforts to increase our portfolio of online brand, we introduced E.l.f., a popular value price cosmetics brand at the end of the quarter. This new brand features many new products exclusive to Ulta Beauty in the assortment and got off to a very strong start in the Web site.","We continue to improve the guest experience in ulta.com with more content for the beauty enthusiasts and recently we launched a new feature called Ulta Beauty Mix with tips, articles and how-tos. The content is shoppable and we view this as our first significant step towards merging content and commerce. In addition, we\u2019ve made several technical enhancements to the Web site including a search engine optimization URL rewrite. We also released updates for our iPhone, Android and iPad app, including support for Ulta Reward credit card applications and account management and improve loyalty program sign-up process, a new gift card purchase capability, and Apple Pay expedited check out.","Turning to supply chain and systems, I'm very pleased to report that our new Dallas DC opened up on time in early July and is clearly fulfilling more than 90 stores and about 30% of our e-commerce volume. The Dallas DC is expected to ramp up a bit faster than Greenwood with plan to service more than a 130 stores and 25,000 e-commerce orders per day by the end of the holiday period. Similar to the benefits received from the Greenwood DC, the advantages of the Dallas operating model includes fewer, fuller and more stable retail cartons, increased categorization and improved labeling, and enhancements for e-commerce orders.","The Greenwood Indiana DC now just over a year-old is serving about 220 stores and fulfilling almost 40% of our e-commerce orders. We still plan to end the year delivering to approximately 240 stores from Greenwood. On the system side, SWIFT, our new forecasting and replenishment tool has now been rolled out to all product categories. The space and floor planning and assortment optimization tool went live a few weeks ago and our teams have starting to use the new system to plan for holiday and next year's store planogram.","The space planning system will be fully integrated with SWIFT and these processes will be integrated with our new master data system, which will automate the work and thus reduce the time needed to create floor plans and our increasingly complex spas. So needless to say, I\u2019m extremely proud of how our teams have executed across these initiatives while supporting strong growth.","Before I turn it over to Scott, I'd like to preview our upcoming investor conference in Chicago on October 13. I\u2019m very excited to update you on our long-term growth strategies and looking forward to give you a deeper understanding of drivers of for business, the future growth opportunities we\u2019re prioritizing, and also to give you insight into the talents and capabilities across our leadership team.","You will hear about our view of category and consumer trends that support our confidence in growth in the beauty category. We will show how we plan to continue to elevate awareness and clarity about Ulta Beauty as a retail brand. We will provide an update on our loyalty program and how we're using data in new ways to drive greater share of wallet of our ultimate rewards members. We will discuss the pipeline of new brands we plan to add to our assortment and provide new insight about our products and services offering.","We will describe how our supply chain and systems investments position us to drive cost efficiencies and higher service level. We will discuss the multifaceted real estate analysis we just completed that gives us confidence in many more years of store growth ahead, confirming square footage growth is a key part of our strategy to double our market share in the next several years.","We will detail the margin drivers that give us great confidence in achieving our mid-teens operating margin target by 2019 and show you why we\u2019re confident in achieving the long-term earnings growth targets we set as part of the strategic plan that we share back in 2014, even on a much bigger base of business than we forecasted in the initial plan.","So now let's turn over to Scott to give us more details about our second quarter results and our outlook for the third quarter and the year.","Scott Settersten","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. I will start with the income statement. Net sales for the second quarter increased 21.9% to $1.07 billion. And once again our top line was driven by a very healthy 14.4% comp and strong new store productivity. The total company comp was composed of 9.7% transaction growth and 4.7% average ticket growth. The retail comp of 12.9% was made up of 8.9% traffic and 4% ticket. The salon business comp 8% with all of the increase driven by ticket growth similar to trends earlier in the year. E-commerce growth of 54.9% was driven almost entirely by increased traffic with ticket growth up low single-digit.","Gross profit increased 110 basis points. The improvement was driven by leverage of store, rent and occupancy expenses, as well as by healthy product margin expansion, partially offset by planned supply chain investments in our new distribution center. E-commerce margins also improved with strength in the high-margin, professional hair care segment.","Moving onto SG&A expense, we deleveraged by 110 basis points driven by additional headcount to support our growth initiatives, as well as an unexpected charge related to a store closure. We recently closed our multilevel State Street store in Chicago. The store was temporarily closed back in May due to disruption from a construction in an adjacent building. The extensive damages to the store and the extraordinary amount of time and expense required to reopen the store resulted in our decision to permanently close the location, necessitating a significant impairment charge. This charge represented about a third of the SG&A deleverage in the quarter.","We reassigned our impacted associates to nearby alternative stores and have assisted guests to minimize any disruption in their shopping experience. We are currently evaluating nearby relocation opportunities and expect to get a replacement store up and running soon.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventories were up 18.7% on a per store basis, a bit higher than expected, reflecting the opening of our new distribution center in Dallas. Excluding the impact of the inventory for the new DC, inventories were up 14.5% on a per store basis in line with our comp. We continue to invest in inventory given better than expected top line growth, new brand additions, and the step up expansion of prestige boutiques.","Going forward, we\u2019re expecting to see total inventory per door growth more in line with comp growth by the end of the year and anticipate that the efficiencies from our supply chain investments, including new DCs and merchandise planning tools will become more evident in our financial results starting in 2017.","Capital expenditures were $95.3 million in the quarter driven by new store openings, fixtures for the rollout of prestige brand boutiques, and supply chain investments. We ended the quarter with $304.1 million in cash and short-term investments. In terms of share buybacks, year-to-date including our ASR, which settled in the second quarter, and activity under our 10b5-1 plans, we\u2019ve repurchased 1.27 million shares at an average price of approximately $199 per share. At the end of the quarter, approximately 193 million remained under the 425 million share repurchase authorization.","Turning now to guidance for the third quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.072 billion to $1.090 billion compared to $911 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 11% to 13% versus 12.8% last year. Online sales growth is expected to be in the 40% range. We plan to open about 40 stores in Q3 compared to 45 stores during the same period last year and preopening expense for the quarter is expected to be about $7.6 million.","Earnings per share expected to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.30 versus a $1.11 for Q3 of 2015. We anticipate a tax rate of 37.6% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 63 million. Our supply chain investments, particularly the ramp up of our new Dallas DC, on top of the Greenwood building, still only fulfilling about half its planned capacity, will continue to weigh on margins for the rest of the year.","We expect to see the largest impact in the third quarter with deleverage in the P&L reflecting the high water mark of our supply chain investments. We anticipate stronger earnings growth in the fourth quarter on higher sales volume. In light of the strength in the business in the first half of the year, we are raising our guidance for the full-year 2016. We now expect comparable sales to be in the range of 11% to 13% for the full-year versus prior guidance of 10% to 12%.","We now expect to grow earnings per share in the low to mid 20s percentage range versus our prior guidance of low 20s percentage growth. We continue to expect that share repurchase activity under our 425 million authorization will contribute about two percentage points of earnings per share growth this year.","The other elements of our full-year guidance are unchanged. We are on track to open approximately 100 net new stores, all planned to be our 10,000 square foot prototype. We expect to open about 40 stores in Q3, and 25 stores in Q4. We are also executing 12 major remodels and two relocation. We plan to go e-commerce approximately 40%.","CapEx is on target to be about $390 million, driven by slightly higher capital for new store and the rollout of boutiques. As a reminder, we planned about $80 million for the boutique expansion and update with the rollout of over 500 Clinique, Lancome, and Benefit boutiques underway, as well as updates to our fragrance fixtures and the Ulta Beauty collection.","I'll now turn the call over to our conference call host for the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Joshua Siber","Good afternoon. It's Joshua Siber on for Simeon. I\u2019m curious where are you guys in the investment cycle relative to where you thought you would be when you laid out your five-year guidance two years ago?","Mary Dillon","I\u2019d say we\u2019re right on track with that. I mean, we describe that this year, last year and this year would be kind of the key years of investment relative to the new distribution centers in Greenwood and Dallas, all on track. Investing in new systems and capabilities all on track. So we\u2019re pretty much right on track with what we\u2019ve described.","Joshua Siber","Okay. And with respect to your consumer, how are you seeing the average age trend? Are you skewing younger with more social media mix of advertising?","Dave Kimbell","Sure. Hey, Josh, this is Dave Kimbell. Yes, we see strength really across all ages and demographics. We don\u2019t look specifically -- we certainly look at the way demographics, but we\u2019re actually more focused on psychographic around this beauty enthusiasts and we see that growth on all ages. Having said that, we\u2019re excited about strength with Millennials and teenagers, a lot of growth there and strong performance of our brand awareness growing there and we see continued growth in that space. So really growth across all ages and demographics right now.","Joshua Siber","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen","Hi. Congrats on solid results. We just had a general question regarding Amazon and your competitive advantages online in terms of what you\u2019re offering versus Amazon. And also as direct -- as brands go direct to consumer, it would be great to get a brief there? And what -- on the long-term for online, what are your thoughts on margins in the context of just the changing customer expectations as online continues to evolve? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Oliver. I will start and I will ask if Scott and Dave want to jump in so please do. Oliver, you know I guess I\u2019d just step back and say we compete as you know with a lot of players, both brick-and-mortar as well as online, but really nobody brings together everything that we do in one place. So I don't think so much about head-to-head competition in any one place, even though we certainly look very closely at the competitive environment. So our online offerings now represent everything we have in the store and more, pretty much everything we\u2019ve in store plus more we are starting to expand that. Our guests enjoy the online experience. We\u2019re improving that, the shipping timeframe everyday and certainly as she participates in buying products online at Ulta Beauty, she gets points in that. It is the whole loyalty program she loves. So the more she buys from us the more she gets points that then she can redeem anywhere in the store. So certainly we compete with Amazon in some ways in beauty. I\u2019d say we offer a great selection that our guests love. But of course as you know we also have a exceptional brick-and-mortar physical experience that our guests love and really the beauty enthusiasts that they\u2019ve described love to go in person and buy beauty and experience and of course get our services. So, I look at them as part of the mosaic of competition, and I think our proposition for our guests is really superior in total. In terms of margin on e-commerce, that\u2019s getting strong. I mean the big reason behind the investments that we\u2019ve done in our distribution centers is to really improve the efficiency and effectiveness of that part of our business and that\u2019s happening. I'd say the guest is happier with the speed of delivery and certainly the margins are improving.","Oliver Chen","Thanks. Thanks for the details on the investor day. Looking forward to it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steph Wissink from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Steph Wissink","Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Just a follow-up question Mary on your comments around the prestige brand boutique. I\u2019m wondering if you can give us a sense of once you rollout both boutiques and store, what\u2019s the mix between prestige and mass will look like? And then, Dave this is a follow-up to that. How are you thinking about marketing, the localization of some of those boutique rollouts and drawing on your customer traffic in those local market? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Steph. We don\u2019t really break out the exact mix, but in total the part of the really compelling aspect of our proposition to our guests, while we see the case of this assortment of categories and price point and so while the shift to prestige has been happening over several years and we\u2019re thrilled with the array of prestige brands that we\u2019ve that we\u2019re rolling out. I don\u2019t anticipate that mix to change dramatically relative to mass in the future. What\u2019s happening as we just have a great assortment of prestige brands to choose from and that's great and we love those brand partners. But again for our guests, it's very important that she always feel that she can come in and have that combination of categories and price points that she loves about Ulta Beauty.","Dave Kimbell","And as far as the target in localization, I'd say a couple of things. First of all, we\u2019re with the boutique brands, in particular, Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me, Benefit, Bare, those -- we\u2019re building boutiques at a fast pace. We are also expanding those brands Clinique and Lanc\u00f4me into every store to present some SKUs in every store. And that allows us to market the brand at a total Company level, national level, because every store will have some SKUs, both of those -- really all of those boutique brands. But we also tailor and target mobilize our communication through our CRM activity. Email is a big part of that. Our magazines will also customize based on location and those are close to a specific store with a boutique, we will customize that communication. At the same time, our national advertising marketing is really talking about the total Ulta Beauty, all things beauty, all in one place messaging.","Q - Steph Wissink\\","Thank you. Best of luck.","Dave Kimbell","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Kelly Halsor from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Kelly Halsor","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a great quarter. Just was wondering if you could dig in a little bit more on -- into the back half guidance. Should we look at the magnitude of the gross margin deleverage related to supply chain investments to be similar to what you saw in 3Q last year when you opened up the [Greenwood][ph] facility or are you kind of implying that maybe it\u2019s a little bit more considering you have Greenwood and Dallas both open now? And then, just secondly on the SG&A cadence, how should we think about SG&A in the back half of the year now that you will start to be lapping the advertising investments that you made in the back half of last year? Thank you.","Scott Settersten","Yes, so the deleverage on the supply chain is significant. Again, I don\u2019t want to be reconciling basis points quarter to quarter. But it's kind of in the general zip code, I would say, that what you saw in third quarter last year. Net-net I think for the third quarter gross profit is kind of flattish year-over-year when you add up all the puts and takes, because we are still going to get a sizable fix store costs, leverage benefit in the quarter, we are going to continue to expand merchandise margins like we have earlier in the year and so that will kind of cover up some of the hurt, I guess I would say from the deleverage and supply chain. I don\u2019t think most of the models include [indiscernible] the SG&A deleverage in the third quarter. It's much more significant than what most people are thinking. It's really a combination of the boutiques, the high water mark on the boutiques in the remodel programs and all the other things we have in process to drive growth for the business. So again, it's just a matter of sequence in the quarter. So a lot of it ends up in the third quarter this year. We\u2019ve got some consulting timing that we move from earlier year to the back half to help us plan for the future as well to help us frame out growth drivers that will help us next year and beyond. And then there is another store impairment charge coming in the third quarter that was just a fairly recent development as part of the heavy flooding down in Louisiana. So that's another roughly a $0.02 charge that was unexpected that we have to record in the third quarter. So that's really the combination of things. When I think about the rest of the year, then moving on to the fourth quarter, again supply chain we start to get some benefits there, so we expect to get leverage overall on some of those supply chain investments. SG&A then we get back into a normal cadence. The heavier sales volume in the fourth quarter, the upfront costs from some of those boutiques are behind us now and we get leverage SG&A in the fourth quarter. So, that\u2019s kind of how we end up full-year then with slight leverage coming from gross profit and slight deleverage on the SG&A line that gives us some all-in slight leverage for the year on operating margin.","Kelly Halsor","Okay, great. And if I could just squeeze in one more, very excited to see that you are introducing us a -- it continue to be a pretty premier brand, cosmetics brand. Any opportunity there in terms of boutique opportunities similar to what you\u2019re doing now with Clinique and Lancome?","Dave Kimbell","Yes, we are excited to be launching -- introducing Estee Lauder that launched online within the last week or so and then we will be rolling that out into 30 stores next month. So with that point, you'll kind of be able to see the presentation that will be different than where we have done some other brands, we're really excited about. We are particularly excited about it is really focus on the strongest most iconic elements of that line, parts like advanced night repair, Double Wear makeup, complementing it with things, the Perfectionist Serum, Extreme Lash and we can do -- we\u2019ve had a strong fragrance, Estee Lauder fragrance business for a while. So this will complement that very well. So we are going to watch it closely. It's one of the largest pursued brands in the world and so we're happy to have it in the store and we will learn and deliver to continue to expand that over time.","Kelly Halsor","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from David Schick from Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.","David Schick","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. With the continued success you\u2019ve seen in this country, how does it factor into thinking about the way you might attack other markets?","Mary Dillon","Well, first I will start with the fact that we have got a lot of great opportunity here in the U.S. We're going to continue to be able to drive growth, we think for many years and as we start to think about International, we are starting to frame and look at possibilities. There is nothing to announce, but certainly we are looking at where it might have make sense from a consumer environment, and a competitive environment overall business environment, and we will make some decisions if we move forward, we'll do that in a way that would be let's learn about it first, and then decided if we would go further. So, in the analysis phase I guess it's the best way to think about it right now.","David Schick","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","Dana Telsey","Good afternoon everyone and congratulations on the results. As you think about the new brands that you are adding to the mix, what's being taken out of the mix and as you look towards next year, what categories are rethinking about that you'd like to add to the mix and given the salon business and obviously now with the men's opportunity there, how do you see the growth of the salon business and the margin implication? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Yes, I\u2019m attacking this with Dave and maybe I will just start with the salon piece. I'm glad you notice that, yes, Brolayage is our [multiple speakers] I want to see people line up at appointment on this call, but it's just with the creativity of our artistic team that really invented that idea of Brolayage for guys anyway. But I'm really -- our salon in overall services business are really critical part of our strategic imperatives going forward, right. So we have got hair services, skin services, and brow services and still in many ways quite small, but performing really well. I mean an industry in hair that\u2019s flattish, we\u2019re gaining market share and we\u2019re growing. So we see that as an area that we'll think-- we are working on just how do you think about continuing to drive that as a growth lever, attractive driver, bringing in new guests. I\u2019m sure you know that when a guest becomes a salon guest, she or he become one of our best guests, because they come frequently and they spend 2.5 times the amount of non-salon users. So more to come on that and we think it's going to provide not only growth, but also the ability to really position us a beauty authority for many years to come. On categories, [multiple speakers].","Dave Kimbell","Yes, as far as assortments and managing that and looking at new brands, certainly as we add many other great new brands that we have talked about and that Mary mentioned, that does mean in many cases that we have to make room for that. And so really a focused approach on looking at sales and gross margin per square foot, Inventory turn, a bunch of metrics that really look for the most profitable usage of our space, but also focused on elements that are really delivering against our core proposition of all things beauty, all in one place. And so when we look at adding new brands, makeup is the fastest-growing part of the beauty business and certainly it\u2019s within our portfolio. So continue to see makeup brands for sure, but we want to make sure that we're really focused on understanding how her needs are evolving and we are bringing innovation across all elements, both mass and prestige. We have a lot of innovation, great exciting innovation in fragrance, we have got Jessica Parker's fragrance coming out on Sunday, that's I think it's going to be great. So a lot of innovation continued in fragrance. Skincare is an area that had its ups and downs, so we see growth and potential within that and then certainly hair care and connected to our salon, it's a big, very important part of our business. The styling part, liquids, shampoos, conditioners, tools, our professional tools areas, personal tools area, so we'll continue to innovate across all parts of the store and optimize our assortments as we go forward.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","Our expressing comes from Mark Alswager from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark Alswager","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and great quarter. Can you talk while little bit more about your partnership with analysis data in the private-label credit program. Just first, how should we be thinking about any revenue sharing or P&L implications over time. And then, you\u2019ve already had a lot of success with your loyalty program obviously and the CRM initiatives, but how do you see that evolving as you start to leveraged the ADA's capabilities on that front? Thanks.","Mary Dillon","Great. Thank you -- thanks for asking about that. I just want to give a little plug. I'm really proud about our team having really worked this for over a year and it's a very cross functional effort as you can imagine to prepare organization to launch something like this and we are off to a strong start. And the good news is we based it first and foremost on guests insight which is our guests are very interested in this program, because it gives them the opportunity to just -- to get more points at Ulta Beauty, but also for us obviously its creating more loyalty, more increasing per share of wallet going to us. So, that's all great and we're not going to get into parsing apart all the details of the deal. ADS is a great partner. I'll say they manage the program for us and take the credit risk, so that's great and more to come. So our CRM team is really the folks who really own this project and you could imagine they have a lot of ideas about how to leverage is going forward to drive growth. So more to come on that and we feel good about where we are.","Mark Alswager","Okay. Thanks again.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Ike Boruchow","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one. I guess, Mary, you talk about your replenishment business being fairly small today. I was just curious how big is it Firenze and can do how do you view that part of the business longer-term? Is it a key focus for you or is it just -- are refocused on other parts of the business in terms of incremental growth from here?","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Ike. Well, the good news is that everything we sell almost everything we sell is highly replenishable. But the great news is that our guest a beauty enthusiast is really not interested in just the same product every time. There is categories that she will need to replenish when she is out, there might be a couple of items which she is quite attached too, but I will tell you for the most part our guests are really coming in and loving to try new products. She loves trends, she loves newness, she loves great new product that are launched by our brand partners. So what we are finding is that very little of the business is one-for-one replenishment. And if that becomes bigger, perhaps in the future, we always looking at that to see if there is a way we can make it even easier for her. But what she seems to be responding to is the breadth of innovation and newness and if you look at for example our e-commerce guests, the guest will shop online and in-store, again some of our best guests they spend significantly more than somebody who is not buying online and what's she tending to buy is a response to things that we\u2019re bringing to her attention via email. So it's usually new products or exclusives or new trends.. So again, I don\u2019t have anything against replenishment, l love the fact that we're replenishing our products a lot, but the one-for-one piece is something that -- it's not a big part of the business.","Ike Boruchow","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gere from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jason Gere","Okay. Thanks. I guess residents. The first one did you say what your loyalty card membership growth was in the quarter and I just wondering as this continues to rise like how do you think about what the potential penetration can be? And on that point, what was a transaction size for loyalty card members versus non-loyalty card in the quarter?","Dave Kimbell","Yes, we -- so our loyalty program did exceed that $20 million -- 20 million member mark to 20.6 million active members that\u2019s a 27% growth rate. So we're really pleased with that. That's very strong. We've had very strong growth with that, and that will we think continue and we\u2019re really happy with our new members. It's actually been a strong kind of lot of new members that are coming in, getting engaged with our program, understanding the benefits of the program. We will also be able to then talk to them about new elements like the credit card. So clearly a big driver for us going forward. The second part of your question was around \u2026","Mary Dillon","The basket for the loyalty guests. It basically represents what we quoted in our prepared remarks, Jason. So, I mean, again the loyalty program is more than 80% of total sales. And so when we are looking at those kind of metrics, that's basically what represent.","Jason Gere","Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess the other question was, just given where the stock price is right now. Howdy guys internally think about maybe splitting your stock at this point. The only reason I say that is a big part of your story is kind of reaching out to that little customer and if the stock was let's just say, under hundred dollar maybe you will get more of your retail customers actually becoming shareholders as well?","Mary Dillon","Yes, that something that we kicked around from time-to-time with our Board of Directors, again the about all options right on, being as shareholder friendly as we can't be whether its capital allocations or things like stock split. So surprisingly I have only gotten this question maybe two times in the three plus years I\u2019ve been here at -- been at the annual shareholder meeting, right. So it's usually a local retail holder that would ask that kind of question. So generally speaking, most of our shares are hold my big large investment funds and hostels and most of those folks aren't that interested based on our Q&A with them about entertaining a stock split. So it's nothing that\u2019s on the front burner, but of course it's something we will always be ready to consider.","Jason Gere","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Please go ahead. I\u2019m sorry, Mark. Do you have a question to ask [indiscernible]?","Mark Astrachan","Sorry, can you hear me now? Hello.","Mary Dillon","We can.","Mark Astrachan","Perfect. Great. Sorry about that and good afternoon everyone. Wanted to ask about thoughts on the sustainability of cosmetics growth given the contribution to comp, and how do you weigh newer smallish brands versus those from larger companies like Estee that you talked about and L'Oreal who are likely increasingly eager to work with you, considering trends in other channels like department stores?","Mary Dillon","Yes, well let me start by saying, as a category beauty has being growing for multiple years. It\u2019s strong. It's up last quarter. It was up 5%, prestige was up higher than mass, but all growing as you said makeup growing, the lead in terms of growth skin care, every category we saw growth last quarter. So the good news is, we are in a category that\u2019s growing as we look at consumer trends going forward and Dave touched on this, but younger women, Millennials, Hispanic women, fastest growing segment of our population, there is a propensity we think for the beauty category for all those folks to continue to play a very important role in -- for overall spend of her money and how she spends her time. So that\u2019s all good. And the great thing is that innovation comes from companies large and small. That\u2019s probably the most exciting consumer category, I think that exists, because innovation comes from many different sources and we positioned ourselves to hopefully be a great partner for brands to do business with and we offer this variety of products categories and price points. So I think that also helps to sort of insulate us as the sub categories go up and down and Dave talked a little bit about those categories, we\u2019re trying to look out multiple years, thinking where do we place our best. But knowing that really innovation is coming from all -- many sources and we think the foundation of growth is there for us.","Mark Astrachan","Got it. Great. And just one follow-up. In the next quarter from a guidance standpoint, it looks like the two-year CAGR and even for the balance of the year back half gets a little stronger relative to Q2 trends. Is there anything in the timing, Scott, that may influence the rate of growth in comps in second quarter versus third quarter, fourth quarter?","Scott Settersten","It gets a little -- you look at quarters and you try to stack them together. We look at the single to double, the triple stack, every way you can look at the comp. There is nothing extraordinary that sticks out in any one, I mean, each quarter is kind of a unique set of opportunities and challenges, I would say. Generally speaking, the back half of the year we just feel really great about the boutiques, right. The tail wind we\u2019re going to get from that finally all being installed, there is a great pipeline of newness coming and we believe we got a great stack ready to go for holiday, both on the assortment and the way we\u2019ve our stores set up and our gift card program, so we are very bullish on the back half of the year.","Mark Astrachan","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Tunick from Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Brian Tunick","All right. Congrats to everyone. I guess on the boutiques first, just thinking about the free cash flow going forward, I think you are earmarking $80 million this year for the boutiques, on the CapEx side. Should we be viewing that as a one-time number, or maybe that\u2019s a peak number? And then the second question is, on your stated store targets and I know you will update us at the analyst day, but I guess if there is more department store closings coming or you guys think your e-com penetration can get to a certain level, how does that inform ultimately what you think the right size of the North America store base can be?","Mary Dillon","Okay. Well, I will start with the store piece first and certainly this we will talk more about in October. I think the dynamics that have been happening for some periods of time in terms of how people shop for beauty. So that\u2019s not new to us. It's encouraging to us as we look at the -- how our stores are performing today, the store classes getting stronger, even after this many years of being in business, that\u2019s really encouraging, and we think that everything that surrounds how we\u2019re doing business driving awareness, getting the great products and services all enhancing that. So I feel good about that. We had a -- we think that our 10,000 square foot store has plenty of growth ahead. We are also looking at smaller market, urban or suburban downtown type format. So all those things we feel given frankly the fact that really have a 5% share of this really enthusiastic beauty shopper provides us plenty of runway for growth. So, we will talk more about this, but we certainly have done a lot of work and analysis and feel confident that we can drive market share growth frankly both to a comp store growth as well as new stores.","Scott Settersten","And as far as that CapEx related to boutiques, again I just want to remind folks that the boutiques were always in the plan back at 2014 where we rolled up the five-year financial target. There was an assumption in there for boutiques, over those five years. We just accelerated that, so we\u2019re kind of pull this forward. '16 a big step up, roughly $80 million as we mentioned that will repeat next year in the 2017. So we are kind of viewing it as a two-year kind of cycle and at that point we will have again those two great brands in the majority of our comp stores and then it will be just about new store build up from that point.","Brian Tunick","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Joseph Altobello from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Christina on for Joe. I was wondering if you could talk about the rollout of Honest Beauty this past quarter?","Dave Kimbell","Sure. Yes, we\u2019re really pleased with it. It\u2019s a great brand of course from Jessica Alba's Company, and it off to a great start. I mean, it\u2019s part of a Honest -- the Honest company has been a leader in broader trend around natural and it's great to bring that to the beauty segment. There is other brands that have been in that space for a while with us and we\u2019re seeing a lot of growth across the area, but really pleased with that and think it will be continue to drive nice growth for us coming forward.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks. Good evening. Mary, gave us a little taste of what you plan on talking about at the Analyst Day, and so I wanted to follow-up on one of your comments. You mentioned getting to the mid-teens operating margin by 2019, and of course we would like to parse words, and that buy stands out to this -- stands out to us. So does this imply that your original mid-teens forecast could be reached prior to 2019, because clearly the comps have exceeded expectations or does perhaps that long-term operating margin target see some upside?","Mary Dillon","Yes, talk about parsing. I like that. We are not going to get into details on that today, except to say we feel confident about reaching the target that we set out back a couple of years ago and frankly had a much bigger scale of business today, with a lot more complexity. So I stand by that description.","Christopher Horvers","Okay. We are Lip Happy here, so we like to \u2026","Mary Dillon","Okay. Hash tag we\u2019ve probably lip [multiple speakers]. Thank you.","Christopher Horvers","So then, since I didn\u2019t get that one, can you talk about your in-stock rates, how they are improving at the store level, how they are improving online, and contributing to the comp growth? You mentioned that the two DCs are about 70% -- two new DCs are about 70% of the volume. Is the rest from the vendor and does that percentage go up over time?","Scott Settersten","So with the e-commerce, just to be clear, so we service e-commerce at a four buildings today. So Chambersburg out East, Romeoville here locally in Chicago, and then the two new Greenwood and Dallas. So again nothing is coming direct from the vendor, so we\u2019re doing all that. The new buildings are just much more efficient, right. They\u2019re designed to actually do e-commerce, pick and fill and ship processes, unlike the older buildings, which were retrofitted and not quite as efficient. So we\u2019re happy to see that and we\u2019re showing the benefit show up in the P&L as currently and as we think about the future, so we\u2019re very excited about that. As far as in-stock rates overall, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve had kind of priority number one. We think about the guest experience in our stores and again that\u2019s part and parcel of all the investments that we\u2019ve been talking about for the last couple of years whether its distribution centers to help the throughput there, capacity and capability overall, but also we\u2019re doing a lot of the work behind the scenes with merchandised planning tools, SWIFT we talked about. Master data, managing that better. Floor planning and space planning kind of tools are going online, as well as to help with in-stocks overall. And then our team internally here, there is a lot of individual projects, and look sees going on around how we can do a better job, just making sure we go extra heavy on A and B SKUs, so we don\u2019t disappoint folks and how can we be more effective with some of the C,D, and F SKUs right in the stores and how we better align ourselves on that. So all oars are in the water when it comes to in-stocks and inventory productivity across the enterprise.","Christopher Horvers","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Erica Eiler","Good afternoon. It's actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks for taking our question. So clearly another strong quarter from your team, and your results continue to stand out. But we\u2019re seeing a mixed consumer backdrop out there. Is there anything that you're seeing from a consumer or even a geographical perspective that concerns you at all?","Mary Dillon","Well, we\u2019re not complacent about our results. So I will say that, but I will tell you that as we look at, our results have been pretty consistent, I would say across regions, period-to-period, pretty consistent. So then you just saw the kind of comps we deliver, so we\u2019re seeing that a strong consumer sentiment right and I think it's because we continue to benefit from the fact that we are in a category that\u2019s important to our guests and as I mentioned this earlier, it's replenishable, it's affordable indulgence and beauty is popular right now in many ways in terms of culture and social media. So you combine that with being in a range of categories and price point. So even somebody is a little bit more pinched, you can also get great product at a lower price from us and in partnership with our brand partners we are continuing to excite her with newness. So I feel like our results would say that there are certain pockets of consumer spending that are quite strong and obviously we see that macro for the category of beauty as well. But we will just continue to watch it closely.","Erica Eiler","Great. Thanks for all of the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Omar Saad","Thank you. Good afternoon. Nice quarter. I actually wanted to follow-up on one of your earlier questions about the potential for category expansions in the future, and maybe ask more specifically about bath and home, and those types of related products, scents and soaps, if those are categories that you would look to going into I think, perhaps in a very nice overlap with the customer base and with all things beauty, as well.","Dave Kimbell","Yes, yes. I would start by saying that we\u2019re always looking across every element of the beauty space to find growth and we\u2019re listening to our guests and finding opportunities in the -- our focus is on continuing to drive a lot of innovation and those most important biggest categories that we have, makeup, hairs, skincare, fragrance, nail is important. But we\u2019re seeing some nice growth in additional categories one of which you mentioned bath and body space is one that is a nice category. Obviously not anywhere near as big for us as something like makeup. But we do see growth potential and we\u2019ve added some new brands into that space, Fizz & Bubble, Soap & Glory, among others and we\u2019ve got some great business the exclusive distribution of the Body Shop outside of their own shops is an example and so it's not huge for that total bath and body space isn't enormous for us, but that\u2019s an example of what you\u2019re talking about, we do see potential growth to continue to add to that and make sure that we\u2019re delivering against what our guests is looking for. So we will look across all different avenues in addition to the big ones that were driving growth on today.","Omar Saad","And then, while we\u2019re on the topic of the product offering, I\u2019ve heard you mention a couple times now in the last few quarters, prestige and mass. The areas of strength, almost a bit of a bar bell, high low. Are you evolving? Do you see yourself evolving the offering and the density of the price points around the high low strategy, or is this be a little bit more of a transitory effect?","Dave Kimbell","Well, I make sure I understand your question, but the mass and prestige has been part of our business and is part of the original insight the Company was founded on and certainly it\u2019s a critical part, key part of our strategy today. We\u2019ve grown our prestige business pretty quickly over the last several years as we\u2019ve added a number of brands, but we\u2019ve also been focused on growing that. So the key part what our guests really responds to us is this idea of mass and prestige, because that\u2019s -- while she shops, that\u2019s how when you look at products that she had at home. Most women don\u2019t have either prestige or either mass only, they have both. So providing both to her is a key part of our strategy. We will never kind of shift away from that. We want to see growth on both sides, because that\u2019s what our guests wants and so we\u2019re investing heavily in the experience, as well as bringing in new brands in innovation across both sides, the range of price points that we think is what our customers really want.","Omar Saad","I understand. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel from Nomura. Please go ahead.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Hi, guys and congrats. Any way to quantify what portion of the transaction growth came from new customers versus greater frequency of visits? And just sorry if I should already know this, but when you open-up new prestige boutiques, the general rules of profits [ph] is regarding geographically clustering those brands or just spreading them out, and if they are clustered, any color on how the existing boutiques have done after the new openings? Thanks.","Dave Kimbell","On the customers, I don\u2019t think we kind of broken out that level of detail. What I would say is there is kind of a few key elements that are driving our total customer growth. Retention is strong and healthy and as we look across as we understand loyalty programs not necessarily just in beauty, but loyalty programs, we think we\u2019re in a very healthy probably it\u2019s a leading level of retention. So that\u2019s key and strong and we will continue to be. Reactivation, we talked about in the past and that also was strong in the second quarter which is essentially those that had not shopped, that had been members of our program, but had not shopped with us in the last year through some elements, our expanded marketing, advertising, new store openings perhaps we will get them in and driving that. But new -- totally new guests is absolutely still big growth driver of getting that -- attracting new guests across the country both obviously new stores, but existing stores bringing her in is a key part to our growth. So those three things are what\u2019s driving that growth. And then boutiques was -- I don\u2019t know if I fully understood the question about \u2026","Scott Settersten","The location.","Dave Kimbell","Looking where we\u2019re locating, it's really across the country. So yes, across the country, we\u2019re looking at really stores as we continue to add these 500 boutiques, we\u2019re seeing success in big market, small markets, all different regions of the country. We will continue to expand as Scott said, probably next year we will be in a large percentage of our total chain, so thereby being in most stores across the country.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Best of luck for the rest of the year.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019d now like to turn the floor over to Ms. Dillon for any closing comments.","Mary Dillon","Thank you. I just want to thank everybody for your interest in Ulta Beauty and we look forward to seeing you in a few weeks at our Analyst Day.

Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to announce very strong third quarter results. Ulta continues to drive significant market share gains across all of our categories as we delivered 22.4% top line growth. ","Same-store sales increased 8.4% maintaining solid top line momentum [wrapping] a 9.6% comp in Q3 2011 and a 12.2% comp in 2010. We expanded gross margin and leveraged SG&A more than expected driving operating margin up 140 basis points from 10.7% in Q3 of last year to 12.1% this year. ","Earnings grew 40% to $0.59 per share. These excellent results position us to deliver sales and earnings performance for the full year well above our initial expectations. At the beginning of the year, we expected to see same-store sales at or slightly above 5% and to achieve earnings per share growth of approximately 30%. We now expect to achieve about 8% comp growth and about 40% earnings growth for 2012 assuming we achieve the midpoint of our Q4 guidance. ","We delivered these numbers through our team\u2019s disciplined focus on the five components of our multi-year growth strategy accelerating store growth, introducing new product, services and brands, enhancing our loyalty program, broadening our marketing reach and increasing our digital focus including ulta.com. ","Our consistent execution of these strategies continues to drive meaningful market share gains in the beauty industry across all of our major product categories. I would like to recap a couple of our accomplishments in each of these five areas during the third quarter and touch on what to head for the fourth quarter. ","First, store growth; in Q3, we opened 49 new stores representing about 10% of our store base, which is a record number of new store openings for us in a tremendous accomplishment in a single quarter. We ended Q3 with 537 stores in 45 states. New store productivity continues to be very strong with the class of 2012 stores consistently outperforming their targets. ","So we're very pleased with the quality of real estate we added to the portfolio and proud of the Ulta team\u2019s execution in getting new stores open. We also completed 11 remodels during the third quarter and also are happy with their performance, with about 90% of the chain opened or remodeled to our most recent store formats, we've done a nice job keeping the portfolio updated in the shopping environment and experience very consistent throughout the chain.","In the first month of the fourth quarter, we opened 13 additional stores successfully completing our 2012 new store program. With these, we will end the year with 550 stores for 23% square footage increase for the year.","As we've said many times, our real estate expansion is predicated on finding great financially attractive sites. Simply put, we will not sacrifice quality for quantity. We do however have strong financial and operational capabilities that allow us to accelerate store growth if we believe the right opportunities exist.","Looking ahead to 2013, that opportunity does exist and we expect next year to be another year where we can exceed our long-term goal of 15% to 20% square footage growth. ","Most specifically, we're currently planning to open approximately 125 new stores in 2013 or about 22% square footage growth. This program will look a lot like 2012 or 2012 plan in terms of opening stores primarily located in suburban shopping centers with roughly 80% of the stores in existing centers as opposed to new shopping center development. We are confident that we have the resources and expertise to execute this aggressive new store program successfully without relaxing our high standards for the quality of the real estate, yet maintaining our high standards for store staffing and training.","Our second key growth strategy is adding new products, services and brands. Newness has been and will remain a key driver of our growth. We continue to see a strong pipeline of innovation in the beauty market. We are also benefitting from the introduction of new brands as well as new product lines within existing brands into our assortment. ","In terms of brands, we launched in Q3 new skincare lines from Vichy and La Roche Posay which rolled out to all stores and we expanded our exclusive CK One cosmetics line to 178 stores during the quarter. We also launched Chroma cosmetics from the Kardashians in the skincare brand Nip & Fab on the mask side of our offering.","To update you on the expansion of Clinique and Lancome boutiques which we have announced previously, our teams completed all of the 50 additional Lancome boutiques by the close of the third quarter ending Q3 with a total of 79 Lancome doors. ","We completed 29 additional Clinique boutiques bringing the total to 42 doors at the end of Q3. We just opened an additional Clinique boutique early in Q4 and have and have another five planned for early in the new fiscal year. ","Execution by the team on all aspects of the implementation from texturing to recruiting to training was exceptional and we are very pleased to have the vast majority of these new boutiques ready to go before the holiday season. We view these iconic brands as a great addition to our prestige skincare and cosmetics offering. As with any of new initiative these boutiques will take time to ramp up and we expect that they will be long-term positive impacts on our guest experience. ","During the third quarter, trends in anti-aging, mascara, lipstick and foundations continue to be strong. Several brands foundation launch has performed especially well including bareMinerals READY foundation, Urban Decay\u2019s Naked Skin and Stila Stay All Day Foundation. The skincare category overall also saw a good growth and our guests remained very interested in the high-tech beauty tools category for at home microdermabrasion, acne and wrinkle treatment and hair removal.","Clarisonic continue to outperform with new colors and special additions for men and acne treatment reaching new customers segments. In terms of new brands for Q4, we will launch a new chemical and [clotty] free line of body care products when the brand Nourish. This certified organic brand expands our assortment of organic products that our guests are increasingly asking for. We will also add some exclusive Ulta products from existing brands we carry, for example Amp2, an instant volume texturizer from the brand Living Proof will be exclusively available at Ulta for several months.","Living Proof is currently in the limelight with the recent news that Jennifer Aniston became the spokesperson and face of the brand. In the hair appliance category, we are introducing an exclusive Ulta version of the GHD luxury flat iron; the number one selling flat iron in Europe and the new assortment of Ulta G here tools is doing exclusive holiday patterns.","In prestige cosmetics some of the new products were exited about include the Vice eye shadow palette from Urban Decay in a special bareMinerals kit exclusive to Ulta which commemorates Ultas 10 year partnership with bareMinerals. In the nail category, OPIs latest nail polish collection, [Skyfall] recently launched and has been opt to a strong start\u2026","9-13","14-18","\u2026slightly. Gross profit dollars increased 24% to $185 million with gross profit margin up 60 basis points to 36.7%. Roughly half of the improvement was driven by better merchandise margins with the remainder attributed to leverage in fixed costs on our strong comp. ","As planned, fixed or leverage was lower than what we achieved earlier in the year due to the large number of stores we opened in the last two quarters. 22 in Q2 and 49 in Q3 this year compared to 21 in Q2 and 28 in Q3 last year. The Northeast DC continues to perform well. We expect to see a slight benefit from our improved network during the fourth quarter in a more meaningful benefit to margins in 2013. ","SG&A expenses increased to 16.8% to $118 million, down 120 basis points as a rate of sales to 23.3%. We leveraged operating expenses on a strong comp and consistent cross disciplines. Preopening expense increased in line with our accelerated store opening program at $6.3 million compared to $4 million last year as we opened a record 49 new stores, remodeled 11 stores and relocated one store in the third quarter compared to 28 new stores, one relocation and no remodels during the third quarter of 2011. ","All in, operating margin improved by 140 basis points to 12.1% versus 10.7% in Q3 of last year as we continue to deliver strong operating execution and remain focused on cost management. Our tax rate was 37.7% versus 39.2% in last year\u2019s third quarter. The improvement in the rate was driven primarily by stock option exercises and was worth about a penny of earnings per share for the quarter. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 38.6% for the full year. ","Net income increased 42.5% to $38.2 million or $0.59 per diluted shares versus $26.8 million or $0.42 per diluted share in last year\u2019s third quarter. ","Now taking a look at the balance sheet, merchandise inventories at the end of the quarter were $462.8 million compared to $354.9 million at the end of the third quarter last year, up roughly 30% in dialers and 7.3% on a per store basis. The increase is primarily due to the 95 net new stores we opened in the past year along with our normal holiday build. The increase also reflects incremental inventory related to the 79 prestige brand boutiques which were added in Q3 as well as strategic inventory investment in core high turn skews to ensure we support strong stock levels throughout the holiday season and into the New Year. ","We will make additional investments in inventory through the fourth quarter which we believe is a good use of cash and helps our business long-term. As a result of the additional inventory investment, you should expect to see our average inventory per store to increase year-over-year in the low double digits as of the end of Q4. We would characterize this as a one-time increase that equalizes the average inventory per store levels quarter-to-quarter. ","I would also note that the basic items we are investing in do not add any obsolescence risk. Looking ahead to 2013, we expect per store inventories to grow at a lower rate than our comp sales absent any major new brand additions. The additional inventory investments that we are making do not have a significant impact on our new store model. ","Capital expenditure for the third quarter were $76.7 million compared to $45 million for the same period last year, mainly driven by our accelerated store opening program. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $22.2 million.","Turning to our outlook for Q4, it\u2019s still early in the holiday season and somewhat challenging to forecast the mood of the customer. That said, we feel very good about our plan, the amount of newness we're offering our guests and our team\u2019s execution. We were very pleased with our Black Friday weekend and our Cyber Monday sales, with both events achieving record sales performance. ","So with all that as a back drop, we estimate Q4 sales will be in the range of $742 million to $754 million, versus $582.5 million last year. This includes the impact of the 53rd week this year worth about $35 million in sales.","We anticipate that comp store sales will increase in the range of 5% to 7%, on top of the 11.5% comp we achieved in Q4 of last year. Our guidance includes the disruption we experienced from Hurricane Sandy, which impacted almost 20% of the chain with many stores closed for multiple days.","As we do every year, we plan to announce our holiday sales on January 4, to provide you a view of our six week holiday selling season. We expect our fourth quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.96 to $0.98 compared to EPS of $0.73 in Q4 of 2011. ","Our expectations for Q4 include the positive impact of the extra week in the quarter, which we estimate will contribute approximately $0.04 of earnings per share. Gross profit margin is expected to increase approximately 30 basis points at the midpoint of the guidance range, driven by improvement in merchandise margin and leverage of fixed door expenses. ","SG&A rate is expected to decrease around 90 basis points at the midpoint of the range versus the last year\u2019s rate of 21.3%. Preopening expenses are expected to be approximately $2 million up $1 million compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter driven by the acceleration of our new store program. This increase in preopening expense will negatively impact operating margin by about 10 basis points in the quarter.","All in, operating margin is expected to increase approximately 100 basis points at the midpoint of the range. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 38.6% and we anticipate the fully diluted share count to be about $64.8 million. To recap the full year, we expect to significantly outperform our original sales and earnings expectations. ","Sales are expected to exceed $2.2 billion more than 24% growth compared to 2011. We are raising our guidance for earnings per share for the full year to a range of $2.64 to $2.66 representing approximately 40% growth. This is well above our long-term goal and our expectations at the beginning of the year of achieving 30% EPS growth despite the roughly $0.07 negative impact from our accelerated new store program, the new [DC] and the addition of prestige brand boutiques.","Total preopening expense for the year is expected to be $15 million compared to $10 million in fiscal 2011, negatively impacting earnings per share this year by about $0.05 per share. ","Capital expenditures for the full year 2012 are expected to be approximately $180 million about $51 million higher than our capital expenditure program in 2011 driven by the acceleration of our new store program, store remodels and the expansion of prestige brand boutiques. ","Depreciation and amortization are expected to be approximately $90 million. We expect to generate strong free cash flow for the year and we will continue to evaluate with our board the best use of any access cash. ","To wrap up, Ulta is well positioned to drive robust sales and profit growth well into the future. All the contributors to our success that we have been discussing with you have tremendous multi-year potential.","We are highly confident in our store build out plans, the quality of our real estate and the sustainability of the maturation curve of our new stores. We expect to continue to offer newness to our guests in terms of products, brands and services. We have significant opportunities to drive benefits from our supply chain, from our marketing and CRM investments and from increasing our digital capabilities.","We remained very confident in delivering our long-term financial model based on 3% to 5% comps, 15% to 20% annual square footage growth, 25% to 30% earnings growth and targeting a mid-teens operating margin in the next few years. ","With that, I will turn the call back over to Chuck.","Chuck Rubin","Thanks, Scott. Before we start the Q&A session, I would like to thank our 15,000 associates for all they do to make Ulta a winning formula that is rapidly gaining market share in the beauty industry. Our team always works hard but I would like to recognize in particular all the efforts of our field teams and our corporate associates to prepare for and then to recover from historic storm impacting the East Coast just a month ago.","We thank them for all they did to take care of each other, take care of our guests. I am always very proud of this team but never more so than one seeing that commitment and Engagement to over come this challenge. Now let's turn the call back to the operator to open up for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Brian Tunick from JPMorgan.","Brian Tunick - JPMorgan","Thanks, congrats everyone for a great quarter. I guess, Chuck I know it's a late holiday this year and people might be a little behind the eight ball given what they have said about to November comps out there but just curious of your view of the overall promotional environment, either from what you're seeing on the department store side or on the drug store side?","And then the second question is you talked about a 1200 store target long term, you're obviously accelerating that here but what's the thought between how much of that has to come from existing or reconfigured real estate versus when are we going to need to see new store development begin to ramp up. Thanks very much.","Chuck Rubin","Hey Brian, let's take the second one first. I think that clearly for the 1200 stores there is going to be a need for new construction. Obviously with our announcement today we feel really good about 2013 and most of those stores are existing real estate. You know the pipeline into 2014 believe it or not we've already approved some sites for that year. It's a little early to look at it at that point but there are some seeds of new development starting to show up and we do have high hopes that the real estate market does start to show some new development as you move into the out years. But clearly to get to the 1200 we will need some new development but we do think that that will start to materialize.","In terms of your first question on the promotional environment there does seem to be a wide range of activity, in retail today and it goes beyond the beauty market. You know clearly our performance this quarter continued to gain market share, so the customer continues to vote that they like what we do.","We're well positioned in our strategy for the fourth quarter between the breadth of our offering everything from mass to prestige, from cosmetic to skin care to hair care across price points using our loyalty program we are well positioned to add value to the customer and we are seeing that she is shopping for value as Scott mentioned in our prepared comments our Black Friday weekend and Cyber Monday were terrific. They were very big and but she was looking for value but we have a very sound offering to be able to cater to that using some of the things we talked about in the script.","Brian Tunick - JPMorgan","Fantastic, thanks so much.","Chuck Rubin","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Thanks a lot, and good afternoon, congratulations on your performance.","Chuck Rubin","Hey, Matt.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","I want to talk for a moment about gross margin. First of all if you look at the fixed leverage that you've generated it was on the lower end of what you typically have been doing with a pretty good comps, so how much of that was absorbing issues like Chambersburg and the [Prestige] investment and perhaps offsetting what would have been better natural leverage on occupancy given the comp that you put up?","Scott Settersten","Yeah, Matt the leverage that you're referring to I agree it's a little bit unexpected but the drivers that were additional labor that we push through the supply chain and other additional costs that were related to these inventory investments that we made during the third quarter.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","And to the extent that labor shows up in gross margin, would that happen kind of in the DCs.","Scott Settersten","Exactly. A little bit deleverage in the DCs.","Chuck Rubin","And again as Scott mentioned earlier, don't forget the number of stores that we've opened, we had a record number of stores in the third quarter. So that had a little bit of a drag on us as well on not being able to leverage as high in this fixed store expense.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Understood, and then Scott, just to clarify, the gross margin expansion you talked about for Q4, I want to make (inaudible) was that 30 basis points?","Scott Settersten","That's right. 30 basis points at the midpoint of the range.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","So, if you think about that relative to the trend in recent quarters, that would be a bit lower as well. So can you talk about, understanding your guidance is from time to time proven conservative, if you look at the components of the budget to take you to that level, how should we think about?","Scott Settersten","Well, we're thinking about, the hurdles that we're jumping over from last year, you have to remember that the comp last year was significantly higher. It was 11 plus percent for the quarter and a 12% plus during that very important six-week holiday selling season. So as we look at it year-over-year, we see that merchandize margin relatively flattish and a little bit of pressure on the fixed store leverage because of the large number of new stores that we just put in place over the last two quarters.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","And does the extra week helped that at all or is that kind of a non-event for?","Scott Settersten","It's really a non-event.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thank you so much guys.","Chuck Rubin","Hey, Matt, I would just add, keep in mind on the merchandize margin that in the last, roughly two years, we've added close to a couple of 100 basis points on the merchandize margin and what we've said is long-term, there's opportunity both on SG&A as well as on the margin side of the equation they won't always be equal they'll vary between the two of them quarter-by-quarter but on the long-term we think that they do somewhat mirror themselves, they'll be about equal in their contribution or overall operating margin.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Understood. Thank you.","","Chuck Rubin","Thanks, Matt.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Altobello from Oppenheimer.","","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer","Thanks, good afternoon guys. Just first quick housekeeping question you mentioned Sandy what was the impact on comps this quarter and what are you expecting to be the impact on comps in the fourth quarter?","","Chuck Rubin","The impact that we envisioned in the fourth quarter was included in the guidance that we gave at five to seven. It's tough to be very specific about that Joe because you clearly have the impact of when stores were closed and we had close to 20% of the store base that was affected and closed, but from either a day or two to a number of days but then you have the after effect once the stores back open it still takes a little bit of a recovery time to get back in the business and for those stores we weren't the first thing that people affected by Sandy were going out to purchase. So to our best guess from what we have seen thus far we think that this is going to impact the quarter up to a 100 basis points 50 to 75 up to 100 basis points.","","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer","This for the fourth quarter.","","Chuck Rubin","Yes.","","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer","Okay. And then just switching gears to the real estate opportunity obviously next year you're looking to do another 23% square footage growth what's driving that opportunity is it just more real estate coming your way, more centers being built and then secondly how are you guys handling that internally, because you added 100 doors or so this year and 125 next year and the numbers are getting pretty big, so are you guys adding - adding people or how you're adding capabilities to keep up with that opportunity?","Chuck Rubin","Yes, we've added people obviously, you can't grow a retail chain without adding people to it. We've added obviously the people in the stores but we have more construction people, we have more store set people, we do have more inventory people.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer","On the real estate side, Chuck, sorry.","Chuck Rubin","Sorry?","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer","On the real estate side, sorry about that?","Chuck Rubin","On the real estate side, the team is the little bit larger but not extensively the real estate team can flex with some good flexibility because you do use other third parties to help find sites, there's a broker community that we leverage extensively. I've talked before that our real estate group is a very strong part of our company, our real estate and construction teams and store set teams. So we've got very, very strong capabilities on this and clearly as we've ramped the store count, we've have added additional people to help get that executed, but the core team, the core leadership team of our store set teams, construction the real estate teams, the deal makers it's just a very strong core group of people.","To your question, the first part of your question, I think we said in our comments that about 80% of the chain, 80% of the stores rather for 2013 our existing real estate. So there are seeds of new development but its not a heavy influence into next year and talked about this publicly a number of times, our team is very creative in going out and find opportunities for stores, we still have tremendous wide space in the country for stores to go in. And the fact that we have become much larger and more successful, we are very attractive tenant for landlords, so you put all of that together and that's what has allowed us to find these opportunities and clearly as evidenced even by these results for the third quarter, these new stores are performing very well and it is part of our DNA that we will not pursue quantity above quality, we just happen to be finding both right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","","I have one and a half questions I think here. So just going back to the real estate composition of the market, I mean, I absolutely got kind of the new center development versus existing center but can you give us a sense of when we look into that 2013 on a 125 stores how many new markets will that represents through existing markets through this year?","Chuck Rubin","I don't know if we want to break into that just yet. There's a fair number of new markets, but it depends on how you define the market as well Neely. So I have used this example quite often. You know you take San Francisco where we have I don't know 10 to 12 stores; it\u2019s a market that can support significantly more than that. So as we put more stores in San Francisco and its, into the San Francisco general market and new store is 10 miles away from an existing store, that's considered a new market or not. ","So our point is that there's a lot of green field out there. There are some of the stores for next year that are going into single market, single store or two store markets but a lot of them are infilling into these bigger markets as a whole. So it\u2019s kind of a broad-brush approach that we've got here.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","And then, do your loyalty program unless I missed it, did you actually say, did you fully convert to the new program on all markets or are you still, where are you in that process?","Chuck Rubin","Yeah, we still have half the team on the new program and half the team on the legacy program. We had converted a number of stores earlier this year and our goal is to get to the one program, the points based program. We are pleased with how the transition is going but there are changes to the program but we want to get through a full cycle of customer shopping patterns so we understand all the components to it. But we still happen to have.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","Would that be more of like a spring revisit sort of situation at this point?","Chuck Rubin","We will see. You know we still have another I don't know close to six months I guess to go before we anniversary the conversion. So we are making good progress and we are pleased with the new program, honestly we are pleased with the old program and it continues to feel a lot of goodness for us. We will get to the one program but we just haven't announced the timing exactly.","","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","Great and I just, I actually have one more on fragrance. I think its really interesting what you are seeing about fragrance and the strength that you saw in Q3, is that historically been a really pretty good predictor for holiday and then maybe even carrying it further into Valentine\u2019s Day if you think about kind of the key selling seasons for fragrance. When did fragrance really remind us, when did fragrance really start to get lit up a little bit from a category perspective?","Chuck Rubin","Well, fragrance is, what happened in Q3 was there was a lot of newness. So we have a lot of new fragrances that have been introduced. We will see how it goes for the fourth quarter. We haven't really hit the main stride for the fragrance category yet that does tend to peak very quickly as you get close to the holiday but newness is important and between that and there's a lot of newness. There is a lot of core fragrances that we've had and our GWPs continue to be briefly well received in this fragrance area. So too soon to tell how the fourth quarter is going to shake out on that but we think our plan is really well laid out.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Hofkin from William Blair.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair","Just couple of questions, I guess, first, maybe you touched on this earlier but can you say anything about sort of the flow of store openings in 2013, obviously I would expect it to be somewhat smoother compared to this year but correct me if I am wrong about that?","Scott Settersten","Obviously, when we get to March, Dan, we will give you a better predictor of how this store roll out schedules is going to work for next year. I don't think it to be too far off [pace], if you use 2012 as kind of the proxy as far as store roll out for 2013 at this stage.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair","And just sort of can I gross it up proportionately, you are saying basically?","Scott Settersten","Right, that would be the best bet at this point.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair","Okay, and then my next question is, with the, I guess in the near-term, you know, you're seeing more contribution from the SG&A leverage. You had huge improvement in the last several years in gross margin. If you look forward over the next two, three years and still, I know you guys still thinking in terms of a mid-teens operating margin. How do you see the contribution splitting up between gross and SG&A?","Scott Settersten","Again, as we progress, look to the future, we're still working on achieving our mid-teen operating margin in the next few years, Dan, and again it\u2019s going to be balanced between both gross profit and SG&A leverage. So again, it's going to move in tandem over the quarters. It\u2019s not necessarily going to be in perfect balance each quarter. There is going to be a little lumpiness along the way but again all in that where we are headed on target.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair","Okay, so I mean, it would be just all well equal fair to say that you would expect because the DC would be further in the ramp up next year and I guess the rate of star growth is similar in terms of percentage you would expect potentially more gross margin improvement year-over-year in 2013 than in 2012?","","Scott Settersten","","We are not ready to get into that quite yet today at the end; we will be prepared to give you a little bit more detail on that when we talk to you in March.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Maschmeyer from Robert W. Baird.","","Erika Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird","The ticket increase that you saw this quarter was slightly lower than it has been any factors to call out there?","","Chuck Rubin","","I missed the beginning, the what increase?","","Erika Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird","","The increase in your ticket?","","Chuck Rubin","Most of the increase has been driven off of traffic, last quarter was a little more balanced between and traffic but we have said all along that long-term we think the traffic will be more the driver. In this quarter it was generally in line I think with that mix. We are very pleased, we do think it\u2019s much a healthier and sustainable comp driver when most of that\u2019s coming out of traffic not ticket.","Erika Maschmeyer - Robert W. Baird","No, I completely agree that makes sense. And then can you talk a little bit about your in stock levels or may be grade yourself there how are you thinking about that and what types of initiatives are you investing in to continue to improve in that area?","","Scott Settersten","","Erika, our number one goal is to provide our guest with the best in-store experience that we can and obviously part of that is maintaining high end stock levels. As we came out of a spectacular fourth quarter last year with the high comps that we had, we found that we had some in stock challenges as we worked our way post holiday and into the January, February timeframe. We have also noticed over the years that some of our smaller vendors are having more of a challenge keeping up with a lot of stocks as our store based continuous to grow. ","So the investments that we are making are core high velocity SKUs with no obsolescence risk. We will remain highly disciplined and continue to prudently manage our inventory levels as we have in the past. Again, there might be a little upside to comps in the January, February timeframe but this in our view is a long-term investment, its going to help the business in the long-term.","Chuck Rubin","Just add to that, if you go back and look at our per store inventories, in generally it have been relatively consistent quarter-by-quarter just the end of fourth quarter this past year, we dipped down. So the additional inventory that Scott talked about this year we are expecting our per store inventory at the end of fourth quarter to be a low double digit. ","It is kind of the one-timer just to get the per stores by quarter more comparable and to Scott\u2019s point, you know, the additional inventory that we have bought and anticipate continuing to buy, its not really specific to holiday, its core and hence we are not overly worried about obsolescence of this stock.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Evren Kopelman from Wells Fargo.","Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo","I wanted to ask as you are opening more and more, as you have been opening more and more new stores each year. Have you seen any changes to the store maturity model that you have shared with us in the past?","Chuck Rubin","We are opening stronger than we have been before. So, but there is still the maturity curve that we have talked about before, so\u2026","Scott Settersten","And the new store class I would add, the new store class in 2012 is operating delivering that above our expectations. And again I think we may have mentioned this previously, yes the older stores and the new store comps are built in to our guidance. The older stores are turning a bit above those post five year comps that are part of our standard store model.","Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo","Oh, great, okay. And then for next year thinking about the preopening expenses with higher number of new stores is it fair if we just looked at about per store investment this year and extrapolate or will there be further savings as you're opening more stores on the store investment.","Chuck Rubin","I think I wouldn't anticipate a lot of additional savings per store. The market continues to evolve and you know its an interesting scenario compared to a couple of years ago there were far fewer suppliers, contractors et cetera. So the supply of resources has tightened up a bit. Therefore some of the cost savings that we've gotten before we're not going to lose but I'm not sure that we'll see as much additional savings there but so I think I would model it to be relatively consistent to this year.","Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo","Okay and then lastly if I can ask on the balance sheet with the growing cash balance any further thoughts on use of cash after all your clearly store opening plans given upcoming tax rate changes any thoughts on special dividends or stock buyback program. Thanks.","Scott Settersten","Hey, Evren. We discuss the cash balance and the best uses of cash with the board on a regular basis. As you know we paid a special dividend back in May of this year. At this point in time we've determined collectively that the best use of cash is to continue to invest in our new store program. That's what generates the best returns on that balance.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gere from RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets","","Just I guess a quick question what do you estimate is the blended beauty growth category rate in the US, I mean I know your mass, your prestige, your salon but if you had to aggregate that together what type of category growth do you think you're seeing right now, that's the first question.","Chuck Rubin","That we're seeing or the industry is seeing?","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets","Not the industry but it will lead into the second question but I mean yeah, where do you estimate the industry growth to be right now?","Chuck Rubin","Personally. I'll give you an answer but let me give you some disclaimer to it. You know it's a pretty broad industry from everything from prestige to mass to hair care to appliances et cetera. with up so I'll give you that as the backdrop. I think if you put all of that together you are probably seeing low single digit kinds of increases.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets","For including everything together, okay. Seems a little bit modest but okay. I guess the question is as you ramp up the square footage and as you get some of these new stores into year two or year three I mean, thinking about the comp and I respect the conservatism that you have with your long term three to five but when you look at the comp trends right now you know what's to say that it is ever going to go back to that three to five I mean the CRM program similar to what it did for similar to what it did for Sally Beauty was a solid contributor for their same store sales. You got some great new products in the stores. So I guess can you just talk me out of thinking?","Chuck Rubin","Well, I think that when we talk about the three to five, we're trying to highlight that this is a profit generating, cash generating business with three to five comps. That's the first point. Secondly, you know our growth has been and will continue to lead the market. We will continue to gain market share in the beauty industry.","The growth that we've seen, as to be expected, I think as in this quarter and last quarter, we were lower than the previous quarters, to expect double-digit kinds of comps endlessly, it would be probably an unwise conclusion. So the three to five that we have in our long-term financial model is just that. It's a long-term financial model to ensure that we continue to generate the kind of strong shareholder returns that we've been. We work to exceed that. So obviously we have been doing that quite consistently for the past couple of years and we're going to continue to strive to do that as we go forward.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, that's a good answer. Then, I guess the other kind of longer-term question is just on the margin target, can you just remind us how you benchmark. You said the mid-teens but with just some of the specialty retailers out there that you guys look at. I know that I think it's been said in the past, maybe not by you that you don't compare yourself to Sephora, but how do you kind of gauge what the real margin potential is in this business?","Chuck Rubin","Well, that's a tough one to answer, no first of all Sephora only carries prestige, fragrance, cosmetics and skin care we are a much broader retailer. There are other large big box operators out there that have terrific businesses and are mature and generate terrific returns, their business is different than ours. I think what we've said before is that getting into the mid teens is what we are working towards now, if you go back a couple of years ago we were in the single-digits and back then I am not sure that anybody would have believed that we have the potential of getting to the mid teens when we get there our challenge will be continue to grow that.","So I wouldn't suggest that's the ceiling on us, I would suggest that's where we are striving for to get there in the next x period of time, but they are I wouldn't compare it to necessarily to other retailers that we directly compete with.","","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great and then just the last I guess it's my half question, some of the gift for purchases that you're doing this year can you just remind us on who's funding some of that so that the luxury role by actually saw that with the purchase on fragrance can you just put a little color on that is that funded by you or is that can you I am just a little bit curious like how much you have to step into that promotion or is that vendor funded for some degree?","Chuck Rubin","No, Jason, we wouldn't get into that. We run a multi dimensional merchandizing and marketing program and we work closely with our vendors to develop exclusive product to provide import into the product that they're going to offer on a broad range we work with them on promotions, I don't see any great value of getting into the details of any specific program. I will reinforce to your point that the robe has - goes into effect this weekend officially and we would invite everybody on the call to be sure and get to one of our stores are online and enjoy that as a gift with the fragrance purchase.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets","Is that Velvet? [Cherry Qua]","Chuck Rubin","It is not velvet but for you maybe we can arrange.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets","All right, I have to get my wife some fragrance, anyhow thanks a lot guys.","Chuck Rubin","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jill Caruthers from Johnson Rice.","Chuck Rubin","Hey, Jill.","Jill Caruthers - Johnson Rice","Hi.","Chuck Rubin","Jill, we're not getting you a velvet robe, either so.","Jill Caruthers - Johnson Rice","That's all right, quick question just on the black Friday approaching, you mentioned that black Friday and Cyber Monday were they be highest record that you've posted and any different approach that you did with doorbusters or type promotions that you'd want to call out year-over-year?","Chuck Rubin","Couple of things one is the merchants did great job of putting an offering together that was profitable had a lot of exclusivity to it and it was really well targeted to our guest and then the stores did a terrific job of servicing. So we also, this year we did open a lot of our stores earlier than we did the year before to go along with what was happening in the center with other retailers that we cohabitate with. So when you put it all together the offering the marketing was quite effective and the experience in the store, it lead to a really good Thanksgiving weekend.","Jill Caruthers - Johnson Rice","Okay, and then question on the [Linkhome] and Clinique boutiques, I know it's very early, just wondering how are you informing the customer as those new boutiques just got in the store given its not store given it's not store wide so you can't really, I don't think you can run it in a print circular or what have you, so just kind of wondering how you're informing the customer at this point in time.","Chuck Rubin","A number of ways just touch on a couple clearly you can go out to our website and find it on a store locator. We're using digital communications and we are putting them into versioned additions of our print marketing. So and we've done other direct marketing that has been exclusive to Clinique around the stores that have carried it so it has been you know pretty multi dimensional in terms of how we're getting the word out.","Jill Caruthers - Johnson Rice","Okay, and do you feel at this point that you're gaining some new customers from that or is it just too early?","Chuck Rubin","We have, we believe that we are and we believe that we'll continue, yes.","","Jill Caruthers - Johnson Rice","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. At this time we have no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any closing comments.","Chuck Rubin","Well, let me just thank everyone for your interest in Ulta and joining us today and wish everybody a happy holiday season and we will look forward to speaking with you soon and hopefully seeing you when our stores are online even sooner.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only-mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to hand over \u2013 to introduce your host, Ms. Laurel Lefebvre, Vice President, Investor Relation. Please proceed.","Laurel Lefebvre","Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for Ulta Beauty\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 conference call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Dave Kimbell, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you of the Company\u2019s Safe Harbor language. The statements contained in this conference call which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the Company\u2019s filings with the SEC. We make references during this call to non-GAAP sales and earnings growth in 2017 adjusted for the 53rd week, tax reform and one-time bonuses.","During the Q&A session, we respectfully request that you ask one question only please to allow us to have time to respond to as many of you as possible during the hour scheduled for this call. Also we\u2019ve gotten a few questions about our 2018 EPS guidance and just to clarify, we expect to grow 2018 EPS approximately 20% of the 2017 GAAP EPS of $8.96.","Thanks. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Mary.","Mary Dillon","Great. Thank you, Laurel, and good afternoon, everyone.","The Ulta Beauty team delivered excellent results in 2017, with an 11% comp on top of the 15.8% comp in 2016 and 37% GAAP earnings per share growth or 25% earnings per share adjusted for items primarily related to tax reform.","However, the continued moderation in the growth rate of makeup our largest category, made our fourth quarter a bit more challenging than expected. But nonetheless, we achieved strong sales and earnings growth in the fourth quarter while continuing to gain market share and make significant progress on our strategic imperatives. We grew the top-line 22.6% or 15.7% adjusted for the 53rd week. Comp sales grew 8.8% on top of 16.6% comp in the fourth quarter of 2016 driven by positive traffic in ticket growth, a strong January and continued great momentum in e-commerce.","Adjusted for tax reform benefits and one-time bonuses for hourly associates, earnings per share were up $2.75, up 23% compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year.","I\u2019ll be briefer than usual with our highlights for the fourth quarter and view the complexity of tax rate impacts and our desire to provide a full discussion of the planned deployment of the benefits of the lower tax rate, as well as the various cost pressures in forming our view of 2018.","Starting with highlights on our loyalty program and brand awareness. The Ultamate Rewards loyalty program grew its membership 19% year-over-year to 27.8 million active members driven by our store team\u2019s successful conversion efforts. We launched a new diamond tier for our top guests who spend more than $1200 per year with a goal of driving higher share of wallet with our best customers.","The new program offers compelling benefits including exclusive offers in even more points earned. The program launched two months ago and it\u2019s off to a great start. Our credit card program continues to perform well with new accounts at conversion above plan and ongoing evidence that we garner a higher share of wallet from guests who sign-up for the card.","We also drove rapid growth in gift card sales, up about 30% in the fourth quarter in part driven by strong performance of our expanded Black Hawk partnership in supermarkets and other national retailers. Our brand awareness metrics reached all-time highs. We grew aided awareness to 91% compared to 86% a year ago and unaided awareness rose six points to 55% from 49% last year. We are also proud to learn that Ulta was the most Googled beauty brand in 2017.","Moving on to merchandizing. We continued to strengthen our partnerships with our brands and launched new and coveted brands across all of our categories. While the Black Friday, Cyber Monday period was very strong, bill for our holiday period was a bit softer than expected with the best monthly growth of the quarter coming in January.","The stand out performance of prestige boutique brands MAC, Clinique, Lancome, and Benefit drove the best growth rate in the portfolio. Reflecting the strong performance we are ramping up the rollout of these boutiques faster than we initially anticipated. We now plan to add 675 boutiques in 2018, compared to 700 in 2017 with the openings more weighted to new stores this year with about 380 in new stores and the remainder in existing stores. This includes plans to rollout more than 200 new MAC boutiques.","Our top-line was also driven by strength in prestige skin care, prestige fragrance and mass cosmetics all of which delivered double-digit comps. Skin care continues to perform very well and we are adding several new skin care brands to take advantage of the growing trend in skin health including the better skin company, Crepe Erase, Mamonde, and House 99 by David Beckham which is the men\u2019s grooming brand that is exclusive to Ulta Beauty.","We are pleased to see a meaningful acceleration in mass cosmetics in the fourth quarter driven by the success of popular new brands like Morphe. Ulta Beauty is this brand\u2019s exclusive brick and mortar partner. We\u2019ve just completed a major cosmetics reflow, making significant enhancements to further differentiate our offering in this category.","This entailed a major expansion of brands like Morphe, E.L.F, Makeup Revolution and the introduction of new brands like Milani, Flower and Wet n Wild. We also launched color top cosmetics, color cosmetics, a cold favorite in select doors and online in late February. This is a true fast beauty brand featuring trend right and affordable products and is exclusive to Ulta Beauty.","Turning to prestige cosmetics, so much in the third quarter we saw this category slowed from its stellar growth in 2015 and 2016. While certain brands of makeup were very strong, others struggled the comp over significant multiyear increases. We are optimistic that we can accelerate growth in this category with encouraging newness in the pipeline.","We are currently updating our prestige cosmetics assortment including the launch of Beauty by POPSUGAR. And this is another Ulta Beauty exclusive inspired by POPSUGAR\u2019s network of 100 million beauty enthusiasts.","We are adding high growth brands like Est\u00e9e Lauder, NARS and COVER FX to dozen more stores rolling out social media darling doors of colors to several hundred doors with an expanded assortment from its current small share. We are also excited about two recent Ulta exclusive foundation launches, Tarte Shape Tape Foundation which follows Tarte\u2019s best selling concealers and It Cosmetics\u2019 Bye Bye Foundation.","And finally we are thrilled to announce that prestige is positioned for 2018, Chanel Beaute following our longstanding partnership with Chanel offering their iconic fragrances in hundreds of our stores, we are honored to introduce Chanel Beaute in a small number of Ulta Beauty doors this year. This will be an added assortment featuring a Chanel branded makeup station with the first Chanel store opening in Westport, Connecticut in just a few weeks.","With significant newness across all of our categories and particularly focused on mass and prestige cosmetics and ramping up our efforts our offering of the \u2013 our efforts around the products and brands, we are certainly planning for make-up to have a much better year in 2018.","Let me turn now to our services business. Salon sales grew 17.2% or 8.7% excluding the extra week and comped 3.2% in the fourth quarter. We are encouraged by the early results of the test of our improved salon business model in two districts and are in the process of rolling out the new model to additional markets including the entire central region of the country with more markets planned to convert in the summer.","Guests and styles unlike are very pleased with this new approach which simplifies the menu of the hair\u2019s conservative, offers better transparency and provides increased training for stylists. We are also investing in a new model for skilled services in all new stores and a number of remodels in 2018, which we will pass 180 stores.","The new model called the Skin Bar at Ulta Beauty is designed to improve our skin services offering and will feature a full-time skin expert with responsibility for both prestige retail sales and skin service sales. This will also add retail space to the skin area compared to our previous model. We expect this model to also drive higher productivity of the space dedicated to skin care.","Moving on to store expansion. We opened 16 stores in the fourth quarter ending the year with 1074 stores. The net cost to open a new store was about $1.6 million in 2017, up slightly from 2016 as expected in light of the increase in merchandise fixtures for boutiques. This cost is expected to be slightly lower in 2018, as we continue to gain efficiencies in new store construction.","We are on track to open 100 stores in 2018 and we are very pleased with the quality of the stores that we\u2019ve accrued so far. We continue to evolve our store format to respond to guest rising expectations for an experiential environment. In addition to the new Skin Bar I just mentioned, the latest store model, our level 10 features upgrades with the Ulta Beauty collection walls, enhanced impulse pictures and elevated prestige hair pictures.","We expect average store rents for the class of 2018 stores to be slightly lower compared to the class of 2017.","Now let me turn to our e-commerce business. Ulta.com grew 60.4% including the extra week or 50.4% on a comp basis in the fourth quarter maintaining its strong momentum and representing 12.8% of total company\u2019s sales. E-commerce contributed 460 basis points of our total company comps driven by transaction growth.","Total site traffic growth rose 54%, while mobile traffic was up 66%. Our recently rolled out omni-channel capabilities store to door is rising faster than expected in satisfying strong demand for online-only brands like Ofra, Lime Crime, and new additions like Storybook Cosmetics, as well as brands like Morphe and MAC that are not yet available in every store.","And finally to update you on our supply chain operation. Our supply chain performed very well during the quarter operating at peak capacity for an extended period while maintaining high in-stock levels during the holiday selling periods. In support of the higher e-commerce order volumes, our distribution teams continued to exceed their goals for processing times and in-home delivery speeds during holidays.","With e-commerce representing nearly 13% of total sales in the quarter, our supply chain was able to support this volume while reducing cost per order by about 10% compared to last year. Our investments in the new operating model allows the network to deliver record daily order throughput capacity at 10% above planned.","From an inventory perspective, the team maintained high in-stock levels during the holiday season and through the end of the quarter improving on last year\u2019s strong performance and exceeding our inventory term goals for the year. Our post-holiday inventory plan was well executed allowing us to recover from the holiday selling season quickly and capture strong post-holiday sales.","So that wraps up my recap of the fourth quarter and now I\u2019d like to spend some time discussing how we are thinking about the future. As we began to plan 2018, we\u2019ve recognized several significant factors that will impact not just this year, but the subsequent years as well and allow modifications to our original long-range planning assumptions.","First the impact of tax reform. This changes the game and provides us with a unique opportunity to deploy a portion of the benefits to invest in our associates, and make us more competitive. It also enables us to accelerate certain investments to drive growth and innovation. These will deliver clear benefits to our business. But any reinvestment obviously impacts our operating margin rates.","We also have to adopt the new accounting standard for revenue recognition that boost the path we are in, but is expected to negatively impact operating margin by roughly 201 basis points this year. Next is clear that our business will have a higher mix of e-commerce sales than previously anticipated. While it\u2019s good news that we reached our target of 10% e-com penetration two years ahead of plan, this does put modest pressure on the P&L from a rate perspective since gross margin for Ulta.com is below that of our brick and mortar business.","The great news is that e-commerce sales and margin dollars are largely incremental and represent additional share gains. The investments that we\u2019ve made to enhance our digital and fulfillment capabilities position us to capture significant sales in e-commerce, while providing exceptional experience for our growing number of omni-channel guests.","We are also not immune to the various cost pressures that most retailers are facing today including labor, freight and healthcare. Labor cost is the most significant of these for Ulta Beauty and we face two challenges, rising hourly wages \u2013 wage rates in many markets across the country and increased competition for workers in our distribution centers.","And more importantly, the ongoing aggressive rollout that we are doing of our prestige brand boutiques with dedicated and highly trained staffing.","And finally, we are operating at a highly competitive marketplace coupled with the slowdown of growth rate of cosmetics that has persisted longer than expected. While we remain optimistic that our differentiated model will continue to gain share in a very fragmented market, these category and competitive dynamics are likely to pressure on margins in the near-term.","These headwinds will be in part offset by a formalized cost optimization program expected to unlock savings later in 2018 and beyond. As we mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call, we believe there is plenty of opportunities to leverage our scale to reduce inefficiencies and we\u2019ve identified four major work streams to drive benefits in the areas of indirect procurements, end-to-end operational efficiency, real estate costs and merchandize margin improvements.","So taking all these factors into consideration, it\u2019s clear that for the long-term health of the business, it no longer makes sense to drive toward the 15% operating margin target on the timetable we set several years ago. And managing the business to attain that target would require under investment in areas that we believe will drive robust sustainable long-term growth.","We still expect to expand operating margin over the long-term. For 2018 however, we anticipate taking a small step-back in the order of magnitude a 50 to 70 basis points. Going forward, rather than guiding to a precise operating margin target or timeline, we will instead ask stakeholders to focus on how we create value through our very healthy earnings per share and margin dollar growth.","We are planning to invest a portion of the roughly $100 million tax rate benefit expected in 2018 in a variety of projects designed to further enhance our differentiated positioning and elevate our overall guest experience. First, we are making critical investments in our people including employee benefit enhancements that will improve our position of the competitive labor market and increased retention.","In addition, we\u2019ve planned to invest in a series of new initiatives that will accelerate customer-facing innovation across multiple touch points to drive growth and strengthen our competitive position. One area of focus will be our store experience where we\u2019ll be innovating on the human physical and digital aspects of the journey since where we are delivering a compelling, exciting and easy experience for our guests in every trip.","We\u2019ll also accelerate our investment in AI and data capabilities to drive more personalization and one-to-one offers for our loyalty program members. In addition, we will increase investments in digital innovation to drive guest experience enhancements designed to drive engagement and education, as well as increased sales through our e-commerce business.","We\u2019ll also enhance our capabilities to both identify and incubate new brand opportunities that will further evolve our assortment and take full advantage of the changing landscape of brand and we\u2019ll accelerate our services strategy with the continued rollout of the new salon model and the addition of the new skin services model.","Finally, from an infrastructure standpoint, we\u2019ll accelerate activities around supply chain network optimization, as well as investments to supply chain systems that enable buy anywhere, sell anywhere capabilities.","We are confident that these investments will allow us to continue to deliver industry-leading sales and earnings growth while making us a more competitive employer, improving the guest experience and allowing us to invest in growth platforms to drive sustainable differentiation, exceptional market share gains and long-term success.","Before I turn it over Scott, I\u2019d like to address the topic of the recent lawsuits alleging that Ulta Beauty has resold used products. We are vigorously defending against these lawsuits and taking action to ensure our guests continue to have the highest confidence in the integrity and quality of Ulta Beauty\u2019s products and packaging.","Let me be clear, we do not sell used, damaged or expired products. It has zero tolerance for any actions that would compromise the integrity of the products we sell. We are confident that our associates are following our policies regarding the handling of returned products. To fortify this policy, we are re-communicating and reinforcing with every associate across the country the proper procedures for processing returns.","We have seen no indications that the publicities surrounding the allegations has negatively impacted our brand, our store traffic or financial results in any discernible way, but we will remain vigilant and ready to take any necessary action to protect our brand and ensure we maintain the trust of our loyal guests.","Now, Scott will cover in more detail the drivers of our fourth quarter financials and our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2018.","Scott Settersten","Thank you, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Starting with the income statement. Q4 sales of $1.94 billion were driven by 8.8% comparable sales growth, strong new store productivity and the benefit of the 53rd week. The total company of 8.8% was composed of 6.2% transaction growth and 2.6% average ticket growth.","E-commerce sales growth remained strong and contributed 460 basis points to the total comps. The retail-only comp was 4.2% with traffic up 2.7% and average ticket growing 1.5%. Ticket was driven by an increase in average selling price, while growth in units per transaction was slightly negative. The salon business comped 3.2%, driven primarily by ticket growth.","Gross profit rate decreased 50 basis points, including about 20 basis points from the one-time bonuses for hourly associates. The 30 basis points of remaining deleverage are attributed to modest pressure on merchandise margins and investments in our salon business in part offset by leverage in fixed store costs.","Distribution expense was flat as a rate of sales year-over-year. Product margins continued to face some headwinds from channel, category and brand mix dynamics with the mix of e-commerce sales, the most significant driver. We were just slightly more promotional year-over-year, largely due to the higher mix of e-commerce which tends to be a more promotional channel.","Preopening expenses leveraged about 10 basis points, related to the timing and number of store openings in the quarter with 16 openings in Q4 this year versus 25 in Q4 last year. SG&A expense deleveraged 60 basis points including 40 basis points for the one-time hourly associate bonuses. Store labor was the most significant contributor to the remaining 20 basis point increase in SG&A by deleveraging about 50 basis points.","As we continue to invest in prestige boutiques, as well as in more hours during the holiday season to deliver an optimal guest experience during peak shopping days. Corporate overhead leveraged about 30 basis points benefiting from strong expense controls. Advertising expense deleveraged slightly.","As a reminder, some of the upside we saw in the first quarter of 2017 came from shifts in the timing of some of the planned advertising expenses into the third and fourth quarters. Operating margin was 13.1% of sales, down 110 basis points on a GAAP basis. Excluding the impact of the one-time bonuses for hourly associates, adjusted operating margins decreased 40 basis points to 13.8% of sales.","Turning to EPS, GAAP earnings per share grew 51.8% to $3.40 and adjusted EPS rose 22.8% to $2.75. The tax reform impact from both the one-time deferred tax remeasurement and the impact of the new lower effective tax rate starting January 1, benefitted the quarter by $0.78. We made the decision to pay one-time bonuses to our hourly associates totaling $12.3 million.","About a third of the expense impacted gross profit and about two-thirds impacted SG&A and in total reduced EPS by $0.13. The 53rd week was worth $109 million in sales and about $13 million in EBIT.","Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow, inventories were up 5.3% on a per store basis, well below comparable sales driven primarily by inventory for new brands and boutiques. This performance demonstrates that our new merchandize planning systems are working to drive improvements in inventory management. This is particularly positive in light of the lower than expected sales and volatility of sales trends throughout the holiday season.","Capital expenditures were $441 million for the year, driven by our new store opening program, investments in digital capabilities, prestige boutiques and merchandize fixtures. We ended the quarter with $397 million in cash and short-term investments. In terms of share buybacks, through our 10b5-1 program, we\u2019ve repurchased approximately 266,000 shares of our stock at a cost of $58 million during the fourth quarter. The resulting lower share count added $0.07 to Q4 earnings per share.","As of February 3, 2018, approximately $79 million remained available under the 425 million share repurchase program announced back in March 2017. Earlier this week, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization in the amount of $625 million.","Turning now to guidance for the full year 2018 and for the first quarter. Our initial 2018 outlook is in keeping with our plan to deliver high single-digit comparable sales and earnings per share growth in the 20% range. With some of the drivers have evolved, as Mary just described, we expect to open 100 net new stores in 2018 and execute on 17 remodel and relocation projects.","Our e-commerce business is expected to grow in the 40% range. Total top-line growth is planned in the low-teens including the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017. Beginning in Q1 of this year, we\u2019ll be implementing a new accounting standard for revenue recognition. As a result, we expect to see a benefit to sales from credit card income and gift card breakage, which were previously classified in SG&A.","This will be partially offset by the impact of the loyalty program reserves now being grossed up into sales. Since we have such a high customer engagement in our rapidly growing loyalty program, Ulta Beauty has a more significant impact from this accounting change than some other retailers. Adoption of the revenue recognition standard is expected to increase sales by about $50 million and reduce operating margin by about 20 basis points.","Total company comps are expected to be in the range of 6% to 8% with the retail comp in the mid single-digits. We are planning for comps to strengthen throughout the year as comparisons ease and newness in our merchandize offering improves. We expect to grow earnings per share approximately 20% on a GAAP basis including the extra week in the 2017 in the base.","Excluding the impact of the extra week, EPS growth is expected to be in the low 20s. Earnings growth adjusted for the lower tax rate would equate the lower double-digit EPS growth. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $375 million. This breaks down to $175 million for new stores, remodeled and boutique expansions, $95 million for supply chain and IT, $80 million for merchandizing and $25 million for store maintenance and other.","Depreciation is forecasted at approximately $290 million. We expect to repurchase shares in the $500 million range for the year and the annual tax rate is expected to be 24%.","One note I\u2019d like to add related to Mary\u2019s comments about the recent social media allegation. This guidance does not include any actions we may take to protect our brand and reputation to ensure that our guests continue to have the highest confidence in Ulta Beauty.","As we look further out to 2019, the last year for which we gave long-term guidance at our Analyst Day in late 2016, we still expect to grow earnings per share in the 20% range and plan for modest margin expansions. We plan to host our next Analyst Day in the fall, and expect to share our longer-term outlook at that time.","Turning to more specific guidance for the first quarter of 2018, we expect sales to be in the range of $1,506 million to $1,519 million versus $1,315 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 6% to 7% versus 14.3% last year. E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the 40% range.","We plan to open 33 new stores in the first quarter, compared to 18 in Q1 of 2017. Q1 preopening expense is expected to deleverage slightly at the rate of sales. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.43 to $2.48 versus $2.05 last year with operating margins planned to deleverage.","Recall that in last year\u2019s first quarter, we had meaningful tax rate benefits resulting from a change in accounting for equity compensation, as well as earnings upside from a timing shift of expenses in the back half of the year.","The tax rate for Q1 is expected to be 24% and our fully diluted share count is estimated at $61 million. We hope that our detailed press release and comments herein today has been beneficial to investors in understanding the quarter and outlook that have a bit more complexity than usual.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mary.","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Scott. And I\u2019d just like to wrap up our prepared comments with some reflections on our overall 2017 performance. We made significant progress on our strategic imperatives throughout the year. We attracted millions of new customers adding 4.4 million net new loyalty members and we achieved all-time highs in brand awareness.","We gained market share across all categories, added dozens of leading brands to the assortment, successfully rolled out 700 prestige brand boutiques and significantly revamped our services offering. We drove impressive new store productivity. We delivered stellar growth in e-commerce sales and increased the percentage of omni-channel shoppers.","We improved our infrastructure and supply chain capabilities. I am really perhaps, most importantly we continue to grow and develop a workforce that\u2019s passionate, highly engaged associates who create and sustain our winning culture.","All these accomplishments give us tremendous confidence in executing our plans and driving sustainable profitable growth in 2018 and beyond. Our business model remains strong and differentiated and the investments we are making will continue to set us apart, support market share gains and make us relevant in the beauty industry for many years to come.","So now, I\u2019ll turn it over to our conference call host for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers from J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Horvers ","Thanks, good evening everybody. So, I wanted to ask about the promotional \u2013 your promotional plans and your promotional posture. I think a big question over the past two quarters is it looks like you added incremental promotional drive to sales at the end which looks like you are trying to catch-up to where you had guided the street.","So, how do you think about those in retrospect? Do you think as a private company, would you have run those? And how are you thinking about 2018 differently, especially in light of some of the works you are doing around the Ultamate Rewards program?","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Chris. Let me start just by stepping back and providing some context which is that, we have many different demand drivers and we always are really striving to deliver great value equation to our guests and one that\u2019s going to drive share gains and profitable growth. So some of those demand drivers are easy to see on track and others are maybe less so, because they are very targeted and a lot of folks are consumer target, right.","So, what I would say, it\u2019s a great thing is that we can and do flex those tactics as needed given the timing here, category competitive dynamics. So, we set out, I guess, more context really over four years ago to reduce our reliance on broad price discounting and as you said, increased targeted offerings through our loyalty program.","We also significantly shifted spending out of price promotion tactics into awareness and brand building tactics and we\u2019ve done that, the business I would say is, much healthier because of that. So, our brand partners, they appreciate what we are doing with the data and the insights in the loyalty program and I am confident that these are the right levers.","So to your point, at the end of the fourth quarter, we did have an incremental 20% off the postcard, at the end of the quarter, drove traffic and share gains, slight headwind to margin rate. But as I said, we actually had many levers and we take a very holistic approach. So, in fact, we are less promotional on other tactics that will cover less visible.","So net-net, there is only a slight increase in overall promotions and really that was largely driven by the higher mix of e-commerce in the quarter which tends to be more promotional. So, to your question about looking forward, I\u2019d say, more save \u2013 is this constant- how do we \u2013 over time we know that getting more and more and one-to-one and personalized is the goal for us. Our loyalty program allows us to do that.","Some of the investments I talked about to as well. But we\u2019ll continue to use an array of tactics and levers to drive the long-term growth in share gains of the business.","Scott Settersten","And I would just like to add, because I know this is a hot button for investors and we of course read all the weekly analyst reports that are tracking our every move on the promotional front.","Christopher Horvers ","Yes.","Scott Settersten","So, one other fact I\u2019d like to add is, it\u2019s not \u2013 this postcard in particular, it drove a lot of traffic to our stores, which helps at mitigate other potential gross margin risk to the business, right. So, that helps us move through clearance products, in this case, it helps us move through some of the residual holiday products that\u2019s still in the stores.","And so, you are able to sell that at a profit with vendor support rather than sending it back to the vendor, right, where you have labor cost and potential shrinkage use or a worst case having to write it off at the end of the quarter. So those are both worst outcomes. So, again, we try to be very thoughtful about the decisions we make and how we execute.","Christopher Horvers ","And I just want to throw in, you mentioned potentially having to react to some of these new stories about the used cosmetics as potentially seems to foreshadowing, maybe pulling one of those out to make sure you are defending the market share out there and you also guided a more narrow range 6 to 7 in the first quarter. So just trying to interpret that. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of\u2026","Mary Dillon","Could we just stay on that? So, pulling, what out, I am sorry, I wasn\u2019t tracking if that was a question or if not a follow-on question Chris, so.","Laurel Lefebvre","Chris can you repeat your question? Okay, he is gone.","Mary Dillon","I am happy to answer, but I wasn\u2019t clear about.","Laurel Lefebvre","Okay, let\u2019s keep going.","Operator","I\u2019m sorry. The next question comes from the line of","Mary Dillon","That\u2019s okay.","Operator","Simeon Siegel from Nomura Instinet. Please proceed with your question.","Simeon Siegel ","Great, thanks. Congrats on a strong year guys. So, Mary, can you just talk about how your new store openings are going? You did mentioned these stronger new store productivity. I am just wondering as the brand continues to gain awareness, are you seeing a faster sales ramp? And maybe is there any change to the maturity profile? Thanks.","Mary Dillon","Yes, I mean, I am very encouraged with our new class of store as each year continues to ramp up stronger. Productivity continues to get better. The maturity ramp of the stores is a function of the overall comp right, so that\u2019s going to flex based on that where we are in the overall comp. But what we are seeing in new store openings continues to be very strong and very encouraging and it allows us to continue to drive more market share gains as we enter markets, even markets that we already have stores, right. If we are adding stores, we are continuing to build our market share and overall penetration. So it\u2019s quite strong.","Simeon Siegel ","Okay, great. And then, thanks. Just quickly, Scott, did you, sorry if I missed it. Did you quantify or can you quantify what you expect mix shift to do to gross margins going forward?","Scott Settersten","We didn\u2019t quantify it. I would tell you that merch merchants in general as we said now for quite some time, we expect to manage to flattish, right, that\u2019s what\u2019s been inherent in our long-term thought process. So, but we believe there is opportunities over the long-term. So again, e-commerce is pretty obvious. So that\u2019s going to be a headwind for us.","It has been in recent quarters and will continue to be and so we are planning and we are looking at things. We have ways to mitigate that both our private-label offering might be a way, just getting smarter about our assortment and newness decisions by making use of our new merchandize tools that we\u2019ve put in place over the last couple of years, better analytical tools as well.","Inventory productivity gains, we think we have in our future, and of course the DC split it will limits as well. So there are better capabilities, better optimized performance overall and with Fresno, we are making thoughtful decisions on where we place these to make sure that we are closer to our end-customers there. So, again, helping with transportation cost over the long-term.","Simeon Siegel ","All right. Thanks, best of luck for the year.","Scott Settersten","Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks. Good afternoon. Question for Mary. Ulta has been making a lot of investments while growth was robust. And now, it sounds like, we are still needing to make some investments at a time where, I think some of us would think that you are relatively better off than your peers. And so, I know, you\u2019ve mentioned some reasons why can we revisit that. A","nd I don\u2019t know if I caught it, but within the margin guidance, and I think you adjusted outside of the accounting changes down 30 to 50, how much of it is down to the extra investments outside of the e-commerce mix shift and some of the freight and the labor margin headwind that you face?","Mary Dillon","Okay, great. Thank you, Simeon. And I\u2019ll start with the question I guess about why we feel we need to make investments, I\u2019d say, first of all I think we\u2019ve got a really strong track record of making smart investments that earn a great return and we\u2019ve had in fact, really significant progress against the five year plan that we communicated back in 2014.","We are well ahead on \u2013 I guess, every dimension you might measure from sales and profits, comp performance, share gains and what not. I would say though that, retail is rapidly changing and really more so maybe we would have thought four years ago. So, I feel very good about the investments we\u2019ve made. This is simply an opportunity now, frankly with the tester format to size up the opportunities that have forged us to invested and accelerated pace.","And some of the dimensions I talked about, I am really investing from a position of strength. We are very confident about our business model and our growth potential, but continuing to invest and maybe doing at an accelerated pace allows us to adapt to the increased pace of change I think are passing on guest expectations in retail.","So, if we solved for margin, I think we would not maximize the opportunity that\u2019s ahead of us. So, when we think about those investments, it\u2019s both on people, as well as guest-facing initiatives and really, it\u2019s more about imagining a future of this intersection of a digital and physical world that\u2019s more focused on experiences and discovery, personalization and let\u2019s on what you might think of what the friction of commerce.","So, for us, it\u2019s just about how do you pace that and do it in a way that continues to allow us to really be the leader in beauty that we are and believe we continue to be. So, it\u2019s just simple as that. Do you want to take the second question?","Scott Settersten","Sure, so, the 50 to 70 basis points down for the year that we guided to, I think you mentioned, Simeon, you got the 20 basis points on the accounting change which is kind of a one-time item I guess, I would say for the changing going from the cost method to the retail method for accounting for loyalty transactions.","The remaining 30 to 50 primarily driven by labor, store labor, is a big driver of that and that\u2019s connected to the boutique strategy. So, we talked in the past a lot about cost implications there. So, we are in a better position in 2018, because more of the boutiques are going into new stores than they had historically. Historically, that\u2019s been going back into the comp base which has been more of an expensive proposition for us through this accelerated depreciation notion that we\u2019ve talked about in the past.","So, labor, the biggest piece with boutiques which we say, we are accelerating from what we have thought about earlier. And then the rest of that is really this tax benefit reinvestment I would say and most of that ends up in SG&A in the back half of the year largely, as does the store payroll as well, is in the SG&A line.","Simeon Gutman","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Crago from Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your question.","Kelly Crago ","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Mary, could you just talk about the prestige cosmetics category a little further, first, did you mentioned how that grew in 4Q? And then, as we begin to lapse some of the outsize growth in the category, what do you feel an appropriate level of normalized growth? And what are some of your assumptions driving that outlook?","And then, just piggy backing on that, it would be great to hear your thoughts on the recent successes of celebrity brand introductions, which you haven\u2019t necessarily been able to participate in. So, do you expect this to be a sustainable trend? And if so, are you seeing any opportunities to get involved in a bigger way? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Great, thank you. I am going to pass it you to Dave, so I\u2019ll start and I guess, I would say, we think about our \u2013 let me reiterate, we\u2019ve continued to gain share in all the categories in all the channels that we are in, right. So, we participate in a lot of different categories I\u2019ve being \u2013 so there is a lot of different items in the past that we have to drive our growth. And in prestige, for us, we comped around 10% last quarter.","And a year ago, that was 20%. So, that was still great growth, little bit, not as strong as it was a year before, but we have some brands that had great \u2013 as our prestige beauty brands were really strong, it continued to rollout. We have some other brands that had innovation that didn\u2019t work as well as the previous year.","But we see our partners in new brand innovation very strong both in mass which we can talk more about and prestige and I feel very confident that that\u2019s going to continue to be a strong segment of growth and really coming in a lot of different ways. So, to your point about celebrity brands, that\u2019s just a one of that many levers that are out there in terms of creation of brands and we are participating across all those. So, I would not move that out. I think, there is a lot of ways for us to get innovation that we are. So, Dave, why don\u2019t you give a little more color and attend on that?","David Kimbell","Yes. On our cosmetic \u2013 on our makeup business, so, yes, I\u2019d just add to what Mary said by \u2013 and we really take a holistic approach at building our total makeup business and while your question was about prestige, I want to talk about both mass and prestige, because that\u2019s really unique for Ulta Beauty, obviously and an important part of our strategy as we help introduce guests into get into the mass business, but then see them over time move into our prestige business. So they work very \u2013 in a very integrated way.","But I\u2019d call out just a few core areas of how we are thinking about building \u2013 or continuing to build our assortment and our growth and success in the makeup business. First and foremost, it is about strengthening the performance with our biggest brand partners, our established brands and we are seeing continued success with that, that drove some of the comps that Mary talked about in prestige and also in mass.","So, our Ulta Beauty collection at the forefront of that going forward as well as Maybelline and L'Or\u00e9al Paris on the mass side, brands like TARTAN, Seche, It Cosmetics Too Faced driving growth on the prestige side. We are also rolling out, we\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times key brand partners that we\u2019ve been establishing at more stores, largely on the prestige side.","We said 675 new boutiques across MAC, Lanc\u00f4me, Clinique, adding benefit in new stores, but also, NARS, Est\u00e9e Lauder, on the mass side, E.L.F rolling to all stores. So, brands that have been successful in smaller subset of doors continuing to expand out. Key exclusive brands are big part of that, Tarte Double Duty Beauty has been a big success and a great partnership.","T Brushes For ULTA makeup revolution on the mass side, an exclusive brand that is we are expanding and seeing a lot of success with. And then I\u2019d say, in the socially relevant, socially-driven brands, we are seeing a lot of success and many of these brands are exclusive to Ulta and we are seeing them already driving a lot of growth on mass side, Morphe launched late last year.","We just launched ColourPop, Milani, Sleek, Flower. On the prestige side, Dose of Colors, Beauty by POPSUGAR, which is an exclusive line created by Ulta. Mary mentioned Storybook Cosmetics, which is an online brand. So we are seeing these influencer led brands having a major impact in the marketplace. We got many that we\u2019ve brought over the last six months and several that have just launched over the last few weeks.","So, we are very confident about the growth that we\u2019ll see there. And then the last thing I\u2019d just reinforce is, to as reflective of a holistic view that we see on the makeup business is the addition of Chanel Beaute and we are very excited about that rolling into a small number of doors, but another example of us driving growth in all aspects and all dimensions of the cosmetic business.","Kelly Crago ","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Altschwager ","Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So, your prior long range plan called for stronger comps in the early years relatively lower comps in the out years. So is the question is, would you expect your comp growth rates to reaccelerate as you accelerate some of these investments in personalization and store experience?","Or would it allow you to at least sustain something in the 6% to 8% range for a longer period of time? Just, I guess, without previewing the Analyst Day this fall too much, it would be great to hear how you are thinking about the longer-term comp growth algorithm. Thanks.","Mary Dillon","Okay, thank you, Mark. Wait, again, a little preview. I like that, which we can\u2019t do and don\u2019t have, but, I would think about it is sustaining really helped to held the comps that which I am not right now and that we would \u2013 I would expect that the need to evolve any retail business is going to be it\u2019s out there for all of us. So, when we think about these investments, it\u2019s really to continue to be just as strong as we are and sustain the kind of comps that we are talking about. So, more to come on that.","Mark Altschwager ","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Erinn Murphy ","Great, thanks. Good afternoon. I guess, Mary, my question was for you regarding the loyalty membership. The growth was pretty strong following 2017 I think you said 27.8 million at the end of the year, I guess, first, how do you anticipate the growth of that to continue in 2018? And then, how are you thinking about the customer acquisition cost if you get up into that next 5 million to 10 million customers? Thanks.","Mary Dillon","Yes, I\u2019ll just start and have Dave add some more to this. But, that really drove with the kind of growth that we\u2019ve had, we are almost at 28 million members as we said, which is fantastic and still, there is a lot beauty associates out there that are not in our loyalty program. So we anticipate to be able to continue to drive growth albeit at a moderate pace over time, we\u2019ve had really strong growth. We know we\u2019ll continue to grow it. So, well, do you like to answer?","David Kimbell","Yes, and I\u2019d say, as far as cost of acquisition, we are not seeing a dramatic change and then we are finding more efficient ways to drive our total marketing plan and we really do take a comprehensive approach to drive new guests into our store. Mary mentioned in her prepared remarks the increased awareness, both unaided and aided which we know contributes to our growth.","We\u2019ve got very strong marketing plan supporting both our total brand store as well many of the new items that I\u2019ve talked about and then our stores have done a very good job improving their effectiveness at converting non-members into members and we are anticipating they will continue to do that through 2018. So we are not expecting a real change in our efficiency of attracting new members into our program.","Erinn Murphy ","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. If I can sneak in one more, just on the credit card, is that still a drag on gross margin or has that neutralized now? Thank you.","David Kimbell","Yes, no, I am trying to put into context the drag. So, the credit card has been a spectacular success and it\u2019s been a real tailwind for the business overall, I mean.","Erinn Murphy ","The 20% offer that came with the [Indiscernible]","David Kimbell","Yes, yes, so that\u2019s moderated. The 20% offering case that didn\u2019t come through loud and clear. So the initial sign-up margin rate headwind with that initial purchase really had subsided once we got it the program off the ground in the second half of last year, really hasn\u2019t been an impact overall when we are talking about margin rates here, recent quarters.","Scott Settersten","Net impact is very positive.","David Kimbell","Absolutely.","Erinn Murphy ","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question.","Dana Telsey","Good evening everyone. As you are thinking about this category performance, makeup and what you\u2019re saying with prestige, how do you see the growth rates of that in the future and do you see any changes going on with skin care versus makeup that we should be looking forward to? And then just on the store base, any changes to the store base potential given the stronger than expected e-commerce build? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Great, thank you, Dana. And I\u2019ll start with the store base. We obviously continue to look at that very closely and are thrilled with the productivity that we have, the real estate opportunities, the ability to take advantage of situations, I think that are right for us in retail. So, and we love the e-commerce growth because it\u2019s so incremental to the business, right.","So it\u2019s not \u2013 we don\u2019t have a shifting of purchases happening here as you know. We look at that omni-channel guest closely and analytically, she continues to buy even more in store and online and becomes the best guest. So, we look at it closely as we continue to build out the store base and make sure that we are picking the right spots and that won\u2019t just keep watching that.","But we feel very encouraged, as I say, we are going to open 100 stores this year. We are off to a very strong start already and we think we are in the right place. On the all category stuff, why don\u2019t you take that Dave?","David Kimbell","Sure, yes, on the category \u2013 on the makeup specifically, we are confident about both mass and prestige. They both slowed down in 2017 and but we are seeing through some of the items that I talked about earlier, strong signs within our portfolio of growth. So we are optimistic at least within our business and our model that makeup trends will improve and we anticipate seeing that across the market.","As far as skin care, I\u2019m glad you asked because, skin care has been accelerating and we are very pleased with the results that we\u2019ve seen on our skin care business. Again, both on the mass and prestige side. Mary mentioned several of the new brands that we just recently launched, actually last week that we are excited about, but also continued strong performance with brands like Mario Badescu, Peter Thomas Roth, expansion of Proactiv, Origins, Clarins.","And then men\u2019s skin business, we think we\u2019ll also drive some incremental growth highlighted by House 99 with David Beckham. So, we see a lot of growth in skin across the marketplace and we are certainly , we think, leading the way and gaining share in that category as well.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Gere ","Okay, thanks, and good afternoon. Mary, I might need you to go into that crystal ball again. Just on the cost optimization program, I guess, I want to get a little bit of color now. Did you use outside consultants on some of the projects, because you guys haven\u2019t really gone through, I wouldn\u2019t call it restructuring, but this level of some of this detail?","And then, Scott, when you think about the 50 to 70 basis points, that margin will be down this year, how much of \u2013 I mean, the cost optimization program, I guess, will help offset in the second half of the year? How much is that going to contribute this year? What would be the full year runrate? And then, how, and this is the crystal ball question, how much of that gets reinvested when you think about going forward into next year? So I was just wondering if you could \u2013 lot of details, but hope that we can get some answers.","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Jason. I also start by saying a couple of things. One is, I am thrilled that we are really in a formalized program that we are working on with dedicated internal leaders and a formal process in place and we are doing it from a position of strength.","So I think it\u2019s the right time for us to think about how do we take our growth and scale and identify opportunities to drive more efficiencies in the business, smarter way to do business for many years to come. So, we are fairly forward on the path of identifying buckets of opportunities. But way too early to start getting specific about what that\u2019s going to look like and when, but I feel really good about the progress we are making.","Scott Settersten","I guess, I would just add that, the executive team is committed to seeing this through. I mean, I think we are in a good spot in our maturity curve here to be working on this ahead of what you might have seen historically in other operations. So we are not going to share a lot of specifics, but there is hard targets in the 2018 plan and this is going to be a multiyear program. Actually, we are really good about it at this stage.","Jason Gere ","Is it fair to say, I mean, just to follow-up when you look at some of the other competitors out there, whether department stores have kind of gone through this type of, I guess, cost-cutting efforts in the past that they aren\u2019t kind of near the tail-end of those programs here at the beginning, it puts you in a competitive advantage, as we think about the next couple of years?","Mary Dillon","Well, it will. So, I mean, the idea is that it really is the right time for us to think about short-term and long-term ability to continue to drive the kind of returns that our shareholders are expecting, while continuing to invest in the business that has many, many years of growth ahead of it, and the need for investment in a changing retail environment. So, frankly, I think about it little bit less of cost-cutting. I think about it more as driving efficiencies, invest in growth. And now it\u2019s the right time for us to do that.","Jason Gere ","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for taking my question. This is [Indiscernible] on for Brian. Just wanted to ask about the ticket growth, I believe it\u2019s been around mid single-digits over the last three years and starting to slow a little here. How do you think about the comp sales from here? Is it reasonable to assume a lower contribution from ticket growth or do you think there is still opportunities to grow the average ticket from maybe channel mix, product mix or anything that we should be aware of?","And then, secondly, I might have missed this, but, so the vendor participation for the different kinds of promotions, say 20% off-coupon, is that different that planned events like the 21 days of maybe that you run almost every year?","Scott Settersten","Yes, so maybe I can start with the comp deconsolidation. So, when we think about the business, it\u2019s always with a healthy balance of traffic versus ticket and a contribution. That\u2019s the way we plan our business.","I mean, over the last couple of years, you\u2019ve seen us outperform that, especially on the traffic side of things. So, again, it\u2019s a balance, the way we think about, we wouldn\u2019t \u2013 there is nothing moved ahead of us that we would say, we would expect anything materially different than that at this stage of the game.","David Kimbell","Yes, and as far as brand partner support of our key promotional activity, I guess, we\u2019ll get into specific details about each individual item other than to say, we are very close \u2013 work very closely with our brands to deliver the best experience to our guest and they are active supporters of our efforts in the marketplace and we just \u2013 they\u2019ll continue to do that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Adrienne Yih ","Good afternoon everybody. Mary, first of all, congrats on the Chanel Beaute. Very, very impressive to land them. Why don\u2019t if you could talk a little bit about how many stores, how many SKUs and the timing of that? And then, along with that, the skin care size of \u2013 prestige skin care size of market relative to prestige cosmetics, and then your penetration within Ulta in those two categories. Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Yes, I am not sure we break out all that in so much detail. But I\u2019ll tag team this with Dave. Thank you, we are thrilled with Chanel Beaute as well. It will be a pretty \u2013 a small number of stores to start. We are starting at Westport Connecticut in the next couple of weeks, additive assortment, beautiful brand. So, which will help to continue and deepen that partnership.","David Kimbell","And the assortment will be highlighting the most iconic items as Mary said, a real highlighted assortment, we are really excited about the presentation in-store, but it will feature their Iconic Lipstick, ROUGE COCO LIPGLOSS and Blush, Screen Foundation, skin care items. And so, we think it will be a really nice presentation of their brand and a nice addition into our portfolio.","Adrienne Yih ","Fantastic. And then, Scott, just a clarification, on the year-over-year operating margin pressure, is that against the GAAP 13.1 or the 13.8? And then for Q1, can you help us that a little bit with the gross margin, because you are opening \u2013 I think more stores in Q1, year-over-year. Should we think about more pressure and then having relieve itself or reverse itself in Q2? Thank you very much.","Scott Settersten","Yes, so it is, so to guide the operating margin guidance is versus the GAAP information.","Adrienne Yih ","Okay.","Scott Settersten","To certify that. And then, Q1, interesting I am glad you asked this question, because it is important for people, we did stated a few times, Q1 is probably our toughest compare of the year, right. So, we had a 14 comp last year. We had some \u2013 we pushed some expenses out of first quarter into the back half of 2017. So that helped us as well.","So, the other things to keep in mind there I would say is supply chain deleverage that we got a new DC in Fresno California, that\u2019s going to open up mid-year next year. So, some slight deleverage there in the early part of the year and then improving in the back half of the year and then you are right on with the store program.","So a lot more stores opening up in first quarter 2018 than a year ago. Plus, we are carrying forward, some what I would call higher cost kinds of real estate, right, that we put online, second half of last year. Manhattan being the most notable of those that we are still up against during the early part of the year. So, again, fixed store cost leverage, tougher in the first half of the year, but improving as the year goes on.","Adrienne Yih ","Okay, great. Thank you for the detail. We\u2019ll be looking forward to Westport.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Oliver Chen","Hi, thank you. Hi Mary, Dave, Scott. Our question is the evolution of the state and how you are thinking about driving value and experience in the context of Amazon and other pure play competitors. What\u2019s on your mind in terms of the shifting needs of the consumer and how are you prioritizing what you can do to just make sure you have a competitive advantage along the value of store experience, personalization and customer engagement?","Mary Dillon","I would say, all the above Oliver. But it\u2019s a great question and I believe we are really well positioned to really be a leader in this category for many years to come, both in the physical space as well as digital, both stuff. I mean, to us, this is a category and the consumer that we focus on the beauty enthusiasts who really loves both.","The in-store experience to try and discover and get services as well as the conveniences on buying online and so, we offer really what nobody else does and we will continue to do that. So the product assortment across all categories of price points, a great in-store experience and online experience that needs to just keep getting better, right.","Services, our loyalty program and I\u2019d say, as we think about our e-commerce platform, we just continue to build out our e-commerce platform at a way that is great- it gives us great control over content, the guest experience, the pricing the data. So, we like the model.","We think we are well positioned and as we think about the future imagining what that guest wants five and ten years from now in that intersection of the physical and digital world, is that\u2019s our job to do. But we believe still continue to want to have physical experience as well. So, that\u2019s how we think about it. It\u2019s a competitive space, but we think we are playing to win. So, we will.","Oliver Chen","And lastly, as a quick follow-up, on the inventory journey, you\u2019ve done a really good job of managing capital and also the slip system and thinking about accuracy. What are the next steps for inventory in terms of what you want to do in ensuring the omni-channel as well as the supply chain and speed in turns and stocks and service levels are where you want them to be regarding both the customer-facing, as well as the Planograms in the stores, just curious about inventory.","Scott Settersten","Yes, I\u2019d say, we are still in the early innings with respect to inventory optimization. So, I mean, as you well know it\u2019s a never ending quest, right to have right products, at the right place, at the right time what she is interested in purchasing. Whether it\u2019s on the store shelf or it\u2019s in our distribution centers ready to shipped to her front door.","So we\u2019ve been making significant number of investments over the course of the last couple of years with tools, you mentioned slip is one and better space planning kinds of tools in the stores. I mean, our analytical capabilities have improved a lot over the last three to four years.","That will continue. That\u2019s a quest again that will be evergreen for us to try to get better and better insights into our purchasing behavior in how we ship things quicker and more efficiently to folks. So, there is still a lot of, I guess, I would say a lot of progress for us to be made there when we think about inventory productivity and inventory turns kinds of things as we look to the future.","Oliver Chen","Thank you.

Thank you. You may begin.","Laurel Lefebvre","Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Ulta Beauty's third quarter 2014 conference call.","Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer, and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are Janet Taake, Chief Merchandising Officer, and Dave Kimbell, Chief Marketing Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's Safe Harbor language.

Good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to announce the Ulta team delivered excellent sales and earnings growth in the third quarter.","To recap the numbers, sales grew 20.5% and we delivered a 9.5% total company comp on top of the 6.8% comp in the third quarter of 2013, both including the impact of e-commerce growth. Our 9.5% comp was nicely balanced between transactions and ticket.","The key drivers of our performance were continued strength in prestige and mass color cosmetics, the successful introduction of new products and brands, a more effective and well-executed marketing strategy, double-digit comps in our salon business, and rapid growth in e-commerce. Ulta.com performed very well, driving 46.7% comp sales growth.","Gross margin was healthy as we continue our efforts to deliver more targeted offers and moderate our reliance on broad-based price discounts. Earnings per share were up 30% to $0.91 versus $0.70 of GAAP EPS last year.","Scott will cover the detailed financial results for the third quarter and our guidance for the fourth quarter in a moment, but before that, I'd like to provide an update on our six strategic imperatives.","As you know, we recently updated our strategic plan and five-year financial target and provided additional insight into the components of our long-range plan at our Analyst Day in October. We believe this plan represents a strong set of strategic imperatives and specific initiatives that will allow Ulta to continue its market share gains and deliver strong sustainable sales and earnings growth.","Now I'll spend a few minutes updating you on activities underlying each of the six strategic imperatives.","The first imperative is to acquire new guests and deepen loyalty with existing guests. As we discussed, we believe that one source of future growth is through the acquisition of new guests. In order to do that, we know there's an opportunity to first drive awareness of Ulta as well as clarity about the overall Ulta experience.","In the past several months we've sharpened our brand positioning, developed an advertising campaign, and began an in-market test to measure the impact of TV, print, radio and digital advertising in six representative markets around the country. We recently completed the tests and are now analyzing to trend out data. Preliminary indications are positive, and we expect this test to influence our marketing strategy for 2015.","Another key aspect of this brand-building strategy is to leverage PR, to increase awareness and establish Ulta as a leading beauty authority. We continue to drive millions of earned media impressions in the third quarter through broadcast and print PR opportunities in support of grand openings and product launches. In addition, throughout the month of October, we partnered with The Ellen DeGeneres show to highlight our longstanding support of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. The total number of media impressions Ulta received from the Ellen partnership approached 500 million","In addition, due to increased awareness of Cut-A-Thon, our salon teams provided 26% more free haircut, with a donation to the BCRF than last year. We raised millions of dollars this year for BCRF, a cause important to our guests and our associates. And we've taken an important step towards increasing awareness of Ulta.","Another critical initiative in support of the first strategic imperative is growing and further leveraging our loyalty program and CRM capabilities to increase loyalty and grow share wallet with our members. At the end of the third quarter, our ultimate rewards program had grown 16.1% year over year, reaching 14.5 million active members. Our strong comp growth across retail, salon and e-commerce was driven by loyalty member sales growth. Average sales per member increased compared to last year, equally influenced by greater shopping frequency and higher spend per transaction. We continue to increase the effectiveness of our targeted CRM campaigns in order to drive incremental sales, improve retention and engage members and our service offerings.","Now on to the second strategic imperative, which is to differentiate by delivering a distinctive and personalized guest experience across all channels. A key initiative is assessing higher staffing levels to determine the impact on sales and the guest experience. During the third quarter we tested different labor models with increased customer-facing hours in 60 stores across the country. Similar to the advertising tests, we're currently measuring several financial and customer satisfaction and retention metrics to assess how to incorporate a more effective labor model as we go forward.","An additional side, we've also been busy improving the guest experience. We've introduced live interactive chats with key vendors on a regular basis. We've launched a new iPad app and add a content to the site to inspire, educate and share. We've also implemented a new technology on Ulta.com to enable video commerce or shoppable videos, where guests can click to buy merchandise shown in videos that are created by passionate Ulta bloggers.","Our third strategic imperative is to offer relevant, innovative and often exclusive products that exist our guests. Newness continues to be a significant driver of our business and our merchandising team is doing an excellent job at expanding and curating our portfolio. During the third quarter we rolled out across the chain a specialized fixture to house an exclusive collection of makeup brushes in partnership with It Cosmetics. With 66 SKUs across multiple price points, these brushes have been an instant hit with our guests.","We also launched a premium skin care Algenist, hair care brand Keranique, as well as new fragrances from Michael Kors. We rolled out popular color cosmetics brand BECCA to 282 stores as well. With its broad range of shades, this brand is a great addition to our portfolio and very relevant to women of color.","Looking ahead to the holiday season, we're excited about the many exclusive holiday items we've introduced in partnership with our prestige brands, and a strong gift repurchase program to support our [indiscernible] offering [ph]. We recently introduced a bath collection for the Ulta brand, with new fragrances and packaging. We've also significantly upgraded our gift card program and merchandising in time for the holiday season.","So we believe our merchandise assortment, combined with a robust marketing plan, anchored on a Gift Gorgeously theme that includes radio, advertising, PR, social, digital and in-store marketing, will resonate with our guests.","Now moving on to the fourth strategic imperative, delivering exceptional services in three core areas: hair, skin health and brows. The salon business grew 20.5% and comp 10% for the quarter, adding 10 basis points to the retail comp. This performance was driven primarily by increases in average ticket. Our guest count was also positive and strengthened during the quarter.","Our strongest comping categories were hair color, blowouts, skin services and makeup services. Skin services had their best comp all year, due in large part to the launch of the new peel service that builds repeat business. We are pleased to see an acceleration in new guest acquisitions throughout the quarter, supported by our new online booking capability. During the quarter, 36,000 appointments were booked online and more than 80% of those were new salon guests.","Beginning in October, we launched a CRM campaign designed to acquire new salon guests from our existing loyalty customer base, with targeted offers for hair, brow and skin services. As we noted at our investor conference in October, salon customer spend 2.5 times more than non-salon guests and shop twice as frequently, but they represent less than 7% of our loyalty program members. So, converting more of our ultimate rewards program members to become salon customers is a good opportunity for us.","Turning to brow services, we now have about 600 benefit brow bars and are performing brow tinting services in almost 400 of these. Benefit boutiques continue to perform very well, with strength in both products and services.","The fifth strategic imperative is to grow stores and e-commerce to reach and serve more guests. We opened 50 stores during the quarter, ending the third quarter with 765 stores. We remodeled five stores in the third quarter and relocated two. We've already completed our 100-store program this year, with an additional 10 stores opened early in the fourth quarter. And after closing one later in Q4, we expect to end the year with 774 open stores. This represents an increase in square footage of just under 15% for the year.","New store productivity remained strong, with the class of 2014 stores outperforming its sales budget. Looking ahead to 2015, we expect to open 100 full-size stores and we have already approved close to 90 sites.","In terms of the small store tests, we opened two 5,000 square-foot stores in September, one in Vernal, Utah and one in Morganton, North Carolina. These stores feature a curated assortment with every major category represented, lower fixture heights for increased visibility, and a full guest experience with a three-chair salon, dermalogic skin services and Benefit brow bar. And these two stores were piloting a new capability for guest to order in-store on an iPad and have the product shipped for free from our DC to their home, in order to give our guests access to our full assortment.","We continue to monitor the performance of these stores, and in their initial weeks, they're exceeding their sales budgets and confirming our hypothesis that these stores will be extremely well-received by guests, and that they're likely to have a higher mix of prestige product sales versus the chain. We expect to learn a lot about operating small stores during these tests to help us be successful in rural and urban markets in the future.","On the e-commerce side, Ulta.com's growth of 46.7% contributed 130 basis points to the total company comp. E-commerce is expected to represent about 5% of total sales this year, on our way to our goal of growing to 10% of our business in the next five years. We're now anniversarying the significant improvements to the new website that we launched just over a year ago, so we expect the top line to moderate over time, but we continue to add more content and enhance the site performance, and we also expect to see improved fulfillment capabilities as we execute our supply chain project.","Which brings me to our sixth strategic imperative: investing in infrastructure to support our guest experience and growth and capture scale efficiencies. The Greenwood, Indiana distribution center is under construction and is expected to open mid next year. We're currently looking for a location in the south for our fifth DC to open in 2016. These buildings will have all new systems and operating models, driving more efficiency, increasing replenishment speed, and improving in-stocks, while making it easier for store associates to stock shells and free up their time to spend with our guests.","Other noteworthy efficiency projects include our new point-of-sale system. The chain-wide rollout was completed at the end of the third quarter. The new POS simplifies the cashier role, enables omni-channel capabilities, and reduces costs. We're also piloting a mobile app for store associates to streamline receiving and inventory functions in 10 stores and a store management tool in 13 stores.","This completes my update on our strategic imperatives, so now I'll hand it over to Scott.","Scott Settersten","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon everyone.","Third quarter sales were $745.7 million, compared to $618.8 million last year, an increase of 20.5%. Comparable sales increased 9.5%. The retail comp, which includes salon, was 8.2%. The total company comp was driven by a healthy combination of transaction and ticket, with transactions up 5.4% and ticket up 4.1%. The ticket increase was driven entirely by average selling price, as our business continues to mix up to more prestige categories, and we succeed in our efforts to rely more on our CRM capabilities and targeted offers versus broad-based couponing. Retail-only comparable transactions were up a solid 4.4%.","Gross profit dollars were up 21.6% to $281.8 million, and gross profit margin increased 40 basis points to 37.8% from 37.4% last year. The primary drivers of this improvement were leveraged on fixed store costs and a strong comp and higher product margins, offset by incremental supply chain costs due to our expanding e-commerce business.","SG&A expense increased 19.7% to $181.1 million, down 20 basis points as a percentage of sales to 24.3%, versus 24.5% last year or 24.2% excluding the severance charge last year. Despite our investments in the test-and-learn initiatives like the payroll and brand awareness marketing tests, we were able to leverage SG&A due to the stronger-than-expected top line, which drove payroll and marketing expense leverage, offset by deleveraging corporate overhead expense. The corporate overhead deleverage was primarily driven by a higher variable compensation expense due to better-than-expected performance, as well as depreciation of IT systems and consulting expense.","Pre-opening expense was $6.6 million, compared to $7.5 million last year, driven by 50 store openings, compared to 55 new stores opened during Q3 2013. Operating margin increased 80 basis points to 12.6% versus 11.8% last year. Interest income was $254,000 net of credit facility fees. Our line of credit remains undrawn.","Our tax rate was 37.3%, versus 37.7% last year. This tax rate favorability added less than a penny of earnings per share and was due to the impact of equity compensation on our tax rate.","Net income increased 30.1% to $59.1 million or $0.91 per diluted share, versus $45.4 million or $0.70 per diluted share last year, or $0.72 per share excluding the severance charge last year.","Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventories were $709.7 million at the end of the quarter, compared to $582.3 million at the end of Q3 2013, up 5.8% on a per-store basis. We achieved our goal of keeping inventory per door growth below comp growth despite investing an additional inventory on bestsellers ahead of the holiday selling season, to keep pace with our strong sales momentum. In-stock levels are strong and we have not experienced any meaningful issues from the recent West Coast port delays.","Capital expenditures were $78.4 million for the quarter, driven by our new store opening program, supply chain investments and systems. We are on track to spend $265 million in capital for the full year.","Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter were $33.7 million.","We ended the quarter with $395 million of cash and short-term investments.","The company repurchased approximately 86,000 shares at a cost of $10 million during the quarter under our 10b5-1 plan, as part of our program to return cash to shareholders.","In terms of specific guidance for Q4 2014. We expect to generate sales in the range of $997 million to $1.014 billion, compared to $868.1 million last year. We anticipate achieving comparable sales increase in the range of 68%, versus 9.2% last year. Recall that comp performance from last year's Q4 benefited by approximately 200 basis points due to the negative impact that Super Storm Sandy and the timing impact of the 53rd week of fiscal 2012.","New store openings in the fourth quarter are already complete, with 10 stores opened versus 11 stores opened in Q4 last year. So, pre-opening expense is expected to be flat.","Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.21 to $1.26, versus $1.09 for Q4 of 2013. We anticipate a tax rate of 37.9% and a fully diluted share count of approximately $64.6 million.","Turning to the outlook for the full year 2014, based on the strong performance of the first three quarters, we are raising our earnings growth expectation to the low 20s percentage range for the full year. Full-year comparable sales are expected to be in the range of 8% to 9%. As a reminder, the long-term plan we announced in September laid out our five-year financial targets. We expect to open 100 stores per year, grow e-commerce to 10% of our sales, drive comparable sales in the 5% to 7% range, and grow earnings per share in the low 20s percentage range each year. However, we expect the reduction of this growth rate in the mid-single-digit percentage range in both 2015 and 2016 due to planned supply chain and systems investments. Operating margins are expected to remain flattish for the next couple of years, before heading up towards our long-term mid-teens target. We plan to provide specific guidance for next year, as usual, on our Q4 call in March.","And finally, for fiscal year 2015, we plan to accelerate our earnings announcement calendar to be more in line with our peers and expect to announce our quarterly results about one week earlier than our historical practice. The dates for next year's earnings announcements are posted on the Investor Relations page of our website.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to our conference call hosts to begin the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. It's Simeon Gutman, Morgan Stanley. Nice quarter, everyone.","Two questions. First, on gross margin and gross margin management. You'd talked about getting better at I guess promotions and targeting and being more selective. If you do what you did this quarter, to drive some of the improvement, and you run it out over the next few, should we see gross margin expansion similar to what we saw in this quarter?","And then my second question is, if you see next year better gross profit dollar growth, either through sales or through better gross margin, could -- are there investments either -- you mentioned supply chain and systems, are there any of those investments that you can accelerate just to pull them forward if the business is performing better?","Scott Settersten","Yes, Simeon. I guess I'll take a crack at the first one here. As far as gross profit expansion was concerned for the third quarter, as I look out at the next couple, specifically the fourth quarter, I wouldn't expect to see the same kind of expansion that we just saw in the third quarter. I mean the fourth quarter, I think you know the holiday season's a little bit different animal for us, you know, with the competitive set kind of changing. We have again a large number of new stores entering into the overall base here, so there's a bit more fixed store cost deleverage coming in the fourth quarter that will drift the next couple of quarters as well. So again we think our guidance includes all those ramifications and we think it's prudent under the circumstances.","As far as thinking forward a little bit about investments, I mean it's, you know, you heard us describe all of this at our Analyst Day back in October. It's a pretty aggressive plan. There's a lot of heavy lifting as far as the investments are concerned, over the next couple of years. I think we're probably as accelerated [ph] probably as we feel comfortable at, at this stage in the game. Of course we'd always course-correct as we see things change in the business.","Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Balter with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Unverified Participant","Hello. It's actually Andrew [ph] on for Gary. Congrats too on a fantastic quarter.","My question is regarding prestige brand wins. This quarter your market share gains from department stores seem to accelerate, and in response we heard companies like Estee Lauder mention that they're going to expand their assortment with the specialty channel. Could you just comment on your outlook for prestige brand wins, particularly as the smaller format stores lessen channel conflict?","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Andrew [ph]. We're really thrilled with the performance of the brands that we've been adding to the mix, and I think I've talked about one example, cosmetics was a big win for us in the quarter, with the expansion of the brush line and whatnot. There's many examples of that.","We continue to just look forward at our growth and we think we are a great place to grow. We're pleased with the performance that we have with our brands and we'll always look to continue to really I guess best meet our guest needs. And if she continues to be interested in more prestige brands, we'll continue to look at those as well. So, thank you.","Unverified Participant","Congrats.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Hi, thanks. Two questions. First, now that Q3 last year is in the rearview mirror, can we do a little post-mortem on what exactly happened then? Didn't know if you get any extra clarity as you kind of cycle through it.","Mary Dillon","That's your first question. Okay. Hi, Aram, thank you.","So I guess there's a few things going on there, right? One is that last year we had this I guess you'd call the fiscal cliff effect that we think had an impact on traffic and consumer sentiment that we saw at the end of the quarter. And we were also cycling up against a very promotional year-ago quarter. And so some of those factors we think actually, you know, that in conjunction with we were starting to pull back a bit in some of our promotional intensity, put those together, we think those are some of the factors that drove some of the impacts to the comp that we saw on that quarter.","This year, as we look at it, I think it's obviously overall a much healthier consumer sentiment happening, while there's still pressure on household budget in a lot of ways. Obviously the overall economic outlook and economy, jobs, are more positive. And we are still continuing to really be cautious but smart about balancing our investment and targeted offers with price discounts. We think we're getting a little bit better at that, probably more knowledge as we've done this a little bit more over time. So those are kind of the things. You know, those. And each year, every quarter has something new as it relates to new products, and some are going to perform better than others, right? So that's always a part of the equation. So we feel like we have a pretty good understanding of all that and confident that the drivers that got us to this quarter result are ones that we can - we think we can continue to drive in the future.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","And a follow-up was, I don't think this was asked at the Analyst Day, but can you tell us how likely you are to try and incubate brands in something like kind of a VC format and maybe if so, timing or moneys you might allocate to such an endeavor?","Mary Dillon","You know, certainly the notion of having a really robust pipeline of products, so, products and brands that our guests want, that they know of already, and products and brands that we can bring to market, win partnership, or invest in, are all in the consideration set for us. We want to really be known as the beauty authority, and certainly the more things that are exclusive to us, the better over time, right? I don't think that'll ever be the highest part of what we do, but certainly we'll want to grow that.","Having said that, we're just really I think beginning to develop that capability, take some investment in time and people to do that. And so that's certainly a focus for us in 2015, is to build our strategy, capability and plans there, because I think it's very exciting and interesting to think about consumer insight combined with great merchandising and retail execution as part of our strategy. But it's early for us yet. We have so many other priorities right now frankly that what we're focused on.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research","Okay. Thanks so much. Best of luck, and happy holidays.","Scott Settersten","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee","Hi everyone. Congrats on a great quarter. Thanks for taking my question.","Two quick ones. I think the first one for Scott. In terms of the next 18 to 24 months on the investment side, is there going to be, you know, as we model out our quarters, is there going to be some lumpiness that we should keep in mind? You guys talked about the next distribution center opening up and the timing of that. Just curious how we should think about timing on SG&A, if there's anything you can add.","And then also, Mary, when we think about ticket growth up 4%, can you comment, is that a function of category mix to prestige, is that a function of less discounts? Is it both? Is it more one or the other? Just trying to understand that a little bit better. Thanks.","Mary Dillon","Let me start with that one because that's actually easier, which is that it really is a combination of both. Ike, I would say that it's a mix of prestige, it's less discounting. Those together have really been the drivers.","Scott Settersten","And as far as the investment cycle is concerned here over the near term, the next 18, 24, 36 months, so I mean, again, clearly we're -- Indianapolis is underway here. That building slated to be online mid-2015, shortly thereafter with a new distribution center in the south, going online approximately the same time of the year in 2016, kind of a carbon copy.","So, you know, the short answer is yes, we do expect our quarter-to-quarter performance to be a bit lumpier than it has been historically. And then we've talked to many investors about that over the last couple of years. That's one of the reasons why we've kind of backed away from more detailed guidance that we'd done in the past.","As a reminder, most of the investment is going to be flowing through the gross profit line in the P&L. There will be a minor part I think flowing through SG&A for some consulting things. But by and large, all these capital investments will amortize gross profit.","Ike Boruchow - Sterne Agee","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Co.","Hi, good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?","Mary Dillon","Yes.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Co.","Okay, great. I'll add my congrats on a great quarter.","Just a couple of quick questions. First, as you think about kind of pulling back on some of the broad-based, as you call, the coupon advertising, what, you know, as you see that, where is that kind of manifesting itself? Is that just showing up in a little bit higher average ticket or is there any other impacts through the ticket or traffic dynamic there? That would be my first question.","Mary Dillon","Well, yes, I would say a couple of things. One is that this is not a dramatic wholesale pullback on discounts. We're doing it carefully, I think smartly. What we're doing is looking at frequency and depth of circulation of price-related discounts, but, you know, reducing that, but on the flipside really leveraging our CRM platform and our loyalty program to incent our guests in a more personalized and targeted, think more effective and efficient way, right? So it's a little hard to measure all those impacts at any one moment in time, but certainly where we can see that play out is in ticket improvement, margin improvement, and we think that's working for us.","But again, I said this before I believe, walk before you run, so Dave Kimbell and his team are doing a lot of work around just really making sure we continue to fine-tune, test and learn, understand all the demand dynamics, so that we can be, you know, we always need to be a value to our guests, is a way to think about it. And it's -- there's no one exact way to define that, but the more relevant we can be with the offerings and then how we position those and communicate those to her, the more that value equation is less about just, you know, come in because we have a coupon or a discount. That said, a lot of our guests like our coupons at our discounts, right?","So it does play out in terms of the ticket dynamic, and we think it's obviously one of the assumptions we build into our long-range plan, is that we'll continue to be able to do that. Because the other place that this plays out is that less money spent on discounting, you know, within the context of our P&L, offers us more opportunity to spend on driving awareness, and the whole new guest acquisition part of our strategy, which is we think an -- we know it's an opportunity to go forward.","New guests don't discover you just on accident. Sometimes they do because we also have the store, which is great, but we're investing and testing and learning in actually marketplace programs already that are about using all forms of ways to communicate, whether it's traditional or new media, to drive new guest acquisition. So, some of that sort of efficiencies there will be used to drive new guest growth.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Co.","Great. And then it looked like there were a couple of other brands that maybe you're testing out a little bit, it looked like Clarins in one of your markets, in skin care. Is that specific brand or is that something that you're thinking about as a potential for broader rollout over time or others like that?","Mary Dillon","I'll ask our expert head merchant here to weigh in on that one. Janet?","Janet Taake","Sure. You know, we did just certainly refocused on Clarins in our stores. We've had Clarins, but what we did do -- so technically it's not new, but once again we really focused it more in our Chicago area. It's a beautiful brand. And we're also very thrilled to offer it on our website as well. And that's -- no further information other than that, and we're just really excited to learn more about this beautiful brand in our assortment.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Co.","Great. Thanks. Best of luck in the fourth quarter.","Scott Settersten","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Joe Altobello - Raymond James","Thanks. Hey guys, good afternoon. I guess first question is on the site -- the Ulta.com site. What percent of visitors to your site are loyalty members? And how successful do you think that site has been so far at funneling those visitors into your brick-and-mortar stores?","Mary Dillon","I will ask Dave to take that for us. Dave?","David Kimbell","Yes. I don't think we'll have the exact percentage of guests versus non-guests that visit our site. We know we over-index on our site in our ability to attract new guests, so we get a greater percentage of new members from our site than it represents of our total sales. So it is a strong channel for us to continue to attract new guests.","And as we shared a little bit in our Analyst Day, we have a small percentage of our guests that are actively shopping in between the channels today, but we are doing a lot to encourage them and we're seeing growth in that activity. So we continue to bring initiatives into the marketplace designed specifically to get an online guests into our stores, try to drive her in to use our salon service or to shop one of the, you know, one of our brands in stores. And vice versa, when we have a brick-and-mortar customer, make sure that she's aware of our online. Because those guests are some of our best guests and we're going to continue to try to drive that integration across channels.","Joe Altobello - Raymond James","Okay. But is that something that you guys are tracking and measuring on a quarterly basis or a monthly basis?","David Kimbell","Yes. We are certainly tracking them.","Joe Altobello - Raymond James","Okay. Got it.","And then secondly, in terms of the consumer environment, I think earlier you guys mentioned that you're very encouraged by what you're seeing so far from a consumer standpoint. This holiday season, how does it look from a promotional standpoint versus last year?","Mary Dillon","Well, you know, this was the crystal ball part of the show, right? Just kidding. But certainly the -- I would say a couple of things on the consumer sentiment.","I think it's a mixed bag a little bit. I mean there's certainly positive economic news that create this more upbeat climate, stock market, employment, GDP. But there's also a lot of pressure on household budget. So if you look at increased costs in healthcare, food, rent, technology, and incomes aren't growing that fast.","So I think the good news is, either way, Ulta is really well-positioned because of our breadth of assortment, our overall value proposition. So we're seeing that play out.","As it relates to the holiday, then I think the same thing rolls forward. We expect it to continue to be a very competitive time. It's always the time of the year that we compete in a broader I guess competitive frame because it's more about gift-giving, and beauty is part of that, right? It's not only that we're competing against beauty retailers.","Certainly the last couple of years they've been very promotional. I think what we've been reading in terms of what other retailers are saying so far about the start of the holiday season is we can expect that to continue. So I think that some guests will have more money to spend and some less, but everybody is going to be competing for that share of wallet during the holiday period, and we expect that.","We feel well-positioned with what we've got ready for holiday, I would just add that. We've got a really great lineup in terms of our product offerings and our marketing plans, our stores are ready, our DCs are ready, our e-commerce platforms, you know, performing well. So we feel good about it. But we expect it and that's put into our guidance to expect that.","Joe Altobello - Raymond James","Okay. Thanks, Mary. Appreciate it.","Mary Dillon","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon and congratulations on a great quarter.","The first question I want to ask is essentially a follow-up to that. So you spoke about the different promotional tools that you have available to you and how you have deployed them to your advantage. Do you expect to continue to stick with those in the fourth quarter when perhaps the promotional environment tends to intensify and you face more players? Or do you feel like you can use some of your -- or do you have to revert, if I may, to some of the more traditional marketing tactics that you would have used I years past?","Mary Dillon","Yeah, our plan for the fourth quarter is to continue to build on what's working. So I mean certainly one of our best tools is our CRM capability, and that holds true even more during holiday, right, when people are very busy and trying to sort out what to purchase in terms of gifts.","One of the things that we've done is we've really -- we've taken our website and organized it around this theme of Gift Gorgeously as a section, and it really makes it easy for people to understand kind of if you're looking for gifts for teens or for men or whatever. So we can communicate to our guests directly via email about gifts and certainly half prices and great products, and we're doing that. And that said, there's also other tactics that we'll continue to use, that are about driving traffic and about great prices.","So it's really I think a combination or a continuation of what we've been doing, within an expectation that there's more competition and hence a little more promotion than another quarter.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","That's helpful. And then two quick follow-ups for Scott. Scott, can you talk about the magnitude at least directionally of merch margin or product margin expansion that you saw here in Q3 relative to what you saw in the earlier part of the year?","Scott Settersten","Yeah. I mean we started off the year I think guiding, right, expansion and margin over the course of the year. Again in the early part of the year it was smaller part of the mix overall. And we're happy to see that play out the way we expected. So we saw 10 basis points of expansion in merch margin year over year in the third quarter. We don't expect that necessarily to repeat in the fourth quarter. We'll see how it plays out. We have good plans in place we think to try to maintain our momentum there and try to do what we can to expand it. But it is a bit of a different animal in the fourth quarter. And we'll do, you know, what we have in the past, right, to protect our market share gain.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","And then finally, just ballpark inventory thought process as we model out yearend.","Scott Settersten","Yeah, we're very happy overall with our inventory. Again we were up 5.8% year over year, which is a little elevated from what we've seen earlier in the year. But we are very confident. Those are ANB [ph] skews that we're buying aggressively because the business is strong and we're confident that that's going to continue through the fourth quarter. So --","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo","Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a little bit about industry product trends. We haven't talked about that very much so far. It sounds like color cosmetics has been an area of strength. Do you expect that to continue for you in the next few quarters? Any other trends you're seeing from a product perspective that we should be watching? Thanks.","Janet Taake","Sure. From prestige, it has been strong for us quarter over quarter for some time now. And a lot of that has really been driven from the evolution of our portfolio over the last several years, the addition of new brands. And we still have brands we've introduced this year that will continue to have increases next year, so we haven't comped over them yet. So there will be opportunity there.","And it's been a strong category for us and we feel that it'll continue. And as far as any trends, there are a lot of different trends. And in color specifically, brow has been a very strong trend this year. It continues, along with web. Some of these that we may have mentioned in the past, and face. All categories in color have been strong.","Some of it new brand introductions, some of it new innovation, along with skin care mask and serums continue to trend very strong. And there are other things, but those are probably the highlights.","Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo","Thank you. And then on the test-and-learn initiatives you've had in place, are those continuing to Q4 and Q1 or are they being replaced by other tests? Just asking more from a -- how to model it from an expense perspective. Thanks.","Mary Dillon","Yeah. Well, just in terms of the actual tests themselves, they're pretty much -- the third quarter was where we did the testing and spent most of the money. There are some that's into the fourth quarter, but a small part of it.","Test-and-learn ongoing is going to be part of our mindset, but I don't expect it to be the kind of investment that we made this year frankly because we're really, we're kind of really trying to do a lot at once, and it wasn't planned in our budget. As we look forward, it's part of again how we're going to run the business and it's already built into our guidance in the five-year plan.","Scott Settersten","Just to point a point on that, Evren, so of the $10 million that we described starting out the year, most of that now is in the rearview mirror. There's a bit that's still embedded in the fourth quarter, but it's not worth really discussing. And as Mary said, there'll always -- we will always have an increment built in in future years for test and learn. It will be to the same magnitude that it was in 2014.","Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo","Great. Thank you. Happy holidays.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Altschwager - Robert W. Baird","Good afternoon and thanks, and congrats on a great quarter. Could you talk a bit more about some of the site enhancement you've made that did inspire beauty consultations, share and play, what are the learnings there, and any metrics you can share on traffic and conversion that you've been able to attribute to these initiatives?","David Kimbell","Yeah. I think we've shared specific metrics related to some of those elements. But I will tell you what -- we're very happy with how the site enhancements have continued to improve the experience overall, and we've invested, you mentioned a couple of those, but continuing to look for ways to both engage our customers more in beauty and our brand through our content destination, yeah, the beauty destination that you talked about, video content that we've been bringing online, shoppable videos, a variety of different ways to try to get consumers to see us as -- increasingly see us as a beauty expert and a leader in the space. And we can see content as a way to do that. And that we know has driven traffic and engagement on our side.","We've also looked for ways to enhance that shopping experience once we get them there. So I think through our cart overlay and how we're enhancing that, we did that through the third quarter. It is in programs like our salon appointments that Mary mentioned in her script. We've enhanced how we're describing and highlighting promos through some different fly-out capabilities. So we're continuing to both enhance and extend the guest experience to attract her there. And once she's there, convert here. And we believe, you know, and we know, through all of our tracking, that it's working. It continues to drive. We had, as you saw on the results, a very strong quarter, and that was driven at least in part by these enhancements and the continued improvement of our site performance overall.","Mark Altschwager - Robert W. Baird","Great, thank you. And then Mary or Scott, could you just address what you saw on the business around Thanksgiving week and Black Friday? How did your approach differ versus last year, and just biggest takeaways overall from that week? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Yes, sure. Well, we're really pleased with our merchandise offers, our marketing communications, I'd say, relative to last year. We just continue I think to get more honed at understanding our guests and what she needs and really picking our spots. And so I'm pleased with -- I think the team did a great job, and the traffic and sales that came from it that it drove, we're pleased with.","Scott already talked about inventory. We're happy with our in-stock position, which is great, with our website performance which Dave just touched on, our e-commerce fulfillment capabilities worked really well for us. So the guidance that we've given for Q4 does embed already what we saw at the holiday, and we're pleased with it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Steph Wissink - Piper Jaffray","Hi. [Indiscernible] --","Mary Dillon","We can't hear you very well. Steph?","Operator, why don't we go to the next question, we'll see if we can get Steph back in a bit.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jill Nelson with Johnson Rice. Please proceed with your question.","Jill Nelson - Johnson Rice & Co.","Good afternoon. Could you talk about maybe some initial learnings you've gained from the higher staffing model? I know it's in the early stages, but any initial insight?","Mary Dillon","Yeah. We're going to -- we're still in the process of really looking at the trend-out data, the customer satisfaction metrics. We tested a couple of different staffing type models, different levels. I'll just have to say, we're pleased with the results. Certainly we, you know, we had a hypothesis, I don't think it was hard to confirm, but that the more guest-facing time that we can give our stores, the better in terms of conversion and ticket. And we saw that, really -- now it's really just a matter of, so, to what extent do you want to invest and how much does it return? But we know over time, with the supply chain investments and IT investments, that these, you know, the customer-facing hours will naturally become more available to our associates in stores, it'll just take a while for those to play out.","So as we build our plan for 2015, we'll certainly be taking those learnings to consideration. I don't expect that there'll be a whole sale dramatic change to our staffing model, but certainly whether it relates to markets, volume levels, categories, there's a lot that we can play with there.","Jill Nelson - Johnson Rice & Co.","Okay. And then just to follow up. You talked about 100 full-size store openings for 2015. Could you talk about what that implies about kind of that smaller 5,000 square-foot box? It's still in test or could that maybe an incremental add to the 100 planned for next year?","Mary Dillon","Yeah, it's still, you know, our overall plan in terms of our store growth really was about the traditional store format, the large store format. And we have always said that the small store we would see bee incremental to that. I'm not sure exactly when we're going to start doing more of them. So far we have two. The test is early. We're really pleased with the results. But it is a different operating model. Everything from learning about how to manage the fact that we have fewer SKUs in the stores, so, making sure we can allow our guests to be able to order from the store and have it shipped to her home, you know, different kind of labor model, certainly a different kind of replenishment model.","So, all those things will take a little time. We like what we're seeing, but we really want to make sure that, as we expand this concept and we are encouraged about that, but that we really set ourselves up for great success as we do that.","Scott Settersten","And it's really key for us, we want to monitor during the holiday season now because of the spike in sales and the number of footsteps that comes through the door, to make sure we can manage all that, and to the levels that we want, so.","Mary Dillon","But we're encouraged, yeah.","Jill Nelson - Johnson Rice & Co.","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question.","Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group","Good afternoon everyone. As you think about the services component, do you have a percentage of sales target from services? And as you look beyond brow bar, are there other services that you may add and how their margin and contribution versus product?","And then lastly, given that the salon customers spend 2.5 times more than non-salon guests and shop more frequently, do you see -- how do you see that interacting with the loyalty programs since now they represent less than 7%? Could it be more? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Yes, absolutely. One of the reasons that it's one of the pillars that we've put into our strategic plan is that we're very excited and committed to the notion of services as a growth driver for us in the future, for all the reasons that you understand, right? So I think, Dave, we mentioned this, this is our best guess. The service salon guest comes more frequently and spends more than any other guest, and it really enhances our beauty authority, and it also enhances the sort of brick-and-mortar reason for being. There's many others than just that, but it's certainly part of the equation, that we think is part of our unique proposition, right, services and breadth of categories and types of brands all in one place.","So we've just started I'd say and we're already doing some CRM to make -- get our current loyalty members aware, and we've seen positive response on that. We've added this online booking tool which was, you know, drove a lot of new guest acquisition, which was great. I mean, a small number so far because we just started, but 80% of those folks booking online were new guests to us.","So I guess the only thing to think about in terms of the types of services, we want to be really known and great at what we're really known and really great at, which is salon, which is about hair, our brows and our skin services through Dermatologica. There's a lot of growth that could be had within all of those, and that's what our focus is going to be, versus continuing to add new -- as new services would be added within the concept of the service pillars that we already offer.","So for example, in hair, you can imagine there's lots of things, whether it's doing even more blowouts, which we do today, or special occasion hair. In brows, we're just doing something just for holiday, which is about blinging out brows -- did I get that right, Janet?","Janet Taake","Yes.","Mary Dillon","But besides tinting, doing fun brow services that add a special holiday sparkle I guess I'd call it. So there's lot of ways I think to grow within the service core that we have today.","Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Steph Wissink - Piper Jaffray","Hi, good afternoon. Sorry about that. Just a question quickly on your mobile traffic to your site. Have you been tracking that? And anything you're learning from your mobile app? Thank you.","David Kimbell","Yeah. We absolutely continue to see that taking -- becoming a bigger and bigger part of our overall business, and yeah, the strong growth in the third quarter, and we've seen that actually continue. So what we're -- we launched a new iPad app in the third quarter. We've seen that increase.","We will expect to see there in peak periods that both the traffic can be up to 50% of our traffic, can be through our mobile applications, any of our mobile applications, a little less of the orders, but certainly the traffic engagement and learning of our products would be increasingly on one of our mobile applications. And so we're investing heavily to make sure that's a strong part of our plan going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the floor back to management for closing comments.","Mary Dillon","I just want to say thank you all for your attention and interest in Ulta, and to all of the Ulta associates for a great job in the third quarter and your readiness and execution for the holiday season.

[Operator instructions.] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Laurel Lefebvre, president of investor relations for Ulta. Thank you. You may begin.","Laurel Lefebvre","Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Ulta\u2019s first quarter 2012 conference call. Hosting our call are Chuck Rubin, president and chief executive officer and Greg Bodnar, chief financial officer. Before we get started, I would like to remind you of the company's Safe Harbor language.","The statements contained in this conference call, which are not historical facts, may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected in such statements, due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the company's filings with the SEC. We will make references during this call to the metric free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash provided by operating activities, minus purchases of property and equipment.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chuck. ","","Chuck Rubin","Thanks Laurel. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m very pleased to announce that 2012 is off to an excellent start. Following our strong performance in 2011, the momentum continued in the first quarter with better than expected sales and earnings growth. ","Just to recap the headlines, we grew the top line 23% and drove same-store sales of 10.1%, on top of double digit comps in Q1 in the two previous years\u2019 first quarters. We achieved 200 basis points of operating margin improvement driven by our double digit comp and our team\u2019s consistent and disciplined execution of margin expansion strategies, translating into 46% EPS growth for the quarter.","We delivered this profit growth while investing in the business with the addition of 18 new stores, moving our improved loyalty program to 50% of the stores, and opening a new distribution center to enhance our supply chain capabilities. ","All of these investments position us to continue to gain market share over the long term. We are driving our business forward by executing on our five-point growth strategy of accelerating store growth; introducing to our guests new products, services, and brands; enhancing our loyalty program; broadening our marketing reach; and increasing our focus on ulta.com.","These strategies delivered results in the first quarter and we believe will continue to fuel our growth into Q2 and beyond. Let me spend a few minutes detailing the progress we\u2019ve made on each component of our growth strategy.","First, we are accelerating our store expansion and are on track to open about 100 new stores this year, representing 22% square footage growth. With the 18 new stores we opened during the quarter, we ended Q1 with 467 stores in 44 states. ","We\u2019ve been very pleased with our real estate strategy and the productivity of our new stores, and have just completed a robust analysis to update the store network potential. We now view the opportunity for our prototypical 10,000-square foot store in the U.S. market to be approximately 1,200 stores, up from our previous estimate of 1,000 stores. As such, we are currently less than 40% penetrated into the new store plan. ","Just to give you a sense of the methodology behind the analysis, our real estate team has a terrific record of identifying great sites and getting stores open on time and on budget, and they have a tremendous amount of data on trade areas and customer purchasing behavior that have allowed us to refine our view of the opportunity for the U.S. market\u2019s potential for our full-sized, 10,000-square foot stores. ","Our updates analysis takes into consideration about a dozen demographic factors. We look at population density, household income, and retail presence in a market, as well as valuable information mined from our loyalty program. This analysis is layered on top of deep knowledge of the local retail markets. A third layer of analysis consists of using performance data of the existing stores and our portfolio based on their market and site characteristics as a reliable predictor of performance with similar characteristics. ","Our new 1,200-store plan does not include smaller store formats or the potential for expanding outside of the U.S., both of which are incremental, longer-term opportunities. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we are on track to open 22 stores and complete about 10 remodels. Our 2012 store plan is locked in, and we are already developing a robust pipeline of sites for the 2013 opening program.","Our real estate team just came back from the ICSC real estate conference very optimistic about the long term opportunities in the market. We believe the discipline we have in selecting sites and opening stores enhances the potential for great returns for shareholders. ","I\u2019d like to emphasize that we will not, however, open stores for the sake of hitting a number. We always value quality over quantity, but we are very optimistic that very attractive real estate opportunities exist for us to achieve our 1,200-store buildout for our current format. ","Let me talk about our second growth strategy, the addition of new products, services, and brands. In the first quarter, we continued to add excitement to our guest offering, which allowed us to gain market share across all major categories by providing the newness that our guests value and expect. ","The three components capturing that newness through our focus on trend: adding new products from existing brands we already carry and introducing new brands to our portfolio. In Q1, we saw particularly strong trends in anti-aging, mascara, lipstick, and BB creams. ","This last category of BB creams is a very hot trend. These all-in-one products deliver protection, priming, coverage, and flawless finish. We\u2019re seeing strong growth in this category, with BB creams from Too Faced, Stila, Smashbox, Boscia, and Garnier. ","The second newness factor is adding new products in existing brands. Here we saw continued strength in prestige cosmetics in particular. The new Naked2 Palette from Urban Decay was a standout. Also strong in Q1 was the launch from Benefit of liquid foundation. In fact, this was one of Benefit\u2019s most successful product launches ever.","I\u2019d also like to note that in our service business we saw strong performance from our Benefit Brow Bars, which are now in about 300 stores. We believe we have more Brow Bars than anyone else in the United States, which provides our guests a fun and fast service for about $20.","Turning back to product, we introduced our exclusive Ck One cosmetic line to 50 Ulta stores along with Ulta.com and are pleased with its performance. The Clarisonic line of skin cleansing tools continued to perform well in addition to everything else I\u2019ve talked about. ","This do-it-yourself at-home category also saw expanded success during Q1, with strong sales in Red Carpet gel manicure sets and the Remington i-LIGHT hair removal system. Our online business in this personal care appliance category, where we\u2019ve tested some of these innovative personal care products which sell at a higher retail price, was particularly strong.","During the first quarter, we also added several new product brands to the assortment. Juice Beauty, an organic line that boasts scientific research supporting the efficacy of their products, was launched during the first quarter. Our guests are looking for organic products that deliver results, and Juice Beauty is a sought-after brand with limited distribution. We also launched bath products from the Body Shop, Carol\u2019s Daughter skin and hair care products in the prestige skin category. ","As we look to Q2, the newness in our offering continues. In prestige cosmetics, we are introducing Tarte\u2019s Maracuja oil and Maracuja foundation, a new Benefit \u201cSnow White and the Huntsman\u201d kit, 68 shades of Urban Decay eye shadow with a build-your-own palette, and the new Supernatural trend collection from Bare Escentuals.","Light technology continues to drive innovation as well, and we will add personal care products from Remington and Tanda to the assortment, targeting hair removal, acne treatment, and wrinkle-reduction. The BB cream trend will be an area of focus, with a new endcap in all stores featuring BB creams across all categories, from masks to prestige. ","Finally, in our prestige product offering, I\u2019m pleased to tell you that we plan on adding Lancome boutiques to 50 additional stores, bringing the total number of stores offering Lancome to 79. We expect to open the vast majority of these new boutiques starting in the third quarter and completing before the important holiday selling season. These new boutiques are geographically targeted to enable us to market most effectively. ","Additionally, in select stores, we plan to invest incremental capital and operating expenses in the prestige area, which will allow us to expand our prestige brand offering and add additional prestige boutiques to these stores. We expect to provide more details on this during our next earnings call.","We are very excited about these actions, as they will continue to strengthen our guest offering in the prestige part of our business, which has been growing quickly and capturing market share. In a few moments, Gregg will detail the short term capital and P&L impacts of these long term investments.","Let me touch on our service business briefly. Salon continues to perform well, and we\u2019re very pleased with the strong positive comps we achieved. Newness was also a key driver of this strength. We launched Chromatics hair color by Redkin in the first quarter, which sparked strong sales in cut and color services as well as new guest acquisition. During Q1, we also finished the rollout of the gel nail service by OPI to all stores, which continues to add incremental sales as guests gain awareness of the offering. ","Moving on to our third growth strategy, enhancing our loyalty program, with now well over 9 million active loyalty customers, this continues to be an incredibly valuable asset for Ulta as loyalty program customers shop more often and buy more with us overall. Just as important, the program gives us a highly effective means to communicate directly with our guests. ","At the end of the first quarter, we converted our central region to Ultimate Rewards, which brings the number of stores on this new program to about half the chain. Our legacy loyalty program is certificate-based and at certain times during the year guests choose a free gift from a list of predetermined products, based on how much they earned during that timeframe. The new Ultimate Rewards program is a points-based program, which is far more flexible, since guests can use their points on anything in the store, whenever they want.","While we have been offering Ultimate Rewards for a number of years, we recently made several enhancements to the program to add greater value to our guests. Since the points program is easier to understand and gives our guests more choices, we believe customers will appreciate the value of the program more. While still early, thus far they\u2019re telling us they greatly enjoy the enhanced, points-based program. We hope to move the balance of the stores to the new Ultimate Reward program over the next 12 to 18 months.","As I have discussed previously, our loyalty club database provides us with a tremendous amount of information about our customers\u2019 shopping behaviors: what she buys, when she buys, where she buys. This is a significant asset for our company. The opportunity to harness that information in our guest targeting and communications is enormous, as we seek a higher share of wallet. We are good today, but we will significantly improve this capability over the long term.","Looking to the second quarter, we will continue to build on the personalization benefits that the loyalty program provides by launching an online reward center that allows our guests to proactively manage their loyalty account. We also will enhance our POS terminals in store to allow our cashiers to recognize and engage with our loyalty guests on a more individualized basis.","Our fourth growth strategy is to broaden our marketing reach beyond our historical strength in print advertisements. During Q1, we were pleased with the success of our \u201c21 Days of Beauty\u201d promotion, which focused on prestige color, skin, and special events in store. We saw solid performance of our gift with purchase offers for Valentine\u2019s Day and Mother\u2019s Day. ","We are also branching out into new areas to improve our marketing effectiveness. During the first quarter, in the \u201c21 Days of Beauty\u201d event, we supported it with radio, deeper public relations, and social media. We continued to run national magazine print campaigns to remind customers of Ulta\u2019s brand positioning, \u201cWelcome to Fabulous,\u201d with targeted ads focused on beauty and spring trends.","We are benefiting from the valuable relationship we established with Conde Nast about a year ago to communicate authority and credibility and position Ulta as a leader in beauty trends. During Q1 we conducted a multichannel editorial integration with a spring trend event curated from the beauty editors of Allure, Glamour, Lucky, Self, and Teen Vogue. This featured an integrated marketing program, with direct mail, in-store signage and handouts, sweepstakes, emails, and social media.","On the public relations and digital media side, we drove brand awareness with participation in New York\u2019s Fashion Week; celebrity events with Katy Perry, Faith Hill, and Tim McGraw; increased activity with Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest; and appearances on national television on shows like \u201cThe View.\u201d","In the second quarter, we\u2019ll continue to focus on expanding our marketing reach. Kicking this quarter off, in partnership with Lucky, a Conde Nast title, we beat the Guinness Book of World Records for completing the most makeovers in 24 hours, and were rewarded with seven minutes of airtime on the \u201cGood Morning America\u201d morning program.","Also in the second quarter, we held our \u201cLove Your Hair\u201d event, 14 days of special events and great deals that showed our guests how to get and maintain the latest hairstyle and color. This type of unique event, which leverages our product and service offering, is what our guests want, and we believe we are the only national retailer that can bring this to life for her.","For the balance of the second quarter, we\u2019re planning a strong Father\u2019s Day season with a compelling gift with purchase fragrance offer, offers for back to school season late in the quarter, and a national print advertising campaign for BB creams. Our marketing program will continue to harness print, direct mail, email, digital, social, and broadcast. Also, a new store endcap program that highlights new brands, new trends, and great value will make our experiential shopping environment more exciting.","The fifth leg of our growth strategy is our focus on Ulta.com. The opportunity is not only to generate higher ecommerce sales, but to become a true multichannel retailer to drive the Ulta brand, both in the physical and virtual environments. From a small base, Ulta.com continued its strong momentum in Q1, with solid increases in sales and traffic. ","During the quarter, we continued to see good performance with our Wednesday limited time Beauty Break offers, which we\u2019ve worked with our vendors to strategically place around certain launches, new items, and seasonality. ","On the technology side, I mentioned that we have built and launched a rewards portal, and we are working on further system enhancements to ensure a highly stable platform, faster page loads, and improved site-monitoring analytics. Looking ahead, we are investing in people, customer service, and technology to build a strong web presence that supports the Ulta brand and delivers a consistent multichannel customer shopping experience.","With a great start to the year, we believe that 2012 will again deliver strong growth in sales and earnings for Ulta, as we continue to provide a unique offering and in-store experience that is fueling consistent market share gains. The five pillars of growth we\u2019ve been executing on are still in the early stages. ","With many years of anticipated store growth ahead, an excellent pipeline of new product and service launches adding new brands to the portfolio, a compelling improved loyalty program to roll out to the rest of the chain with a significant opportunity to improve the effectiveness of customer data mining, plenty of opportunities to drive customer awareness and acquisition in all of our markets, and a dotcom business still in its infancy, we believe all of these drivers will fuel our growth in 2012 and in the years to come.","We will also continue to be very disciplined in expense management and maintaining a healthy balance sheet, enabling self-funded growth and free cash flow generation.","With that, let me turn the call over to Gregg for a more in-depth review of the financials.","Gregg Bodnar","Thanks Chuck. Our first quarter results were driven by better than expected sales and margin performance. We delivered a 22.8% increase in total sales, with strength across all categories, reflecting continued market share gains.","Same-store sales increased 10.1% on top of an 11.1% comp in Q1 of last year. Consistent with previous quarters, the comp came primarily from traffic, up 8%, with a 2% increase in average ticket. ","Gross profit dollars increased 27% to $171 million, with gross profit margin up 110 basis points, to 36%, driven by continuing improvement in merchandise margin and leverage in fixed store costs on a strong comp.","SG&A expenses increased 17% to $111 million, down 110 basis points as a rate of sales to 23.4%. This improvement was driven by leverage from strong comps and execution of our margin expansion strategies.","Preopening expense was up $1.3 million to $2.5 million as a result of our accelerated store opening program, with 18 new stores compared to 5 in Q1 2011 negatively impacting EPS in Q1 this year by about $0.01. ","Operating margin improved by 200 basis points to 12.1% versus 10.1% last year, driven by our team\u2019s relentless focus on disciplined execution and delivery of our margin expansion strategies.","Interest expense was immaterial, primarily representing fees associated with our credit facility, which remains unused.","Our tax rate was 39.3% versus 40.1% last year. The slightly lower tax rate was driven by a decrease in nondeductible stock option expense. Net income increased 49.7% to $34.9 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, versus $23.3 million, or $0.37 per diluted share in last year\u2019s first quarter.","Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, merchandise inventories at the end of the quarter were $332.1 million, compared to $255.5 million at the end of the first quarter last year, up about 9.6% on a per store basis. ","We continue to effectively manage our inventory, and we\u2019re happy to maintain inventory growth slightly below our comp growth, particularly in light of the fact that we delivered a stronger than expected comp and successfully opened our new northeast distribution center. ","The majority of the 9.6% per-store average inventory increase was to support the opening of our third DC. Excluding the investment to open a new facility, per-store average inventory increased approximately 4%, well below our comp growth of 10.1%. ","The northeast DC team has executed an excellent launch and as the facility ramps up their operations, our incremental DC inventory investment will subside as we rebalance between the facilities in the back half of the year. All of this effort is part of our plan to integrate the new DC into our overall supply chain. As a result, we will continue to manage our per-store inventory growth at a rate well below our comp growth rate, as the new DC becomes fully integrated into our supply chain. ","Chambersburg is already delivering excellent productivity and is on track to enable our expanded distribution network to achieve meaningful reductions in transportation costs. We expect to see these benefits from our network improvements in Q4, contributing to our overall margin expansion strategies.","Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $24.8 million, compared to $19.5 million in Q1 of 2011, driven by our accelerated store opening program. Depreciation and amortization was $21 million.","Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter, we currently estimate sales in the range of $466 million to $473 million, versus $395 million last year. We anticipate the comp store sales will increase in the range of 6-8% on top of the 11.3% comp in Q2 of 2011, for a two-year comp in the range of 17.3-19.3%.","New store openings are expected to be 22 versus 21 new stores in Q2 of last year. We expect our earnings per share will be in the range of $0.49-$0.51, including $0.02 negative impact from the planned addition of prestige brand boutiques and the expenses associated with the startup of our Chambersburg DC. This compares to EPS of $0.38 in Q2 of 2011. ","Gross profit margin is expected to increase approximately 80 basis points, at the midpoint of the guidance range, driven by improvement in merchandise margin and leverage of store expenses, partially offset by the costs associated with our new DC and accelerated depreciation for the previously mentioned expansion of prestige brand boutiques.","SG&A is expected to decrease around 50 basis points as a rate of sales, at the midpoint of the range, versus last year\u2019s 23.0% rate.","Preopening expenses are expected to be approximately $4.3 million, up $500,000 compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. As a result, operating margin is expected to increase approximately 130 basis points, at the midpoint of the range.","We expect our tax rate to remain at approximately 39.5% and we anticipate the fully diluted share count to be approximately $64.5 million. ","Looking ahead to the full year of 2012, given the strength we saw in Q1, we expect to deliver strong results ahead of our long term financial goals. We expect to achieve comp store sales growth in the range of 7%-8%, about 200-300 basis points above the high end of our long term goal of 3-5%. ","As a reminder, fiscal 2012 is a 53-week year for us. The extra week is included in the fourth quarter, and represents approximately $35 million in sales. We expect to deliver net income growth above the high end of our long term target of 25-30%, including the negative impact from our accelerated new store program, the new DC, and the addition of new prestige brand boutiques. ","The full year impact of these factors is approximately $0.08-$0.09 per share of additional operating expense. Partially offsetting these impacts is the benefit of the 53rd week operating results, which is approximately $0.03 per share.","We are on track to open about 100 stores and to complete 21 remodels in our plan for this year. In terms of store openings by quarter, after pulling some stores forward into Q1, we currently expect to open 22 stores in Q2, 48 stores in Q3, and 12 stores in Q4. Preopening expenses will be about $4.3 million in Q2, $7.5 million in Q3, and $2 million in Q4. ","Our real estate team has been very successful in pulling as many store weeks forward as possible, with the goal of getting stores opened earlier in the year and ramped up to benefit as much as possible from the Q4 holiday selling season.","Total preopening expense for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately $16 million, compared to approximately $10 million in fiscal 2011, representing an incremental $0.06 per share impact in 2012.","Capital expenditures in 2012 are expected to be approximately $180 million, which is about $51 million higher than our capital expenditure program in 2011. This increase is driven by the acceleration of our store expansion program, store remodels, and about $10 million incremental capital investment for the expansion of the prestige brand boutiques.","Depreciation and amortization will be approximately $90 million. As you know, we paid a special dividend of approximately $62 million in May. We have ample liquidity to continue to invest in the business. We expect to generate free cash flow again this year, and as always, we will evaluate the best use of any excess cash position.","Looking ahead to next year, we expect the investments we\u2019re making in the business this year to allow us to build upon our current success, continue to gain market share, and be a leader in the beauty retail space. We\u2019ll benefit in 2013 from the acceleration of store openings this year, with about 100 new stores, which will contribute to total sales, comps, profitability and cash flows versus the 60 stores benefiting 2012. We\u2019ll see our investment in the new DC pay off in 2013, after being a drag on earnings this year, and we\u2019ll also see the benefits of additional prestige brand boutiques.","In summary, we\u2019re investing appropriately to continue to drive performance in 2013. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Chuck. ","","Chuck Rubin","Thanks Gregg. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank all of our associates for making Ulta a compelling shopping environment for our guests. It\u2019s a result of their hard work that we gained market share, delivered excellent financial performance, and further positioned Ulta as a true beauty destination.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the operator so we can open up for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of [Ike Borgia] with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. ","[Ike Borgia] - JP Morgan","Chuck, I guess this one\u2019s for you. When you look at the business, it\u2019s been really very consistent with the comps in the double digit range for a little over two years now I think. I think last year you benefited a lot because you were on trend with the nail products and nail services, which were hot. Is there anything new out there today that you\u2019re seeing that\u2019s really trendy, and are you going after that? Just trying to see what\u2019s driving that comp right now. ","","Chuck Rubin","As I mentioned, some of the things in the first quarter, anti-aging products, BB creams, mascara, lips were all big trends. We think that that continues, and we\u2019re excited about the back half of the year. There\u2019s a lot of new product launches in the third quarter that are still coming, and into the fourth quarter. ","So it\u2019s a combination of the new products from existing brands that we\u2019ve talked about, some of the new services that we\u2019ve put in. Our salon business comps have continued to improve. They\u2019re running very well. And then it\u2019s the new brand introductions. So all of those things continue to be very good. ","One thing I mentioned in my prepared comments that I should call out, these at-home tools like Clarisonic, the hair removal, the acne treatment that I talked about that\u2019s coming, it\u2019s a small part of our business, but they\u2019re high ticket and we\u2019re selling a good number of units, and it\u2019s having a nice impact to our overall sales dollars. So that\u2019s also a trend that we started to see emerging stronger in the first quarter. ","[Ike Borgia] - JP Morgan","On the store rollout, you mentioned you\u2019re taking it from 1,000 to 1,200 domestically. You said that does not include international markets. On a high level, Chuck, could you talk about what potential down the road several years from now opportunities there could be in international markets? Does your format really work in other countries? And then I guess to that note, on the store base, when we look out to 2013 should we be thinking about 100 stores as kind of the run rate? Or is 20-22% growth kind of the run rate for the business going forward? ","","Chuck Rubin","Let me answer the second one first. What we said is that our business model is built on a 3-5 comp, 15-20% square footage growth. So we\u2019re pleased with how 2013 is setting up right now, but it\u2019s still early for that. So we\u2019ll update you as the year progresses. But our long term guidance is that 15-20% growth. This year, being 2012, we are growing at 22%, so obviously higher. ","If we can find the sites that are very attractive, and I stressed in my comments that we\u2019re looking for quality, not quantity - if we can find those sites we have the balance sheet to be able to do it. We have the capability to do it. And most importantly, there\u2019s the customer demand to do it. So we will pursue it as we see appropriate. And we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing, but it\u2019s still early for 2013. So just remember our 15-20% long term guidance. ","As far as the international, yeah, I think there is an opportunity for Ulta\u2019s model overseas, but I would stress that when you look at the three big buckets of opportunity, those being U.S. stores, the second being U.S. digital, and the third being international, clearly that third bucket of international is the lowest of the three, and it\u2019s the longest term. ","So we have significant growth opportunities for a number of years ahead of us to get to that 1,200 store count. There\u2019s the potential for a smaller store format. And clearly while our digital business is growing quickly, it is on a small base, so that U.S. business, digital and physical, is really what our focus is for the near to mid-term timeframe.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair & Company. Please go ahead. ","Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Company","If I look at the new store economics model that you guys have provided periodically, and clearly the cost side of it in recent years has certainly improved, as has the total sales volume, if you will. I guess one question would be, just based on the mass and if you look at the percentage of stores that are in different age groups, it would seem like you would likely be exceeding your plan right now kind of across various [age] buckets, that you would be exceeding that model. Is that fair to say? And the reason I say that is if you just sort of use the numbers in the model in terms of year one or year two comp sales growth, you\u2019re left with very high comps in year four or year five and beyond. And I\u2019m just curious what your thoughts are on that. ","Gregg Bodnar","The way to think about that is stores that are five years and older are performing meaningfully above what you would expect kind of over the long term, or the normal, if you will. Those stores in our model, six, seven, eight years out, we expect to produce more like low single digits. ","The fact of the matter is all of the strategies that Chuck referred to that have been driving our business, have a meaningful impact on mature stores. And you could argue have one of the largest impacts on mature stores because a big part of that is reaching out to our loyal customer base where the largest quantity is in a mature store, five years or older. ","So back to the macro on the store model, yes, the costs have come down. We\u2019re still building them for $900,000. The productivity of sales per square foot is getting slightly better. As we improve company operating margins, not all of it, but a significant part of that, contributes to the single store returns, because a big part of that affects the four-wall contribution of a store. So the store model keeps getting better. ","Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Company","And then one follow up would be if you can share anything about your expectations at this point for the incremental Lancome boutiques in terms of looking out a year. Do you expect that to show up materially in the aggregate at comp sales number now that you\u2019d be at a larger number of stores [unintelligible]? ","","Chuck Rubin","We added the 29 doors last fall with Lancome, so we\u2019re very pleased to be adding these 50. We\u2019ve commented before that we\u2019re pleased with our performance with the iconic brands. These 50 will get up starting in the third quarter. We expect to have them all done as the heat of the holiday season is upon us. I think the impact for this year is minor. It\u2019s negligible. I think that as you look out into future years, we believe that it is a nice addition to our offering. We\u2019ll be in 79 doors once these 50 are open. We\u2019ll see what happens from there, but we\u2019re very pleased, as is Lancome, with the level of sales and the type of guest that we\u2019re introducing to Lancome that\u2019s good for both us as well as the brand.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jill Caruthers with Johnson Rice. Please go ahead. ","Jill Caruthers \u2013 Johnson Rice","Following up on the last question, the incremental $10 million of capex you\u2019re devoting to expansion of boutiques and whatnot, can you talk about is that just supporting Lancome, or is it supporting existing prestige, or potential upcoming new prestige brands? ","Chuck Rubin","It\u2019s a little bit of all. So obviously opening the 50 boutiques for Lancome is costing us capital and some opex to get those open. But as I said in my comments, in a select number of additional doors, we are making some investments into the prestige arena, which will accommodate our ability to expand future boutiques. So that all is included in the $10 million that Gregg called out. ","Jill Caruthers \u2013 Johnson Rice","And then just a follow on on the increased long term store potential domestically. The incremental 200 stores that you found through further evaluation, is it focused on particular regions, or just basically broad-based? ","Chuck Rubin","It\u2019s broad-based in the contiguous U.S., the 48 states.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Joseph Altobello with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. ","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer","First, in terms of the new counters for Lancome, what brand or brands are they going to be displacing? And then secondly, what are the price points of these products relative to department stores? ","Chuck Rubin","The price points relative to department stores are the same. This isn\u2019t so much a price-based business. This is an experience- and service-based business. So the retail prices, everyone prices it as they see fit, but typically our prices are consistent to what you would find at a department store. But our service model, we believe, is, for our guest, a better one. ","As far as displacement, I think we\u2019ve talked before that our store, the average store size is about 10,000 square feet, and it\u2019s a pretty flexible store format. So we can move things around. So we go through an ongoing review of product and brand performance, and there are always things being added and things being removed. ","So I wouldn\u2019t call out specific brands that are going out, but I would say that the addition of Lancome into these 50 doors is a bit of the same process that we go through on an ongoing basis of refining the productivity and continuing to add new brands and new products and eliminating things that aren\u2019t performing. ","It\u2019s that process maybe a little bit on steroids, but it\u2019s an ongoing effort that we\u2019ll follow to get the space for these 50 boutiques. ","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer","And in terms of the new DC in Chambersburg, you guys have mentioned that it\u2019s supposed to weigh a little bit on gross margin this year, and I would imagine be somewhat beneficial next year. Could you quantify maybe how much that\u2019s going to reduce gross margin this year, and maybe how much it will help 2013? ","Gregg Bodnar","We said for the full year it will have a slight negative impact, so about 10 basis points. And then for next year, I would expect that negative 10 basis points could be 20-30 basis points positive, depending on how fast we can get it ramped up headed into next year. Typically, a DC in its first 12 months is where it gets its biggest productivity gains, but that\u2019s kind of where it\u2019s maturing cycle is. So it takes 12-plus months to get to the productivity on an existing DC. Certainly we\u2019ve put some equipment in this distribution center just to kind of better the operations versus our current distribution center. So overall, I\u2019d expect its productivity to meet and surpass the other DCs. ","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer","So by next year you\u2019ll be back to reducing inventory on a per-door basis I would imagine. ","Gregg Bodnar","Not inventory, Joe. This is operating costs. So this is driving margin improvement. ","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer","Right, but I would imagine this would also help on the inventory side as well. ","Gregg Bodnar","Not necessarily. You do wind up with a little bit of benefit, because you have a distribution center that\u2019s closer to stores. It reduces a little bit on lead time, but it\u2019s not material. ","Chuck Rubin","Just to add to that, Joe, right now if you look at the overall numbers that we put out, our inventory increased on a per-store basis by about 9% versus our 10% comp, so they were relatively close. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about reducing, I think you\u2019ll see the gap between inventory per-store growth and comp to be larger. If you take that 9%, though, and remove the northeast DC impact, the per-store inventory was up about 4%. So I think that\u2019s where Gregg\u2019s going, that if you extract that northeast DC part, that\u2019s how you should really consider that. Inventory per store will move in line with sales comps. ","Gregg Bodnar","So walk that forward Joe. In my prepared remarks, I said that when you pull out the northeast DC, the end of the first quarter inventory, the effect of that, for seeding it, to start shipping stores, we were up 4% on a 10% comp. As we work that DC into our network and rebalance inventories across the three DCs, adding stores into that Chambersburg facility, taking them out of other DCs, we\u2019ll continue to rebalance that inventory across the chain. But it still does take some incremental inventory as we add stores in our supply chain. ","When you go to next year, our philosophy will remain consistent. We need to make sure that we\u2019re providing a superior experience for guests, appropriate in-stocks, presentations, etc. So I expect that our inventory on a per-store basis will continue to be below our comp growth, but I don\u2019t expect it to decline. You certainly will get a little bit of an abnormal comparison in the first quarter next year, because you\u2019ll be cycling against the 9.6[%] for the new DC this year. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets","I guess the first question, thinking about the trends, the comp sales, over the quarter, when you look at February, March, April, I know we\u2019ve heard some retailers saying that hey, some of the strong trends we saw in February and March kind of reversed a little bit in April. So I guess I was wondering if you could provide the cadence of maybe the quarter, and then maybe how March kind of shaped up. And then I have a follow up question. ","Chuck Rubin","For a lot of reasons, we don\u2019t report comps on a monthly basis. So we don\u2019t get into the cadence during the course of the quarter. We\u2019ve never done that. We move the marketing calendar around from time to time, so there can be impacts that are driven by, as we optimize the marketing of that and the market calendar. So we don\u2019t get into intra-quarter comp flow. ","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets","Could you just maybe qualitatively say, is there anything in the May period that would give you any reason to pause that there\u2019s anything out there macro-wise. It doesn\u2019t sound it, but I guess that\u2019s just something obviously that everybody\u2019s kind of fearing right now with the U.S. economy too. ","Chuck Rubin","You mentioned May. May is in our second quarter. And that would be incorporated into the guidance that we gave. So I would remind everyone that, firstly, this is a pretty resilient business model. We have a lot of levers that we can pull. We have a broad range of prices, a broad range of product categories. We feel very good about the things that we can control. ","Obviously we live in a broader economic environment, and we understand some of the things that are going on in the world in general. To the best of our ability, that\u2019s all incorporated into our guidance that we gave in the second quarter. So we wouldn\u2019t break it down into what we\u2019re seeing thus far that\u2019s reflected already in the guidance we gave. ","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets","Fair enough. And then I guess just the other thing, Gregg, I\u2019m not sure if you talked about the timing of the remodels, the 21 over this year. We didn\u2019t see any in the first quarter. What\u2019s the flow of that through the course of the year? If you said it, I apologize. ","Gregg Bodnar","No, I didn\u2019t. 10 in Q2 and 11 in Q3. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jacob Zitter with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. ","Jacob Zitter - Robert W. Baird","I\u2019m calling in for Erika Maschmeyer. First, could you just quickly break out the components of gross margin expansion in the quarter? ","Gregg Bodnar","Sure. We were up 110 basis points and about 80 basis points of that was coming from , merchandise margin, and the rest coming from fixed store expenses. ","Jacob Zitter - Robert W. Baird","And then just a follow up on the prestige initiative. These stores, are these the ones that have already been remodeled, but maybe not to the latest level seven format? ","Chuck Rubin","There\u2019s a cross-section of stores. I would tell you that out of our store base at the end of the first quarter, about 85% of those stores are either a level six or a level seven. We consider those our current format. That roughly 85% of the mix being in level six or seven compares to about 75 a year ago. So between the combination of new stores and the remodels that we\u2019ve done, we\u2019re making very good progress. Lancome and these other prestige investments that we\u2019re making, they will not go into anything older than a level six store. So they\u2019ll all be in a six or a seven. So essentially they\u2019re going into our current format. ","Jacob Zitter - Robert W. Baird","And then just lastly, it sounds like the salon business is picking up steam. Did the comps sequentially improve there? And do you think maybe services like the OPI nail gel is lifting other parts of the salon business? ","Chuck Rubin","Yeah, I think a few things. The newness in the salon, the OPI nail gel, the introduction with Redkin of this Chromatics hair service, a lot of programs of training in some greater marketing that we\u2019ve done in the salon - I think all of them have contributed to some of the improved performance. Clearly in general this is a tough business in the industry as a whole, when you look at other public companies as they release their results. We\u2019re very pleased with our performance and it\u2019s been an improving part of our business over the past few quarters. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo","I wanted to ask if you\u2019re seeing any demographic changes, in your new additions maybe to your loyalty program age-wise or ethnicity-wise. ","Chuck Rubin","No, we run a pretty broad demographic customer base. We go from teens to 60s. Obviously the sweet spot is in the 30s, but both quantitatively and qualitatively, you really do see a broad cross section of people. It\u2019s not a typical spiky kind of bell curve. When you stand in our store and you watch, you typically see women shopping in groups. It\u2019s either a mother and a daughter or two friends shopping. So pretty broad, widely distributed in terms of age. ","Certainly the ethnicity represents the market that we do business in. Our average income customer tends to be upper income. Our average income is in the $70,000 range, a little bit above. And that really continues to be the case with the new customers as we open new stores, as well as expand our loyalty database. ","Evren Kopelman - Wells Fargo","And then when we look at the store maturity, what it used to be historically, as your brand awareness continues to increase, are you seeing maybe a faster store maturity pace? And lastly, with the accelerating new store openings, how is the rent environment that you\u2019re seeing? ","Gregg Bodnar","On the store maturity, as the brand grows in awareness I think there\u2019s much more opportunity in front of us. Even with 467 stores, with that 1,200 target for the U.S., there\u2019s much more opportunity to drive comps all the way through the maturity curve by increasing brand awareness. So I think more of that opportunity is in front of us than we\u2019re realizing today.","As far as rents go, it\u2019s been pretty even. You know, we have a concept that the customer seeks and the developer community seeks. We have a strong balance sheet that ensures that the developer is actually going to see execution in the leases and get payment. So I think it provides a good balance for our deal-makers to negotiate in this environment. ","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Randy Konik with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Amanda [Siglin] - Jefferies","Hi, this is Amanda [Siglin] on for Randy. Just a question around the new 1,200 store target. Your in depth analysis around that, just curious if it opened up new markets for stores, or if it\u2019s more going to be you see that you can cluster stores more in certain markets. ","Chuck Rubin","I think both. As the cost of getting these stores opened has improved, as we\u2019ve continued to add more data to our loyalty file, as we\u2019ve continued to learn more about refining the market size that we can operate a store in, all of those have demonstrated that there are markets that potentially a couple of years ago the company thought were too small to support an Ulta, but we believe now they can. Or we can congregate them into a market a bit tighter than had been thought of at one point. ","So just giving you some sense of the depth of that analysis, a lot of work and thought has gone into it, and we\u2019re very encouraged that the 1,200 number is out there. We\u2019re also very confident that it can be realized over time. ","Gregg Bodnar","And keep in mind, that\u2019s also based on the data that we have and based on the actual performance in those examples that Chuck\u2019s citing. ","Amanda [Siglin] - Jefferies","And then just to follow up on the ecommerce business, trying to get a sense of kind of how longer-term that could fit in as well. I know it\u2019s fairly small today. I guess are you doing any different to drive traffic to your website, and kind of in the next three to five years, how big do you think it could be overall as part of your business? ","Chuck Rubin","Well, it can be a lot bigger. I would remind you of the following. One, it is growing very quickly, but it is a small base. I also would remind you that it serves two purposes. Our digital effort serves two purposes. One is clearly there is more ecommerce revenue to be done, and that number should be significantly higher than what we have today in terms of our revenue. But the second is to reinforce Ulta as a brand to our customer, and bring to life our brand to that customer and augment what we do in stores. So the buzz terms out there are multichannel or omnichannel. ","The reality is in our business, which is a very emotional experiential category, digital complements what we do in our stores and what we can do through our ecommerce effort. What we need to do digitally is bring that experience to life for our customer, whether that\u2019s shopping, actually enabling her to spend money, or whether it\u2019s providing a community for her to talk to and learn from, whether it\u2019s providing trend information. Provide that physically in our stores, but virtually through our digital efforts as well. And that\u2019s the second purpose of our ecommerce effort, our Ulta.com effort. ","So one is the revenue increase, which should be significant, and the second is to bring the Ulta brand to life to the customer where and how she wants to engage with us. ","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Chuck Rubin","Okay. Well, let me thank everybody for your interest in Ulta and joining us on the call today, and we will look forward to speaking with you at the end of next quarter, in September. Thanks so much.

Thank you. You may begin.","Laurel Lefebvre","Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Ulta Beauty's second quarter 2014 conference call.","Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer, and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are Janet Taake, Chief Merchandising Officer, and Dave Kimbell, Chief Marketing Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of our company's Safe Harbor language.

Good afternoon everyone.","We're delighted to announce very strong second quarter results and to share the outcome of our updated strategic plan and financial targets. I'll talk about our long-term vision, five-year financial targets, and strategic imperatives today, then following up with more detail at Analyst Day in Chicago next month.","First, a quick review of the second quarter headlines. We grew the top line 22% and drove the best comp we've achieved since the second quarter of 2012. Total company comparable sales were 9.6%, on top of an 8.4% comp in the second quarter of 2013, both including the impact of Ulta.com. Strength in Prestige and Mass cosmetics, boosted by some very successful new products and brands, as well as rapid growth in e-commerce, drove these exceptional results.","We are pleased to see transaction growth contribute more than ticket growth to our same-store sales. Solid gross margin performance reflected strong sales of Prestige and professional healthcare categories, coupled with fewer discounts compared to a year ago.","Earnings per share grew 34%, with strong flow-through from better-than-expected sales, healthy product margins, and some benefit from the timing of marketing expenses. Scott will discuss the second quarter in more detail and the outlook for the rest of 2014 in just a few moments.","Now I'd like to walk you through a review of our strategic planning process and our new five-year financial targets. As a reminder, we set out several months ago to refresh our strategic plan. This process was led by me and my full senior team. We formed a fact-based, guest-centric and total enterprise view of the guest experience that we want to deliver in the future, and determine what is required to do so. We feel confident about the opportunity to continue to drive growth and guest satisfaction in the years ahead.","Our approach was to understand Ulta's current strengths and opportunities and then project guest needs, the potential competitive set, and the omni-channel landscape of the future. We defined Ulta's path from the perspective of brand positioning, guest experience, product and services portfolio, and store and e-commerce expansion plans. We also projected the IT and supply chain requirements to achieve our strategy, then consider the financial impact of all those factors to establish a five-year plan that delivers sustainable growth and strong shareholder returns.","To summarize the primary outcomes of this work, we've identified six strategic imperatives as the foundation of continued strong growth. We've identified areas of focus and investment that give us confidence that we can maintain strong top and bottom-line growth rates. We developed a five-year financial model to support this strategic framework. And finally, we developed a capital allocation strategy.","We think about the strategic plan as evolutionary, not revolutionary. At the outset, we recognized that our core business model is strong. The original insight of our founders that women want a shopping experience that reflects the entire range of her beauty purchases is still very relevant today, almost 25 years after the first store opened. So the core of what Ulta is all about is not changing. This is about sharpening our view and getting even more focused on delivering a relevant and differentiated business model that drives sustainable profitable growth.","In fact, we believe many of the key drivers of our past results still have plenty of runway and will continue to deliver, namely new store growth, expansion of our Prestige assortment, a strong, compelling loyalty program, a clear guest target, a woman we refer to is a beauty enthusiast. She represents about half of the spend in the beauty category, she's highly engaged in newness and discovery, a highly differentiated offering, with an unmatched breadth of assortment across categories, brands and services, and rapid e-commerce growth.","We also agreed on key opportunities we want to focus on to ensure long-term sustainable growth. And those include increasing Ulta's brand awareness and acquiring more new customers, becoming less reliant on discount and overtime in a careful and measured way, and developing the omni-channel capabilities our guests expect us to offer to keep pace with the marketplace. Examples of these capabilities will include ordering in store and delivering to home, and checking availability of inventory online, as well as others.","We established our vision for the future of Ulta, to be the unmatched beauty authority, by providing women a compelling, unique and on-trend array of products and experiences. We aspire to become the favorite beauty destination, the most loved and admired by our guests, associates, communities, partners and investors.","Supporting this vision, we articulated six strategic imperatives that we believe will drive sustainable growth for Ulta. One, acquire new guests and deepen loyalty with existing guests. Two, differentiate by delivering a distinctive and personalized guest experience across all channels. Three, offer a relevant, innovative and often exclusive products that excite our guests. Four, deliver exceptional services in three core areas: hair, skin health and brows. Five, grow stores in e-commerce to reach and serve more guests. And six, invest in infrastructure to support our guest experience and growth and capture scale efficiency.","At the upcoming Analyst Day, we plan to give you more color on each of these six strategic imperatives, and show you how we're bringing the Ulta brand experience to life for our guests.","The main components of our new five-year financial targets are as follows. We expect to maintain comparable sales growth in the 5% to 7% range. We plan to open approximately 100 stores per year. For the next couple of years, these are expected to be almost entirely our 10,000 square-foot prototype, pending findings from our upcoming small store tests.","We anticipate that e-commerce will grow to represent about 10% of our sales. This model is expected to deliver earnings per share growth in the low 20% range over the next five years, excluding the impact of the supply chain investment. As you know, we're making significant investments in systems and supply chain, including a multiyear supply chain transformation designed to improve our inventory productivity, in stocks, and to free up labor and stores to be more customer-facing.","This supply chain work will also enable omni-channel capabilities to position us to keep up with changing consumers' expectations in the years ahead. This investment is expected to reduce our earnings per share growth rate by percentage points in the mid single-digit in 2015 and 2016. After which we anticipate EPS growth will return to the low 20% range. And these targets exclude any benefit from share repurchases.","Despite these investments, operating margin is expected to remain stable for the next couple of years before heading up towards our long-term mid-teens target. These targeted range are not meant to represent specific guidance for 2015. We'll provide guidance for 2015 at the time we normally announce annual guidance, which will be on our March 2015 earnings call.","Now turning to our capital allocation strategy. We recognize that we have more cash than we need on the balance sheet today, and this cash is expected to grow significantly over time as our business grows and our CapEx needs moderate. We plan to maintain our strong balance sheet and maintain enough cash to invest in organic growth, as well as to keep some dry-powder for [ph] potential acquisitions or partnerships in the future. And we do plan to buy back shares going forward.","We expect to offset dilution and, beyond that, give ourselves the flexibility to buy back more aggressively based on market conditions. Today we announced a new share repurchase authorization for $300 million, which replaces our existing program. We announced our intention to implement a 10b51 plan to give us that flexibility.","I believe our plan represents a strong set of strategic imperatives and initiatives and that our results will place Ulta in the top tier of high-performing retailers. We'll continue to drive market share gains and deliver strong, sustainable sales and earnings growth, making our company a very attractive investment. I also know that we have the best associates in the industry who love what they do and are excited to bring more beauty into the lives of our guests.","So let me turn over now to Scott to cover the quarter and update to our 2014 guidance.","Scott Settersten","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon everyone.","Second quarter sales were $734.2 million, compared to $601 million last year, an increase of 22.2%. Comparable sales increased 9.6%. The retail-only comp was 8.3%, with the follow-on [ph] business comping slightly higher at 8.4%. E-commerce growth of 54.9% added 130 basis points to comp.","We were very pleased with the balance between transaction and ticket increases, with transactions up 5.8% and ticket up 3.8%. The ticket increase was driven by a modest increase in units per transaction, but mostly by higher average selling price due to strength in Prestige categories and less discounting overall. Retail-only comparable transactions increased 5%, a significant acceleration compared to the first quarter.","Since we're spending quite a bit of time on this call discussing the strategic plan and long-term financial targets, we thought we would share a condensed version of our usual discussion of our business drivers.","From a real estate perspective, we opened 19 stores during Q2, ending the quarter with 715 stores. We also completed four remodels. New store productivity remained strong, and we're also seeing solid comps in our more mature stores, as all classes of stores are benefiting from the momentum in new brand and product launches.","On the merchandising front, newness continues to be a major driver of our business. After rolling out It cosmetics and Mally to every store during the first quarter, these new brands were solid contributors to our growth. We are also pleased with the success of our chain-wide expansion of Urban Decay, and excellent results in our Clinique, Lancome and Benefits boutiques.","Exciting new product launches during the quarter included an innovative liquid foundation from Bare Minerals, a highly anticipated eyeliner to complement Benefits, best-selling [indiscernible] mascara, as well as new fragrances like Armani C and Marc Jacobs Daisy Dream.","To update you on our loyalty program and CRM, we now have 14 million active members and are very pleased with the performance of the markets that were converted to the ultimate rewards points-based program in February. Having all customers on one platform allows us to communicate the benefits of the loyalty program more efficiently, and deliver CRM campaigns across the entire loyalty customer base, compared to just half our customers before the conversion.","On the marketing side, second quarter highlights included our Love Your Hair event, which we enhanced with content more focused on education and benefits, versus just price promotions. We also saw excellent results from our semiannual event promoting jumbo sizes of hair care products at great prices.","Finally, turning to Ulta.com, we continue to see strong performance from our e-commerce business. In July we released exciting new features and functionality to the site, designed to enhance the discovery and browse experience, with the addition of rich editorial content. New pages for Get Inspired, Beauty Consultation and Share & Play, focused on trends, new arrivals, best kept secrets, advice and social content.","We added online booking capability for our salon appointments for all stores. We also began to host live chats on Ulta.com, featuring some of our vendor partners like the founders of the brand Carol's Daughter and Tart, which were very well-received by our guests. Finally, we released our first iPad app in July, designed to provide our guests with a unique opportunity to browse, discover and share our products.","Turning back to the P&L. Gross profit dollars increased 22.3% to $259.3 million. Gross profit margin was flat year over year at 35.3%, primarily driven by stronger-than-expected sales of Prestige cosmetics and professional healthcare products, as well as a modest rent and occupancy leverage on higher-than-expected same-store sales. This was offset by slight deleverage in supply chain expense due to costs associated with the expansion of e-commerce fulfillment capabilities in our Chambersburg distribution center.","SG&A expenses rose 17.4% to $157.8 million, down 90 basis points as a percentage of sales at 21.5% versus 22.4% last year, primarily due to leverage on strong sales as well as timing of marketing spend. We also pushed some of the planned expenses related to test-and-learn initiatives later in the year. About half of our earnings outperformance in the quarter was due to the impact that SG&A expenses moved later in the year.","Preopening expense was $3.6 million compared to $4.8 million in Q2 of 2013, driven by 19 store openings during the quarter, compared to 33 new stores opened last year. Operating margin increased 120 basis points to 13.3%, versus 12.1% in Q2 of last year.","Net income increased 35.4% to $60.8 million or $0.94 per diluted share, versus $44.9 million or $0.70 per diluted share last year. Earnings per share grew 34.3%.","Turning to the balance sheet. Inventories were $541.5 million at the end of the quarter, compared to $461.2 million at the end of Q2 2013, driven by 106 net new stores opened since August last year. Inventories were flat on a per-store basis as our supply chain and store teams continue to keep inventory very clean.","Capital expenditures were $55 million for the quarter, driven primarily by our new store opening program, as well as supply chain and IT investments. And depreciation and amortization for the quarter were $31.9 million.","We moved $100 million of the cash on our balance sheet to short-term investments, with a maturity of less than 12 months, and as a result ended the quarter with $363 million in cash. Our free cash flow year to date is about $39 million, and we're well on track to generate more than $100 million in free cash flow this year.","With a very strong first half of the year under our belt, we are raising our view of our full-year performance. We anticipate comparable sales to increase in the 7% to 8% range, and total sales to increase in the 20% range for the year. We expect that earnings per share will be in the 20% range this year, excluding any impact related to share repurchase activity. We expect to invest about $265 million in capital in 2014.","Turning now more specifically to the third quarter of 2014. We expect sales to increase in the range of $724 million to $736 million, versus $618.8 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 6% to 8%. Preopening expense is expected to come in around $7.1 million, with 50 stores planned to open in the third quarter. We expect to achieve earnings per share in the range of $0.79 to $0.84, compared to $0.70 in Q3 of last year. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 38.2% and our fully diluted share count will be approximately $64.8 million excluding any potential share repurchase activity.","With that, I'll turn the call over to our conference call host to begin the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we are conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question is coming from the line of Mr. Brian Tunick with JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open, you may proceed with your question.","Brian Tunick \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yes. Thanks very much, and congratulations. Two questions. One, maybe just more color on the SG&A timing shift, how that's changed, and what we should be thinking there. And then maybe on the, Mary, if you could talk about the 1,200-store target. I know in the guidance you talked about 100 stores a year. But just ahead of the Analyst Day I guess, can you talk about sort of it's at least 1,200 in the big format and then small markets can add to that? And does that change as you think about e-commerce becoming 10% of sales? Just curious about what you think long term about the 1,200 store target.","Mary Dillon","Sure, Brian. Thank you. And let me start with the store question. So as I said, you know, we're reiterating that our target has been continue to be, you know, at least 1,200 stores. And that, we think about that as really our current 10,000 square-foot format in our suburban type market. And we'll talk more about this at Analyst Day, but one of the things that we're learning about right now is the small store format that we're opening up two this year. We're going to learn about that.","So, you know, given how our stores are performing, we think that's a pretty good target, possibly conservative target. If we find the small format of interest, those would largely be incremental to our 10,000 square-foot format. We're starting those in some rural [ph] markets and in the future potentially urban markets. You know, that would be down the road.","You know, new stores continue to be a great investment and they continue to perform. And we think about, relative to our strategic plan, getting more stores is a great way for us to get more guests. Beauty is a business that really is contingent on an experience that is -- that involves the physical experience. And as we see our guest experience in the future being able to delight our guests, obviously stores and e-commerce can work really well together, we think, to deliver on that.","You know, our store expansion is always going to be contingent on finding high-quality sites. We have a very robust and rigorous process. But we continue to see plenty of excellent real estate opportunities in the years to come.","Scott Settersten","And as far as the SG&A question is concerned, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, roughly half of the beat [ph] for the quarter is SG&A related kind of expenses, so, call it $0.05 roughly. You know, half of that is marketing, the other half is test-and-learn. So the test-and-learn program was delayed a little bit, more than what we expected when we gave second quarter guidance. So we thought it was better to wait until we had those projects properly scoped and metrics aligned, so we knew how to measure success with the completion of the test period.","And on the advertising and marketing side, these were efficiencies that were identified by our marketing teams that we, in the first half of the year or second quarter, that we expect to redeploy in fourth quarter, to drive smaller new customer acquisition kind of activities.","Brian Tunick \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Very helpful. See you in a couple of weeks.","Scott Settersten","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair & Co. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.","Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Co.","Good afternoon, and I'll add my congratulations. Just wanted to, first, with regard to the comp, and obviously very strong performance, where are you seeing kind of the most upside across the age of stores? Is it pretty balanced, or is it more newer comping stores? Just that would be my first question.","Scott Settersten","Dan, I would say, you know, the general rule of thumb is, when you have strong performance being driven by these new brand launches and exciting new things that merchants are bringing into the business, it really - rising tides lift all boats in this business. I know I've said that before to many of our investors. I mean you just - it's not a single class of store or vintage of stores, or older stores versus newer stores. It really helps drive productivity in the whole fleet.","Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Co.","Okay, great. And then with regard to the long term, I find it particularly impressive on the top [ph] sales outlook. Obviously some of that is that the new plan includes e-commerce, whereas I think [indiscernible] three to five did not. But could you comment on what are some of the things that, you know, what are some of the components of that, or, you know, what are the things that you expect to kind of help drive a stronger underlying comp versus --","Mary Dillon","Sure. You know, first of all, we're in a growing industry, right? Especially the Prestige side of beauty has been showing good growth, and we participate heavily in that. As we look at our guests and look at her needs in the future, we believe that there's more market share that we can gain with the beauty enthusiasts and that our insights about how to meet her needs continue to deepen every day. So in that sense we think there's plenty of opportunity for growth.","We also know that, we've talked about this, the majority of our current growth is coming from our current loyalty members, which is great. And they love what Ulta has to offer. But an area of opportunity for us is, a big part of our test-and-learn this summer, or this fall now, is about how do we get new guests to become aware of and try or either - or retry perhaps Ulta. So we think about it almost as a relaunch of the Ulta proposition, and again there's plenty of women that are in this consumer segment that we believe would be very attracted to our proposition.","So, new guest acquisition, e-commerce growth as you said, store growth, all the six strategic imperatives are largely around driving a different way to drive growth.","Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Co.","Great. Best of luck. See you guys soon.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open, you may proceed with your question.","Aram Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research","Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask you a bit about your current capabilities. We hear a lot about investments a little bit last year, this year, and obviously for the next two. Can you just give us a sense as to what you're capable of today and what you'd like to be capable of, whether it's warehouse management systems or merchandise systems or financial systems or distribution? Just can you give us a little bit of a lay of the land of where you are now with all of these capabilities and what you think you're missing and where you'll be in those couple of years that you can do that you can't do now?","Mary Dillon","Yeah. Well, first of all, Aram, our business is obviously running pretty darn well today, right? So we obviously have some core capabilities that we're using every day to execute the business. What we have identified is a couple of things. One, as everybody knows, retail is changing rapidly in terms of guest expectations. So the omni-channel aspect of our capability is one we need to invest in to grow. We anticipate that the guests in the future is going to want a seamless experience and one that we don't necessarily offer today. It's not a big barrier to our growth, I'd say, as you see the performance that we're having. But we know that that's going to be something that she's going to need to have in the future. So, a more seamless ability to, you know, buy something, you know, bring it back to the store, order in store, have it shipped at home, be able to know in advance what we have in inventory in our stores. So, all those kind of basic shopping and retail capabilities are part of what we'll be investing in.","Also, you know, just a part of this investment is really just around growth. As we continue to go down this growth path, which is a strong growth path, and we continue to drive a number of stores, we need more capability in the system. And so that's part of the investment too, which are just pretty straightforward.","And also we just think overall end to end we could have a more efficient system than we have today. So, whether it's how we receive our orders and work with our vendors, how our stores are stacked as the product comes in to the stores, there's -- and how we reforecast and replenish, we know that there's ways that we can be smoother, I guess faster, have less out-of-stocks, you know, all those things that we know will just help our business be more a better experience for guests and drive some efficiencies in the long run.","Aram Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research","So if I can just drill down into that just a little bit. So I mean, are we on automated replenishment? Do we have some kind of store scheduling for labor? You know, just trying to figure out, we have the space optimization program, do we have price optimization, are all these things kind of totally new or they -- I'm just trying to understand whether you have these capabilities or not.","Scott Settersten","Yeah. You know, I don't know if we want to go through a specific laundry list of what's in and what's out, Aram, but I will say what you described predominantly we don't operate in that kind of environment today. So we've got good systems in our stores, over the last couple of years we've made some investments in store laboring, and we're working on test management in the stores. We're just about ready to finalize our rollout with a new POS system which we think will be best-in-class, kind of check-out experience for our guests. So, again, early stages of that.","On the supply chain and the merchandise organization, I think you've heard and I think many of our long-term investors have heard us say that we still do things kind of the hard way. We muscle through a lot of things, that we know factually that there's better, more efficient ways to do that, whether it's forecast and replenishment, which Mary mentioned, and helping our vendors help us forecast the business and get it to our DCs more effectively, and getting it to our stores, right, in the right kind of what I would say delivery mode, boxes or shelf-ready, you know, so that we can take time out of the backroom and get into more guest-facing time.","Aram Rubinson \u2013 Wolfe Research","I appreciate that color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Oliver Chen with Citigroup. Your line is now open, you may proceed with your question.","Oliver Chen \u2013 Citigroup","Hi. Congratulations on solid results. Regarding the outlook for the gross margin. Your inventories are under really good control at this point. The gross margin comparison, you know, as we look at it, is a little bit harder than easier in the fourth quarter. Is the expectation that you'll be able to keep promotions under control versus last year? And how are you seeing kind of the promotional environment unfold as we approach holiday?","Mary Dillon","Okay. Oliver, thank you. You know, the promotional environment, right, that's -- we expect that as we get into the holiday, there'll continue to be a competitive promotional holiday. I don't think there's any reason that that will, you know, it's always going to be like that, right? The overall sentiment right now, consumer sentiment, is strong, and I think we hear retailers feeling pretty optimistic about their inventory situation going into holiday. But nonetheless, we know that's a competitive time.","You know, we're also seeing some success. And again, I would say we're walking before we run, but we're I think every day getting at how we can use some of our tools like our CRM capabilities to be more targeted with our offers and drive value in ways that are less about price discounting. So, you know, would we need to be more promotional than last year, I doubt it. Will it be a promotional holiday? We'd expect that. But we feel, as you can see in our guidance, optimistic about the rest of the year.","Scott Settersten","And Oliver, I would just add, as far as rate goes, again gross profit margin rate overall is flat year to year in the quarter. You may recall, last quarter call we mentioned loyalty program, right? It's still going to be a headwind for us for the rest of the year. There's still some product mix challenges that we had. We did a good job this quarter overcoming some of that, and we have more of that planned for the rest of the year, so we'll do our, you know, do the best we can to make sure we keep that all in balance.","Oliver Chen \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. And Mary, on the product side, you know, one of the strategic highlights is the focus on hair, skin care -- skin health and brows. Was that is that consistent with how you had been or are there categories that you may deemphasize as you focus on these three?","Mary Dillon","Yeah -- I'm sorry, go ahead.","Oliver Chen \u2013 Citigroup","I was also just curious about, you know, articulating your thoughts on your competitive advantage versus department stores.","Mary Dillon","Sure. Okay. Well, first of all, that strategic imperative actually was talking about services. And actually one of the earlier questions was about levers for growth, and I should have mentioned we do see that our services are absolutely one of the areas that strategically are important to us, to your point, one of our points of differentiation, and we believe an area that we could focus on to drive future growth.","Our salon guest -- salon is a small part of our business today, as you know. That's our best guest though. She comes more frequently, she spends more, and she loves the experience. And we've kind of carved out three pillars that we think we can -- we excel in today and can excel in even more in the future. And it's about hair, basically cut and color, and also hair services that involve trends like braids, things like that. On the skin side, as you know, we have a partnership with Dermalogica and we have trained aestheticians in our stores. Small part of our business today in terms of that service. We know that could be -- it will be an area of growth. And then lastly, brows, particularly through our partnership with Benefit and their brow bars.","So we look at those three pillars of service as areas that we will focus on and drive [indiscernible] today how to drive more new guests to try our salon and come back. And those often, not as much as I'd like, but often have products attached to them. So you can imagine that's a great flywheel for us.","So that's an area that really dovetails I guess with your second question which is, you know, part of the work we do in strategic plan is just really step back and say, what is our competitive advantage today and what would it be in the future? And, you know, it's a competitive industry. Everybody is interested in beauty. It's a growth industry. But we've got advantages that we think we can really push and accelerate. And it is about this total guest experience that we think we'll get even better as we allow our associates in store to have even more guest-facing time, as our, perhaps, our systems get more efficient and some of the ways that Scott described.","So, you know, Ulta should be able to give an experience that's very different and unique, different than the department store, different than mass outlets and different than other specialty stores. And that, you know, we plan that that would be kind of our core. We differentiate and we'll lead with that.","Oliver Chen \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you. Best regards.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Gary Balter with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open, you may proceed with your question.","Mr. Balter, your line is now open.","It appears there's a connection issue with Mr. Balter's line. We'll move on to the next question coming from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open, you may proceed with the question.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks so much and good afternoon. My first question relates to capital. Obviously you talked about the SG&A impact of some of the investments you're going to make. Can you talk about, as the store growth I guess flattens out, whether the investments that you're making, contemplate, any kind of bump in CapEx?","And then also related to capital, you talked about buying back stock at least at the level you'd need to offset dilution. What is the typical dilution you would see in a given year from options issuance?","Scott Settersten","As far as the CapEx question is concerned, we're projecting $265 million for 2014. You know, directionally that might be at a slightly more elevated rate over the next couple of years as we get through the supply chain cycle here event. But we expect it to moderate once we get past 2016, generally speaking.","And as far as dilution, or dilution is concerned, we'd expect that to be roughly maybe 1 percentage point, Matt, you could estimate, is what the buyback dilutive offset would be.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. One other quick financial question, then a strategic one. As we think about the $0.05 or so that you deferred from the second quarter to the remainder of the year, should we think about it as being roughly half and half Q3, Q4 based on the comments you made earlier?","Scott Settersten","Yeah, I think that's a good approximation.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. And then finally, I think you'll have an extensive strategic discussion in Chicago in a few weeks, but very briefly on mobile, on the -- you piqued my interest and you talked about having the iPad app, which on the one hand I guess you're not the first retailer, on the other hand it speaks to the opportunity. Can you talk about how you think your customer in your category deploys mobile differently than for other retail categories and what you think its potential is relative the online business that you've been doing already?","Mary Dillon","Sure. Well, you know, obviously mobile is a growing part of our business as it is for everybody, and we know that that's increasingly a way that our guests engage with our brand as well as others. Probably one of the biggest opportunities for us with mobile is the ability for her to be learning about content, about brands and products and services, whether she's in our store and not in our store, or outside of our store, as well as for our associates. You know, a part of our technology plan is to allow them to have more access to mobile technology in the stores so that she can be an even bigger expert on every brand that we offer than she is today, frankly, our associates. It's hard to be able to do that all the time. Having more access to mobile information helps get us to the same position that our guests are in.","Mobile transactions are continuing to grow as a percentage of our transactions, and we'll expect that to continue to happen.","Matthew Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee. Your line is now open, you may proceed with your question.","Ike Boruchow \u2013 Sterne Agee","Hi everyone. Congrats on a great quarter. Thanks for taking my question.","Mary, I want to -- can we dive in a little bit on the new marketing -- new customer acquisition side and things you've been doing and tests you've been doing regionally with some new marketing, new CRM capabilities? And then to take that a step further, could you comment on the traffic increase you saw in the quarter and maybe how much of that was new customer traffic and how that compares to the prior couple of quarters?","Mary Dillon","Well, you know what, really at the Analyst Day we'll have more color on some of the tests-and-learns and the experiments that we're doing. There's a couple of different things going on. One is that we have an end-market advertising test that just started in several markets, to see just in a general way, can we drive new customer acquisition through basically driving awareness, through a more mass media and digital media kind of approach? So that's something that just started, and we'll know a lot more about that soon. And that's one way. We know that basically top-of-mind awareness for Ulta is not as high as it can be. And we believe that by driving that awareness and positioning the brand in a way that, you know, we represent, which is this great place for women to discover [indiscernible] beauty, that we think there's upside there. So we'll learn more about that.","And certainly, Dave Kimbell and his team are also using our CRM capability to run I guess several small-scale experiments right now around how can we either get, you know, guests who aren't coming as often as we'd like, to see what could incent her to come more often, or using multiple forms of either social marketing to see if we can target new prospective guests to try Ulta. So a lot of that is in process. And we feel optimistic that that'll be part of our growth strategy going forward.","Ike Boruchow \u2013 Sterne Agee","Can you comment -- are you already beginning to see some of the fruits of your labor on new customer acquisition front?","Mary Dillon","You know, most of our sales right now are really being driven by our current guests, and she's coming more often and spending more, which is great. So it's really I'd say early stages.","Now our e-commerce business is one of the ways that we are seeing some new customer acquisition, and that again will be an area for growth for us as well.","Ike Boruchow \u2013 Sterne Agee","Got it. Thanks everyone.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is again coming from the line of Gary Balter. Sir, your line is now open, you may proceed with your question.","Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you. I'll try again this time. First of all, congratulations. Following up on Ike's question a little bit, Mary, when you first came and met with a lot of the sell side people, one of your concerns was that Ulta isn't as well-known as [indiscernible] and you were trying to figure out, how do we improve that? Obviously you've had great traffic drivers this quarter. As you, without giving all the answers today, October 15th meeting, what's your perception now of Ulta? Do you feel that you've made some nice progress in terms of the customer understanding who you are and have you closed the gap a lot and if you changed your perception of it?","Mary Dillon","Okay. Thank you, Gary. You know, I would characterize that less of a concern that I saw and more of an opportunity, and I still see it today, because I think we're really in the early stages of driving that new customer acquisition. So, you know, most of what we're doing right now, we're refining the tactics that we've used previously, and I think getting even better at them, but they're largely targeted at our current loyalty members, and that's largely where our growth is coming from, which is great. It says that our current guests love us, they're coming more often and spending more, and we're getting growth on e-commerce, and some of that is new guests. But, you know, we believe again why we're confident about the long-term targets that we're providing is that there's still that opportunity.","So I would say really, Gary, I wouldn't feel -- I don't think it's very different today in terms of the awareness and sharpness of the perception of Ulta. But we have done the work to identify more insights about our current guests, prospective guests, and how to position and really drive awareness to the brand. And we'll know more [indiscernible] so I don't want to over-promise. You know, we don't know yet what the response will be. But that work is still in process. And we'll know a lot soon.","Gary Balter \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open, you may proceed with your question.","Neely Tamminga \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Great. Good afternoon. Just two quick questions [indiscernible] specific here. On the new POS system, what are some of the key functionalities that are making you guys really excited about launching this new POS system? Number one.","And number two, what sort of kind of key metrics or problems or KPIs, however you want to look at it, on the e-commerce business are you looking to address over the next couple of years? I mean is it really kind of about, you know, bounce rate, sort of email campaigns? Is it about cart abandonment? Like give us some sense of what you're going to improve on the e-commerce side too? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Okay, thank you. On the POS front, I'd say a couple of key categories of benefits. One is speed of transaction which we know, you know, there's always a little bit the learning curve, but our associates are, the ones who are using it, love it, and they are seeing the benefits of it. So we know that that'll help speed the transaction, as well it's going to give us the ability to have more information of our guest when she comes in. So over time we believe that that's going to help us to even be more personalized in terms of what we offer her.","And so -- and also one of the capabilities is going to be to be able to order in the store and have it delivered to your home. So we think about, for example, on our small store tests, you know, those are smaller stores, not going to carry every single SKU. So the ability for our guests to be able to still have access to everything that we sell will be a benefit as well. Those are just a few of them.","Dave, do you want to comment on the e-comm metric?","David Kimbell","Yes, absolutely. You know, as we look at e-commerce, first of all, we're really pleased with the results that we've had so far. We're really just about a year into kind of the relaunch of our site, and really happy with that. And because we're really still relatively new, and there's a lot of foundational pieces that we're really still very much focused on, driving traffic, we continue to have success in getting new customers [indiscernible] customers that come to our site. We saw traffic increase pretty significantly in the second quarter last year through -- this year through sharper, more sophisticated customer acquisition efforts. So we'll continue to do that.","You know, our conversion rate through optimization of our site experience, we really significantly improved a year ago, and we're continuing to fine-tune that experience through that check-out process, the way the cart works, we're making improvements to that site experience to make sure we're, as you mentioned, limiting cart abandonment and maximizing conversion.","And AOB [ph], as we get -- as we improve our merchandising approach, get learnings about what's working in the e-commerce environment, maximize the understanding of our best guest and how she's experiencing both our brick-and-mortar retail and our online, and personalize and customize our marketing to her, we think we're making progress on AOB [ph] through our merchandising, and we'll continue to do that.","So a lot of it's really foundational, and we're going to continue to focus on those efforts going forward.","Neely Tamminga \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Fantastic. Thank you. Best of luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open, you may proceed with your question.","Evren Kopelman \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thanks. Good afternoon. Two questions. First, on the comp growth, the strong comp growth in the quarter. How -- do you have a sense of how much that conversion of [indiscernible] people to the new loyalty program in the first quarter, how much that is helping traffic this year as people are getting more emails [indiscernible] some things like that?","And the second question is on the e-commerce. Can you discuss how you expect the product mix and the margin to evolve over your long-term horizon? Thanks.","Scott Settersten","You know, as far as the comp drivers for the quarter, we -- I guess I will tell you, we're not going to be able to, you know, disaggregate the comp [indiscernible] versus not, or new versus old customer, existing customer. We can say with certainty that typically, historically what we saw when we implemented the loyalty programs, that it took a while for the customers to kind of come back. The sales performance was a little weaker on conversion. And then we kind of cycled back through the course of like a full one-year period, we kind of get the comp back.","This time, again hopefully we learned some lessons on our last conversion cycle, this time we've seen sales kind of maintain. So we haven't seen any degradation or any weakness in sales with those people that have been converted. So that was a really great sign for us that the conversion has gone very well.","As far as product margin mix is concerned, I think we're talking about 2014, Evren. You know, we talked overall on margin rate, that we still have this loyalty headwind. We will expect to have that forward to the remainder of 2014.","We're still seeing one of our more important categories, professional nail, has been a bit weaker than what we are expecting this year, so that's a headwind on our margin rate as well. Again the merchant team is working hard to try to mitigate that. We saw some of that in the second quarter, with better performance than we're expecting. And we'll continue to do that in the back half of the year.","Evren Kopelman \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. You may proceed with your question.","Joe Altobello \u2013 Oppenheimer","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Just want to start with e-commerce. You guys talked about earlier the 10% of sales. How does that benchmark against some of your peers and what they're doing today for example?","And then secondly, in terms of the required investment to get there, are we talking a step function or is it more incremental investment on the infrastructure side to allow for that 10% of sales from e-commerce? Thanks.","David Kimbell","Yeah. I think competitively we feel, you know, there's a wide range of our competitors and we're actually probably not as much focused on where our competitors are. We think 10% is a really both attainable and smart place for us to be. Our focus within e-commerce, as we've talked before, is to make sure we're serving our customer where she needs this, where she wants to be served, but also finding ways to get her to experience our full breadth of offerings including our in-store products and services. And we think that the 10% is the right guide path to get us -- target to get us to that.","As far as the investments?","Scott Settersten","Yeah. We saw most of the step-up in investments back in 2012 and 2013, and I think we've talked about that and called those numbers out. That was really the step function, I think, as you use that term. You know, future investments are embedded in the supply chain numbers that we've given today and built into the overall CapEx that we'll talk about in more detail as we get to the future. So again I wouldn't expect there to be any kind of extraordinary step-up in the investment for that business.","Joe Altobello \u2013 Oppenheimer","Okay, thanks, Scott. And then secondly, in terms of acquisitions, you referenced that earlier. Are you talking more square footage acquisitions or could you guys in fact, you know, purchase brands or partner with companies on brands?","Mary Dillon","Yeah, you know, we haven't defined all that yet, but generally speaking I'd say we would have more of an interest in things that we could -- that would strengthen what we offer to our guests. You know, we think we're pretty darn good at what we do, but we know there's opportunities out there to bring her news in innovation and exclusiveness. So that would be more likely the area we'd focus on. But we don't have anything planned right now.","Joe Altobello \u2013 Oppenheimer","Okay, thanks. See you guys next month.","Scott Settersten","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, you may proceed with your question.","Simeon Gutman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Congratulations. Stepping back a little bit with regard to investments, next couple of years they'll be a little heavier. When they go away, when they subside and earnings growth really accelerates, does that reflect the cost of them just being lifted or does it factor in that the business itself becomes more efficient? So in other words, are you baking in anything -- any benefits in those out years?","Scott Settersten","Yeah. There's definitely benefits from our supply chain investments from some of the other what I'd call just pure P&L kind of charges that we're thinking like marketing, incremental marketing efforts, whether or not we tweet the store payroll model at all which is yet to be determined, we're still testing that. But anything that we would contemplate along those lines we would fully expect to see top-line comp benefits come out of those.","Simeon Gutman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then switching gears to product, I think Mary mentioned expand Prestige, which I think has been a focus for a long time. Does the Prestige mix just grow simply by the natural mix shift in the business, you're adding brands, you're introducing new products, or does it contemplate some type of -- some space increase or even reallocation over time?","Mary Dillon","Well, I'd say it's both. I mean what we're seeing is that our guest is really responding to Prestige brands right now. Certainly not only that but that certainly is a strong area of growth for us. And some of the brands that we've launched or new products that had been introduced in some of our brands have done quite well this year. So, you know. And in fact, we've expanded the space for some of those brands.","So, you know, we imagine it'll be a pipeline of new products and expansion of existing brands. And what that mix exactly is going to be will be determined as we march forward over time.","Simeon Gutman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks. Good luck.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. You may now proceed with your question, your line is open.","Mark Altschwager \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Hi, good afternoon, and congrats on a great start to the year. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. First, on the gross margin side. I think the comments in the Q, and you mentioned earlier that merchandise margin is about flat, but I was hoping you could parse that out a bit, because it sounds like you benefited from both mix and fewer discounts. So, just trying to understand where you saw the offset there.","Scott Settersten","Yeah. I'm not going to be able to quantify everything for you, Mark. But as I think I'd mentioned earlier here, we still have -- the loyalty conversion is still going to be a headwind for us throughout the course of the year. Product mix, again every quarter has a little bit different lever that we pull as a merchant team, so we try to plan ahead to make sure we have a good balance of ticket drivers and traffic drivers embedded in our marketing materials.","We've been able to offset some of the drag that we've seen from some deceleration in Pro Nail. We've been able to offset that. Luckily we've strengthened the Prestige line here over the first half of the year.","E-commerce, I know we've mentioned that in the past, I mean e-commerce rate is dilutive to us overall, but that's a business that we're going to continue to compete in very well I believe. And we'll continue to expand merchandising opportunities there as well, which should help mitigate some of that over the long term, as well as continuing to scale up that business will help as well, so.","Mark Altschwager \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Thank you. And then just following up on services. As you look at the long-range plan, where do you see services as optimal mix of overall sales, and how does that play into the longer-range margin expectations?","Mary Dillon","Well, we haven't set a specific target yet for the size of services. We know we're going to grow it. We think that, as I said, we have data that shows that our guests who are participating in our services right now are great guests because they come on a frequent basis, they love the experience, and then she often buys other add-on products. So, while services in general are lower margin than our retail products, that guest is a very valuable guest to us. And, you know, we'll continue to look for ways to drive awareness, not just of Ulta as a retailer but Ulta as a beauty authority, with our service as a critical component of that. And that's a very sticky part of the equation for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Kernan with Cowen. Your line is now open, you may proceed with your question.","John Kernan \u2013 Cowen & Co.","Good afternoon guys. Congrats on a great quarter.","Just on the outlook, with ticket and traffic both running in the right direction, why would comps decelerate a bit in the back half of the year?","And then, can you help us understand long term what your market share in beauty will look like in five years versus now, particularly in a Prestige offering? Thanks.","Mary Dillon","Well, it would be bigger. I'm just kidding.","But I mean we definitely expect it to grow our market share, and that's part of our vision, is that we're going to continue to, you know, really be a stronger player in this industry and we'll grow share.","In terms of the outlook for the year, listen, we're really pleased with our second quarter results. And we've reflected that by raising guidance, you know, from a mid-teens to about 20% sales and earnings growth. You know, some of the upside that Scott talked about, some of it was new product launches, which is great, some of it was expense timing shifts, which is fine. We expect to see positive sale and share trends, as we complete the year.","John Kernan \u2013 Cowen & Co.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is now open, you may proceed with your question.","Dana Telsey \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group","Good afternoon everyone, and congratulations. Can you talk a little bit about, as you think about the longer-term investments beyond supply chain over the next two years, how do you see operating margin being impacted, or is that when we should begin to see some leverage in the model?","Scott Settersten","Yes. We expect the operating margin to remain rather flattish over the next couple of years, which we think is an excellent result considering the amount of investments that we're going to be making over the next two years, especially in the areas of supply chain. I alluded to earlier, maybe not as clearly as I should, but we believe that there are significant efficiencies that are going to come out of this supply chain implementation that are going to help drive top line and operating margin performance overall, once we get through the 2016 timeframe.","You know, at that point we expect that our operating margin then will start, will start making significant progress towards our mid-teens target, which we've talked about for some time.","Mary Dillon","And let me just add that, we've talked a lot about the investments that we're making this year, and what we're calling \"test-and-learn.\" And those are some experiments around hypotheses that we have about how we can drive the business, investing in things like advertising, advertising in things like more attention to salon, perhaps more guest-facing time in our stores. The reason we're testing it is that, you know, we hold ourselves to a standard of getting a return on that investment.","So, you know, as we look at those \"investments,\" the reason that our five-year plan leads to improving that operating margin is that we will only choose the things to \"invest in\" that drive that kind of return that'll help us -- that will allow us to deliver those results.","Dana Telsey \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group","And as you think of the size of those investments over time, are they going to be bigger at the beginning of this time period, or how do you think of the scale of them?","Scott Settersten","Yes. I mean directionally they're more significant in the near term than they are. So they moderate. Again once we get through -- 2015 and 2016 are the big step-up years I would say, generally speaking. And then they moderate once we get past 2016.","Dana Telsey \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jill Nelson with Johnson Rice. Your line is now open, you may proceed with your question.","Jill Nelson \u2013 Johnson Rice & Co.","Good afternoon. You saw nice traffic gains which exceeded ticket gains for the first time in quite a few quarters. Could you talk kind of that variance going forward? And how do you see ticket versus traffic playing out in your kind of long-term 5% to 7% comp growth?","Mary Dillon","Well, yes, we're very pleased that we saw the growth in retail transactions that we did in the second quarter. I would just say that long term, short term, every quarter our goal is to really have a good balance between transaction and ticket. And we work together as a team to put plans in place that we believe will continue to do that. So it's not a science, right? So, some quarters, yes, it's going to play out a little differently. Some of our new products, like Urban Decay, Benefit, some of the new products in those lines, launch of It, Mally, they were significant contributors, as well as the strong Pro Hair event, a later event that Scott mentioned earlier. And our marketing and merchandising teams continue to work together to create I'd say even more compelling communications every quarter. So our goal here is to really just maintain that balance going forward.","Jill Nelson \u2013 Johnson Rice & Co.","Okay. And then could you talk about kind of the role of Prestige boutiques going forward, kind of your thought process of how many boutiques you're looking at adding and the 100 new stores per year kind of plan and just their role in the long-term goals? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Sure. Well, we, you know, we - our guests love the Prestige boutiques, we're very pleased with the business. Janet Taake and her team work closely with our vendor partners and those opportunities. And we hope and expect to continue to grow those.","Jill Nelson \u2013 Johnson Rice & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research. Your line is now open, you may proceed with your question.","Janet Kloppenburg \u2013 JJK Research","Hi, Mary; hi, Scott. I want to congratulate you on a great quarter. I just had a couple of quick questions.","There's been some talk in the beauty industry over the last couple of weeks that the mass business -- mass brands are being cannibalized by the Prestige business, and Estee Lauder and L'Oreal have both talked about that. I was wondering if you could talk about that change and how that may affect your business going forward, or if you even agree with that trend that is being witnessed by some of the big suppliers.","And also I was wondering, on the e-comm being dilutive to margins, if we should expect it to be equally dilutive in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, or if you'll start to get some scale from that channel as we go forward. Thank you.","Mary Dillon","Sure. The categories, you know, I would say, step back and just think about our business model, our guest, what she needs and expects, you know, she is always looking for a balance -- ability to go across the store and to buy different types of products at different price points that meet her needs. So I can't comment on the trend that you're describing that people are talking about. What I would say, in our business we're seeing a good balance there. And so -- and we expect to continue to be able to drive that kind of balance within Ulta.","Second question?","Scott Settersten","As far as e-commerce and contribution might be considered, or availability of that business. I mean if we just carve that out as a standalone operating business, I think anyone would be happy to have it. I mean it generates a lot of operating income for the business. We're improving our merchandise rates there, so, gross margin, gross profit margin in general is improving. And we continue to see scale in that business. So these growth rates do that kind of inherently, and we expect more of it in the future.","Janet Kloppenburg \u2013 JJK Research","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Laurel Lefebvre, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Laurel Lefebvre","Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Ulta Beauty's Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are Janet Taake, Senior Vice President of Merchandising; and Jeff Severts, Senior Vice President of Marketing.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of the company's Safe Harbor language.

Dillon","Thank you, Laurel, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report solid top line performance in the third quarter and, in particular, rapid growth in our e-commerce business despite a tougher-than-expected sales environment. After seeing good momentum in the second quarter and early in the third quarter, our sales trends in retail customer transactions softened somewhat in late September and October.","We adjusted our promotional strategy to drive transactions and deliver healthy top line growth but gave up a bit of margin in the process. We nonetheless delivered solid earnings growth in line with sales growth, excluding severance charges, and made good progress in each of our key strategies.","To recap the headlines, we grew sales 22.4% and delivered a 6.8% total company comp, following an 8.9% comp in the third quarter of 2012, both including the impact of online sales growth. E-commerce built on a strong momentum with 74% growth, contributing 170 basis points to the comp.","Prestige Cosmetics and skincare continue to be the strongest categories while we experienced some softness in the nail and fragrance categories, consistent with industry-wide trends. Our comp was driven entirely by ticket, evenly split between units per transaction and average selling price, while transactions were slightly negative.","Part of this transaction decline was driven by this year's strategy of reducing and better targeting our coupons and price promotions intended to reduce reliance on such discounts over time. We also believe we experienced a wider weakness in traffic that many retailers felt in the third quarter. In light of this change in trend, we elected late in the quarter to increase our promotions in order to protect our market share gains in an incrementally tougher retail landscape.","GAAP earnings per share were $0.70, up 18%. Earnings per share, excluding severance charges and retention costs, were $0.72, up 22%. Charges for severance and retention costs resulted from changes at the senior management level to strengthen media capabilities in supply chain and human resources.","We achieved slightly less gross margin expansion than we planned as a result of our increased level of promotion to drive sales late in the quarter. Investments in supply chain, e-commerce and labor came in as expected.","The current trend in the business and the overall heightened promotional environment for the holiday season are making us more cautious on earnings expectations for the fourth quarter and heading into next year. As you've seen in the press release, we've lowered our earning growth rate expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2013.","In addition, while we're still in the midst of the budgeting process and haven't finalized our plan for 2014, based on what we know today about our square footage plans likely in the 15% range and several investments we need to prioritize to drive sustainable long-term growth, we expect that our earnings growth next year will likely be in a similar range to the current year.","Looking even further ahead, I'm sure you're all anxious to understand how this more muted view of the end of the current year and next year fits into our long-term sales and earnings algorithm. Right now, our first priority is to focus on delivering a strong holiday for Ulta and to continue to deliver market share gains.","We're also focused on the long-term view and are currently conducting an in-depth and future-focused strategic planning process to align and prioritize our growth strategies, as well as the additional investments we'll need to make -- we'll need to make to remain a high-performance and high-growth company.","Since I joined Ulta Beauty in July, I've continued to be impressed by the strength of our business model and the passion of our associates. I'm confident in our ability to offer a differentiated total experience for our guests now and into the future, whether in our store, our salon or online.","Over the next several years, it's clear that our square footage growth will necessarily moderate off a larger base, and we'll need to find new ways to grow. I believe there are significant opportunities ahead for Ulta in areas such as driving higher brand awareness; developing smaller and urban store formats; increasing our digital presence, both online and in-store; and growing our capabilities to enable initiatives like localization of assortment.","I've also seen we need to upgrade our capabilities in certain areas which will require additional investment over a multi-year horizon in order to achieve our growth aspirations. Some of the areas we plan to invest in include: customer-facing training in our stores and salons; systems investments to improve the customer experience; digital marketing to drive brand awareness and a multi-year supply chain project, including a new warehouse in 2015.","As we complete our in-depth strategic planning process over the next several months, we plan to be in a position to update our long-term growth targets. We expect to remain a high-performance, high-growth company while building an even stronger foundation for the future.","Scott will provide more details on our financial results for the third quarter and our guidance in a moment, but first I'd like to update you on recent progress on the 5 components of our strategy to build an even stronger business for the long term: store growth; new products, services and brands; our loyalty program; marketing and ulta.com.","Starting with real estate. We opened up 55 stores during the quarter, the most new stores we've ever opened in one quarter. With additional 10 stores already open in the early fourth quarter and one planned for January, we are close to completion of our 2013 real estate program of 125 stores and remain very pleased with the team's execution of store openings and the productivity of our new stores.","We're still finalizing our plans for our 2014 real estate program and expect to grow square footage approximately 15%. We also plan to remodel several more stores than we did this year and are still finalizing the scope of the remodel program.","We also anticipate a large number of smaller in-store projects such as additional prestige boutiques and reflowing the mass cosmetics planogram in some of the older stores to make the shopping experience in that category more consistent across the chain. We believe this balanced approach will lead to continued excellent store performance, but will obviously have an impact on the top line following 2 years of 22% to 23% square footage growth.","Turning now to merchandising. We continue to expand our portfolio with new brands, products and services. In fact, it's been my pleasure over the past several months to meet many of our key vendor partners to learn about their businesses and brands and collaborate on how we'll continue to partner together.","Recent launches of IT Cosmetics and Mally have been very strong out of the gate, and we're seeing excellent performance from brands like Urban Decay and many of the exclusive kits we've developed with them and several other prestige brands.","In the personal care appliances category, the innovative Curl Secret from Conair has been a hit with our customers, and we expect it to be a big seller through the holidays.","To update you on the rollout of Lanc\u00f4me and Clinique boutiques, as of the end of Q3, we've completed the buildout of these prestige boutiques that we planned for this year. We now have 100 stores with Clinique boutiques and 105 stores with Lanc\u00f4me boutiques. Customers are responding very well to our offering in both brands, which add to our positioning as a beauty destination.","We continue to see rapid growth also in the Benefit brand. We now have Benefit Brow Bars in 500 stores, and 225 of these stores are offering the new service of brow tinting, which is off to a great start. A strong services offering combined with a steady stream of launches of successful products are making Benefit one of the fastest-growing brands in our portfolio.","Looking ahead, we see a strong pipeline of new brands and innovation in the beauty industry. While we don't generally launch many new brands in the fourth quarter, as we're focusing on holiday, we're excited to announce exclusively at Ulta, the Japonesque Color Collection, a beautifully packaged line of prestige cosmetics from the brand famous for high-quality brushes.","We also introduced the new Pedi Sonic from Clarisonic, adding to this brand's high-growth portfolio of skin care tools. The highly anticipated Urban Decay Naked3 palette will be launching next week, with a significant marketing plan to take advantage of that franchise's cult following.","Turning to salon. The salon team continues to have a great year with strong top line performance, which again this quarter, contributed to the total company comp. With solid execution and promotions, expansion of services like lash extensions and programs that are improving the tenure of our stylists, the salon team is gaining share. We continue to see significant opportunity to drive awareness and trial of our services offering and differentiate Ulta as the perfect beauty destination.","Moving on to an update on our loyalty programs and customer relationship management platform. We currently have 12.5 million active loyalty members who have shopped within the last 12 months, up 18% compared to last year, in part driven by a loyalty sweepstakes program during the quarter which drove strong new customer acquisition.","We continue to see increases in retention in our loyalty customer base, and average sales per existing customer are growing. We're on track to convert all our customers to the ULTAmate Rewards program in the first quarter of 2014. Having all our customers on the points-based program will enable more efficient use of our CRM platform.","And now turning to marketing. During the quarter, we executed our signature 21 Days of Beauty event, featuring special deals and events focused on prestige brands. We continue our support of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation in October through the sale of products in our stores, events like our Salon Cut-A-Thon and other events and programs designed to raise awareness of the cause.","In November, we ran a 2-week event in 100 stores called Brows Across America to highlight Benefit brow services. This program exceeded expectations, driving incremental sales, as well as awareness and excitement in our stores.","We also continued to evolve our tactics to reduce reliance on price promotions, such as tailoring our offers and better segmentation of our customer base and increased brand equity events like the ones just mentioned. While this change did have a somewhat dampening effect on the transactions versus a year ago, we do feel this is a better way to build our business over the long term. We'll continue to refine this strategy, and we'll be nimble with our promotional cadence so we can respond to changes in the environment the way we did late in the quarter. We're confident we're building better tools and better insights to pursue a stronger promotion strategy in the long run.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter and important holiday season, we're focused on continuing to grow market share to a strong set of offerings, including a strength in gift with purchase program and marketing campaigns designed around some of our hottest new fragrances.","Next week, we're launching a marketing campaign designed to generate excitement about the launch of the Urban Decay Naked3 palette, offering fans a chance to buy the latest palette in advance of the official launch.","And wrapping up with our fifth growth strategy, our e-commerce business. Q3 was an excellent quarter for ulta.com, demonstrating continued momentum on the top line despite tough prior year comparisons and a major site relaunch. Our limited-time Beauty Breaks!, our sample beauty bags and CRM program all contributed to better-than-expected sales growth.","Ulta.com delivered continued margin improvement through growing scale, better supply chain capabilities and a favorable product mix. The biggest news for ulta.com is the launch of our new website, a significant step forward for us. The platform was rolled out over a period of several weeks to make sure the new site was operating the way we planned.","The new site enhances visibility to our product assortment, highlighting bestsellers and featuring products across all categories. Search capabilities were vastly improved, and brands were recognized for better visibility.","Ulta is one of the first retailers to feature Responsive Web Design, a new technology that enables a consistent browsing experience regardless of the device the customer is using, be it a laptop, mobile phone or tablet. The new site is receiving positive consumer feedback on the usability improvements and browsing experience, and we're seeing an increase in conversion rates on the new site. I'd like to congratulate our entire team for their great execution and focus in delivering a top-notch website and supporting a successful Black Friday and Cyber Monday.","On the supply chain side, we continue to ramp up the volume of e-commerce orders fulfilled out of our Northeast D.C. Chambersburg is well-staffed for the holidays and operating very effectively. Our associates supporting our e-commerce business in both Romeoville and Chambersburg are working very hard to support customer demand throughout this holiday season.","This completes my updates of the progress on our 5 growth priorities. And with that, now I'll hand it over to Scott.","Scott M. Settersten","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. We recorded total sales of $618.8 million compared to $505.6 million last year, an increase of 22.4%, with a comp store sales increase of 6.8%. The retail comp was 5.1%, and e-commerce growth of 74% added 170 basis points to the comp.","Gross profit dollars increased 24.9% to $231.7 million, and gross profit margin rose 70 basis points to 37.4% from 36.7% in Q3 of last year, driven by strength in our prestige categories and better-than-expected leverage of fixed costs.","While strong, this margin expansion was a bit less than our guidance due to an uptick in promotional activity later in the quarter to drive sales amid weaker-than-expected consumer traffic.","SG&A expenses, excluding the impact of the severance charges Mary mentioned, rose 26.7% to $149.5 million, up 90 basis points as a percentage of sales to 24.2%. This was driven by the planned investments on our new website, supply chain project, store labor and brand awareness that we've discussed previously, in line with our expectations.","Preopening expense increased to $7.5 million compared to $6.3 million last year, driven by 55 store openings during the quarter compared to 49 new stores opened during Q3 of last year. Operating margin, including the severance charges, decreased 30 basis points to 11.8% versus 12.1% last year.","Net income increased 19.1% to $45.4 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, versus $38.2 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, last year. Excluding the severance charges, EPS was $0.72, or 22% growth.","Turning to the balance sheet. Inventories were $582.3 million at the end of the quarter compared to $462.8 million at the end of Q3 2012, up 1.7% on a per-store basis. This is consistent with our plan for the year where, after making permanent investments in inventory at the end of last year to improve InStyle levels and continuing to invest in prestige boutiques, we expect to see inventory per door growth below comp growth by the end of the year.","Capital expenditures were $78.9 million for the quarter, driven primarily by our new store opening program. And depreciation and amortization for the quarter were $27 million.","Turning now to guidance for the fourth quarter. Based on current sales trends, less certainty about consumer sentiment and what appears to be shaping up to be a highly promotional holiday season, we believe it is prudent to take a more cautious view of the fourth quarter from a margin perspective since we are focused, as we have always been, on maintaining strong market share gains.","We expect sales to increase in the range of $853 million to $867 million versus $758.8 million last year, which included an extra week. We expect comparable store sales to increase in the range of 7% to 9%. Our same-store sales comparison for the quarter is based on weeks 40 to 52.","We have 2 elements at work in Q4 that drive the comp metric but do not translate to earnings: first, we benefit from the comparison to the disruption we experienced due to the Superstorm Sandy disaster, which negatively impacted last year's Q4 comp by roughly 100 basis points; second, we have an easier comparison as a result of not lapping the 53rd week of 2012, which was a strong sales week. Absent these one-time impacts, our comp guidance would be 5% to 7%.","We will open 11 new stores in the fourth quarter to complete our 2013 plan versus 13 in last year's fourth quarter, so preopening expense is expected to be in line with last year. We expect to achieve earnings per share in the range of $1.07 to $1.10 compared to last year, which it was $1, which included about $0.05 of benefit from the extra week.","Gross profit margin is now expected to be flat as we prepare to participate in a highly promotional holiday season. SG&A rate is expected to increase 50 basis points versus last year's 20.3% rate due to planned investments in the business. Operating margin may be expected to decrease approximately 50 basis points.","Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 38.2%, and our fully diluted share count will be approximately 65 million.","Turning now to the full year 2013. In light of the weaker-than-expected back half of the year and conservative earnings view on Q4, we now expect 2013 to come in at an earnings growth rate in the 20% range, adjusted for the 53rd week last year, compared to our previous expectation of mid-20s percentage EPS growth.","We expect the full year comp to be in the range of 7% to 8%, and CapEx will be approximately $225 million. As you know, we give specific guidance about the coming year on our Q4 conference call in March. We are not changing that practice.","At this point in the year, we are deep in our planning process for 2014. While we are not yet prepared to give specific guidance for next year, we wanted to share some of our preliminary views. First, we expect square footage growth to moderate off a larger base to about 15% versus 22% this year. Second, while the beauty category overall continues to grow, industry growth in both prestige and mass had been less robust in recent years, and a deceleration has continued during 2013. We have also seen weaker trends in several categories, including nail and fragrance, consistent with the industry. Third, we expect to continue to invest for the future in areas that will improve the guest experience and give us stronger multi-channel capabilities, primarily in the areas of supply chain and in-store technology improvements.","We are still in the process of making decisions for 2014 to deliver the best possible results while investing for the future. However, assuming industry growth dynamics remain unchanged and a less certain consumer macro environment continues into next year, we believe it is prudent to plan for earnings growth similar to 2013, as we may have to maintain a more promotional posture to maintain market share gains.","As Mary mentioned, we have some work to do on our long-range plan before providing a definitive update on our longer-term growth expectations. So stay tuned for more details on the multi-year view beyond 2014.","On a final note, I'd like to remind you all that on our June conference call, we announced that we were discontinuing our practice of announcing holiday sales in early January. With that, I'll turn the call over to our conference call host to begin the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Oliver Chen of Citigroup.","Nancy Hilliker","This is Nancy Hilliker filling in for Oliver Chen. I -- my first question is related really to the promotional strategy. Have you guys seen a difference in promotion, different ideas that you have been testing over the past quarter and the past month? And then is there any approach to maybe competitors offering prestige beauty online? Are you seeing any approach -- a different approach to strategy in terms of that as well?","Mary N. Dillon","Well, let me take a start at this, which is in terms of promotions, I would say that over the course of the year, we have been, I think, smartly experimenting with different ways to drive consumer retention and value with less discounting. So through the use of our CRM capabilities and some tweaks to some of our other tactics, we've been learning and experimenting with what our parameters are around how we can sort of drive long-term growth with little bit less reliance on promotion. And as we said, as we saw the environment start to change towards the end of the third quarter, the great thing is that we were able to nimbly, I would say, adjust and adapt to that because we have tools that we can turn very quickly. So we're going to continue to look for ways for the long haul. We can reduce some reliance on promotion and price discounts. But also, as we said in the call, we want to play to win, and we're going to continue to be aggressive in the fourth quarter, as we expect it to be very promotional.","Nancy Hilliker","And then any -- just as a follow-up, any thoughts as to the online competitors? Are there any other promotional strategies maybe that you can use to continue to gain market share?","Mary N. Dillon","Well, first of all, it's a -- there's a lot of activity in this category, that's for sure, and we are certainly aggressive. Our e-commerce performance in the quarter, we're very proud about that, and particularly the change for our new website, which is performing extremely well with even stronger conversion. So we're constantly watching the competitive environment certainly. And I don't think there's anything that we've seen that surprised us, but we know we should be in a stance to continue to be aggressive. And again, with our tools being more nimble and facile, and I think more consumer-friendly on our website, it gives us the opportunity to continue to play very strong.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Tunick of JPMorgan.","Brian J. Tunick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess just looking ahead for a second first, Scott, does it make sense, broadly speaking, that if you're guiding us for 15% square footage growth and for earnings growth next year to be similar to this year, that, that would embed a 50-, 60-basis-point operating margin expansion? And just wondering, if that's true, what buckets or what areas would be gross or SG&A that you would expect operating margin expansion? And then does your view that the earnings -- or your guidance is under a view going forward, does that take away the midteen operating margin that the previous management team had offered to the Street before, given how you guys are now looking at the business model with slowing category growth?","Scott M. Settersten","Thanks, Brian. I guess the first thing I would say is we're not giving any specific guidance for 2014 at this point in time. But being mindful of your question, I think directionally, we would think 2014 would shape up much in the way that 2013 did, with the emphasis and the strategy being on trying to lever back on the promotional environment overall and continuing to develop the guest experience in the store to drive the business, long-term profitable growth of the guest experience in our stores. So big picture, I would say it's more in the merchandise margin and gross profit line, directionally speaking, for 2014. Again, much like it was in 2013. As with respect to the midteens operating margin target, again, I would say that we're suspending that initially by what we're seeing here for the near term on 2014 and what we think the guidance targets are for 2014.","Operator","The next question is from Aram Rubinson of Wolfe Research.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC","You guys have a very high dollars per square foot level, around $415, and it seems like you are trying to figure out the balance between how much of that is kind of sticky customers and how much of that might be cherry pickers, because you're struggling maybe to balance the promotional cadence. If you were to kind of look at your customer base and say, hey, that $415, if we had kind of the right customers in the store for the brand, where do you think that sales per square foot number would actually be? I'm just trying to figure out how much of there might be at risk. And then if you can also just tell us how you're fiddling with the promotional cadence, just to kind of make sure that, that drop-off, if there is one, doesn't happen too quick?","Mary N. Dillon","Well, let me just start in a couple of ways. One is that we -- as we described in terms of the full year expectations, this is -- we are still performing at a strong level in terms of top line growth and really, one of the top in the industry. So we're not troubled by what we're seeing in terms of our customer trends. What we are doing is reacting to an environment that looks to be more promotional and also being mindful of future investments that we believe need to be made to continue to support our growing business. So our base of customers right now is strong. I mean, we've got a really strong loyalty membership group of customers who are very responsive, and we're learning as we're tweaking some of our tactics about how to really personalize and customize offers to them in a way that we believe will drive, as it is, more units per transaction. And that's a good thing. So the way that we're thinking about our promotional tactics right now, I would say, is really not dramatic. These are small changes around the edges to learn about the sensitivity, and we're doing them at the time that the marketplace is maybe a little bit volatile and consumer sentiment is a little bit unpredictable. The good news is that we can ratchet back, which is what we've done, to our more traditional cadence. But I believe we've got the best tools that we've ever had to continue to test and learn. And we know that there's a lot of guests who -- there's a lot for them to discover at Ulta and a lot of products that, when we bring it to their attention via some of our e-mails and Beauty Breaks! and whatnot, we're seeing great response. So we'll continue to play with that and drive our growth.","Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC","And just to follow up and recap this quarter, as far as I can tell, you did kind of hit your earnings target and you did hit your sales target, and you did have gross margins up with merchandise margins from the 10-Q saying that, that was kind of up 60 basis points. And your inventories weren't too out of whack. So I guess I'm just wondering as well, if you're doing any kind of bar setting as a new CEO coming in or -- because the numbers look good overall, at least for Ulta, to what you had issued in terms of guidance.","Mary N. Dillon","Well, that's an accurate reflection of our performance relative to guidance. And really, what we're doing today is just what we think is our best view of what to expect in the fourth quarter, given the environment as well as our preliminary view of 2014. Ulta is and will still continue to be a high-growth company, and the 2014 look that we're giving, which isn't guidance, but the early view, is still a very high-growth company. But it is different than what was stated before. I would say this isn't about bar setting, but it is about -- as Scott said and I said in my comments, this is also a great time for us just to take a step back and really create a 10-year view of Ulta. It's been a very successful company for many years, but like any business, the environment changes, whether it's the consumer environment, the categories we compete in, the competitive environment. So we really want to take a very thoughtful and deep view of our strategic planning. There's going to be plenty of choices we believe we have for future growth. We want to prioritize those and then come back with guidance based on that work.","Operator","The next question is from Gary Balter of Credit Suisse.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Mary, the tone that we're hearing is different than on your last quarter. So is it -- could you walk us through kind of -- in the last 3 months or maybe it's longer than that, what are the elements within the company that you felt aren't executing, that require the investments that you're talking about that kind of say, let's slow the growth, let's reinvest, let's pull out with a better company? Where is the focus right now for where you need to make those investments?","Mary N. Dillon","Well, I guess I would say a couple of things. One is we're also in an environment that's changing and fluid in the marketplace. So as we said in the third quarter, we did see a change in our trend towards the end of the quarter, and we're reacting to that. So I feel very optimistic and upbeat about our prospects. And again, we're going to come out of this year with a very top performance in terms of top and bottom line. But it's somewhat different than what we would have guided, even really just coming in -- out of the -- in the middle of the second quarter. So that's different, and that would give us a reason to say let's look at our preliminary view of 2014 and provide the best transparency to that, that we can. Beyond that, I feel very optimistic about our future growth prospects. I'd say the only thing that's different is, as I learned about our business, I continue to be very optimistic. But I think we're going to have to be choiceful in terms of how we pick our spots for future growth. There's investments that will continue to be required as we look at a competitive environment that's increasingly omni-channel. Consumer views are changing, categories are evolving. So it's really not anything more than -- regardless of how this quarter performed, we would have been doing the strategic planning, frankly, and really want to come out in the future with our best view of what that future growth looks like. And I continue -- we very much expect Ulta to continue to be a high-growth, high-performance company. That stance has not changed.","Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just following up and then I'll get off, the -- you mentioned a few times, including in this answer, competitive environment is changing and got tougher. What -- could you be a little more specific on what's changed from expectations? Because everybody kind of expected a difficult Christmas period.","Mary N. Dillon","I was talking about [ph] more of a long term view which was that as we know that there's more people competing in beauty and really the need to be able to really operate in a very omni-channel environment, which is part of what our investment in our supply chain and ITs are going to allow us to do. In terms of the short term, I would just say, as we saw some impacts on our traffic -- I mean, our transactions, is that -- towards the end of the second quarter relative to our promotional changes, we felt that it's probably a little bit more promotionally sensitive than we might have thought going into the fourth quarter. But not dramatically so.","Operator","The next question is from Evren Kopelman of Wells Fargo.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask in terms of the slowdown you saw at the end of the quarter, is it primarily a nail and fragrance category issue that you mentioned? Or did you see a slowdown in the growth rates of even the outperforming categories like the prestige skincare fragrance and salon?","Scott M. Settersten","Yes. Hey, Evren, a couple of data points again for people who follow the industry fairly closely. If you look back over the last couple of years, so 8 to 10 quarters, you would notice that both prestige and mass color cosmetic categories were really at the high-water mark at the end of fiscal 2011. So both of those categories were just into the double-digit year-over-year growth rates at that point in time, and they've both been on a slow deceleration over the course of the last 2 years so that we ended our Q3 -- I think mass color year-over-year was flat, and prestige color was low to mid-single-digits. So we're bucking those headwinds as well overall in our box besides the category -- the nail and the fragrance deceleration that has been talked about in the open marketplace here for the last couple of quarters. So there's a number of headwinds that we have category-wise that, to this point in time, we've been able to mitigate fairly well, even with the pullback on some of the promotional things that we're doing for the business. So people are curious as to the timing of things. Coming out of Q2, we felt really good about where we were. Our plans were working, we felt comfortable with where we were through the guidance phase of the last quarter's call. And really, this transaction trend went south on us late September and really heavily into October. So we're taking a really close look at that both from an internal view on what did we do that could have changed the guest perception or shopping patterns, or was it more macro kinds of things that have kind of stacked on top of each other here over time. So again, we're deep into the investigation process on all of those things, and you can -- rest assured, we're working hard to try to find the answer.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. That makes sense. The other question is your younger stores typically comp stronger than your older ones as the younger ones mature. Have you seen any changes to that historical trend? Or can we expect that to continue?","Scott M. Settersten","No. The comp stack for the third quarter is pretty similar to what we had back in the first quarter so you can remember back, we did a 6.7% all-in comp in the first quarter. We're doing a 6.80% or so. By and large, the stores look the same. Still the stores from 0 to 5 years, that comp ramp looks exactly the same as what's reflected in our model. When you get beyond year 5, years 6 through 15 is roughly in the -- it's in the solid low-single digit range. And then when you get beyond the 15-year range, it's more or less a net 0. So consistent with what we would expect at this kind of comp level. So again, we feel -- we're pleased with the 2013 slate of new stores and no change in the ramps.","Operator","The next question is from Ike Boruchow with Sterne Agee.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I guess my question is the last time we heard from you, you were guiding a 5% to 7% comp for both Q3 and the year, which I think essentially implied a 5% to 7% comp for Q4. So to guide it now a 7% to 9% comp for Q4 with sales that are so far below the Street is just a little confusing. So I guess can you just help us understand the Q4 top line outlook and how does that compare to your view of what the Q4 sales number was going to be 3 months ago?","Scott M. Settersten","Yes. We tried to give you a realistic view of the business. Again, I mentioned in my prepared comments that there's 200 basis points in that 7% to 9%, Ike, that's really just a basic measurement, the arithmetic measure versus last year. So it's not really reflective of the core of the business. The core business is still operating at a 5% to 7%.","Irwin Bernard Boruchow - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","But when we think about the outlook for Q4 coming down, is that a function -- I mean, you said more promotional environment. So obviously, margins lower than you had planned. But are the sales -- the total sales dollars, are those also -- where you're putting them now, are they lower than where you thought 3 months ago? Or is that not -- is that somewhat unchanged?","Scott M. Settersten","They are somewhat lower. I mean, we did see a dropoff in retail sales late in the third quarter, which we mentioned here, driven by transaction deceleration. So we have taken down our internal view of what we expect retail sales to be in the fourth quarter. So yes, that has been taken down somewhat.","Operator","The next question is from Daniel Hofkin of William Blair.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just to follow up on that question, I guess still not completely clear. Like, where -- if you have -- I totally get that last year's comparison was affected by Sandy. That ought to benefit your comp growth and your total sales growth, it would seem, this year. So we're just trying to understand what appears to be, and again, maybe it's just the calendar shift that you described, but what appears to be a mismatch between the comp that you're projecting and the total sales growth, which has a much smaller spread relative to the comp than we're used to seeing. That's the first question.","Scott M. Settersten","Dan, I don't think I really have anything more to share on that one other than the 200 -- we're calling it 200 basis points roughly of the year-over-year comparison. And we have taken down our retail estimates, our retail comp estimates for the fourth quarter that are really -- really, it's the competitive environment and the conservative view that we're taking on the fourth quarter and what the margin rate investment is going to be to maintain those sales levels.","Daniel Hofkin - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So are you implying that you're expecting a moderation in new store performance or, let's say, non-comp store performance in the balance of the year that's maybe more significant?","Scott M. Settersten","No. I don't think so. I mean, our stores are continuing to perform at the levels that we expect them to. We may not see an overperformance kind of environment, like maybe that you've seen in the past or have been reflected in models just through the delivering of actual results. Historically, stores have -- our new store program has way overdelivered what our initial expectations were. So naturally, in an environment where comps are a bit more challenged, there's going to be some kind of headwinds on those new stores. I mean, they're not immune to what's going on with the macro consumer environment. So that might be a bit [indiscernible] if you're looking at it from a modeling perspective.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First question I would ask, you talked about severance and some changes that you're making in supply chain and HR. Could you give us any more details on the changes that you made there?","Mary N. Dillon","Yes, sure. That was related to 2 changes at the executive team level in terms of the HR and the supply chain functions and just my judgment about capabilities that we needed there for the future. So we've got a great strong team here, we made a couple of changes and we're moving forward.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So, Mary, did you replace the senior executives in those roles with internal people at this stage?","Mary N. Dillon","One was internal and one was external.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. My second question relates to the real estate plans. So this year, obviously, you were in the -- you're going to end up in the low to mid-20s. You were pretty close to that last year. And I guess in '11 and prior to that, I guess you had peaked at 15%, but that was sort of coming out of a downturn. So I guess as I combine the move to 15% next year with your discussion of developing urban and smaller store prototypes, what's your sense of the blue sky footprint potential for the existing format as you have it? And would you say that's changed at all from perhaps what you guys have talked about prior to the time you came to the company?","Scott M. Settersten","No, Matt. Our view is on the 1,200-store potential for our 10,000 square foot box. Nothing's changed with respect to any of that. Again, what we're faced with here in the near term, we think, is just -- it's whatever, a pendulum swing that will come and it will go, and consumer and category itself will bounce back here. Again, over the long term, we feel really good about our model and about the category overall. As we look at next year, it's really a balance. I think we've said before that 125 stores this year was kind on the outer reaches of what we felt like we could do comfortably, both supporting it with operating disciplines and training and all the other things we have to do with our new store associates. As we look to next year, we want to do a few more remodels, so that's kind of -- again, those are more or less like a new store, so that kind adds in -- gets you to your total buildout. And then there's a few more things internally that we want to do, kind of in-store projects with planogram changes in the mass area and a few other things we want to do. So all in all, we feel really comfortable with where we are, and it's more of a balanced approach next year.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And one last quick one. So if you think about the promotional environment, I guess, last year in the fourth quarter, the gross margin had a bit of a setback. It almost seems like there are other seasonal entrants into the business or some of your competitors choose to turn up the juice at this time of year. It seems to be a recurring pattern. Is it the year-round players who you find aggravating the competitive backdrop? Or are there more seasonal players, be it general merchants or others, who tend to refocus on this around holiday, who seem to be gumming up the works a bit from a margin perspective?","Scott M. Settersten","Well, one thing I do want to point out is that in the fourth quarter, even though we're guiding gross profits flat year-over-year, we are expecting merchandise margin to expand by roughly 50 basis points. So our plan of trying to balance the promotional environment here whilst continuing to drive a great value orientation for our customer is still in place. What we've seen here develop recently -- again, everybody sees this in the news, right? Our mailboxes are full every night, our e-mail accounts are full. We see the fashion and soft good guys out there with 50% off the whole store on the first week in a holiday. I mean, that -- nobody really expected that. I mean, we knew it was going to be competitive, but we didn't know it was going to be to this extent. So looking at it again objectively, in a balanced way, we said we need to compete here to maintain our gains. But when I think back -- and this is one of the benefits, I guess, for being around for a while, right? Thinking back, analogizing back to really -- the last time we saw discussions about inventory levels with these soft good players and the need to get through this stuff before the end of the holiday season was back in 2008, and that was a tough environment for everyone. And we'll take the same view this year as we did then, a balanced view between investing margin and chasing the comp number. So we'll be very mindful of that.","Mary N. Dillon","Yes. I just want to add one thing, which is that up until a recent shift in trend, these tweaks to our promotional strategy were encouraging to us. So in no way, shape or form did we step back from that as a longer-term way for us to continue to drive top line and bottom line, because we know we're getting smarter, we can test and learn. And yet, if the environment changed, we can respond to it. But we're going to continue to drive that over the long haul.","Operator","The next question is from David Wu of Telsey Advisory Group.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","First, in terms of next year's square footage guidance of 15% growth, which obviously -- that's at the low end of your long-term target range of 15% to 20%, and I understand that you're planning to do more remodels next year. But can you talk about whether -- or why you're not opening up more stores next year and if you're perhaps seeing any real estate limitations out there, and if you're still sort of sticking to your long-term 15% to 20% square footage growth target range?","Mary N. Dillon","Well, let me just start by saying that 125 stores this year, we've said, is probably about the peak in terms of really just executing with excellence. Every time we open up new stores, we do a great job identifying real estate and constructing those stores. We also have to hire folks and staff them and train them and have them ready for our guests. So we feel good about that number and really believe that, coming down off of that, is really just a way for next year to make sure that we're striking that right balance. We're not concerned about our ability to find the right real estate and to build those stores, and we're not concerned about the productivity of our store model. We just think this is a better pace for us right now.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great. And can you talk more about your strategy for the brand boutiques, including your initial plans for next year and what the longer-term opportunity could be?","Mary N. Dillon","Well, as you know, we are really thrilled with the fact that our assortment continues to evolve. Our team here has done a great job partnering with really great vendors and iconic brands, and that's been part of the magic of Ulta, frankly. And it's great. So as I said in my prepared comments, we've gone to 100 Clinique store boutiques and 105 Lanc\u00f4me boutiques this year, which is great. Benefit boutique doing exceptionally well, and we're going to continue to build out that strategy. So I can't tell you specifics today, but you can imagine that, that's high on our hit list of things to continue to build on.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great. In terms of the higher promotions, are you expecting this to impact your non-prestige business? Or are you becoming more promotional also on the prestige side?","Scott M. Settersten","No. By and large, again, when we talk about promotions and discounting, that is non-prestige kind of business. So prestige product, that category, by and large, there is no discounting allowed. It's an SRP out the door.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Got it. So in terms of then the slower traffic and sales that you saw towards the tail end of September and into October, did that mainly impact then sort of the non-prestige side? Or did you also see a little bit of a pullback on prestige as well?","Scott M. Settersten","No. The promotions itself, it's generally non-prestige-related. Again, from time to time, prestige becomes part of the mix with some of the offers that we give our guests. But by and large, in the third quarter, it was non-prestige-related categories.","David Wu - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Where you saw the pullback?","Scott M. Settersten","Yes.","Operator","The next question is from Mark Altschwager of Robert W. Baird.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to touch a bit more on the supply chain side. Mary, I was hoping you could talk about your long-term vision there. You made some changes, so what is your assessment of the supply chain today? And where does it need to go in order to support the type of growth that Ulta is capable of?","Mary N. Dillon","Sure. Well, I -- we'll just answer that really at a macro level. But our supply chain today, I think, is performing very well for us, yet we know that we need to do more, especially because number one, we're a growing business. So we need more infrastructure to support our multi-year growth plans. We also know that we need to continually increase our ability to compete in an omni-channel way. So we're thrilled with our e-commerce performance, but we want to make sure that we have the capability at a minimum to be able to have our guests, for example, understand if they can order online and pick up in our stores. Whether or not we ship from stores is a different question, but we're really looking at the range of capabilities. And as I'm sure you imagine, that's not the -- you need to have the right systems in place to allow that kind of capability. And we also know that we have opportunities just in end-to-end efficiency in our supply chain. So we've taken some time to really build a robust view of that. We're -- the first stage of that is really building a new distribution center in 2015, which we're planning. But beyond that, there's also plans to invest in the right systems and in people and capability and capacity to support our long-term growth ambitions. We plan to get to 1,200 stores and continue to be a very high-growth retailer, so we need a supply chain that supports that.","Mark R. Altschwager - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then on the services side, where do you see the biggest opportunities? And how do you think about allocating the space in the store? And then as the environment gets more competitive, how do services fit with the long-term vision of building brand awareness and customer engagement?","Mary N. Dillon","Right. I think it's a perfect example of -- we sit back and think about our 10-year view of Ulta and how we want to really differentiate Ulta. That's exactly the kind of question we're asking ourselves. Ultimately, we really have a differentiated proposition today because of the one-stop shop ability, the exciting assortment that we offer, but also the fact that you can get services in our stores, which I don't think anybody can get online yet and hopefully never. But anyway -- so we've got a really differentiated concept that we believe is going to really be the place that allows us to win for the long term. So we're going to examine what we think about trends, consumer trends, anti-aging -- an example might be skin health, right? So there's ways that we can think about. Is there more we can do there? But that's just one example. But we'll put all those under the, I guess, sort of the examination lens here as we think about places that we'll continue to invest to grow. So -- but for sure, services will continue to be part of our long-term proposition.","Operator","The next question is from Kayla Berg of Piper Jaffray.","Kayla Berg - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","First, if you would, could you share your thoughts about approaching holiday from a digital marketing perspective versus last year? And also, how do you guys feel positioned for holiday in fragrances here across the price points and newness?","Mary N. Dillon","Okay. Can I ask you guys to take those for us? Janet and Jeff, you want to take the marketing? We have our team here.","Jeffrey Severts","Sure. Well, Kayla, I would say that our digital marketing efforts will be pretty consistent with what you've seen from us for the balance of the year. So as we've talked through the first couple of quarters of the year, we're a lot more focused on the digital space than we have been traditionally, and you're just going to see that continue. Not going to give you much more detail than that because I'm sure the competition would love to hear it.","Janet Taake","And in fragrance -- this is Janet. Basically, we have our exclusive gift with purchase that we started in November and continue through holiday, and that is exclusive to Ulta and something we have done for many, many years. And we're very excited. We've improved the quality of both of those. One has already been in the stores, and the second one hit this week actually. But we're also encouraged by some of the newness that we have seen at the end of third quarter. Just to comment on One Direction, out of the box was very strong, along with Honey from Mark Jacobs and a few other things. So gift sets are strong. And also, I think that we feel very good about some of the opening price points in purse sprays or roller balls, if you will. So from a fragrance perspective, we're ready for holiday.","Kayla Berg - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And one last quick follow-up. Where do you guys expect to end the year in terms of inventory levels?","Scott M. Settersten","We expect to end the year in line -- similar to where we ended the third quarter. So it'll be well below what the comp increase is for the year. We feel very, very comfortable with our inventory position. Again, as many of you know, there's very little in the way of fashion risk in our inventory, so very low obsolescence risk. So again, very comfortable we're on plan and expecting to hit our targets at the end of the year.","Operator","The next question is from Krystyna Metcalf of Oppenheimer.","Krystyna Metcalf","Most of my questions have already been asked, but I was just wondering if salon comps were still above product comps this quarter?","Scott M. Settersten","They were indeed. They were -- they added roughly...","Mary N. Dillon","10 basis points.","Scott M. Settersten","10 basis points to the comp for the quarter. So still performing very strong.","Krystyna Metcalf","Great. And then I'm not sure if you answered this already, but I believe last quarter, you said that you were expecting e-commerce sales to go down just because of the new website rollout? And obviously, this quarter, they were pretty similar. So what are your expectations for 4Q?","Mary N. Dillon","Well, yes. We were very happy with that transition, and we were being cautious about that. So that's better than we expected. The first 3 quarters still, I would say, were benefiting from some pretty high-ticket products that we were selling that were hot products and -- I mean, supplements and some tools. We're excited about our continued growth, but the comps do get tougher going forward. So we're going to continue to grow. I'm not sure if we're citing a specific number, but it's -- we're going to continue to have tough comps, but we also feel more optimistic with the transition going better than it did, I might add.","Scott M. Settersten","And I would add, we picked up steam at the end of 2012 with our e-commerce site. They had a really good fourth quarter, so I wouldn't expect the 70% growth for the fourth quarter year-over-year.","Operator","We have time for one more question from Jill Nelson of Johnson Rice.","Jill R. Caruthers - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","A quick one on fourth quarter gross margin. You did mention that merchandise margins are planned up. Could you talk about maybe the pressures in that line item you're expecting?","Scott M. Settersten","On the gross profit line?","Jill R. Caruthers - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Yes, because you had said, for overall, it'd be flat.","Scott M. Settersten","Right. So we are happily expecting to see merchandise margin expansion with product mix and the prestige mix being richer as part of the overall business. We do have headwinds with fixed store cost. That's really the primary offset there, Jill. So it's really the accelerated new store program, especially with 125 new stores now kind of entering into the chain here late in the third quarter. So that's the headwind that's offsetting the merchandise margin gains.","Jill R. Caruthers - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then kind of big-picture question into 2014. Clearly, you need to put in more investments into the business. And could you maybe just talk about some of the big buckets? You've mentioned supply chain, but maybe if you could put them in order? Or just some type of magnitude of where you feel like the company has underinvested and what needs to help grow the business for -- into next year?","Scott M. Settersten","Yes. I wouldn't use the term underinvested, Jill. I mean, there is -- I think we've talked to many of you, at least I have, over the last year. Right? I mean, as a growing company, there's always things we'd like invest in, but you need to have the proper team in place and the proper third parties to help coach you along in some of these more complicated kinds of things. So I would just remind everyone, the biggest investment we're making is in the new store program. So big acceleration in 2012 and into 2013. And even next year, at 15%, 100 stores, do the arithmetic. That's no small feat for us. And that's still -- the best investment produces the best shareholder returns that we currently have. So in the current term though, that creates some headwinds for us on fixed store cost. Again, we don't get the leverage with all those stores going in place that we have in recent years, so that hurts us a bit. Some of the investments are more certain things. Mary talked about supply chain. We're going to get a lot of new capabilities there, which are going to be very helpful for us down the road. There's things in IT. Again, they're primarily customer-facing kinds of investments. So in-store POS systems that will allow us to do more mobile and all that kind of flashy iPad stuff, which everyone does now and we need to invest in as well. That's what the guests expects. There's other investments like brand awareness, marketing investments, training for store associates to make sure we give the right guest experience in places like skin category, which is high touch and high impact. So those things -- those are one of the things that we're talking about as part of the strategic planning process and how far do we need to go and to what extent do we need to do those kinds of things. So -- and then there are other things I'd call kind of compliance costs, non-investments, but will be a drag on earnings next year around health care. So some of that stuff is starting to kick in now. And I can tell you, generally speaking, it's more expensive than anybody really thought initially. So that's kind of the short bucket list for what we're looking at for 2014.","Operator","That is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Ms. Dillon for any closing remarks.","Mary N. Dillon","In closing, I'd like to thank all of our Ulta Beauty associates who worked very hard to deliver solid results in a tough environment in the third quarter. I'm very proud of the team for driving strong store sales while delivering on elements of our longer-term initiatives to position the company for success over the long haul. While we're acknowledging some of the challenges we're facing in the near term, I know the long-term opportunities for Ulta still make it one of the most exciting growth stories in all of retail.

Good afternoon everyone. 2016 is off to a phenomenal start with excellent top and bottom line growth in our first quarter. There are several factors coming together to drive the momentum of our business. Healthy consumer demand in the beauty category, also Beauty's unique and relevant format and positioning and effective collaboration across the enterprise which is driving strong execution of our growth strategy.","To recap the first quarter results. We grew the top line 23.7% and delivered 15.2% comps on top of an 11.4% comp in the first quarter of 2015. This is our best comp growth since 2006. Comp sales were driven primarily by traffic while ticket also saw healthy increases. Ongoing strength in cosmetics both mass and prestige is the largest contributor to our growth. But other major categories are delivering robust comps as well. E-commerce continues to see rapid sales growth. The salon's top line was solid even while we reduced the frequency of our promotions.","So with overall revenue growth significantly better than planned coupled with strong execution of our strategic imperatives we delivered Earnings per Share growth of almost 40% well above our expectations. I'd like to call out some more specific details on the primary contributors for our performance during the quarter. Growth in our loyalty program continues to fuel our business results. Ultimate rewards membership grew to 19.4 million active members up 25% year-over-year. This continued acceleration and sign ups reflects our store associates' effort to convert new members and strong traffic driven in part by our advertising campaign. The number of members shopping increased as well as their average sales per ticket, per visit.","Loyalty member retention has increased steadily each quarter and is up almost 200 basis points compared to last year. Using our loyalty program points as currency our CRM team is working closely with our merchants and our brand partners to continue developing targeted and relevant campaigns that are increasingly resonating with our guests. Our marketing mix continues to evolve with great balance across television, radio, digital and social media as well as our traditional print vehicle.","In March we ran television and radio ads for our signature 21 days of beauty event. We complemented this with an aggressive online video campaign as well as extensions into online radio with Spotify and Pandora. We elevated our social media and improved efforts anchored on our spring trends, we surrounded our consumer with current and relevant content online and in store as well as activation at high profile events including the Coachella Music Festival.","Our comprehensive campaign for Mother\u2019s Day, which was called Pamper Her with Pretty, was designed to build awareness of our brand, deepen our connection with our guest and provide a platform to make Ulta Beauty a top of mind destination for gift giving especially in Fragrance. In addition to the return of the mother\u2019s day gift guide and fragrance finder, we offered more gift at purchase and salon [ph] promotions in conjunctions with many exciting new fragrance launches. The mother\u2019s day activities also included a social media campaign with the launch of the special video entitled, Mom The Original Beauty Icon, which invited guests to celebrate mom by sharing what makes their own mom beauty iconic through post on Facebook, Twitter or Instragram. This campaign was viewed 4.5 million times. We believe all these marketing efforts contributed to our strong traffic growth during this quarter.","Now to update on merchandising, the trends from last year continued to drive the business, with Urban Decay, It Cosmetics, Nyx, Anastasia, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lanc\u00f4me, Benefit and the Ulta Beauty Collection among the best performing brands for the quarter. The pipeline of Muncie [ph] really continuing to be quite compelling, translating into strong growth in both mass and prestige cosmetics. During the quarter we launched Honest Beauty in 250 stores, rolled out our exclusive Fiona Stiles line in 500 stores and added Buxom cosmetics all doors.","Anastasia at Beverly Hills and it\u2019s [indiscernible] launched new product lines, Clarence was rolled out to additional doors, we introduced Tarte\u2019s Double Duty Beauty collection, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty and we rolled out Vevo Mascara to all stores. More recently we announced the addition on Beauty\u2019s new hair care products and we began to offer NUXE, a French skin care brand on our website. We also rolled out an assortment of the iconic Drybar hair products and tools in hundreds of stores. ","We\u2019re enhancing our Ulta beauty collection through a series of initiatives. We\u2019ve been updating and elevating the formulas and packaging as well as the in store graphics, while improving speed to market in on trend product. Trends categories include countering, Strobing and multi-dimensional makeup and we\u2019ve also added an end-cap featuring new spring hits. We\u2019ve produced compelling training videos and enhanced our sampling program. While we\u2019ve made great progress, we\u2019re just getting started with our efforts to evolve Ulta Beauty collections to continue to represent our brand\u2019s personality.","Turning to services, our Salon sales grows 14.7% and comp 7.7% with strength in blow outs, hair treatments and make up services. We view the services business as a growth opportunity and we\u2019re very focused on our strategy to convert more of our loyalty members to discover our high quality services offering. The Benefit Brow Bar continued its strong performance with brow services now in 738 stores and we\u2019re proud to perform more brow services than anyone else in the U.S.","Moving on to stores, we opened 13 stores and closed to one in the first quarter, well on our way to executing our 2016 program of 100 net new stores. We ended the quarter with 886 stores. New store productivity remains very strong with all vantages of stores benefiting from the successful execution of our strategic alternatives. Our growth and development team is now in the process of performing a detailed analysis to refresh out estimates of the store potential in the U.S. This analysis includes an updated assessment of the potentials for smaller and urban markets as well as how our small store format will fit into the future store mix. Sharing the outcome of this work is expected to be one of the topics we planned to cover at our next Analyst Day this fall. A small other update from our long term strategic plan that we\u2019ll now in the process of refreshing as well.","Moving on to ulta.com, our e-commerce growth was very strong up 38.8% and contributing a 130 basis point to our total company comp, that mix of professional hair care and prestige cosmetics continues to grow helping our e-commerce margin rate. We\u2019re also adding brands and products that are available only online such as J.Cat Beauty, StriVectin Hair Care, Ico [ph] and ManCave among others. Our ulta.com guests remain very interested in our Beauty Bags sampling programs and Beauty Breaks limited time promotions. Mobile is growing rapidly, now representing more than 60% of site traffic. We released new versions of our iPhone and Android apps in the first quarter. The iPhone app was featured on the apple store home page, moving up to a 5 star rating, this new version now includes features such as ApplyPay check out, enhance features displaying ultimate reward information and get quick purchase details on product pages. Both app versions have been a big hit with users, garnering enthusiastic user reviews and an increase in downloads now reaching well over 2 million between the two.","Finally, our supply teams and IT teams have done a great job, managing the ramp up of the Greenwood distribution sender, while preparing to open our new distribution center in Dallas, which began to accept inbound inventory just last week. The Greenwood BC is now serving about 200 stores and fulfilling roughly 40% of our e-commerce orders. We\u2019re on track to end the year delivering to approximately 240 stores from Greenwood. Our Dallas facility, a carbon copy of our Greenwood building is right on track to begin outbound track shipment in July as planned. We expect to ramp up this newest BC to several 125 stores by holiday. As expected the Greenwood distribution center and systems are producing efficiencies and cost per unit shift.","On the system side, we have good progress report here as well, Swiss our forecasting and replenishment tool has rolled out through additional categories including skincare and hair-care and rest of categories will be implemented throughout the remainder of the year. I'm particularly proud as the supply chain team and IT teams performance and deep collaboration and their balancing and execution of several major initiatives and projects while doing an excellent job improving in stocks in our stores to support the higher than expected sale trend.","So now I'll turn over to Scott to discuss the drivers of our first quarter result and outlook for the second quarter and the year. ","Scott Settersten","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Starting with the income statement, similar to previous quarters, our top line was driven by a very healthy 15.2% comp and strong new store productivity. The total company comp was composed of 11% transaction growth and 4.2% average ticket growth. The retail comp of 14.3% was made up of 10.5% traffic and 3.8% ticket. The Salon business comped 7.7% and Salon growth was all ticket based, e-commerce growth was almost entirely driven by traffic with modest ticket growth.","Gross profit increased 150 basis points, the improvement was driven by strong leverage on store rent and occupancy expenses as well as by healthy product margin expansion, offset by planned supply chain deleverage related to investments in new distribution centers and core merchandizing systems. Strong product margin performance was driven in part by significant margin improvement in mass departments due to changes in our promotional offers and mix of higher margin brands including the Ulta Beauty collection. We continue to carefully pullback on product discounting while placing more reliance on loyalty in our CRM tool kit. ","Moving on to SG&A expenses, we deleveraged by 20 basis points, primarily related to investments in headcount and consulting to support our growth initiatives. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, inventories were up 14.5% on a per store basis, slightly below the comp rate. This growth was driven by investments in inventory to keep upward better than expected top line growth, new brand addition and the accelerated expansion of prestige boutiques.","In stock levels have improved year-over-year, but we still expect to make more progress going forward as we begin to reap the benefits of our new distribution centers and related systems. Capital expenditures were 54.3 million in the quarter, driven by new store openings, merchandize fixtures for the rollout of prestige brand boutiques and supply chain in system investments. We ended the quarter with 369 million in cash and short-term investments. We repurchased 158,000 shares at a cost of 27 million under our 10b5-1 plan. As you know, we entered into a $200 million ASR agreement in March which settled just last week.","During the first quarter, we received 80% of the shares we expected to receive on settlement or about 852,000 shares, a reduction in shares outstanding year-over-year contributed approximately $0.03 of earnings per share growth in the quarter, including the entire 200 million paid as part of the ASR agreement approximately 219 million remained available under the 425 million share repurchase program announced in March.","Turning now to guidance for the second quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of 1.041 billion to 1.058 billion compared to 877 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 11% to 13% versus 10.1% last year. Online sales growth is expected to be in the 40% range. We planned to open about 25 stores in Q2 compared to 20 stores during the same period last year and preopening expense for the quarter is expected to be about 4.6 million.","Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.32 to $1.37, versus the $1.15 for Q2 of 2015. Our supply chain investments including our new Dallas BC are expected to weigh on margin the most in the second and third quarter and we expect earnings per share growth to be higher in the fourth quarter this year. We anticipate a tax rate of 37.6% and fully diluted share count of approximately 63 million.","In terms of our outlook for the full year 2016, we are raising our guidance for comparable sales and earnings per share growth to reflect the strong start to the year. Total company comps are now expected to be approximately 10% to 12%, compared to our prior guidance of 8% to 10%. We now expect to growth earnings per share in the low 20 percentage range versus our prior guidance of 18% to 20% growth. Operating margins are now expected to leverage slightly. The other elements of our guidance for the year are unchanged. We are on track to open approximately 100 stores, all planned to be on 10,000 square foot prototype. We expect to open about 25 stores in Q2, 50 stores in Q3 and 15 stores in Q4. We are also planning 12 major remodels into the locations. We plan to grow ecommerce approximately 40%. We expect CapEx to be above 390 million driven by slightly higher capital for new store and the roll out of boutiques.","As a reminder we planned about 80 million for boutique expansion and updates, with over 500 Clinique, Lanc\u00f4me, and Benefit boutiques, as well as updates to our fragrance fixtures and the Ulta Beauty collection. We anticipate that share repurchase activity under our $425 million authorization will contribute about 2 percentage points of earnings per share as well. ","I'll now turn the call over to our conference call host for the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Please state your question.","Christopher Horvers ","Was just curious, a lots of retailers talk about an uneven cadence during the quarter. Some pulled forward to manage early in the quarter some weather issues. Was curious if you had a view on how that impacted your business during the quarter?","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Chris. First of all I would say that what we saw was pretty consistent across the quarter in terms of comps, not on lot of variations, where we did see variation it was maybe cadence of promotions that we had planned. So I think at the end of day beauty as a category is great price to be as and it's a healthy category and it's fairly we think insulated from some of the factors that are effecting maybe retailers broadly, in particular our -- what we bring to the marketplace in terms of the differentiated proposition of categories, various price points, products and services we think makes us pretty insulated right now and we\u2019re pretty proud of the results.","Christopher Horvers ","Understood and then as a follow up. Can you just talk about the performance the comp performance in your mature store base and how that impacts your view on the potential store penetration over the long-term? Thank you.","Scott Settersten","Again, our store model reflects mature stores five years and older kind of moderating comps down to mid or lower single digit kind of comps over the long-term. With the 50 [ph] comp in the total as you can well imagine Chris, I mean the existing store base, very healthy comps overall, very productive on the SLV [ph] contribution line, which is a huge contributor to the profit increases that we saw year-over-year.","As we look to the future I mean that's part of the mix here, we\u2019re adding the boutiques that's why we\u2019re being so aggressive with the CapEx this year to get those installed. We believe that along with all the other great purchase of pipeline that we have coming aboard, loyalty on top of that after that, some of the marketing and advertising kind of initiatives we have underweight. We think all of those things together will come together to drive really strong productivity in that existing stores.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Please state your question.","Joseph Altobello","I guess the first question on the ultimate awards program, obviously hugely successful for you guys, well north of 19 million. First, how high can that number get, I guess you guys have, I'm sure you've done some demographic analysis in terms of the potential size of that. And secondly, if you could remind us what percentage of your sales comes from the loyalty club members?","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Joe. Well first obviously we've said as well over 80%. Over 80% of our sales are driven by the loyalty program members. We are really pleased with how that's working for our business, it's really one of the key drivers of the results that we\u2019re seeing as the acceleration in members entering this program really proud about our store teams been able to convert new traffic and new members into the store into the program. How high is up, I mean certainly we asked ourselves that question as well as, as we think about our kind of launch review of the business, it's going to be obviously a very key driver for us as we move forward and if you step way back and look at it, our share of the market in Beauty in the U.S. is still only a 3% or so of the total market right. So we know there is a lot of growth ahead and we are very focused on understanding kind of what it is about the loyalty program that drives the appeal and continue to make sure that we find tune it going forward. So we think there is more growth there certainly and I think our results are showing that.","Joseph Altobello","Okay, understood. And then, just moving on, I guess, one for Scott. The guide for Q2, you mentioned looks like earnings per share down sequentially. That's seasonally fairly unusual. You mentioned some the costs related to Dallas hitting you in Q2 and Q3 and you had the Greenwood facility around the same time last year and yet you had sequential earnings improvement in Q2. So I'm curious is Dallas bigger in terms of the impact or is the timing a little bit moved forward relative to Greenwood? Thanks.","Scott Settersten","No, I'd say it's more along the lines of a couple of new factors this year. So again I think we've talked about the DCs and the lapping effect there year-over-year. So not a huge change there within the sequence. We do have accelerated depreciation from this boutique acceleration that we talked about. So again, you guys can't really model that very accurately, but that's a little bit lumpy and it\u2019s kind of first half of the year kind of weighted I would say. And then we also had some store payroll implications related to the same boutique strategy right.","So I think we explained back in the fourth quarter it takes a lot for those boutiques to ramp up. So they\u2019re being installed now and we\u2019ve got some payroll investment there in the early days, which again over time moderates and plays very, but it\u2019s far from a profitability standpoint. So it's really the payroll piece of that is some of the depreciation that's really there that's causing that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Tunick of Royal Bank of Canada. Please state your question.","Brian Tunick","So excited here, you guys are having an Analyst Day in the fall, sounds like for the footage and the smaller storage you\u2019ll be updating us on. But I guess, I was curious about the mid-teen operating margin that you\u2019ve been talking about. I guess, you look at this double-digit comps you\u2019ve been running, I guess the question is can you get to mid-teen operating margin target faster or is there anything impairing you from getting to a high-teens operating margin over the next couple of years, so curious on that.","And from a market share perspective, when we all look at the depreciation store numbers, they\u2019ve been putting up the last couple of quarters. Can you maybe talk how that effects the brand conversations? So are there still major hold outs regarding brands that you\u2019d like to be offering I guess there might be still looking at the department stores as one of the key channels of distribution? Thanks very much.","Mary Dillon","Okay thank you, Brian. On your first question, while I'm not going to provide guidance today, nice try though, but that is a really fair question. I'd say this, we're very confident, first of all we're thrilled with the progress of the business. I think that should be pretty clear and confident that we understand the driver and we see plenty of growth ahead. We're confident in the mid-teen operating margin target that we've stated previously. I think what you'll see is we're looking to refresh our view, but feel good about where we are. I wouldn't expect to change our outlook materially.","We believe we can continue to drive top line and invest in the business for the long term as well as drive efficiencies with the investments that we're making today and while we're thrilled about the top line momentum I think all of us would say consumer expectations in the future will continue to evolve, so we need to be prepared to be able to respond in scenarios, lead instance scenarios, so that makes us cautious about getting more aggressive about the operating margin target.","Dave Kimbell","Great and Brian, its Dave Kimbell. On your second question around adding new brands in this environment. I'd start with saying that we're really focused on growing our business with our existing brands and that's working very well for us and we've got a great portfolio of brands across all categories and that's been very successful and will continue to drive success for us going forward. Having said that, we may have mentioned some of the brands that we've added just in the last quarter. You've heard that we've added well over 100 over the last several years, so we're always looking at new brands and as our growth continues, I think we're an attractive partner for brands. So we'll continue to be having discussions and exploring new opportunities, but right now really focused on continuing to drive behind the success that we've been having.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gere with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please state your question.","Jason Gere ","I guess I wanted to go back to talking about the OmniChannel customer and I know you talked about ecom was up almost 40%, a lot of that was traffic driven. So I was wondering as you're learning more with the loyalty card and CRM and the specialization, how are you getting that transaction size of that OmniChannel customer to kind of increase and any updated outlook in terms of how big that customer could actually become as a part of your subscriber base? Thanks.","Mary Dillon","Well I'll start and maybe David if there is any additional color you want to add. What\u2019s wrong with the growth that we're seeing in ecommerce, of course it's still pretty small percentage of our sales, just under 6%. And what's interesting is that as we look at the OmniChannel shopper multi-channel shopper, we love that guest because they are really our best guest in many ways. So the person who is shopping both in store and online is driving two and a half times the sales than somebody who\u2019s only shopping in the store.","So what that says to us is it's quite incremental. There's not a lot of replenishment type activity happening. We\u2019ve talked about this, we\u2019ve focused on this Beauty enthusiast who\u2019s really focused on trend and newness and actually it\u2019s when we get her e-mail address and the ability to give her e-mail, spark her imagination and curiosity about other products that maybe she didn't see in the store seems to be driving, whether it\u2019s that or beauty breaks or samples they are really responding. So over time, we certainly see that expanding in terms of percentage of sales. It's a small percentage of our sales today is from the multi-channel shopper, it\u2019s a very healthy place for us to continue to look at driving growth.","Dave Kimbell","The only thing I'd add to that is what we see with the OmniChannel guest most of them pretty quickly if they come in through ecommerce pretty quickly move into retail and that's what we would like to see. We want her experiencing the entire Ulta Beauty experience both online and in store. We're investing heavily in various both enablers of OmniChannel around our inventory and understanding of our guest as well as guest facing experiences that we talked in the past, we've got beacons in our stores now that allow us to -- will allow us over time to identify our guests, we've got same day shipping in partnership with Google. Mary mentioned some of the App improvements which will make it easier for her to buy anywhere and anytime she wants. So it\u2019s a big focus for us and we see lots of upside going forward.","Jason Gere ","Okay and then the other one I was going to squeeze in so you talk about Greenwood and Dallas in terms of the DCs. Given the last few years you've made key investments and obviously you guys have been doing a terrific job in terms of top line and bottom line. How does it make you think about the older DCs like as you continue to really drive strong growth now? Is now the time to maybe think about retrofitting some of the older DCs that eventually you might have to do just too obviously keep the best-in-class. So I was just wondering if that's something that you guys internally talk about or you're happy the way things are with the older DCs and down the road maybe you'll deal with it.","Scott Settersten","Uh, no. I mean its part of the whole supply network. It's part of our -- you know we've got a roadmap built right five years into the future showing us different things that we're going to address at different points in time so yes, you're right on Jason, we're thinking about the rest of the network and those buildings. We'd like to have everyone on one platform right, best in class kind of platform at one point in time, so those decisions are a little bit yet out in front of us, but I would say definitely that would be a focus of ours over the long term.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Birtel with Wells Fargo, please state your question. ","Ed Birtel","Scott just for you I guess. I'm sorry if I missed this, but on the gross margin very impressive expansion this quarter. Can you just elaborate how much of that was merchandise -- core merchandise margin versus fixed cost leverage and then of the 4% pricing in the quarter maybe just how do we think about that in terms of product mix and then just higher like-for-like pricing due to the pull back on couponing? ","Scott Settersten","Well let me take a crack at that. So gross margin overall, we aren't going to break down all of the basis points pluses and minuses here, puts and takes, but just directionally talking, I know sometimes people may not be clear to this, it\u2019s a multi-variable equation that we're solving for here at Ulta when we talk about promotions. So there is a couple of major buckets I would call them, merchant discounts, right. So what are the offers in the magazines that we distribute or the tabs that we put in the newspapers, whether it's two or one or is it buy one get one 50% off or a GWP with it, so that's one bucket. Then there is the Marketing discount bucket, which is the coupon 3.50 off 10, 20% off one item, 20% off the entire order kind of thing, with the postcard offers that we've described in the past, and then there is the loyalty. So that would be the third leg of the stool.","So again we\u2019ve approached this very carefully and we're testing and learning constantly, but if we look at the First Quarter for example, we talked about the mass area, so mass has been generating really healthy comps for us. We've kind of learned over the course of the last year that the merchandise discounts don't need to be as broad, maybe as what we've had done in the past. So this year we kind of narrowed it down instead of, buy two get one across the whole brand, maybe it's just a narrower set of skews. So that would be one example of something that we executed very well in the First Quarter.","And then there's just another set of other, just what I'd call smart merchandising marketing decisions. Continuing to tweak our coupon offers and the circulation that we have on our marketing offers both beauty collection, private label, super high margin part of our business was especially strong in the first quarter this year, ecommerce we called out again. Product mix there being very helpful to us, so we've got a lot of good things happening in the merc margin bucket I would say. And then you layer on top of that a 15 comp that helps a lot on the fixed store cost line, we called that out in our comments and then we had some offset, some deleverage on the supply chain which was planned and which was expected.","So that's kind of it, I guess I'd say in a nutshell, on the explanation of the variation year-over-year when we think about the comp break out and the ticket bifurcation, units were pretty flat year-over-year, so most of it was on average selling price.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Alswager with Robert W. Baird, please state your question.","Mark Alswager","Scott thanks for all of that detail on gross margin. I guess I wanted to follow-up quickly on SG&A. Spending was up 25% in the quarter which is presumably more than you initially planned when you built your -- planned for the quarter and for the year. So I guess can you break out just how much of that was pull forward and some of the accelerated depreciation you referred to that would potentially allow greater leverage later in the year and then to the extent you've had more dollars to spend given the top line growth, what are the areas where you've chosen to really intensify investment?","Scott Settersten","So we're really trying to stay focused and not break it out in too much detail the variations and I know you guys would love to have that but again, directionally the store payroll, there's some investment as we ramp up the boutiques and there was accelerated depreciation in the first quarter and it's going to be heavy again in the Second Quarter as we look compare against last year. I would say there's some cost of doing business things that in there.","You guys read all these stories about credit card fraud and the whole EMV thing that all of retail is kind of struggling with. So we aren't immune to that, we had some of that in the first quarter. Now lucky for us our EMV rollout is complete now. So we've mitigated that risk as we looked out across the rest of the year. I would also say that we're -- like we've done in the past, we look to optimize the business.","So there's some additional investments I would call in the short-term around some test and learn things, around levers, future levers to drive growth that we think we can move up here and accelerate a little bit into 2016, again those aren't huge but there's a little bit here and a little bit there. So again we're doing it in a very disciplined manner making sure we have the right balance for both short-term and long term financial results of the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.","Simeon Gutman ","Mary you mentioned 3% you said market share. I don't know if that was including or excluding services, but my question is do you have a sense of the share of the beauty spend among your best customers, what percent of their wallet are you getting and then based on what you carry, I know this is a moving target because that will change over time, but based on what you carry how much of that wallet is attainable?","Mary Dillon","Well the 3% of that I mentioned is if you take all of beauty product and services in the US, and that very macro view of it which is kind of where we start. And then if you look at really just the dollars that are spent even among the target that we focus on, the beauty enthusiast [indiscernible] on a budget certainly is higher, we have 5% of their share of wallet.","Of the people that are in our loyalty program, clearly it\u2019s higher than that. But I'll tell you what there's a lot of upside to that as well. We believe even we look at our best guest, when you step back there are 50,000 places you can buy beauty in the U.S. right? So between grocery, mass drug, department store, specialty retailers, online there's a lot of places you could buy beauty. So it\u2019s a lot of sources of volume and share gain. That whole idea for us and our guests seem to be really resonating with this is the more she spends with us, the loyalty program right, the more benefit she gets by consolidating for spend at Ultra.","So we have not tapped that out either in terms of the number of repellant -- the addressable market in terms of folks that could be our loyalty program as well as -- we\u2019ll never have the 100% of anybody\u2019s wallet I think, that\u2019s kind of in any category think about grocery for example, people buy food in two or three or four different types of retail outlets. It\u2019s probably always going to be a little bit like that with beauty, but we feel good about where it is and there is still a lot of potential for that growth. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. Please state your question.","Daniel H. Hofkin","Two quick questions, one on the comp, further uptick. Anything you could point to in terms of brand marketing et cetera. That led to the further acceleration in the First Quarter? Second question is just on the labor cost outlook, what's going on in the retail broadly and some of the recent legislation or Department of Labor rulings, any impact on you guys for the next couple of years? Thanks.","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Dan. In terms of the drivers honestly it's really a combination of a lot of factors really you could point most directly to the acceleration and the growth in the number file. So it was a 25% increase in the members and ULTAmate reward program that clearly we can point to as a major driver. So more guests in the program and guests spending more often, reactivation of guests, better retention.","Now that doesn't happen on accident, so it's really a combination of I would say anything we're doing I mentioned at the top, it's great to be in a category that's growing in beauty. We believe what we have is a very compelling proposition relative to a large segment of the market right? So what we offer them is relevant and as we look out into the future of the future consumer and Millenials even more so relevant, but then in addition we have to be driving awareness and traffic. So I feel great about what I would call our demand creation tools. So we wouldn't have an increase in the numbers if we didn't have new people coming to Ulta and the traffic shows that.","Then in addition of course it's about what we sell in the store and the service that we give and the services and the guest experience. So I talked a lot about the merchandise assortment, so I feel good about we're really doing business smartly with our brand partners, so I guess in total it's a lot of things coming together effectively for us to drive members into loyalty program and have a relative proposition to drive their growth.","On the second part you asked about was yes there's a lot obviously happening as it relates to wages and what not in particular, there is an overtime pay, a thing that just passed. We have already factored that into our forecast. There's some attached to us this year it\u2019s immaterial I would say, most of our Managers are typically paid above their threshold and some co-managers are affected and as we look out into future years, we'll continue to obviously be cognizant in factor wage into other pay factors.","Operator","Our next question is comes from Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research. Please state your question.","Adrienne Yih","Two quick, very quick questions. Mary what is the overall forecast that you're using for beauty and services segment growth and then secondarily, as you build or as you do your brand awareness studies where are you finding which demographic do you have the highest brand awareness with? Thanks very much.","Mary Dillon","As I stated we would just look at the current growth factors to the industry that you guys can see as well, which is the industry is up what 4% and which is great and obviously prestige up more than mass, color cosmetics up a lot. So we look at the published forecast or published data that\u2019s out there as well as do our own kind of work that's both qualitative and quantitative thinking about future sources of growth.","So don\u2019t have a great -- any other Crystal ball than anybody else, but we\u2019re I think pretty darn good at understanding consumer segments, understanding and projecting where their demand might go in the future and use that to try to figure out what we think the category growth will be. The second question was? ","Dave Kimbell","Awareness","Mary Dillon","Awareness, let me give that one to Dave, thank you. ","Dave Kimbell","Yes so on brand awareness, overall, we see -- we don't see huge swings by any demographic group that's really -- it\u2019s pretty broad based and we're seeing growth across all demographic, all age ranges, ethnicity, but I would say Hispanic women do have a bit higher in general across-the-board and that's the strength that we're continuing to grow with.","Adrienne Yih","Okay, great and any quantification of that?","Dave Kimbell","No. I guess we won't share any of that detail, but we did grow our total awareness and we shared that in the past, so total awareness increased five points in Q1 versus Q1 of last year to 84% on a native basis and was up two points on a non-native basis to 40% [ph]. So continued strong growth of that behind the marketing efforts and we expect to continue to drive that going forward.","Operator","Your next question is comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Securities. Please state your question. ","Simeon Siegel","Did you say or how many prestige brand boutiques do you currently have? I think Scott did you say you expect to open 500 this year and can you share any color on the comp lift and maturity in those stores when add?","Scott Settersten","I think we shared this last time, so we started the year and we talked about in the couple hundred range of Clinique and and this year yes, approximately 500 new boutiques across Clinique, Lanc\u00f4me and Benefit those three brands. We will see growth over the year. We're just getting those new ones opened, so while it had some impact on and Q1 was not the big driver of Q1 and frankly to add, it will be a contributor but there's a lot of other parts of our business that are driving growth a lot of the brands in prestige phase with mass and hair care, skincare, so it will continue to drive growth but we aren't counting on that being the primary driver of growth throughout the rest of the year.","Simeon Siegel","Great thanks and then did you say with the Ulta Beauty collection penetration was at this point? Do you see that business grow in mix as the overall brand awareness grows, do you actively look to grow that penetration, any thoughts there?","Dave Kimbell","Yes, Mary gave a few of the highlights about some of the things that we're doing to build that and frankly I think we are on at the beginning of a really reinvention of that business and we're seeing the impact of that already strong growth. Scott talked about high margins, so when we look at the exclusive Ulta Beauty collection and exclusive brands combined like included brands like gift brushes for Ulta it's about 6% of our business and we'll see that growing over time. We've got new innovation we'll continue to drive that business behind and we'll as you mentioned as our brand grows as our recognition grows, and then we improve its presentation and quality of the product and just overall merchandising strategy, marketing strategy, we'll see that grow as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.","Matthew Fassler","A couple of follow-ups. In terms of demographics you spoke a bit about Hispanic customers, you talked to Millenials. If you think about the market share opportunity you have and where you're getting incremental traction, could you for instance talk a bit more about age and also new versus exiting Markets. What cohorts you feel that you're uncovering and kind of awakening to the vitality of the concept at this point, as the marketing has exploded here.","Mary Dillon","Let me just say, I think more of this we'll talk about in the fall as we do the Analyst Day because it\u2019s kind of as we think about the future that's obviously, we're sort of in the insights and mailing machine about kind of where the world is going and how to think about those dynamics for Ulta. I'll let Dave add color, but I will tell you I think we all feel personally very optimistic that as we think about the way the world edges with the world today, sort of the influences are really converging nicely as it relates to beauty as a category as well as shopping in the way that we offer, should be able to commend with a point of view and Steve already a curated idea in mind to get some help as well. So maybe you could add a little more to that, but more on this topic. I'd say is the best way to think about it.","Dave Kimbell","The only thing I'd say is our growth, we're excited to see in our growth as I mentioned earlier, it isn't concentrated on any specific age range or demographic profile, it's really is beauty enthusiast and she's all ages, she looks all across the country, so we're seeing strength with teenagers, there has been -- reports are out that from other third parties about Ulta continue to gain strength and presence with teenagers, certainly Millenials, but through all the way through ages and of course a great part of beauty is it's not age dependent, we each might change, but their desire to be part of a beauty category continued. So I will see that across the board right now.","Matthew Fassler","Thank you for that. My second follow up, so it sounds like that the boutiques while they\u2019re rolling in are only about are already starting to impact the business, if you think about your historical experience and the kind of pop that that can give the business relative to the double-digits same-store sales you've been posting without that catalyst, is the input or the additional volumes from those boutiques material in that context or is it something that should just be absorbed by the strong growth that you've got these days?","Scott Settersten","I think it was short-term it's absorbed so again back to today\u2019s earlier point here, it's going to be additive, it takes a while for those boutiques to ramp up much similar to our store, maturation curve overall we've seen I\u2019ve demonstrated over a long period of time. So again over the longer term yes we think it is a significant add to the [indiscernible] grow and will help productivity significantly over the long-term.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Please state your question.","Courtney Willson","This is Courtney Willson in for Oliver Chen. Thanks for taking our question and congrats on the impressive results. We just had a question in terms of the consumer dynamics, the mass consumer versus the prestige consumer. Which segment is experiencing higher rates of new customer acquisition and is there an increasing amount of cross shopping between the two customer segments? Thanks very much.","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Courtney. The great thing is there is definitely separate mass versus prestige consumers at our store, which is kind of core I guess. There is a bit of a tendency to come in and I think we\u2019ve talked about this grade and maybe more the mass side and prestige -- and migrate overtime. Typically, our guest has a mixture through, there is really very few people I think are just completely one versus another type category. And that's part of the beauty of what we offer that makes it super relevant for our guest and I think it is well for our grand partners.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.","Rupesh Parikh","So I have two quick questions. First are you guys seeing any similar things differences between the performance or traffic at your mall locations versus non-mall locations? And then second our new products clearly from your Q1 remarks it sounds like there is a significant amount in unit and innovation Q1. As we look out for the balance of the year what can we expect in terms of brand product additions?","Mary Dillon","Okay, so we\u2019ll tag team this again, Dave. Certainly, the mall as you know, malls are about with 10% or so of our store base and we\u2019re not seeing much of a difference. We\u2019re seeing positive traffic, I would say when we\u2019re in malls we pick those spots pretty carefully, both in terms of the market as being a great place to shop in the given market as well as our locations in the exterior of the mall store, so we feel good about how they\u2019re performing.","Dave Kimbell","Yes, on new brands, nothing to report specifically here. But I will say as has been our trend of Lanc\u00f4me [ph], we\u2019ll continue to add new brands. But I\u2019d say that is a big contributor, we\u2019re also I mentioned this earlier, we\u2019re really focused on driving growth with our existing brands. We had a lot of new products coming in and growth with existing products within our portfolio across many other brands that Mary mentioned in her remarks. So it will be a mix continue to drive with a strength of our big brands like Urban Decay and Redken and Bear and Two Face and Nyx, but then we\u2019ll certainly compliment that with new brands throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray. Please state your question.","Steph Wissink ","I just have one question on the brand Boutique, I\u2019m wondering if you can give us a little bit more information on the return on invested capital or some of the productivity goals that you have within that floor space. And just given the $80 million investment I think that you talked about so far, can you talk to us about what the brands are that committing to, whether it's capital exclusive product or marketing? Thank you.","Scott Settersten","Let me start there, as far as the 80 million is concerned, I mean that's all Ulta. So we\u2019re stepping up with the CapEx investment and again that 80 million partly it's not just a boutique drop in, so again this 500 -- roughly 500 individuals boutiques drop ins across the team. But we\u2019re going to take the opportunity while we\u2019re in the stores to also refresh our fragrance fixtures in those stores and Ulta Beauty collection fixturing as well. As well as other miscellaneous things, right during the store touching it up and causing some chaos. You\u2019re going to take the opportunity to do what you think is best for the guests long-term.","So that\u2019s how we\u2019re deploying the $80 million. Again each vendor, we have a different set economic terms with them. So I think by-and-large, it\u2019s kind of, it\u2019s a payroll share kind of model. So again they\u2019re trained, they\u2019re our associates, there are on our payroll, the vendors provide, or vendor partners provide excellent training for them. We kind of share the payroll, model on a go forward basis and it takes a while, again we install the boutique\u2019s upfront, it takes a while for those the reach maturity, right. So again as we go overtime we add more payroll resources there to make a more productive. So I think that\u2019s it in a nutshell.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question. ","Mike Baker","So I just want to ask about the loyalty card increased membership. Is a lot of that or is it break out, how much better coming from people who already were shopping in each store, but weren\u2019t loyalty cards and now you\u2019re sort of upgrading them to loyalty numbers or versus what percent is coming from customer who would use the brand and they\u2019re coming in and then they\u2019re signing on?","Dave Kimbell","What we\u2019ve shared, I think couple of quarters ago that we\u2019ve seen an increase in, I guess what we call reactivation which were last customers. And so we\u2019ve seen a healthy increase of that. Probably won\u2019t get sharing that every quarter of that is a part of it. So customers that might have shopped with us two years ago would not be considered a current customer. But we have a record of them, they comeback in they reactive their accounts and they move into our active, would move back into our active member profile.","So that\u2019s the chunk of it, but the biggest part of it is new to older customers. And that is exactly as you describe customers coming in and shopping at Ulta and starting that experience as our customers and when they get up and interact with one of our associates, become customer during their visit there. And a key part of our success has been our store associates really doing an excellent job converting non-members into members in the store, and we\u2019ve seen a strong increase in that. So that is the primary drive or new member growth.","Mike Baker","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Well, you have one more maybe more mundane question, but what we\u2019ve heard from couple of other retailers that the real state opportunities are very strong out there, very much a buyers\u2019 market. Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in some of the new stores in terms of rents and those types of metrics?","Scott Settersten","I guess, we could echo those comments that you\u2019ve heard from others. We have a no shortage of great real estate sites and we\u2019re seeing as we look at proposals across the country, again our stores. We have a typical, I guess best in class kind of set of co-tenants that we would like to operate with, but we\u2019ve proven and demonstrated overtime, Ulta store is working on wide variety of real estate locations and types.","So I feel very confident about our current pace of 100 stores a year right that we\u2019ve talked about here as our medium term target. We just came back I guess from ICSC here in the last day of so. Again the landlords, the relationships that we have a very strong, we know Ulta is being sought out as a tenant of choice. We\u2019re proven traffic drivers at centers and the Beauty category is something that many landlords as a piece of the offering, retail offering that they would love to add the mix overall.","Mike Baker","So I guess the punch line there is that, materially changing your new store economic model and is that something that you would address at your Analyst Day this fall?","Scott Settersten","Yes, I mean, I don\u2019t -- we haven\u2019t -- we\u2019re always very competitive, when we get into the rent structure and the economic terms of our deals, I mean, I think Ulta is probably best in class. When you look at our operating model overall. So it\u2019s not like we\u2019re seeing something step decreases and rent terms or anything like that, at least not at this stage. Not a lot of the liquidation events are kind of in profit I guess, I would say right now. So I guess that\u2019s yet to be seen. And it\u2019s not causing us to rethink the number of stores that we open every year. Like a 100 a year, again there is no magic around that, but that\u2019s kind of a comfortable pace for us with the number of new associates we need to add to the mix overall and the time here that those storage usually get open, all in when we think about that a hundred is kind of a good pace.","Operator","Our final question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.","Omar Saad","I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the comment you made early around urban stores and doing some more thought process around that. If you have anything in the fleet now that resembles is kind of an urban location and how it does and how those locations may do in more densely populated urban type areas. It seems like it could be a great fit, obviously the real estate costs are a bit different. But would love to hear more about it?","Mary Dillon","Yes. No problem Omar. I guess, what I would say is yes, we have several urban, I guess you can call them stores in the fleet, and they do fine. As were thinking about the future, I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve ever had a conservative urban strategy right. So we don\u2019t have a lot of them Omar. Our main strategy has been to reach in suburbs and in power centers, [indiscernible]. We've talked about, we feel good about the 10,000 sq. foot store format and the ability to hit at least 1,200 of that format, but when I referenced that we\u2019re also looking at, let\u2019s say opportunity in the smaller market and then also looking at opportunity in places where the parcels of real estate by definition would be smaller.","So whether it's urban centers or the downtown maybe shopping area of high end suburbs right, so we've got just curious of 2,000 to 5,000 square foot stores right now and that we are operating to learns about the dynamics of a different size box and they\u2019re doing well, they were also burning a lot about the best way to operate that and as we look at refreshing our view of store growth, urban is the question we\u2019re asking ourselves and look as you said, obviously the economics are different, but as we drive brand awareness across the country with our marketing efforts we know that wherever we go now people know more about us that I guess they would have in the past, right. So that's a good way to place a start, so more to come on that.","Omar Saad","Thanks, that's helpful and then can I ask one follow up on the loyalty, have you thought about ever partnering with a financial services firm and maybe adding a private label credit element to that, or are you happy as a standalone loyalty program?","Mary Dillon","Well, we're very happy with the loyalty program today, it's really a key asset for us and that's a fair question, I mean that something that could be a good asset in the long run rate, nothing to announce on that certainly, but it's certainly something that has history in retail that's been successful from the retailers.","Operator","And now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. ","Mary Dillon","Thank you. I'd just like the close by thanking our 26,000 associate for an incredible start to the year and look forward to speaking with all of you again soon. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"20839":["Ulta Beauty, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laurel Lefebvre, Investor Relations, Vice President. Thank you. You may begin.","Laurel Lefebvre","Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us for Ulta Beauty\u2019s third quarter 2018 conference call. Hosting our call are Mary Dillon, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Settersten, Chief Financial Officer. Also, joining us is Dave Kimbell, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you of the company\u2019s Safe Harbor language.

Ulta Beauty\u2019s strong performance in the third quarter reflects continued market share gains across all major categories, acceleration in our overall comp driven by healthy traffic, excellent new store productivity and robust e-commerce growth.","To summarize the headlines, total sales increased 16.2%. We delivered 7.8% comp sales growth on top of 10.3% comps in the third quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per share of $2.18 grew 28%. We just shared a lot of news at our Analyst Day last month, and today, I\u2019ll reiterate some of the information we discussed about each of our strategic imperatives, which position us to deliver industry-leading financial results.","I\u2019ll begin with our efforts to drive loyalty and to take our brands to the next level. We grow our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program to $30.6 million active members at the end of the third quarter, a 15.3% year-over-year increase. Loyalty member sales now represent more than 95% of our total revenues.","We continue to benefit from the high engagement of our Platinum and Diamond level guests, garnering more than 40% share of wallet from these two tiers combined. These guests are over three times more likely than our average guests to be omni-channel shoppers and take advantage of our services offering. They also have extremely high retention levels at more than 96%.","Going forward, we expect to increase our focus on driving higher sales per member and personalization is the next major tool for growing share of wallet. Our vision is to make every guest touchpoint personalized and relevant, building tools and capabilities to develop a closer connection to our guests, so they feel even deeper loyalty to the Ulta Beauty brand.","We\u2019re just in the early innings of personalization, and we\u2019re building expertise, both internally and through acquisitions to bolster our capabilities in this area. More on this topic in a bit. We also continue to grow our credit card portfolio and see a sustained business sales for our guests, who hold the Ulta Beauty credit card. Sales of gift cards grew 35% in the quarter, driven by expanding distribution and other retailers this year, as well as strong growth in our own stores.","We continue to grow awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand, now reaching all-time highs at 55% for unaided and 92% for aided awareness for the quarter. These milestones are supported by significant improvements on important brand attributes such as being considered exciting, fun, inspiring, experts in beauty and on trend.","Last quarter, we discussed the launch of our new brand purpose, \u201cThe Possibilities are Beautiful\u201d. This is a new articulation of our brand platform, celebrating the emotional and inclusive power of possibilities at Ulta Beauty. We believe we\u2019ve moved past the point of driving awareness of the concept of Ulta Beauty, All Things Beauty, All in One Place, to one of being able to create a true emotional connection with our current and prospective guests. This is how great brands create loyalty and drive growth over the long haul.","To support the launch, we commissioned a consumer study to understand beauty standards and perceptions of beauty today, in order to facilitate this important discussion. We brought this to life with a partnership with NBCUniversal\u2019s platforms, including NBC, E! and Telemundo, which garnered millions of impressions and engagement with our brand.","As part of our efforts to connect more closely with the key consumer segments of millennials, Latinas, Gen Z and African-Americans, we\u2019ve launched specific efforts to drive awareness with each group. For example, we\u2019re partnering with ESSENCE and Girls United to increase academic potential, confidence in leadership of young women\u2019s aged 12 to 17, and leveraging partnerships with influencers and media partners that are most relevant to these consumer groups.","In addition to our new brand equity campaign that launched a few months ago, we began running new holiday commercials with the theme, Shine Brighter, in early November focused on Ulta Beauty as a destination for both grooming and gifting.","Let me turn now to an update on our merchandise assortment, focused on innovation, differentiation, exclusivity, relevancy and speed to market. During the third quarter, we benefited from double-digit comp growth in mass cosmetics, prestige skin care, fragrance, prestige boutique brands and sun care. Prestige cosmetics showed modest improvement in comp sales performance compared to the prior quarter, suggesting encouraging stabilization of our largest category.","We\u2019re positioned in Ulta Beauty as the partner of choice for brands across the beauty spectrum from classic brands to established indie brands to new and emerging brands and we believe there are significant opportunity to grow each of these groups in multiple expressions and formats.","As we\u2019ve recently launched an emerging brands team, focused on identifying new and often digitally-native brands. The team has developed customized processes to onboard and incubate smaller or emerging brands of partnerships with all areas of our business in order to ensure successful launches of these brands, which are often not accustomed to a retail environment.","We\u2019re excited to be participating in the rapid rise of influencer and celebrity-driven brands. Kylie Cosmetics is off to a strong start, with 28 SKUs launched in-store on November 17 \u2013 excuse me, November 17 and were carried the assortment online. We also announced the introduction of four Kim Kardashian West Fragrances for holiday, which launched in-store only. Both brands have been very supportive of these launches with a series of social media posts by Kylie and Kim, who each have 120 million Instagram followers.","Kylie also made a personal appearance in one of our Houston stores the weekend of the launch. Other examples of influencer-led brands are the launches of Beauty Bakerie, Juvia\u2019s Place and expansion of Morphe. Morphe is now in 10 feet with an elevated presentation in all stores, and we launched an exclusive collaboration on November 16 with James Charles, an influencer with over 10 million Instagram followers.","Our holiday plan has been well executed by the teams with many exclusive products and kits; elevated gift for purchase offerings for fragrance; and a strong Black, Cyber Monday offer; as well as our early December Beauty Blitz program. Combined with the new holiday television and radio creative in-store marketing, we\u2019re confident that we have implemented a comprehensive merchandising new marketing plan to position Ulta Beauty as a compelling destination for holiday shopping.","Now touching on our services business. Salon sales grew 10.7 % and comp 3.5 %, driven by average ticket increases and benefiting from increased traffic in our stores. To update you on the roll out of our service optimization program, our new services model is now in over 30% of the chain. We continue to see encouraging results and we will continue to roll it out to additional markets in early 2019.","This program was built to attract and retain top stylists to provide exceptional services. The components of services optimization, our compensation design to retain top talent, industry-leading internal trading and education, simplified menus, transparent pricing, as well as dedicated field teams focused on business and technical training to support our 8,000 stylists.","We continue to roll out the skin bar Ulta Beauty and now have this format in 174 stores. We plan to have 188 stores with the skin bar by year-end, and 50 of them will be multi-branded offering services with brand partners, Dermalogica, Murad, Kate Somerville and Kiehl\u2019s. Early results are promising for increased product sales, as well as guest satisfaction.","We\u2019re now testing a new salon appointment booking tool in partnership with technology start-ups groups. We developed an enhanced tool for booking appointments for all services, including hair, skin, brows and makeup. The booking tool is faster and easier to use and elevates guests engagement. We expect to roll the booking tool out through 2019, with further enhancements to the platform teed up for next year.","And now let me turn to real estate. We opened 42 stores in the third quarter, compared to 48 last year and closed three ending the quarter with 1,163 stores. New stores continue to deliver sales ahead of expectations, and we recently updated our new store model to reflect the strength of the new store portfolio, with year one stores achieving sales of $3.5 million on average and ramping to $5 million by the fifth-year of operation.","With increased confidence in the next several years of store growth, we narrowed our U.S. store target range of 1,500 to 1,700, and we\u2019ll slightly moderate new store openings in the next few years, with plans to open 80 stores in 2019, 75 stores in 2020 and 70 stores in 2021. This moderation is planned in tandem with a greater focus on portfolio repositioning, as the large number of store leases is coming up for renewal in the next several years.","Moving on to our e-commerce sales and our recent efforts to create an innovation ecosystem. Ulta.com sales grew 42.5%, and represented nearly a 11% of total company revenue. E-commerce contributed 340 basis points of the total company comp, driven by transaction growth. Total traffic growth rose close to 36%, with mobile traffic up 44%.","We continue to see strong demand for store-to-door or save the sale program, and we\u2019re now testing buy online, pickup in store in 47 locations. So I\u2019d like to recap some of the important announcements we made at our Analyst Day in November. We described how we\u2019re building an innovation ecosystem with a series of partnerships and acquisitions.","We recently invested in a multi-year strategic partnership with Iterate, a technology solutions company and workflow platform. Iterate helps large companies harness the best digital innovations and allows us to tap into technology talents in Silicon Valley in Colorado, as well as sharing knowledge across industry. Iterate attracts trends, provides research and curate technology partnership opportunities. And for Ulta Beauty, it enables rapid prototyping and gives us access to start-ups that will be most suited to our needs.","In addition to this important partnership, we\u2019re also accelerating innovation by building internal capabilities. For the first time in the company\u2019s history, we made acquisitions of two small tech start-ups, GlamStreet and QM Scientific, to support our digital experience roadmap and develop the innovation pipeline. We welcome these entrepreneurial founders and their teams to Ulta Beauty family. We\u2019re excited to work together with this team to unlock personalization in a differentiated way.","GlamStreet has been a partner for the past two years behind the development of GlamLab, our virtual try and experience in our mobile app. Bringing these capabilities in-house will allow us to move faster in developing our augmented reality offerings. They can buy an AR, AI and machine learning capabilities and focus on virtual makeover solutions, image processing, graphics and effects.","QM Scientific is an artificial intelligence startup, recognized as a disruptor in the retail space. Their capabilities include artificial intelligence, recommendations, computer vision, natural language processing and visual search. Both GlamStreet and QM Scientific bring technology leadership, guest experience focus, capabilities and the right cultural fit with Ulta Beauty.","Connecting these strategic relationships and partnerships start to frame up our approach to digital innovation, an ecosystem where we rely on capable technology partners, more closely with Iterate as an innovation workflow partner and as an extension of our Ulta Beauty team, as well as invest in assets and bring in-house technologies and talents that are core to our future.","We view this structure as an efficient way to accelerate our digital innovation capabilities on our path to deliver world-class digital experiences, including much greater personalization.","And now turning to an update on our supply chain operations. Strong in stock levels, coupled with good control of inventory per door growth, were the highlights of our supply chain team\u2019s performance in the quarter. Our newest distribution center of Fresno is ramping quickly, now serving a 173 stores in 21% of e-commerce orders.","In concert with the continued ramp-up of our three newer buildings, we are reducing activity in our Phoenix, B.C. in preparation for its closure next year. We see a significant opportunity to improve working capital in the years ahead. As part of the efficiencies for growth cost optimization program, we\u2019re launching an SKU rationalization project. We\u2019re also benefiting from better inventory visibility and markdown tools.","Over time, we\u2019ll get the entire supply chain network on a common operating model, as well as continue to drive end-to-end process improvements. As a result, we expect to see modest inventory turn improvement each year over the next several years, with a goal of 50 basis points of improvement over the next five years.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott to discuss in more detail the drivers of our third quarter financials and outlook for the fourth quarter and the full-year.","Scott Settersten","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll begin with the income statement. Top line growth of 16.2% was driven by a 7.8% comp and strong new store productivity. The revenue recognition accounting standard adopted at the beginning of the year added $10.5 million in sales from the combined impact of income from our credit card program, gift card breakage, as well as e-commerce revenue now being recognized upon shipment, offset by the value of points earnings in our loyalty program.","As a reminder, our retail comparable sales growth is not impacted by the revenue recognition accounting change. Traffic strengthened compared to the prior quarter, with transactions driving the majority of the comp. Total company transactions increased 5.3% and ticket increased 2.5%.","The retail-only comp of 4.4% was balanced between traffic and ticket. Ticket growth was driven by increases in average selling price, with units per transaction flat. Including the salon comp of 3.5%, the combined retail in salon comp was 4.4%.","Turning to gross profit. Margin was flat year-over-year. The new revenue recognition accounting standard added about 50 basis points to the gross profit line. So the underlying 50 basis points of deleverage were a bit more than we were forecasting going into the quarter.","Some of the factors driving this deleverage were the same dynamics we\u2019ve been experiencing all year, including the mix of e-commerce sales; the mix of lower-margin prestige brands; investments in our salon business and supply chain deleverage, driven by the Fresno distribution center opening; as well as higher freight costs, which weighed on the P&L by about 10 to 15 basis points as we called out at our Analyst Day.","Overall, promotions were fairly flat year-over-year, with lower circulation of some of our print catalogs and newspaper inserts and three weeks of our postcard 20% offer this year, compared to four weeks of the same offer last year, offset by increased digital marketing.","The primary driver of the delta between the original plan and our actual results was the clearance event that began at the end of the second quarter and continued into the first several weeks of the third quarter. It took us longer than expected and we took deeper markdowns than expected, to sell through the discontinued inventory to clean up our back rooms, to get our stores ready for all the great new launches ahead of holiday.","While the clearance event did pressure marginally more than planned, we\u2019re happy with the end results and are in great shape for Q4. The margin rate headwinds that I described were partially offset by planned leverage of rent and occupancy expenses.","Moving down to SG&A. We deleveraged by 140 basis points, including 70 basis points of impact from the revenue recognition accounting standard. The remaining 70 basis points were due to deleverage of store payroll, primarily related to the prestige brand expansion, as well as deleverage of marketing expense.","This was due to timing of advertising spend for our new campaign, and we anticipate marketing expense to be flat as a percentage of sales for the full-year. These pressures were partly offset by slight leverage in corporate overhead.","Operating margin was 10.8% of sales and was down 130 basis points from last year\u2019s Q3 operating margin of 12.1%, with 20 basis points attributable to the revenue recognition accounting change. Diluted EPS grew 28% to $2.18, with about $0.02 of earnings due to a lower than expected tax rate related to equity compensation.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total inventory grew 10% and was flat on a per store basis, well below comparable sales growth, as we continue to benefit from improved inventory systems and processes, as well as the clearance event that began at the end of the second quarter and ran for the first few weeks early in the third quarter.","Capital expenditures were $115 million for the quarter, driven by new stores, investments and systems, prestige brand roll outs, merchandise fixtures and supply chain investments. We ended the third quarter with $296.9 million in cash. We repurchased 451,000 shares to our 10b5-1 program at a cost of $119 million during the third quarter. $283 million remained available on the $625 million authorization as of quarter-end.","Turning now to guidance for the quarter and full-year. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be in the range of $2.085 billion to $2.103 billion versus $1.938 billion last year. Recall that, last year\u2019s fourth quarter included an extra week worth $108.8 million and about $0.14 of earnings.","We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 7% to 8% versus 8.8% last year. Our comparable sales will compare weeks 40 through 52 this year with the same period last year, so that 53rd-week drops out.","E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the mid-30s percentage range, compared to 60.4% last year, or 50.4% on a comparable 13-week basis. We plan to open approximately 11 new stores in the fourth quarter, compared to 16 in Q4 last year, and remain on track to open 100 net new stores this year. Q4 preopening expense is expected to be slightly lower as a rate of sales compared to last year.","Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.55 versus $3.40 last year on a GAAP basis, or $2.75 adjusted for a lower tax rate, the impact from the revaluation of deferred taxes and related one-time bonuses last year. Operating margin is planned to deleverage, including the roughly 20 basis points related to the revenue recognition accounting standard consistent with the impact we\u2019ve seen so far this year.","The tax rate for Q4 is expected to be 24%. This does not include any assumptions for the tax rate impact of share-based compensation accounting, which is difficult to forecast. Our fully diluted share count is estimated at $60.3 million.","For the full-year, we are maintaining our outlook for comparable sales and earnings per share, which we updated at our Analyst Day a month ago. We plan to open 100 new stores, all approximately 10,000 square feet. We\u2019ll complete 15 remodel and relocation projects. We expect to grow e-commerce approximately 40%. We anticipate top line growth in the low-teens, including the impact of the 53rd-week last year.","Total company comps are expected to be in the 7% to 8% range. We expect to grow diluted earnings per share in the low-20s percentage range, including the extra week in 2017. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $375 million, depreciation is forecasted at approximately $290 million, we expect to repurchase shares in the $500 million range for the year and the annual tax rate for the remainder of the year is expected to be 24%.","As you know, we provided a long-term look at our Analyst Day last month, targeting mid to high-teens earnings per share growth, 5% to 7% comparable sales for the next three years and modest margin improvement each year. We plan to provide specific annual guidance for 2019 on our Q4 call in March as we normally do.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to our conference call host for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Great. Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question here is from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Lauren Frasch","Hi, everyone. This is Lauren for Ike. Scott, could you maybe provide a bit more color around Q3 gross margins, maybe help us understand the dynamics between fixed costs, the merchandise margin and how the clearance event play into that? Also, anything that may have surprised you in the quarter and how that helps you think about Q4 gross margins as well? Thank you very much.","Scott Settersten","Yes. Thanks for the question. I know this is a little complicated, so let\u2019s give you a couple of points of reference. So versus last year, what you guys may have been expecting or looking for your models. So benefits versus last year included lapping the hurricanes. Of course, we had to promote a lot last year to capture lost sales, right?","We said, I think, it was about 100 basis points of comp of impact last year and then stronger rent in occupancy leverage versus last year, so we\u2019re lapping over a number of, what I call, higher-cost stores, Manhattan and Michigan Avenue, and a number of others that we installed last year. Those benefits were offset by salon optimization investments that we\u2019ve been talking about.","All year, the Fresno DC, again, new in the second quarter, that\u2019s caused a bit of deleverage year-over-year and then the mix things we\u2019ve been talking about in the business, the prestige brand mix and an e-commerce mix, all right, so that\u2019s versus last year.","Versus our expectations, we call our transportation of 10 to 15 basis points at Analyst Day, so there has been some upward pressure there all year for us. On the sales mix side, Marry called our fragrance and mass doing really well in the third quarter. So again, fantastic market share gains, but those two categories do have slightly lower margins overall than the house. And then it was primarily, we called out the clearance event, was really the bigger surprise for us versus our plan.","So like I said, we had to go longer and deeper to move those items out of the store. But it was the right thing for us to do, and we feel really good where we are prepared for holiday.","Lauren Frasch","Great. Thank you so much for the color, Scott.","Operator","Our next question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simeon Gutman","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. So one question and just a couple of parts. Scott, can you quantify to us how much more did the extra clearance or the extending of the clearance hurt your gross margin? And I guess, I would have presumed that by the time you gave your second quarter call, you had some idea of this at the time. And then I just want to reconcile this, Sephora called out a more promotional environment, you didn\u2019t really, you didn\u2019t say that, I mean, it was all sounds like this clearance event. But just if you can talk about the posture of the industry and if it feels more competitive? Thanks.","Scott Settersten","Yes. So maybe I can start with the promotional environment. So again, we feel like it\u2019s relatively stable year-over-year as we look at things. So again, it seems like overall there has been a bit more buzz about things. In the competitive environment, this is a tough space it always has been and we expected to continue to be. So as we\u2019re looking ahead now, specifically to the fourth quarter, we feel like we\u2019re in a pretty stable place overall.","As far as the clearance event goes, not quantify it for you, but directionally I would tell you it\u2019s primarily \u2013 it\u2019s the biggest driver by far of the surprise versus where we thought we were headed for the third quarter. So, we talk a lot about the boutique strategy and the remodeling efforts that have been underway here over the last 18 months really in an accelerated phase.","So, when we\u2019re updating those stores, one of the biggest changes is our fragrance fixtures. And we\u2019ve really pared back the assortment there as we upgrade the fixturing and presentation in the store. It was a lot of excess fragrance that had built up in the system overall and we\u2019ve been trying to, I\u2019d say, at the margins, kind of sell our way through that in clearance sections in our store just got to the point, where we thought we needed to be more aggressive and that\u2019s what we did.","So we wanted to know \u2013 it can \u2013 it was playing its way through and in the third quarter we just needed to put our foot on the accelerator to get it out of the store. So again, overall was a little more expensive than we were hoping, but it was the right tactic for the business.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe Altobello from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Joseph Altobello","Thanks. Hey, guys, good afternoon. I guess, the first question is on the comp guide for the fourth quarter of 7% to 8%. It sounds like it\u2019s kind of consistent what you saw in the third quarter. I\u2019m curious, your base period gets easier by about 150 basis points. You got the introduction of Kylie this quarter. So why would we see a comp acceleration sequentially quarter-over-quarter?","Mary Dillon","Yes. I mean, Joe, it\u2019s Mary. I would say that, we guided the best we can with the information that we have. I feel really good about what we have in place for holiday, whether it\u2019s like you mentioned the brand launch is off to a strong start, our holiday marketing, our exclusives, our gift with purchase, they\u2019re all \u2013 we\u2019re lined up really well, I\u2019d say, to be competitive and have a strong quarter. But really this is just our best estimate at this point.","Scott Settersten","And I would just add, not to forget, fourth quarter is a different animal for us, right? This is a place where we compete with all the retail, not just the beauty competitors. So, we go into the quarter, we think in a \u2013 with prudent guidance, right, recognizing and feeling good about where our plan is for just making sure that we don\u2019t get too far ahead of ourselves.","Joseph Altobello","Okay. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from Anthony Chukumba from Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Anthony Chukumba","Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. You talked a little bit about the fact that your unaided awareness and your aided awareness both continue to increase. Give me a sense for what\u2019s been driving that? I mean, is that just increasing your store presence at some of the shifts that you\u2019ve made in terms of your marketing? Is it the loyalty program? I\u2019m just \u2013 I guess, I\u2019m just wondering what do you think is driving that and where do you expect those numbers to trend going forward? Thanks.","Mary Dillon","Sure, Anthony, and I will say, this is Mary, because I thought you guess is this Mary. But anyway, I\u2019m going to start. I\u2019ll let \u2013 ask Dave to add more color. I\u2019ll say, this is something we\u2019ve been at now for multiple years, right, just the opportunity that with a brand at Ulta Beauty on the map literally and figuratively. And that\u2019s triggered by a whole lot of factors and we\u2019ve been measuring it. It\u2019s not even just about people know us, but is there a meaningful understanding of what we are about.","And I do believe that this next level of creative that we\u2019ve just launched is going to deepen, not just to people know about Ulta Beauty, but the way they understand what we stand for. But maybe Dave could add some color in terms of the tactics that in terms of\u2026","David Kimbell","Yes, absolutely. We have, Anthony, dramatically adjusted our marketing approach, really revamped it in a significant way to make it more current and relevant and motivating to our consumers. And that\u2019s driven a much greater connection really as we\u2019ve done that over the last three years or so, we\u2019ve seen this dramatic increase in awareness. So marketing, for sure.","But you mentioned some of the other things. Certainly, we\u2019ve been opening new stores and that\u2019s been helpful as we\u2019ve entered into some new markets. Our loyalty program, as we combine that to one program about four years ago, that gave us the opportunity to market that and make the a deeper connection. And that helped us drive greater connection with our guests, but more word of mouth.","Our assortment has improved dramatically over the last several years. So those things have come together. And you asked about what come \u2013 where we think it\u2019s going from here? We\u2019re really pleased with the growth we had and awareness is just a critical \u2013 it was a critical opportunity, but we see more to come.","We\u2019re one of the leading unaided awareness retailers, number two in the market right now, where we think we\u2019re on a path to becoming the number one unaided retailer in beauty, the campaign that Mary described in her comments, is the next step of that to make a more purposeful effort to connect with our guest in a more meaningful way. And so far, we\u2019re off to a good start with that.","Anthony Chukumba","Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead.","Rupesh Parikh","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So on the Kylie Cosmetics launch, it sounds like the comment \u2013 the launch so far is off to a strong start. So I\u2019m just curious how it\u2019s trending versus your expectations. If there\u2019s any surprises in terms of the customers bring into your stores?","David Kimbell","Yes, great question. Yes, we\u2019d say, first, it\u2019s early. It\u2019s been less than a month just a couple of weeks, but we\u2019re really pleased with the results, certainly has generated a lot of excitement. It is \u2013 our existing guests have responded very favorably to it, but also it\u2019s done a nice job driving in some new guests, in particular, younger and diverse consumers. So we\u2019re really pleased with the effort overall.","Kylie and the Kylie Cosmetic team has done a really nice job helping communicate this launch, but their fans excited about it. So overall, we\u2019re pleased with it. I think, as far as the assortment, we\u2019re seeing strength across line. It\u2019s relatively narrow assortment, but we\u2019ve been really happy with the performance we just launched a \u2013 an exclusive holiday kit, and that\u2019s been received very well and that\u2019s available only on Ulta and not on kyliecosmetics.com. Our teams are working really hard to keep the stores replenish. We have anticipated through Q4 of \u2013 kind of being tighter on inventory through the quarter.","So it\u2019s possible as we move into holiday that we\u2019ll sell out in some cases, but we\u2019re working hard to continue to replenish and evolve the assortment going forward. So overall pleased, but a long road ahead of us as well.","Rupesh Parikh","Great. thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen","Hi, good evening. The QM Scientific deal is great and awesome. We\u2019re curious about the AI-powered customer engagement in terms of how you see that manifesting across different opportunities within the ecosystem? And also in the context of AI, how do you juxtapose that with the beauty enthusiast to often, likes new product versus driving an optimized personalized recommendation system and would love your thoughts?","The QM Scientific team has a lot of experience with robotics and we\u2019re seeing a lot more retail robotics, as well as conversational commerce. How do you see that manifesting and what you\u2019re building over time? Thank you.","David Kimbell","Yes. Oliver, great question. We too \u2013 we share your excitement about having QM joined Ulta Beauty and we\u2019re just really optimistic about what that team has already brought and we\u2019ll be bringing us going forward. You hit some of the highlights, but I\u2019d say, of the things that we\u2019re looking forward to drive with them. But I\u2019d say, overall, as Mary mentioned in the comments, this is first and foremost about personalization, leveraging their capabilities to understand our guest in a better way and manage our connection to them.","The first phase with them is really getting them engaged and onboard, which they are, we\u2019ve been doing that over the last month or so and getting them fully up to speed and connected to our business as we look forward over 2019. I\u2019d say, it\u2019s a mix of some foundational elements that they\u2019re bringing to, say, helped us assess our capabilities.","We\u2019ll be looking across kind of our personalization platform, our data foundation and make sure that that\u2019s as strong as it can be, I shared some of that at the Analyst Day ad they\u2019re going to play a key role in strengthening our foundational capabilities.","The first area is that, we\u2019re going to be tackling things we\u2019ve already been doing. But we\u2019ll see that we think we can move faster in a bigger way around elements like recommendations, as you mentioned, dynamic content, personalized on page. Computer vision is a capability that they have that we see that integrating in as we get further in with them over the next several months that allow us to have product and image recognition, that will also connect to our GlamStreet acquisition to integrate virtual try on data with our personalization platform.","So those are the big areas that we\u2019re focused on. And we see \u2013 we\u2019re really just \u2013 we\u2019re off to a great start with them. The team is really strong and we\u2019re really pleased to have them on board.","Oliver Chen","Okay. And just a follow-up. With the store of the future, what do you really envision in terms of making sure that you link a lot of the innovation you\u2019re conducting digitally and with AI into shopping \u2013 the physical experiential shopping experience? And as you use this incubation innovation lab to look at ideas, how should we think about how Ulta thinks about M&A versus organic innovation?","Mary Dillon","These are deep questions. I\u2019ll start and just say a couple of things. Well, the store in the future, we talked a bit at the Analyst Day. It\u2019s early in our thinking and we\u2019re not going to show a lot of the direction. I\u2019d say, high level the notion of the ability to be very experiential and meet our guests where they are. It\u2019s going to be critical. We think an important in the beauty category, I think, Ulta Beauty will be able to do that, serve that needs really well.","But to your point, an underpinning of technology for everything we do. So these investments in these companies, we see as ways to drive a personalized experience across all touch points, and that would be an underpinning. And again, in the future, we would imagine not surprisingly that there\u2019s less and less friction in the transaction happening in store right more time, less time tasking and checking out a lot more time spent consulting and just having fun with beauty.","So we see them all is working together. And frankly, the place that we can play the best is to play together ease and convenience with discovery and through human experience. That\u2019s both physical and emotional and that \u2013 and it\u2019s kind of in a big picture way is how we think about our \u2013 not just store, but experience in the future.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Best regards. Happy holidays.","Mary Dillon","Thank you, Oliver.","Operator","Our next question is from Simeon Siegel from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Simeon Siegel","Thanks. Hi, guys, good afternoon and happy holidays. Mary, I\u2019ll start with the labor, the clearance conversation. But just can you speak to the why you think it happened? Just was it internal buying planning, or is it more a function of the external environment? Just basically, can you speak your comfort around this not being go-forward necessity? And then, Scott, sorry, if I missed it. What are the gross margins embedded in the Q4 guide that you guys gave? Thank you.","Mary Dillon","So yes, on the clearance, I would say, it\u2019s just a combination of factors that more about that fair number of remodels and expansions of brands that happened in the quarter and a lot of new brands coming in. That just \u2013 we make a call [indiscernible] I\u2019m assuming it, we never do, this just happens periodically.","So in this instance, it was bigger with an opportunity, we thought to really clear out inventory and get a set up for the holiday. It\u2019s not something that we expect to repeat at that scale this quarter \u2013 on the fourth quarter, for sure. But just one of those business calls that we made that we think we\u2019re right for the business at the time.","Scott Settersten","And as far as margin for the fourth quarter, just a little bit of color on some of the levers there. So, Fresno, less of a headwind in the fourth quarter as that building continues to scale up and, of course, higher volumes overall. Rent and occupancy will \u2013 lever, will be stronger in the fourth quarter than it was in the third, again, where we had 42 new stores in the third quarter.","We\u2019ve got a dozen, I think, in the fourth quarter, so that will be better overall. We will be lapping those stores again from last year that we\u2019re in 2017 with higher cost stores. So we\u2019ll see some nice benefits there.","I mentioned earlier, the promotional environment overall, we think is pretty stable right now. So again, it\u2019s a competitive environment, make no mistake about that and holiday is more so than the rest of the year, so we\u2019re prepared for that, but that\u2019s baked into the plan.","When you get down to the SG&A line, labor, so we\u2019ll see \u2013 get leverage there unlike earlier in the year. Again, you got higher volumes there that help with some of that. The mix assumptions are all baked in there now. Freight, we mentioned earlier today, that\u2019s in there, although I will say there has been some upward surprises there as we kind of march through the course of the year, but again, that\u2019s not a major driver overall. So feel good about where we are in the plan we have in place for the rest of the year.","Simeon Siegel","Great, thanks. And then just high level for a second. So you \u2013 congrats on the awareness obviously keeps getting better. Did you \u2013 would you expect the \u2013 to accelerate the store productivity curve as that happened? I mean, I guess as you open up new stores, should that ramp happen quicker?","Scott Settersten","Yes. I mean, we\u2019re keeping an eye on that. I mean, we did up \u2013 update our store model here at Analyst Day just a few weeks ago. So we are seeing stronger productivity there. It\u2019s a mix of things, as Dave alluded to it earlier, assortment is part of it, awareness is part of it, better guest experience in the store the payroll investments we\u2019re making are part of it. So again, it\u2019s kind of hard to break it down on an individual basis.","Simeon Siegel","Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Best of luck for the holiday.","Mary Dillon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from just look at all the. Our next question is from Steph Wissink from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Stephanie Wissink","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I just have a follow-up question on your prior comments, Scott, on labor leverage. I\u2019m wondering if you can break the deleverage you saw in Q3 in \u2013 for payroll into the boutique and skin bar investments relative to wage rate pressure overall. It sounds like your lever in the fourth quarter, does that imply that those boutiques in those skins bars hit a level of sales volume that allows you to lever there as well? Thank you.","Scott Settersten","Yes. I think big picture that that\u2019s the answer. I mean, as you know, we install these fixtures throughout the course of the year, right, we\u2019re kind of building to a crescendo here. And so you get maximum benefit from that in the fourth quarter when you\u2019ve got much larger sales volumes overall.","So, again, I would just remind people when we\u2019re talking about payroll deleverage it is largely around investments that we\u2019re making for the guest experience, which a lot revolves around these boutique brands that we\u2019re installing in our stores. So all good for the long-term exactly, the thing \u2013 the way we think we should be playing it.","Operator","Our next question is from Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks. Good evening. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but did you say e-commerce would grow in the mid-30s in the fourth quarter, so that would be about a 100 basis points less on comp contribution. So you\u2019re expecting to the store to accelerate in the fourth quarter? And can you talk about your thoughts around that, and how do you think the drivers of that are?","Scott Settersten","Yes. I guess, we\u2019re trying to avoid a detailed breakdowns of the comp by business unit here, but yes, we did. So I can confirm we, did say mid-30s for e-commerce in the third quarter. So again, it\u2019s just natural to kind of assume some moderation in that again when you do the adjustment for the 53rd-week last year as part of the math as well. So again, we are off \u2013 we feel good about the plan overall."," We think the guidance is strong. We feel like the business is well-positioned. And so we just want to be a little bit prudent with what we\u2019re forecasting for the public at this point in time, because there\u2019s a long way to go between now and Christmas, right? It\u2019s the longest period, right, start to finish. I think 31 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. So we\u2019re just playing it wisely, we believe.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. And then just to clean up the questions on the gross margin front, questions that we\u2019ve been getting. So earlier this week, there was a coupon. Some people thought it was an extra coupon. I want to get your thoughts on that. And then in terms of 4Q, the clearance which sounded like it lasted a few weeks into the fourth quarter, what sort of headwind are you expecting in 4Q gross margin around the clearance?","Scott Settersten","Well, let me start there first, to be clear. So that the clearance event is behind us now. So that was, Mary mentioned as well. We would call pretty extraordinary. So I think it was some catch up for us right to get through that and we accelerated it in the third quarter. So that we could clear out the back room, so we didn\u2019t have to struggle with it in the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s kind of off the table.","Christopher Horvers","Yes.","Scott Settersten","Again, there\u2019s always a bit of clearance floating through the margin line right, but not not to the extent that what we just saw over the last two quarters.","Christopher Horvers","Got it.","Scott Settersten","And then as far as the coupon is concerned, again, I tried to do this earlier in the year to tell people not to try so hard trying to track individual coupons that hit their e-mail box, rights, because there\u2019s a lot of factors that influence how many times we ping you and what you do with your open rates and redemption rates and all those kinds of thing. So again, I would just reassure investors that we\u2019re pragmatic in our approach. We\u2019re doing the best that we can to deliver the best overall result for the quarter and that includes promotion levels.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","Dana Telsey","Hi, good afternoon, everyone. As you think about this fourth quarter and obviously a lot of the discussion points on gross margin coming up, what about on inventory levels as you\u2019re heading into the season? Flat per store, how do you see yourself positioned for the holiday with flat per store inventory levels? Thank you.","Scott Settersten","Well, we feel great about our inventory position. So again, we alluded to, Mary did in her comments about the tools and process improvements and things that we\u2019re doing. Part of that is just improved capabilities in our distribution centers. Part of it is behind the team\u2019s investments in tools for our merchants and support teams here at the home office to help us just manage inventories better overall.","So taking out excess weeks of supply in our supply chain network and reinvesting a lot of that into our best selling SKUs, the As and Bs and making sure we\u2019re always in stock on the things that our guests are looking to us for. So again, overall, managing it and we\u2019re guiding to again our long-term guidance 50 basis points of inventory productivity improvement here over the next five years.","So this is \u2013 we\u2019ve been promising and talking about this for a long time now,. I know. But now you\u2019re starting to see the fruits of our labor manifest themselves and we\u2019re really happy about where we are and what we have in front of us.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Altschwager from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Mark Altschwager","Good afternoon. Thanks. It\u2019s encouraging to hear the prestige cosmetic saw some sequential improvement. Obviously, you have Kylie coming in Q4. But bigger picture, can you talk about your outlook for category growth? The past year we\u2019ve seen the acceleration in skincare bit of deceleration in cosmetics. Based on the trends in the innovation pipeline, do you see \u2013 do you think we\u2019re beginning to see an inflection back in favor of the cosmetic category?","Mary Dillon","Yes. It\u2019s always \u2013 this is a crystal ball moment, right? And Dave and I [indiscernible]. What I would on the prestige, we\u2019re encouraged as well that that\u2019s an encouraging sign about stabilization of that side of the \u2013 that part of the business is big. It\u2019s very important to us. But it really is sort of like a tale of different brands or some brands that have huge 2015 \u2013 2015 and 2016s that are so struggling a bit with kind of matching that kind of growth and others that are seeing stellar growth.","So, in total, that sort of muted, I guess, a little bit, but it\u2019s still a healthy segment. Use of cosmetics and innovation in all aspects of color is continuing to be huge out there. And, of course, there\u2019s the channels that are \u2013 the brands that are aren\u2019t measured in our traditional channel. So there are a lot of growth and innovation for us to participate and that we feel good. And I feel \u2013 we feel good about what\u2019s happening with the other segments of the business with prestige skin, as you said, mass cosmetics, fragrance, all with double-digit comps for us. So anything if you can add to that [indiscernible] Dave?","David Kimbell","Just reiterate. Yes, we\u2019re really optimistic about makeup. Yes, there certainly is a strengthening in skincare. But we feel that our consumers are \u2013 remained very engaged and in makeup all the demographic trends continue to be very positive. One of the \u2013 that\u2019s one of the reason. So we\u2019ve been focused on digitally-native brands and expanding that part of our portfolio.","So certainly, a brand like Kylie, but also Morphe and ColourPop, Juvia\u2019s Place, so a number of brands that we think will play a role. At the same time, continuing to drive growth on some of our biggest stylish brands like Tarte and Benefit and Anastasia and L\u2019Oreal and Maybeline on the mass side. So wellround and we are positive about where the future of makeup.","Mark Altschwager","Thanks. And just a quick follow-up. It looks like the transaction component to the equation did reaccelerate this quarter, even I guess a tougher compare. Were there any call outs there drivers on the marketing side this quarter and learnings you can leverage for the holiday quarter?","David Kimbell","I\u2019d say from a marketing, we were \u2013 we felt really good about our marketing approach. Yes, the \u2013 we had some activities throughout the quarter as we made adjustments to make sure we\u2019re driving traffic and transactions. And so the mix we felt was ended up in a solid place. But certainly, as we continue to look forward in the fourth quarter and into 2019, driving traffic is obviously critical and our new advertising campaign we think is front and center doing that and all the other changes that we\u2019re making, I think, will continue to drive strong growth across all aspects of the business.","Mark Altschwager","Great. Best of luck. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Erinn Murphy","Great, thanks. Good afternoon. I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit more about the math category and the performance during the quarter? And then how are you thinking about that as you go into 2019? I know you\u2019re lapping your major reset this year.","And then, I guess, Mary, if you think about the emerging brands team and just the opportunities that they can kind of now look through, is there more coming down the pipeline in math or prestige? Thanks.","Mary Dillon","Go ahead, Dave.","David Kimbell","Yes. So on the math side, we\u2019re very pleased with the results this year and then we\u2019re really optimistic about the future. We\u2019ll share more as we get into, but we\u2019re going to continue to expand and grow brands that have been doing well for us. So there\u2019s still opportunity to make them bigger parts of our portfolio.","There\u2019s some core foundational brands, including Ulta Beauty collection, but also L\u2019Oreal and Maybelline and some of the bigger established brands that have been doing well. And we see, we\u2019re positive and optimistic about the future there because of the innovation pipeline that\u2019s ahead of us.","We\u2019ll continue to find emerging brands, and Juvia\u2019s Place is a recent example of a brand we launched early, but off to a good start and that\u2019s in our mass cosmetic space. So as much success as we had this year, we have a large share opportunity. It\u2019s a huge category, and we feel like we\u2019ve got a lot of runway ahead of us to continue to try to drive growth in that space.","Mary Dillon","Yes, and I would just add, Erinn. I think that with the emerging brands that\u2019s really across the Board that we\u2019ll see innovation, right across categories and price points, not just math.","Erinn Murphy","Okay. And then just the ticket growth was the slightest we\u2019ve seen year-to-date. I\u2019m just curious, is that just part of the clearance events being extended or was there any other puts and takes for the ticket, which came in a little bit lighter than we thought? Thanks.","Scott Settersten","I\u2019d say, that\u2019s probably the primary driver there. So again, the clear of that wasn\u2019t much of a sales help overall for the quarter. So yes, that, that would be something that I would attribute a good piece of that as well.","Erinn Murphy","Thanks, and happy holidays.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Goldsmith","Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It looks like your e-commerce in your mobile traffic decelerated sequentially, but your e-commerce sales accelerated. So are you seeing an improvement in conversion online and what would be driving that? Thank you.","David Kimbell","Yes. We \u2013 well, a couple of things I\u2019d say is, we\u2019re \u2013 we continue to be pleased with traffic. You talked about mobile, that\u2019s a big part of the business \u2013 a growing part of the business. And we\u2019re pleased all around with all aspects of that \u2013 of the business traffic is strong and healthy.","What we see in mobile is conversion in mobile is a little bit less than desktop, because mobile is used often as an aid to shop in either in-store or on store, so there\u2019s other reasons to use mobile to maybe you\u2019re not using the desktop. So conversion shifts just a little bit there. But when we look across the conversion, traffic, all pointing in the right direction and contributing in a meaningful way to our e-commerce business. And we think we continue to grow all aspects of that business going forward.","Michael Goldsmith","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Tunick from Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.","Brian Tunick","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess, two questions. One just curious, on the 20% off coupons, maybe can you talk \u2013 are you still using them to acquire new guests, or has your philosophy around the returns that you\u2019re seeing on those coupons changed?","And then maybe secondly, Scott, on merchandise margin expectations, as we look at next year or so, maybe talk about any mix shift within prestige growing versus mass growing again, maybe just give us some sense of how you think merchandise margins will play out going forward? Thank you very much.","Mary Dillon","Sure. I\u2019ll start on the promotion question. I would reframe it, it\u2019s really not that any one tactic is about that I think, you said that we have a wide variety of tools in our toolkit, I guess, I call it to drive traffic, to drive share gains, to make our guests very excited and happy, and the 20% off is just actually one of many tools that we do. Everything is designed to do, to get new guests and increase share of wallet of existing guest.","And increasingly, I\u2019m really proud about the fact that our teams have over the past several quarters and years really create a much more sophisticated set of tools that involve everything from an ability to invest and awareness to our loyalty program, as we just talked about the investment in these new capabilities that we have to really use that in a more personalized way.","So it\u2019s all in a journey of how do you make sure that you\u2019re excited for the guest, you\u2019re competitive to driving profitable growth and driving market share gains. And there\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019ll continue to see a whole array of ways that we do that.","Scott Settersten","And as far as gross margins are concerned, I mean, Brian, we\u2019ve been following us a long time. It\u2019s a very dynamic category. I mean, they\u2019ve described, I mean, the mix of products that come in and out of our box and now online to a great degree. Every year is kind of like a new story, right? What\u2019s the hot product? What\u2019s the hot SKU? What\u2019s the newness look like?","So again, we\u2019re not expecting. We never have, I guess, really to expand \u201cmerchandise margins\u201d in any significant way in the foreseeable future. I mean, we just \u2013 we are looking for market share gains, profitable market share gains over the long-term and finding products that excite our guests that drive traffic in our stores and online and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on delivering. And then we\u2019ve got, so we\u2019ve talked about EFG during the course of the year a little bit and more explicitly at the Analyst Day.","So that\u2019s a lever for us, again, a back around a lot of our core processes and other places in the business, where we feel like we\u2019ve got good opportunities to find savings to mitigate some of those headwinds if they present themselves. So again, trying to balance all elements of the business to deliver those \u2013 the long-term algorithm that we laid out clearly at the Analyst Day.","Brian Tunick","All right. Super. Thanks for the color. Good lucks for holiday.","Scott Settersten","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys, thanks for taking our question here. So I know, you normally wouldn\u2019t comment on quarter-to-date trends. But given the \u2013 of the excitement and the significant stock moves we\u2019ve seen around the last two times, you made [indiscernible] announcements. Would it be safe to make an assumption that current trends are above the 70 guidance for the comp?","Mary Dillon","Yes. We\u2019re not going to comment on the fourth quarter. I feel like, as I said earlier, really good about what our teams have put in place from a merchant side, the product offerings, the marketing, our store teams, our distribution teams are performing at exceptional levels. So, I think, we\u2019re in a good shape, but I\u2019ll leave it at that.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Is there \u2013 and then just one more cleanup on that. Is there anything so far that make you think the right e-comm growth rate is mid-30s in fourth quarter?","Scott Settersten","Our forecast \u2013 when we look at the business when we layout to be and we look at what were the events we\u2019re comping against and newness that we have to drive our business. That\u2019s kind of \u2013 to Mary\u2019s earlier point, we keep it \u2013 rate up to the last minute here to make sure we got our best thinking when we put our guidance together.","Michael Binetti","All right. Fair enough. And as you guys think about the detailed guidance you gave at the Analyst Day and the algorithm for the next three years and I look at 2019, you model, you mentioned to us that some of the efficiency initiatives wouldn\u2019t be linear at the Analyst Day. One could assume that you be implying the EPS growth rate than to maybe start at the low-end of the mid to high-teens range to start the three-year plan? Is that the right way to orient ourselves as we think about the puts and takes of multi-year plan?","Scott Settersten","I appreciate your question, Michael, but we\u2019re not going to get into that today. So we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019ll lay out our plan for 2019. Again, I think I explained at the Analyst Day that we\u2019re in the in the midst of our planning process here and there\u2019s still a long way for us to go and a lot of decisions to be made. So we\u2019ll share more with you on that in March.","Michael Binetti","Okay. I just had a try. Thank you very much.","Operator","Great. Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back to Mary Dillon for any closing comments.","Mary Dillon","Thank you. I\u2019d just like to close by thanking our 40,000 associates for delivering another strong quarter, as they\u2019re working hard to get the store\u2019s website and DC is ready for the busy holiday season, all while continuing to elevate the guest experience.

(Operator instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Allison Malkin of ICR. Thank you, Ms. Malkin. You may begin.","Allison Malkin","Thank you. Good afternoon.

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our fiscal 2011 fourth quarter and full year results. On the call with me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Bodnar.","Following my opening remarks, Gregg will review in more detail our fourth quarter and full year financial results and provide our outlook. I will then offer some closing comments and turn the call over to the operator so that we can answer the questions you have for us today.","The fourth-quarter concluded another outstanding year of growth at Ulta. We surpassed the sales and earnings guidance we provided in our holiday release in January, and delivered our second consecutive year of double-digit comp store growth, while growing our operating margin and net income at a rate far faster than our sales growth. Our consistent strong performance validates the success of our customer offering, the motivation of our marketing, and the power of our operating model.","I\u2019m proud of all that we have accomplished in fiscal 2011, and equally confident in our ability to continue our favorable performance in 2012 and beyond. Briefly touching on the highlights of our fourth quarter results, net sales rose 23% to $582.5 million from $473.7 million last year.","Comp store sales increased 11.5%, following a comp increase of 10.4% last year for a two-year comp gain of 21.9%. Comp growth was mostly driven by traffic increases, with average selling price rising slightly.","Gross profit margin rose 100 basis points, inclusive of a 40 basis point expansion in merchandise margin. Strong sales growth, combined with expansion in gross profit margin and leverage in SG&A, led to a 49.5% increase in operating income, with operating margin up 230 basis points to 12.6% of net sales.","Net income increased by 53.8% and income per diluted share increased to $0.73 from $0.49 in the fourth quarter last year. Our strong sales resulted in additional market share gains during the quarter across all of our major categories, as more customers continue to choose Ulta instead of other shopping venues for their beauty needs and wants. Our growth during Q4, as well as all of 2011 was driven by our 5 key growth initiatives. Let me provide some color on each.","First we continued our new store expansion by opening seven stores in the quarter for a total of 61 new stores open in 2011. This represented a 16% net expansion in square footage in 2011, and resulted in a year end store count of 449. Additionally, we remodeled 17 stores for the year. We are very pleased with the performance of both our new and remodeled stores. Our second growth initiative is the continued enhancement of our guest offering, especially through the addition of new products, new brands and new services.","During Q4, our sales were strong across categories with prestige skin, prestige make-up and fragrance leading the way. A few noteworthy strengths included our new and exclusive holiday gift sets from Urban Decay, Benefit, Tarte, bareMinerals, and Ulta. New fragrances from Fendi, Vera Wang Princess Night and continued strength from Justin Bieber's Someday, and Taylor Swift Wonderstruck and the successful growth of new brands and products introduced in Q3, including Laura Geller, Art of Shaving, and Mia 2 from Clarisonic.","Our third growth initiative of expanding our marketing reach also contributed to our strong sales. During Q4, we enhanced our special eventing that combines our product and service offering into a fabulous guest experience that highlights our unique beauty offering. Our January skincare event, our brand specific days that we have in our stores, and our lunchtime specials at ulta.com are all examples of our marketing events, which animate the experiential shopping experience that Ulta offers.","Our Q4 marketing program also included blockbuster gift book purchases including our popular holiday rope [ph], along with the new ice bucket and wine glass gift set. Our Q4 sales were also supported by our first national holiday radio campaign that reinforced our Ulta brand awareness, in addition to driving urgency for the holiday shopper. And finally, we built upon our already strong direct mail efforts by utilizing our loyalty club database.","Leveraging this growing royalty club membership is our fourth growth initiative. During the fourth quarter, we surpassed 9 million active members. As I have previously said, harnessing the power of this rich pile of customers is a long-term focus for us, which will allow us to better personalize our marketing outreach while driving higher sales. We made solid gains in Q4 through better customed targeting of all of our direct mail marketing pieces, including our first-ever prestige fragrance mailer.","Finally, our fifth growth initiative, to build our e-commerce and digital capabilities continue. Our digital sales during the quarter were strong, albeit still off of a modest base. We continue to better integrate our marketing campaigns across all our customer touch points to consistently reinforce the Ulta experience across channels, from brick and mortar, to e-commerce, to social media. We have great opportunity in this area and are only in the early stages of maximizing our potential.","Turning to Salon, we achieved a solid positive comp in the quarter, in part driven by more frequent marketing and new service offerings. One example was our service launch of nail gel by OPI to approximately 200 stores. This is a new incremental service that augments the salon experience we offer our guests. We are pleased that we were the exclusive national retailer to launch this service, and based on our strong initial results we are rolling out to the balance of the chain in Q1.","Turning to the balance sheet, our year-end position is very strong with $253.7 million in cash and no debt. Inventory was down 3% on a per store basis, and we generated over $90 million in free cash flow. In recognition of our ability to generate strong cash flow, while investing in our accelerated store opening program, in the people and infrastructure to support our long-term growth, our board of directors approved a $1 per share special dividend payable to shareholders of record, as of March 20, 2012.","2011 certainly was a fabulous year for Ulta. Total sales increased 22.1%, with comp store sales up 10.9%. Operating margin expanded 280 basis points to 11%, moving us closer to our mid-teens goal, and diluted earnings per share rose to $1.90, up 63.8% over 2010. Looking ahead to 2012, we are excited about the opportunity ahead as we continue to focus on our core growth initiatives. We know we\u2019re less than halfway to our previously communicated 1000 US store potential.","For 2012, we will accelerate our store openings beyond our long-term goal of 15% to 20% annual square footage growth, as we plan to open approximately 100 new stores. This represents approximately 22% square footage growth. Our real estate team has done a terrific job of identifying high-quality sites that meet our stringent criteria. We are also pleased with our early stage 2013 pipeline, and feel confident that it will deliver the 15% to 20% square footage growth consistent with our long-term growth targets.","Of course, if additional attractive real estate opportunities are identified, we will consider accelerating our store growth just as we have done in 2012. We will continue to offer newness and excitement to our guests through the introduction of new brands, products and services, as well as line extensions for those existing brands our guests love and rely on us for.","During the first quarter, we plan to introduce new brands including The Body Shop, Carol's Daughter, and Doctor Brand [ph]. We will also highlight new products and services, including eyelashes from Katy Perry, Urban Decay\u2019s Naked 2 palette, our exclusive your starting line-up kit from Bare Essentials, our exclusive launch of Ojon super sleek hair treatment, and Chromatics, a new hair coloring service from Redken, that provides more vibrant color and healthier hair benefits than other color services.","We are proud to be the exclusive national retailer to offer this service.","Our marketing will continue to focus on promoting and animating our stores and website through fun, guest friendly events like our Q1 spring beauty inspirations, held in conjunction with the editorial authority of Conde Nast, and our 21 days of beauty, and finally our upcoming Frederic Fekkai hair blow-out events. We also will continue to leverage our successful and growing loyalty program.","As mentioned on our last call, in 2011 we completed our necessary technology platform improvements to begin the migration to one loyalty program from the two we operate today. In late Q1, we expect to convert approximately 130 additional stores to our enhanced points-based loyalty program. When this phase is complete, approximately one half of our stores will be on the points-based program. The enhancements of this program provide greater choices and greater freedom to our guests, which we believe overtime will lead to higher guest engagement and greater loyalty.","And finally, we will continue to invest in our digital efforts with continued upgrades to our e-commerce site, including more products available for auto replenishment, improved customer service, improved search engine optimization, and an enhanced customer experience via our mobile say [ph].","Before I turn the call over to Gregg to review our financials in more detail, and provide our outlook for the first quarter of the year, let me say how proud I am of Ulta\u2019s 2011 accomplishments. Let me also thank our 14,000 associates across our stores, distribution centers and home office that worked diligently to provide the most unique and compelling experience to our beauty guests. We are all focused on building upon the success in 2012 and beyond. Gregg.","Gregg Bodnar","Thanks Chuck. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were driven by better-than-expected sales and margin performance.","During the quarter, we delivered a 23% increase in total sales, an 11.5% increase in comp store sales, a 100 basis point expansion in gross profit margin, and leveraged SG&A by 130 basis points. This performance delivered a 230 basis point increase in operating margin to 12.6% for the quarter. We also delivered a 49% increase in fourth quarter earnings per share.","Turning to a review of the income statement, fourth quarter net sales increased 23% to $582.5 million. Comp store sales rose by 11.5%, representing a two-year increase of 21.9%, consistent with the trends that we saw through the course of 2011. As Chuck mentioned, our strong sales performance was broad-based and we believe resulted in market share expansion, reflecting the (inaudible).","During the quarter, we opened 7 new stores and at quarter end, we operated 449 stores, expanding square footage by 15% from last year's fourth quarter.","Gross profit dollars increased 26.7% to $198.5 million from $156.7 million last year. Gross profit margin increased 100 basis points to 34.1%. Our gross profit margin expansion was primarily driven by 70 basis points of increased leverage and fixed store cost due to our comp store sales increase and 40 basis points of improvement in merchandise margins.","SG&A expenses were $124.2 million or 21.3% of net sales, compared to $107.2 million or 22.6% of net sales last year. The leverage in SG&A expenses is primarily attributable to comparable store sales growth and our cost management discipline.","Fourth quarter fiscal 2010 included a non-recurring compensation charge, which impacted SG&A by 20 basis points. Preopening expenses totaled $1 million in the quarter, which compares to $0.5 million in the fourth quarter last year, reflecting 7 new store openings during the quarter versus 5 new store openings last year.","Our strong sales growth and margin expansion, (inaudible) resulted in operating margin expansion of 230 basis points to 12.6% from 10.3% last year.","Interest expense was $91,000 and represented fees associated with our credit facility which we did not utilize this year. The income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 36.7%, down from 38.3% last year, primarily driven by year-end tax adjustments, including some Federal and State tax reductions and credits.","Net income for the quarter increased 54% to $46.3 million or $0.73 per diluted share. This compares to $30.1 million or $0.49 per diluted share last year.","Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, merchandise inventories at the end of the quarter were $244.6 million, compared to $218.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter last year. The 3% decrease in average per store inventory was consistent with our plans. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $30.9 million and depreciation and amortization was $20.3 million.","For the full year 2011, just a couple of highlights. Net sales rose 2.1%, inclusive of a 10.9% comp increase. We opened 61 new stores, representing a 15% increase in square footage. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our 2011 new stores. Operating income margin expanded 280 basis points to 11%, achieving a double-digit operating margin. Earnings per share increased 63.8%, and we delivered free cash flow of $92.3 million, finishing the year with 254 million of cash and no debt.","Now regarding our first quarter 2012 outlook. We currently estimate net sales in the range of $452 million to $460 million, compared to actual fourth quarter 2011 net sales of $386 million. This assumes a comp store sales increase of 6% to 8%, representing a two-year increase of 17.1% to 19.1%, following last year's increase of 11.1%.","We plan to open approximately 13 new stores in the first quarter 2012, compared to 5 new stores last year. Income per diluted share for the first quarter is estimated in the range of $0.46 to $0.48. This includes a $0.10 per share impact driven by incremental preopening expense from our accelerated new store program. This compares to actual income per diluted share of $0.37 in the fourth quarter of last year.","In addition, we expect gross profit margin to expand by approximately 40 basis points at the midpoint of the guidance range from last year's gross profit margin of 34.9%. Gross profit margin expansion in the first quarter will be driven by merchandise margin. As previously mentioned, our distribution centre will have a slight negative impact on gross profit, primarily in the first half of the year.","We will also incur some additional accelerated depreciation associated with the increase in our 2012 remodel program, which will impact gross profit in the first quarter by approximately 20 basis points. Again, with all of these initiatives, we will continue to (inaudible).","We expect SG&A as a percentage of net sales to decrease approximately 70 basis points at the midpoint of our guidance range from last year\u2019s rate of 24.5%. As the result of the aforementioned drivers, we expect to continue to expand our operating margin during the first quarter by approximately 90 basis points. We also expect the following for the first quarter, pre-opening expenses to be approximately $2.3 million, an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5%, and fully diluted share count to be approximately 64 million.","Looking forward to the full-year fiscal 2012, we expect to deliver strong results in relation to our long-term financial goals. As a reminder, our business model has been built to generate 25% to 30% annual net income growth through the achievement of 3% to 5% annual comp stores sales gains, square footage growth of 15% to 20% annually, and operating margin expansion as we progress through our mid-teen operating margin target.","We are very pleased with the start of our year. For the full year 2012, we expect to deliver annual comp stores sales growth at the high end to slightly above our 3% to 5% long-term growth target. We expect net income growth at the high end of our 25% to 30% growth target, even after absorbing approximately $0.07 to $0.08 per share in incremental expenses related to preopening costs associated with our accelerated new store program, and expenses related to the opening of our third distribution centre.","This net income growth expectation also includes a $0.03 per share benefit from the 53rd week. (inaudible) details regarding our 2012 expectations. We have a very robust new store pipeline for 2012, with the expectance of opening approximately 100 new stores, delivering square footage expansion of approximately 22%. As you are aware, our total sales include comp store sales, non comp sales from the prior year openings, and sales from new stores opened in the current year.","Given the acceleration of our store openings in 2012, we thought it might be helpful to provide you with our store openings by quarter, and the expectations for new 2012 sales volume in each quarter. By quarter, store openings are expected to be approximately 13 new stores in Q1, 23 in Q2, 48 in Q3, and 16 in Q4.","Total 2012 store sales are expected to be approximately 5 million in Q1, 15 million in Q2, 40 million in Q3, and 80 million in Q4. Preopening expense for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately 16 million compared to 10 million in fiscal 2011. By quarter, this breaks down as follows, approximately 2.3 million in Q1, 5 million in Q2, 6 million in Q3, and 2.5 million in Q4. As you know, our new 2012 stores will start to roll into our comp base in 2013.","In addition, they will positively contribute to total sales, comparable store sales growth, profitability and cash flow in 2013. We will also expand our remodel program in 2012 to 21 locations, compared to 17 locations completed in 2011. You may remember we generate a return on investment from our remodel program primarily driven by the additional selling space gained by the remodel.","We remain on track with our third distribution center project. We expect the third DC to result in a (inaudible) to gross profit primarily in the first half of the year. Specifically, most of this activity will occur in the second quarter, as we prepare to ship from the new DC in Q3. This should have a 10 basis point to 20 basis point impact on gross profit margin in the second quarter. Again, we expect to expand gross profit overall each quarter.","Starting in the fourth quarter, we expect a modest benefit to gross profit margin as we ship to more stores from the new DC, and therefore realize the expected transportation cost benefit. As you may recall, we opened our second DC very successfully on time and on budget, and we will apply the same disciplined execution as we bring this operation online.","Capital expenditures in 2012 are expected to be 170 million, which is approximately 40 million higher than our capital expenditure program in 2011, driven by the acceleration of our store expansion program. Depreciation and amortization will be approximately 89 million. We will continue to appropriately manage inventory levels, as we have demonstrated in the past.","At the end of the first quarter, inventory on a per store basis is expected to increase in the mid-single digit range, largely driven by the inventory to open our third DC. This inventory growth will still be below expectations for our comp growth, and will trend lower as we move towards the end of the year. We expect this improved inventory productivity to drive higher turnover. We remain comfortable with the composition of our inventory, and will continue our inventory discipline.","We will continue to expand operating margin, and expect to be well into the low double-digit range, building from the 11% we delivered in 2011. We continue to be very confident in our long-term mid-teen operating margin target. 2012 represents a 53rd week for us. The extra week is included in the fourth quarter, and represents approximately 35 million net sales, and approximately $0.03 per diluted share in earnings.","In 2012, we expect to deliver free cash flow while making additional investments to accelerate our new store program to approximately 100 stores, or 22% in adding our third DC. Again to summarize, in fiscal 2012, we expect comp store sales growth at the high end to slightly above our long-term target of 3% to 5%, and expect net income growth at the high end of our 25% to 30% long-term growth target, while absorbing $0.07 to $0.08 per share of incremental costs related to the acceleration of our new store program, and the opening of our third DC.","As Chuck mentioned earlier, our board recently approved a $1 per share special cash dividend payable to shareholders of record as of March 20, 2012. We are confident we have ample liquidity, including $254 million in cash at year end and our unused $200 million credit facility to continue to invest in our future growth and drive meaningful shareholder returns.","We expect to continue to generate significant free cash flow in future years. We will continue to invest cash generated appropriately in the growth of our business, and will continue to evaluate strategies for the use of excess cash beyond our planned needs.","And now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chuck.","Chuck Rubin","Thanks, Gregg. 2011 was another remarkable year for Ulta as we posted higher sales and profits along with strong cash flow. By providing our guests with the product and services they seek in an exciting and fun shopping environment, we gained market share and new guests, and further solidified our position as a key beauty destination.","I want to thank everyone at Ulta for their hard work and dedication, and I look forward to another year of sales and profit growth in 2012. Finally, you likely saw our press release announcing that we will begin a search for a new CFO as part of a CFO succession plan. This results from Gregg needing to relocate to Michigan to address a family health issue. In the meantime, I am pleased that Gregg will continue in his current role, as well as assist in the hiring and transitioning of his responsibilities to his successor later this year.","Gregg has been a terrific partner of mine and contributed greatly to Ulta\u2019s growth. While I regret his decision, I respect his desire to put his family needs first. I\u2019m confident in the team he has built, and know they have the proven abilities to continue Ulta\u2019s strong performance.","Before we open the call to questions, I know Gregg would like to make a few comments as well. Gregg.","Gregg Bodnar","Thanks Chuck. While I know I\u2019m making the right decision for my family, this is a very difficult choice for me. I have enjoyed my time with Ulta, and I\u2019m proud of what we have accomplished and even more excited about the company\u2019s future opportunities. Chuck, the management team and the board of directors have an exciting vision and all the talent required to continue the company\u2019s success well into the future.","I am pleased to continue on in my current responsibilities and assist with the hiring and transition of a new CFO to provide seamless and orderly succession. And with that, I would like to turn the call back over to the operator to open the call, and we will take your questions. Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with JP Morgan Chase. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Tunick - JP Morgan Chase","Thanks. Good afternoon guys.","Chuck Rubin","Good afternoon.","Brian Tunick - JP Morgan Chase","And Gregg, we are definitely going to miss you. So best of luck Gregg.","Gregg Bodnar","Thank you.","Brian Tunick - JP Morgan Chase","I guess, so I guess two questions here, I guess first one Chuck sort of bigger picture, thinking about market share right, either by vendor sort of how do you think about it or where is the share coming from, and is that changing as you have changed your marketing from I guess (inaudible) about that. And then maybe, some discussion about the comp drivers going forward, you know, do you think it is more important for new brands, or is it the newness within the brands that you think give you the most confidence?","Chuck Rubin","Brian, three things, one you don\u2019t have to miss Gregg just yet. He\u2019s going to be here through the transition. So you will have more opportunity\u2026","Gregg Bodnar","I will continue to torture you Brian.","Chuck Rubin","Exactly. Actually that is something \u2013 we both enjoy doing that. To your questions though, on the market share, we are gaining share across the board. So we\u2019re gaining it in our prestige area, in our mass area, in our what we call personal care appliances. So it is coming from a variety of places. I can\u2019t identify which specific retailer it is, but I know that we\u2019re growing across our business base faster than the industry as a whole.","In terms of your second question, it is newness that is the real motivator here. And newness can be defined in different ways. It can be a new brand that we are adding in, as I mentioned some of the new brands we are adding into the first quarter, and some of the brands that we have added in the past couple of years, they continue to mature in some ways almost like the new store matures. It is still, you know, you have the new brand in one quarter, and you still see growth even a year later as it continues to mature.","But new brands is only part of it. New products within brands, new trends, new services, I think that is what we have done so good with putting into our offering and communicating through our marketing to our guest is the newness. She comes in and discovers the things that she relies upon us for day in and day out and has for years. But she is also finding the new product or the new services or the new brand when she comes in, and even the new marketing events that we have added into it.","So I wouldn\u2019t isolate it just to brands. I would tell you that the word new is really the motivator that we are seeing accelerate our business.","Brian Tunick - JP Morgan Chase","And just a final question on what kind of customer acquisition thought process as you have shifted now from marketing from mostly being a newspaper insert to obviously moving more towards digital and radio, so are you bringing a new customer or is it a different view?","Chuck Rubin","Well, print is still a good part of our marketing mix, and we\u2019re getting significantly better at our abilities in direct marketing as a result of our loyalty program. So the content that the merchants are putting out there is improving the targeting of our marketing that the marketing group is putting out there is improving, and the experience in store is improving.","As far as attracting a new customer, I believe that our sales performance is driven by \u2013 grabbing additional share within existing customers, so she is spending more of what she spends in the beauty space with us, although still only a fraction, which is encouraging because we know we can still capture more sales from our existing customer base. But we also are adding new customers. Clearly when we open a new store, we expand our base, but we are adding new customers in comp markets as well.","This is \u2013 as I said this was a fabulous year in 2011, and we saw good performance from new and existing customers across the board throughout the year.","Operator, did we lose Brian?","Operator","Mr. Brian, your line is still live.","Brian Tunick - JP Morgan Chase","I am all set. Thanks and good luck.","Chuck Rubin","Thanks Brian.","Gregg Bodnar","Thanks Brian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Neely Tamminga \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Hi, thank you. And I know this isn\u2019t the end of our time with Gregg, but I do want to thank Gregg very much for your service to Ulta and its shareholders. I do wish you the best with you and your family, and your impact on this roadmap of the public company will not be forgotten, and this afternoon\u2019s release is certainly testimony to that. So congratulations. Hi, so the question here on stores, you have 100 here in the pipeline on the opening side, just wondering if you are thinking a little bit differently on the prototype. Obviously level 7 is the most recent prototype that you guys have out there, but will they still be anchored with the usual benefit velocity [ph], or do you start making room for the Lancome in that, just wondering how that looks in terms of roll out.","And then Chuck, a little bit of a clarification question on the loyalty program, so as you open those new stores, will they automatically be adopted into the loyalty program the new ones, or do you have to wait for that market to get this rolled out?","Chuck Rubin","Yes, let me take the second one first Neely, the conversion of the stores is a geographic conversion. It is not based on the store age. So existing stores in the markets that we are converting, as well as new stores that we opened in the market will Startup on the new program.","As far as the first point, we are still working in level 7. We have made a number of enhancements to it, and we continue to both in the visual appearance of the store, as well as the space allocation and you know, the allocation of space to different brands and different categories. I think what you will see us continue to do in stores is similar to what we have done in the rest of the business; we had a very good base. We just continue to evolve that, listen very closely to what our guest tells us, what products, what brands, what categories are out there that she is interested in, and we continue to evolve.","So as an example, you will see later in the first quarter, the end caps of our fixtures throughout the store will become much more exciting than they have been before. They will be much more statement oriented, either around new product or a new trend or something that we want to do a better job of highlighting than we have historically. So while we still consider it a level 7, sometimes I refer to it as a level 7 on steroids. We have made a number of improvements to that. So that is what we will continue to \u2013 we\u2019re putting all of that into the new stores we are opening this year, but we are also going back to the existing 7s and doing the same thing.","Neely Tamminga \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Chuck that is very helpful. Thank you. And just one quick follow up on the manicure service that is being rolled out, do you have to do anything differently with the store payroll or labor-management, or is that just a plug and play with the\u2026","Chuck Rubin","It is kind of plug and play. You know, there is some downtime for our stylist. It is the service provided by our stylists that are in store now. They have some downtime between guests. They also have downtime even when working with a guest. If they are waiting for a treatment to \u2013 while they complete the service, they have a little downtime with that same guest.","So that is what is exciting about it Neely. This is an incremental service. It is not taking away from anything we offer today, and it can help fill into some time gaps that we have in the salon.","Neely Tamminga \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Company","Good afternoon, and just another terrific year. Gregg let me echo others comments, certainly very sorry to see you go when that happens, and I hope everything takes a turn for the better with your family. Just a quick question regarding traffic and ticket expectations, obviously in 2011 including the fourth quarter, I gather traffic was the vast majority, do you expect a similar kind of relative dynamic, or might that mix change a little bit going forward. That is my first question.","Chuck Rubin","Yes, Dan. We don\u2019t break that out in detail, but clearly we do expect traffic to be the motivating factor in our comps this year, as it has been over the foreseeable past.","Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Company","Okay. And in terms of just number of visits or conversion rate as well, some of [ph] mostly number of visits that is driving the transaction?","Chuck Rubin","Yes, I don\u2019t know how much detail we want to get into that. What we have provided in the past, what I can tell you is traffic has been the driving force in our sales, and with the growth of our loyalty file, what we know is she is shopping with us more often, and she is spending more money in total on each of her visits, she may spend a little bit less, but because she is coming in more frequently the aggregate of her spend with us is increasing. So, I would expect that we would see that as we go forward.","The loyalty program, both of the loyalty programs are very good, solid attractive program. We obviously believe that points program is better and hence the reason for the conversion. So we have high hopes of this loyalty program continuing to drive our business as we go forward.","Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Company","Okay, thanks and as it relates to let us say incremental sales, what you are seeing right now, or what you expect for drop through right to the margin line, operating margin, kind of what is a good rule of thumb, or that we can think about at this point?","Chuck Rubin","You know, probably the easiest way to translate that Dan is if you look at our point of comp, based on our guidance range, so our point of comp translates to about a penny of earnings.","Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Company","That being at the quarterly, I am sorry, that is on a quarterly basis, correct?","Chuck Rubin","Correct.","Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Company","Okay and that is \u2013 so fairly similar even kind of outside of the range I would assume?","Chuck Rubin","Correct.","Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Company","Okay. So, talking about like second, third, fourth quarter?","Chuck Rubin","Yes.","Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Company","I guess last question if I could, on the 53rd week, so that is obviously included in the guidance. I was a little bit surprised because I thought it might be a higher margin week, but is there other things that affect the margin, and the single week I know it is a small number for the overall year?","Gregg Bodnar","No, you know, it is a normal week for us. You know, we go through the sort of exhaustive exercise of making sure, which I think a lot of retailers do, but maybe not all of them, the exhaustive exercise of making sure that week has all of the incremental costs associated with it, which is the proper way to do it. So it has all the variable costs, it has all the fixed costs. So it is a more normal operating margin week in the month of February.","Daniel Hofkin \u2013 William Blair & Company","Okay. Got it. Thank you very much. Best of luck.","Chuck Rubin","Thanks Dan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erika Maschmeyer with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Erika Maschmeyer \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Hi, congratulations on another great quarter, and then Gregg also very, very sorry to hear about your departure and family situation.","Gregg Bodnar","I am going to be around for a long time Erika, until we find the right successor. So\u2026","Erika Maschmeyer \u2013 Robert W. Baird","That is good. That was what I wanted to ask about, I guess have you set a date for how long you will be willing to stay around, and then on the search, are you looking internally or externally, or both?","Gregg Bodnar","I will take the first one, I\u2019m going to be around till we find the right successor. You know, I have an incredible passion for this company, a passion you know, about what we have delivered in the past, a passion for the opportunities that are in front of us, which I think have never been stronger. We\u2019re going to take the time that it takes, and I have the flexibility to make sure that I am around until we find that right successor.","Chuck Rubin","As far as the search is concerned, obviously we are just beginning that, and we will consider all candidates internal as well as external.","Erika Maschmeyer \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay. And then on the loyalty program rollout, any plans outside of the 130 in Q1, do you expect all stores by year-end, and then can you talk a little bit strategically on the promotional front, I know you have been working to move away from store discounting, and I guess kind of where kind of examples of where you have had success, and then how the new loyalty program can help you move that goal forward further?","Chuck Rubin","We haven\u2019t yet laid out publicly the full conversion schedule. So we\u2019re going to take the 130 stores, and as I mentioned in the script, that will have half of the chain on the program by the very end of the first quarter. It is actually the last week of the quarter. There are natural points to convert this over because we have to convert the old program and the redemption windows that we have for that. So, we will talk more about the rest of the company as we proceed into the year.","As far as the benefit of converting to the one program, it does provide us a lot more flexibility to adjust our promotional format, because today it is difficult with two programs to be able to offer a lot of loyalty based incentives nationally in lieu of price discounts. So, you know, what we have done is altered some of our promotional mix. We clearly have offered our coupons. We will continue to do that, but as we move more and more to the points based program, you will see us utilize additional points as incentives to our guest.","But ultimately you have also seen as 2011, and it will continue in 2012 that newness is highlighted more and more in our advertising as well. You know, price is not the ultimate driver in our business. It is a factor, but unlike other types of businesses it is not the leading factor. It goes back to everything what Brian was asking about earlier, it goes back to the newness. So you know, you have seen some examples of that and when you go through our ad pieces, whether they are print or digital you will see as we go through 2012 us highlighting the newness, whether it is fun, fashion, function around that newness, you will see us highlight that more in our advertising.","Erika Maschmeyer \u2013 Robert W. Baird","It is very helpful. Thanks so much.","Chuck Rubin","Thanks Erika.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Panella with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Sam Panella - Raymond James","Hi, good afternoon everyone, and let me add my congratulations as well, and Gregg wish you and your family the best here. I guess, I apologize if I missed this, did you break out what the traffic and ticket increases were in the fourth quarter?","Chuck Rubin","We said mostly traffic, slight increase on ticket.","Sam Panella - Raymond James","Okay, and in terms of your acceleration of your store growth, can we talk about the opportunities that you are taking advantage of, obviously this is further acceleration from what we discussed in the last call, and just wondering given your store economics are much stronger now than they were say three, four years ago, is this something after maybe new real estate opportunities for you?","Chuck Rubin","I will take the first part and throw the second to Gregg. You know, the real estate team has been really creative, really aggressive in finding opportunities. There is obviously not a lot of new construction that is happening, but there is real estate that has been out there, whether it has been other retailers who have freed up their full real estate foundation, or just others who are looking to scale down on some space.","So, for instance, in the first Borders [ph], we have taken some sites from them. We have taken some excess space from Best Buy. But I want to give the real estate team a call out for the outstanding work that they have done. They also have been very creative in working with existing centers, and existing landlords to try to put together small stores and try to merge them together to get our 10,000 square foot box.","So it is a very different way you have to approach real estate today for new stores than it was a few years ago, when a few years ago you could almost sit and wait for developers to call you, and today you have to be very proactive, very creative. And I think our real estate team has done a great job as evidenced by the 100 sites. It is also important to note that we are very pleased with the 100 sites that we have been able to get for this year. We have not sacrificed quality whatsoever. I think we have talked about this, but Gregg and I have talked about this repeatedly, we will not pursue quantity in lieu of the quality. But that is what makes 2012 so exciting, we have been able to find both of them and we are very excited about what is ahead.","Gregg Bodnar","And we do have an incredibly rigorous real estate evaluation process, as well as the talent in the team that knows the right sites to pick. I think one additional point there too is you know, the larger we get, the more attractive and more visible we get with developers kind of across the country. So, the dealmakers have been incredibly creative, and the receptivity of developers to rearrange boxes et cetera to accommodate our needs has been equally as attractive.","As it relates to the payback, you are right. Over time, we have accelerated the cash payback in the model. We have reduced the opening cost as well as improved the operating margin. So what is really exciting about this opportunity to accelerate the new store program even though a lot of it does come into the back half of the year, is there will be a pretty significant 2013, 2014 benefit, because these stores pay back pretty quickly, and you know, they get a nice lift when they start to roll into the comp base. They generate additional incremental free cash flow and earnings. So it will be a nice comp line to 2013 and 2014 and certainly beyond that.","Sam Panella - Raymond James","Great. Thanks for all that clarification, and best of luck. Thanks.","Chuck Rubin","Thanks Sam.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jill Caruthers with Johnson Rice. Please proceed with your question.","Jill Caruthers - Johnson Rice","Good afternoon. I want to extend my best wishes Gregg to you and your family in \u201912. A question on a comment you made earlier, knowing only a small percentage of the customer\u2019s weekend [ph] spend is at Ulta, maybe I know it is a generic comment, but maybe could you talk about where you feel the missing parts are that Ulta isn\u2019t driving?","Chuck Rubin","Well, I\u2019m not sure it is any particular product category that we are not grabbing, but no one in retail gets 100% of any one\u2019s spend in their respective categories. So we believe given the strength of our model, the breadth of our offering from master prestige, to salon products, to the salon services, and how we have improved upon that, we think we are giving our guest that much more reason to be able to spend her purchase with us, spend her money with us.","So, you know, it is not any particular place that I think we\u2019re weak on. I think it is just somewhat a convenience issue because to be shopping elsewhere and pick something up. But it speaks to the opportunity that we have because of the breath of what we offer, unlike other players in our space who are much more limited in the breath of their offering and the scope of their offering, we can satisfy most things that a woman wants in a beauty store. So that is why we believe we do have that upside potential to grab more share of an individual\u2019s.","Gregg Bodnar","And Jill, I think you know the other way, in addition to think to about it too is loyalty program, and the flexibility that comes with this, and the attractiveness that she has in using this program I think will drive higher share wallet and higher loyalty. In addition to that, it also leads to the capabilities we are continuing to develop on the digital side.","So we can be more personal and more top the mind to her. So the more frequently at an appropriate level that we can personalize messaging to here, and it is a very impersonal world today, that is going to leave us a higher share of mind and leave us with higher share of wallet I believe because we know that the other things we are doing, she is significantly enthusiastic about as demonstrated by the kind of traffic and loyalty growth that we are getting today.","So I think there is multiple levers as we continue to build out these strategies that are going to continue to help us drive our share of wallet, and the customers who we already have higher share of wallet, and a bigger opportunity for those as you kind of move down the ladder from that. So that is kind of the way I would think about in addition to what Chuck said where the opportunity continues to come forward. And then as we become larger, again that voice as a national retailer becomes much more prevalent as well.","Jill Caruthers - Johnson Rice","I appreciate it, and just a quick follow on on the real estate, kind of what are you seeing out there in the rental rate forecast out there?","Chuck Rubin","You know, pretty consistent with what we have seen in the past. You know, no upward pressure, no significant downward pressure. Again, you know, the way we think about it is we know with \u2013 as odd as this may sound, with incredible procession, based on we have this large royalty club customer base in a very sophisticated analytical model to identify what the potential sales volume is and how that will grow over time for a particular trade area, seeing what the size and shape of that trade area is.","So we know exactly what we can pay and what we won\u2019t pay to deliver a profitable store as we have been delivering. And obviously our deal makers have incredible experience as to what market there is as well. So it leaves us a very strong negotiating position, and a lot of precision in terms of what the right rental structure is to deliver the economics.","Jill Caruthers - Johnson Rice","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Altobello with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Christina - Oppenheimer & Co.","Hi, this is actually Christina [ph] in for Joe. I was just wondering if you can give an update on the Lanc\u00f4me and Clinique [ph] tests, how many doors you are in now?","Chuck Rubin","We are in the same number of doors that we have been in. We are very pleased with the performance of both brands, and you know, before you ask your next question, we have nothing to announce about an expansion, but we are very pleased with how both of them are doing.","Christina - Oppenheimer & Co.","Okay. Have you seen a comp lift from either one of the brands, or you are not going to comment on that?","Chuck Rubin","We are very pleased with how we are doing with the brand. We think it augments the offering as a whole. We are pleased with how the store overall is performing, those stores that have had Lanc\u00f4me and Clinique added to them. So, up-and-down, [ph] it has not been cannibalizing other parts of our offering.","Christina - Oppenheimer & Co.","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Connie Edwards - Wells Fargo Securities","Hi guys, this is actually Connie [ph] in for Evren. My question is, I know you touched on kind of your real estate selection process, but given the ramp up in new store openings, do you have any color into how may be some of the newer markets have been performing relative to some of your more mature markets, have you seen any signs of cannibalization between your stores?","Chuck Rubin","You know as we always have for many, many years as we build out a new store annual program, we balance our openings intentionally so between new markets and existing markets. And in some cases in those existing markets, it will create some cannibalization, and in other cases it won\u2019t. At the same time, you obviously get incremental operating margin leverage by all the natural efficiencies as you know, go along with that. All of that is built into our historical performance. We have been doing that sort of forever. And all of that is built into our store model as well.","Gregg Bodnar","I will also remind you that when you have less than half of your potential store build out that is up and running, cannibalization will be a factor in some cases. But you have a lot of runway open, a lot of wide space for us to satisfy guest demand by opening a store in those markets.","Christina - Oppenheimer & Co.","Thanks so much, and best of luck to you Gregg.","Gregg Bodnar","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments?","Chuck Rubin","Well, let me thank everyone for joining us today and Gregg and I will look forward to speaking to you to discuss our first quarter results in June. Thanks again.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation."]}}
